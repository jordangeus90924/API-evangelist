When you and your community have several web apps, mobile apps, plugins or other tools you are proud of, showcase them.

Whether you call it a showcase, directory, gallery or store...having an area that highlights the applications built upon your API is critical to continued API adoption and success.

Application showcases do several things:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/SimpleGeo-app-showcase.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

  * Show developers love by showcasing their work and giving them the exposure the need
  * Emphasize the work of your partners and the value they add to your platform
  * Highlight the best apps your company has developed internally
  * Show, not only do people use your API, they have delivered actual applications
  * Demonstrates your API is easy to use and has value
There are two ways to deploy an app store for your API. 1) build it yourself or 2) use a private label App Store solution like [AppStores.com][1]. I can speak from experience, your time is better spent evangelizing, and not building your own app store.

[AppStores.com][1] provides a white-label / private-label solution for deploying an app store for your API. Here is a little of what AppStores.com bring to the table.

They help with developer acquisition:

  * **Self Service App Submission** \- Enable developers to submit apps on their own, using a process you control
  * **Developer Dashboard** \- Developers are provided with a dashboard to monitor approval status, manage and update their own apps
  * **App Marketing** \- Developers will get the exposure they need being featured in your ecosystem
They provide a complete set of management tools:
  * **Approval Process** \- Accept, reject or request changes to developers apps using approval dashboard
  * **Customizable UI** \- Complete control over the design of your AppShowcase
  * **ContentManagementSystem (CMS)** \- Add custom pages to your AppShowcase
They encourage application discovery:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/IndexTank-App-Gallery.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
  * **App Categorization** \- Create categories to organize applications and feature the very best
  * **App Details -** Provide descriptions, editorial reviews and ratings. Include screenshots and video tutorials on each app
  * **Mobile Ready** \- HTML5 app store allows app discovery on a variety devices
AppStores.com is a ready-to-go, App Store as a Service for your API. Their goal is to save you money, reduce time to market, and be your team specializing in delivering your app showcase.

They are fairly new, but already have a couple of high profile deployments:

  * [IndexTank App Gallery][2]
  * [SimpleGeo App Showcase][3]
  * [EventBrite App Store][4]
An [application showcase is an innovative building block][5] to showcase developers and partners, while also bringing attention to your API and the value it can deliver.

When deploying your application store, I highly recommend checking out [AppStore.com][6], tell them API Evangelist sent you.
