{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google has an SDK early access program setup for the Google Drive platform, andÂ is inviting a select group of dedicated Google Drive developers to join the program.Giving them access to upcoming Google Drive SDK features and the opportunity to provide feedback.Google isnt accepting everyone--they will be screening applicants based upon the type and quality of the application, number of users, and ability to implement and provide feedback on new features as theyre made available.An early access program seems like a good idea for API owners.It gives you the chance to test out your alpha and beta APIs, client libraries, SDKs with a controlled audience, before you release them out into the wild.</p>
