{% include JB/setup %}<p>When new users sign up for the CityGrid API, I immediately get an email with their name, email and phone number, which are required for registration.The API is self-service, and I rely on the essential building blocks Iâ€™ve assembled as part of the API area to support them in their first hours and days of integration.Five days after registration, if a publishers has not reached out to the CityGrid API team, or show any usage on the API, I reach out to them via email, asking if there is ANYTHING I can do to make their integration successful.I do not send an email blast, I email them one by one, and as I do this, I use Rapportive in my Gmail to identify if they have a Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn account.I then send a personal email, and follow them on their social networks and research their business web site, if they have one.</p>
