{% include JB/setup %}<p>With the recent explosion in the number and usage of APIs, the Internet technology industry is well aware of the value of the application programming interface.It recognizes that APIs drive much of the Internet from social media and cloud computing to mobile applications.But while there is plenty of information to get the developer community up and running with APIs, there is a shortage of information that can serve to educate the business community about the business of APIs.The necessity of having that sort of outreach is one reason why I use the term API Evangelist instead of Developer Advocate.While yes, developers do still need advocates, I also feel that there needs to be more evangelism to the business community about APIs and their benefits as well.</p>
