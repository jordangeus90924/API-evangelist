        <p><a href="http://api-craft.org/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/api-craft-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with Brian Mulloy (<a href="https://twitter.com/landlessness">@landlessness</a>) of <a href="http://apigee.com/">Apigee</a>, to organize six of the leading hypermedia experts for a 2 hour panel discussion on the state of hypermedia, at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft, in Detroit, Michigan</a> this month.  I couldn't imagine a more distinguished panel of hypermedia experts, than this lineup:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li>Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>)</li>
<li>Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>)</li>
<li>Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>)</li>
<li>Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>)</li>
<li>J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>)</li>
<li>Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2 hour panel is going to be broken into an hour of 10 minute presentations from each of the six panelists, followed by another hour of QA discussion between myself, the panelists, and the API Craft audience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-craft-hypermedia-panel-detroit-2014">Github repository to gather thoughts for the discussion</a>, from the panelists, and if you have anything you'd like me to discuss, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-craft-hypermedia-panel-detroit-2014/issues/new">submit an issue</a>, and I'll consider including in the discussion.</p>
<p>See you in Detroit!</p>

<p>The elite technology group at the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/">GSA</a>, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">known as 18F</a>, has released the latest copy of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">API guidance for federal government agencies</a> to follow when designing their own APIs.</p>
<p>Using 18F&rsquo;s own description:</p>
<blockquote><em>This document captures 18F's view of API best practices and standards. We aim to incorporate as many of them as possible into our work.<br /><br />APIs, like other web applications, will vary greatly in implementation and design, depending on the situation and the problem the application is solving. </em></blockquote>
<p>I like the mix of info that is delivered as well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>High level design guidance that individual APIs interpret to meet their needs.</li>
<li>Low level web practices that most modern HTTP APIs use.</li>
</ul>
<p>To top it off, <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">the API Standards is hosted on Github</a>, in its own repository, and as Gray Brooks from 18F says:</p>
<blockquote><em> "Want a formal API Standards for your agency to adopt?  Fork ours, add your name to the top, and make it your own." </em></blockquote>
<p>Simple guidance like this goes a long way in helping, sometimes even very experienced developers, understand the best practices when it comes to designing, simple, modern APIs&mdash;a world where consistency and simplicity goes a long way!</p>

<p>I was looking through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis">federal government APIs</a> the other day, looking for the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government">low hanging fruit</a>, when it came to making government APIs more discoverable using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. During my initial work, I played with <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">three separate APIs from www.usa.gov</a>, which I think demonstrates the importance of CORS, and how opening it up for APIs, makes them more portable and remix-able.</p>
<p>When it comes to the the three APIs from www.usa.gov, I do not have control over the API itself, but I wanted to create a self contained, site that showcased the government APIs, and provide interactive API documentation generated using Swagger. I made sure all three of the APIs had machine readable API definitions using Swagger, then I setup a simple HTML page, which allowed anyone to play with each of the APIs.</p>
<p>This worked great until I reached the third API, which was at a different domain than the previous two, and didn't have CORS enabled. If you aren't familiar with CORS, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</a>, which is a mechanism that allows many resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain the resource originated from&mdash;behavior that you may want to control on a web page, but for an API it is something you want to encourage.</p>
<p>CORS being enabled, is the difference between an API being portable, and remix-able, and it being locked down to its original developer portal. If an API is RESTful and has CORS enabled, any outside party (like me), can generate a machine readable API definitions for it, and compose a developer experience, that that includes the API&mdash;with or without consent of the original API provider. While this might scare the shit out of some API providers, it is the future of API driven, application architecture.</p>
<p>You can't expect all developers to find your API developer portal, and APIs need to be more portable, allowing for remixing by other API providers, backend as a service providers, and anyone who wants to feature the API resource in their developer portal. CORS is a simple thing that you can enable for your APIs that will make a big difference in how your API is found, and integrated into other applications and systems.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

        <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.commerce.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/commerce.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Today, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker (<a href="https://twitter.com/PennyPritzker">@PennyPritzker</a>), <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2014/07/15/secretary-pritzker-discusses-power-government-data-and-announces-department-commerce">announced that the Department of Commerce will hire its first-ever Chief Data Officer</a>. I wanted to make sure that when this new, and extremely important individual assumes their role, they have my latest thoughts on how to make the Department of Commerce developer portal the best it possibly can be, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this port will be</span> the driving force behind the rapidly expanding API driven economy.</p>
<p>Secretary Pritzker does a pretty good job of summing up the scope of resources that are available at Commerce:</p>
<blockquote><em>Secretary Pritzker described how the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s data collection &ndash; which literally reaches from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun &ndash; not only informs trillions of dollars of private and public investments each year and plants the seeds of economic growth, but also saves lives.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think she also does a fine job of describing the urgency behind making sure Commerce resources are available:</p>
<blockquote><em>Because of Commerce Department data, Secretary Pritzker explained, communities vulnerable to tornadoes have seen warning times triple and tornado warning accuracy double over the past 25 years, giving residents greater time to search for shelter in the event of an emergency.</em></blockquote>
<p>To understand the importance of content, data and other resources that are coming out the Department of Commerce, you just have to look at the list of agencies that are underneath Commerce, who already have API initiatives:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/department-of-commerce.shtml"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/matrix-dollar-sign.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Then take a look at the other half, who have not launched APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/bureau-of-industry-and-security.shtml">Bureau of Industry and Securit</a>y</li>

<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/national-technical-information-service.shtml">National Technical Information Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The data and other resources available through these agencies, underneath the Department of Commerce, reflect the heart of not just the U.S. economy, but the global economy, which is rapidly being driven by APIs, which are powering stock markets, finance, payment providers, cloud computing, and many other cornerstones of our increasingly online economy.</p>
<p>Look through those 13 agencies, the resource they manage are all vital to all aspects of the economy telecommunications, patents, weather, oceans, census, to other areas that have a direct influence on how markets work, or don't work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all behind the Department of Commerce, hiring a Chief Data Officer (CDO), but my first question is, what will this person do?&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>This leader, Secretary Pritzker explained, will oversee improvements to data collection and dissemination in order to ensure that Commerce&rsquo;s data programs are coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic.</em></blockquote>
<p>Yes! I can get behind this. In my opinion, in order for the new CDO to do this, they will have to quickly bring all of the agencies /developer program up to a modern level of operation. There is a lot of work to be done, so let's get to work exploring what needs to happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Central Department of Commerce Developer Portal To Rule Them All</strong><br /> Right now the <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/developer">Department of Commerce developer portal</a> at commerce.gov/developer, is just a landing page. An after thought, to help you find some APIs--not a portal. The new CDO needs to establish this real estate as the one true portal, which provides the resources other agencies will need for success, while also providing a modern, leading location for developers of web, mobile, Internet of things applications, and data journalists, or analyst to come to find the data they need. If you need a reference point, go look at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/">SalesForce</a>, <a href="https://go.developer.ebay.com/">eBay</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/">Googe&rsquo;s</a> developers areas&mdash;you should see this type of activity at commerce.gov/developer.</p>
<p><strong>Each Agency Must Have Own Kick Ass Developer Portal</strong><br /> Following patterns set forth by their parent, Department of Commerce portal, each agency underneath needs to posses their own, best of breed developer portal, providing the data, APIs, code, and other resources, that public and private sector consumers will need.  I just finished <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">looking through all the available developer portals for commerce agencies</a>, and their is no consistency between them in user experience (UX), API design, or resources available. The new CDO will have to immediately get to work on taking existing patterns from the private sector, <a href="https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X">as well as what has been developed by 18F</a>, and set a establish common patterns that other agencies can follow when designing, developing and managing their own agencies developer portal.</p>
<p><strong>High Quality, Machine Readable Open Data By Default</strong><br /> The new CDO needs to quickly build on existing data inventory efforts that has been going on at Commerce, making sure any existing projects, are producing machine readable data by default, making sure all data inventory is available within their agency's portal, as well as at data.gov. This will not be a one time effort, the new CDO needs to make sure all program and project managers, also get the data steward training they will need, to ensure that all future work at the Department of Commerce, associated agencies, and private sector partners produces high quality, machine readable data by default.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling To Support The Public And Private Sector</strong><br /> Within each of the Commerce, and associate agency developer portals, there needs to be a wealth of open source code samples, libraries and SDKs for working with data and APIs. This open source philosophy, also needs to be applied to any web or mobile applications, analysis or visualization that are part of Commerce funded projects and programs, whether they are from the public or private sector. All software developed around Commerce data, and receive public fundeing should be open source by default, allowing the rest of the developer ecosystem, and ultimately the wider economy to benefit and build on top of existing work.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Readable API Definitions For All Resources</strong><br /> This is an area, that is a little bit leading edge, even for the private sector, but is rapidly emerging to play a central role in how APIs are designed, deployed, managed, discovered, tested, monitored, and ultimately integrated into other systems and applications. Machine readable <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/">API definitions are being used as a sort of central truth</a>, defining how and what an API does, in a machine readable, but common format, that any developer, and potentially other system can understand. Commerce needs to ensure that all existing, as well as future APIs developed around Commerce data, possess a machine readable API definition, which will allow for all data resources to be plug and play in the API economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/18f/18F_logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Established An Assortment Of Blueprints For Other Agencies To Follow</strong><br /> The new Commerce CDO will have to be extremely efficient at establishing successful patterns that other agencies, projects and programs can follow. This starts with developer portal blueprints they can follow when designing, deploying and managing their own developer programs, but should not stop there, and Commerce will need a wealth of blueprints for open source software, APIs, system connectors, and much, much more.  Establishing common blueprints, and sharing these widely across government will be critical for consistency and interoperability--reducing the chances that agencies, or private sector partners will be re-inventing the wheel, while also reducing development costs.</p>
<p><strong>Establish Trusted Partner Access For Public And Private Sector</strong><br /> Open data and APIs, do not always mean publicly available by default. Private sector API leaders have developed trusted partner layers to their open data and API developer ecosystems, allowing for select, trusted partners greater access to resources. An existing model for this in the federal government, is within the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">IRS modernized e-file ecosystem</a>, and the trusted relationships they have with private sector tax preparation partners like H&amp;R Block or Jackson Hewitt. Trusted partners will be critical in Department of Commerce operations, acting as private sector connectors to the API economy,  enabling higher levels of access from the private sector, but in a secure and controlled way that protects the public interest.</p>
<p><strong>Army of Domain Expert Evangelists Providing A Human Face</strong><br /> As the name says, Commerce spans all business sectors, and to properly "oversee improvements to data collection and dissemination in order to ensure that Commerce&rsquo;s data programs are coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic&rdquo;, the CDO will need another human layer to help increase awareness of Commerce data and APIs, while also supporting existing partners and integrators. An army of evangelists will be needed, possessing some extremely important domain expertise, across all business sectors, that Department of Commerce data and resources will touch. Evangelism is the essential human variable, that makes the whole open data and API algorithm work, the new CDO needs to get to work writing a job description, and hiring for this army&mdash;you will need an 18F, but one that is dedicated to the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Commerce As The Portal At The Center Of The API Economy</strong><br /> The establishment of CDO at the Department of Commerce is very serious business, and is a role that will be central to how the global economy evolves in the coming years. The content, data, and digital resources that should, and will be made available at commerce.gov/developer and associated agencies, will be central to the health of the API driven economy.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-contract.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One conversation I had at #Gluecon this year,  was around the role an API plays in being a contract between providers and consumers, with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) from <a href="https://helloreverb.com/">Reverb</a>. API contract, is a common phrase to describe how API services are consumed, and depending on the on-boarding process, an API provider and consumer can enter into a contract for services around a set of resources, in a self-service way.</p>
<p>In the last couple years, with the increased use of API definition formats like API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML, we often reference this API definition as a tangible representation of the contract API providers and consumers enter into. In my mind, I see the API definition as one building block, in a larger set of building blocks, that are working together to form a contract, with the API definition acting as the truth.</p>
<p>If you step back and look across multiple API providers, you start to see a variety of building blocks that contribute to the overall "API Contract", that is negotiated between API provider and consumer, starting with the API definition.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br /> A machine readable definition of an API interface, using a common format like API Blueprint, Swagger or RAML, providing a definition of the surface area of the resources that are available via API. API definitions are proving to be very useful in establishing a common way to describe, communicate and collaborate around APIs, which are often extremely abstract.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /> Terms of service are the legal portion of the API contract, determining how the service can be used, keeping the company&rsquo;s interest in mind, but should also be liberal enough to allow developers and 3rd party integrators to be successful. Plain english version of terms of service go a long way in seamlessly fitting into the API contract, allowing API consumers to quickly understand where they stand.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong><br /> The privacy of a platform, is definitely a very critical element of the API contract, and sets the tone for a platform operations, contract with developers, and their promise to the end-users. An awareness, and respect of privacy issues is part of every success API platform, and feeds into the overall health of the contractrual relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Service Level Agreement</strong><br /> A service level agreement (SLA), sets the quality of service expectations within the API contract. All API consumers should have some sort of SLA that provides a definition of the services being offered, and the level of service, and the reliability end-users can expect as part of API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Service Accord</strong><br /> As an API provider, if you can&rsquo;t offer a formal SLA, you should at least provide a service accord with users, setting expectations around what level of service will be offered around an API, and while a service accord isn&rsquo;t legally binding, it can at least help set expectations, and the tone of API operations for consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Interface License</strong><br /> The Oracle v Google legal battle has brought API licensing front and center, making them part of the overall contract of API operations. Whether you apply copyright, or some other license, an API license will be part of the contract entered into between API provider and consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Data License</strong><br /> Like an API interface, the licensing of underlying data stored, and returned by an API needs to have a license defined, providing guidance for developers, and businesses that are consuming an APIs data, and how they can store, remix, and put data to use.</p>
<p><strong>Code License</strong><br /> Providing code in the form of samples, libraries, and SDKs is common practice for API providers, and the how the code is licensed will determine how API consumers integrate an API into their, providing another layer of licensing within the API contract. This doesn't end with client side code, many APIs will also offer server side API implementations, which should also be appropriately licensed.</p>
<p><strong>Deprecation Policy</strong><br /> How long can API consumers depend on an API? What sort of notification will I get before an API is deprecated? The deprecation policies of an API, play a significant role in the trust established as part of the API contract that API providers and consumers agree to.</p>
<p><strong>Roadmap</strong><br /> Contracts are know for targeting a specific period of time, but API contracts are considered to be open ended, and part of that obligation is communication and openness around an APIs roadmap, providing critical details on what is next for an API, allowing API consumers to trust that a contract will not change to quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br /> Providing a place where API consumers can see a recent history of changes to an API platform offers a reference, for how often an API changes, and how its evolved over time, balancing out marketing and potential rhetoric around API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Rate Limits</strong><br /> As an API consumer, if we are entering into a contract, I need to know how my contract will scale, and where I exist in the API supply chain. Rate limits provide a unit of measurement that can be used as part of the API contract, quantifying expectations and deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>Uptime / Availability</strong><br /> You can offer a low cost, high value API service, but if your availability and uptime sucks, you are not delivering on the contract entered into with API consumers, making this aspect of operations a very important piece of the API contract.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong><br /> Stipulating the price paid for a service is fundamental to any contract, and the pricing of a particular API represents the value that is exchanged between API provider and consumer, as part of the API contract.</p>
<p><strong>Service Tiers</strong><br /> Most modern APIs have multiple access levels, providing contract negotiation opportunities between API provider and consumer, a feature that allows API contracts to be negotiated, or re-negotiated in real-time, based upon known service tiers.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br /> A contract is a relationship between two businesses, and any relationship requires support to be successful. Direct, and indirect API support provides assurances to API consumers that once they enter into a contract, the API provider will be there to help in all phases of contract execution.</p>
<p>An API definition provides a tangible, machine readable lens to look at the API contract through, providing a quantifiable truth that describes how an API will be delivered, but the actual API contract requires a suite of other supporting elements, starting with terms of service, and continuing through to how a company supports an API, before the API contract is fully realized.</p>
<p>I'm very optimistic about the evolution of API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> in 2014, now that we have the ability to define an API, and quantify the resources interface in a machine readable format. Next we need the same for the other portions of the "API contract", so that we can negotiate contracts for online resources in an automated, frictionless, real-time way.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-telescope.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is a pretty basic concept&mdash;look at other competing or complimentary APIs in the space, before designing your own. This seems like common sense to me, but I look at APIs for a living, and I&rsquo;m interested in finding the best API patterns across business or government sectors. Even though this topic seems like a no-brainer to me, I still encounter many folks who contact me to discuss their API strategy, but have not looked at any APIs, in the same genre as the one they are looking to enter--which tells me I should be writing about this topic on a regular basis.</p>
<p>My first advice to any API provider, looking to begin new API effort, is to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">look at as many of the leading APIs out there</a>, as you have time for. Even if they aren&rsquo;t in the same genre as your API, they are leaders for a reason, and do many things that you can learn from. If nothing else, at least look at the pioneers like SalesForce, Amazon, Twitter and Google&mdash;they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Secondarily I urge developers to go look at any APIs that are doing the same thing, or portentially exist in the same genre, as your API. If you are doing a bookmark API, go look at Delicious and Pinboard. If you are doing an image API go look at Flickr and Instagram. Even if your API will be slightly different, you should look at all, accessible, patterns, that are similar to what you are trying to do do. Try to understand why these APis providers designed their interface the way they did, and actually make calls against the API, to see what you like, and what you don&rsquo;t like about their approach.</p>
<p>Once you have looked at all the APIs you can, take the best patterns you found, and make it into your own. Even if you come back around, and still think your API design is superior, you will have learned something through the process&mdash;even if you learn what you don&rsquo;t want to do, or just receive validation of your idea.  If you haven&rsquo;t done your due diligence, looking for other healthy API patterns in the space, you are wasting valuable development cycles, on something that may not actually be innovating, and moving the conversation forward.</p>

<p>In the API section, they provide a nice introduction to what is an API, and why you would use an API, including nine library focused APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://copac.ac.uk/developers/webapi/">copac</a></strong> - search over 70 UK and irish academic national &amp; specialist library catalogues</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/access/data/opensearch">european library api v2.0 </a>-</strong> data describing the collections and catalogues of national and research libraries in 48 countries</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/books/">google books family</a> -</strong> APIs to integrate with google data on books such as searching via title and retrieving data such as isbn and cover images</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.nature.com/developers/documentation/api-references/opensearch-api/">nature.com website data</a> - </strong>bibliographic search for content on nature.com: news, research articles and citations</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api">open library</a> -</strong> one web page for every book. open library exposes an API to gain access to all their book data in various formats</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/access/data/lod">rluk linked open data</a> -</strong> not really an API, but research libraries uk have published nearly 20 million bibliographic records from 34 libraries as linked open data</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.librarieshacked.org/">Libraries Hacked</a> is available as a Github, so any librarian, can fork, and launch for their own purposes, with everything licensed CC-BY.  I think that librarians hold the key to our future, and ensuring librarians have the latest resources they need when it comes to APIs, open data, and open source software is critical to all of this working.</p>
<p>Sites like Libraries Hacked, not only save me a lot of time in researching priority areas like libraries, but also make me hopeful for the future, in a world where I&rsquo;m bombarded by warning signs around how technology is used, and knowing that librarians are getting equipped, makes me feel a lot better for all us.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.yodlee.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/yodlee/yodlee-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spoke with the leading financial data API aggregation providers&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yodlee.com/">Yodlee</a> last week, regarding their <a href="http://www.yodlee.com/about-us/careers/">hunt for a director of developer evangelism</a>.  Yodlee provides an aggregation API that is designed for developers who need secure access to their users&rsquo; bank, credit card, investment, and loan accounts&mdash;if you think about it, this is a pretty critical API, in what we are all calling the &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yodlee isn&rsquo;t just looking for a junior evangelist, they are looking for a director&mdash;someone to lead the charge, when it comes to evangelizing Yodlee to potential API consumers, while also supporting the community and applications that are already integrated with the financial data aggregation platform. While there are well published job descriptions for the API evangelist role, there are no universities training up, cranking out the next generation of evangelism leaders&mdash;they are a unique breed, leaving a major hurdle for API providers like Yodlee to jump.</p>
<p>Evangelists are equal parts engineer, business development, product development, sales, and marketing&mdash;a combination that is not easy to find. Yodlee and I discussed the difficulties of finding the right candidates for the role, and whether or not you emphasize the technical or the marketing skills? There are extremely few candidates who know they are evangelist material, you often have to sculpt one out of many different personality traits, and both technical and business skils.</p>
<p>Evangelism talent, at both junior, and leadership levels is going to continue to be a major stumbling block for the expanding API economy. Even with some movement in the world of API discovery in 2014, we will never be able to fully automate API discovery, let alone evangelism, management and support. At some point we are going to need more agencies, and institutions focusing on training up the next generation of evangelists, similar to social media marketing did in the last 5 years&mdash;of course, hopefully we can scale a little more sensibly, than the social media marketing world did.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the developer evangelist position at Yodlee, <a href="http://www.rockitrecruiting.com/jobs.php?cjobid=JB197383618">head over to the recruiters site</a>, and let them know I sent you.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://autodevbot.com/">API monitoring service AutoDevot</a> has opened sourced their JavaScript API monitoring solution, built on Frisby.js, called <a href="https://github.com/AutoDevBot/API-Monitor-Runner">API Monitor Runner</a>. The API monitoring tool, allows for a pretty robust configuration file, that lets you detail exactly what the service should monitor, and how it should behave when something out of the ordinary happens.</p>
<p>I though the trigger actions stood out, allowing you to take common actions when something occurs with an API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>TRIGGER_EMAIL</strong> - enable email notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_PAGER_DUTY</strong> - enable PagerDuty notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_WEBHOOK</strong> - enable a generic webhook notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_HIPCHAT</strong>- enable HipChat notification</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoDevBot, even takes things to another level, providing a ready to go Docker container, to quickly deploy API Monitor Runner, and then configure it on setup, using Docker environment params--a very interesting approach to deploying open tooling to support APIs.</p>
<p>I really like this type of deployment for vital API services, focusing on providing a simple, valuable, cloud-based service, as well as an open source version that anyone can put to use. We just saw the same moves from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/apitools-raises-the-bar-with-open-onpremise-api-testing-and-monitoring-tools/">3Scale with the release of APITools</a>, and now AutoDevBot with API Monitor Runner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see other critical building blocks of the API economy emulate this approach&mdash;there is plenty of money to be made from cloud services, while also providing open tool that will stimulate API growth across many business sectors. Which, creates more need for services.</p>

</ul>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there are other nice implementations in there. I like the simplicity and consistency in APIs coming out of GSA, SBA, but overall federal APIs reflect what I see a lot in the private sector, some developer making a decent API, but their follow-through and launch severeley lacks what it takes to make the API successful. People wonder why nobody uses their APIs? hmmmmm....</p>
<p>A little minimalist simplicity in a developer portal, simple explanation of what an API does, interactive documentation w/ Swagger, code libraries, terms of service (TOS), wouild go a looooooooooooong way in making sure these government resources were found, and put to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, so where the hell do I start? Let's look through theses 123 APIs and see where the real low hanging fruit for demonstrating the potential of APIs.json, when it comes to API discovery in the federal government.</p>
<p>Let's start again with the <strong>White House&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers">http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;">White House Petition API</a>&nbsp;-</strong> No swagger, but simple, high value API that is totally worth doing.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Only one API made it out of the <strong>USDA</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there. The landing page looks good, but the API documentation isn't really there. Could be really easily. Looks like a well crafted API.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Census Bureau API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">http://www.census.gov/developers/</a></span>&nbsp;- Yes, a real developer area with supporting building blocks. (Update, News,( App Gallery, Forum, Mailing List).&nbsp;Really could use interactive document though. There are urls, but not active calls.

<li><strong>Severe Weather Data Inventory -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly basic interface, wouldn&rsquo;t take much to turn into modern web API.

<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Education -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">http://www.ed.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of high value datasets. Says API, but is JSON file. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate APIs for it all and make machine readable definitions.<strong> (B)</strong></li>

<p><strong>Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Information Administration -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/developer/">http://www.eia.gov/developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Nice web API, simple clean presentation. Needs interactive docs.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Renewable Energy Laboratory -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">http://developer.nrel.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- Close to a modern Developer area with web APIs.

<p>That is a lot of potentially valuable API resource to consume. From my perspective, I think that what has come out of GSA, SBA, and White House Petition API, represent probably the simplest, most consistent, and high value targets for me. Next maybe the wealth of APis out of Interior and FDA. AFter that I'll cherry pick from the list, and see which are easiest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm lookig to create a Swagger definition for each these APIs, and publish as a Github repository, allowing people to play with the API. If I have to, I'll create a proxy for each one, because CORS is not common across the federal government. I'm hoping to not spend to much time on proxies, because once I get in there I always want to improve the interface, and evolve a facade for each API, and I don't have that much time on my hands.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent most of the day yesterday, looking through <a href="/admin/blog/http:/18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 of the developer portals listed on the 18F Github portal</a>. While I wanted to evaluate the quality and approach of each of the agencies, my goal for this review cycle was to look for any APIs that already had machine readable API definitions, or would be low hanging fruit for the creation of <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definitions</a>, as part of my wider API discovery work.</p>
<p>I had just finished updating all my API Evangelist Network APIs to use verion 0.14 of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and while I wait for the search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> to update to support the new version, I wanted to see if I could start the hard work of applying API discovery to federal government APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally all federal agencies would publish APIs.json on their own, placing it within the root of their domain, like they do with data.json, and provide an index of all of their APIs. Being all to familiar with how this stuff work, I know that if I want this to happen, I will have to generate APIs.json for many federal agencies first. However for the APis.json to have their intended impact, I need many of the APIs to have machine readable API definitions that I can point to--which equals more work for me! yay? ;-(</p>
<p>My thinking is that I will look through all of the 77 developer areas, and resulting APIs looking for the low hanging fruit. Basically I would grade each API on its viability to be included in my federal government API discovery work. I spent minimal amount of time look at each API, and in some cases looking for the API, before giving up. I would inspect the supporting developer area, and the actual interface for complexity, helping me understand how hard it would be to hand craft a Swagger spec, and APIs.json for each agency and their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(warning contains my raw un-edited notes from doing this research, not suitable for children)</em></p>
<p>As I went through, I wrote a couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;">National Climate Data Center</a> is nice looking, and is a high profile--they should have a kick ass API!</li>
<li>Inversely <a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted&lt;/a&gt;">NOAAA Climate Data Online</a> very simple, clean and well done.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">Department of Education</a> is acceptable as dev area, only because of Socrata</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> just gets it. They just get it.</li>
<li>Some of these are billed as developer areas, but really just a single API. It is a start I guess.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I love me some <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a>. Their developer area and API is freak'n cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://my.usa.gov/developer/">MyUSA citizen API </a>has oAuth!!! WTF. How did I not notice this before? Another story, and work here.</li>
<li>MyUSA has really good, simple, high value, API resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://exoapi.com/">NASA ExoAPI</a> not just API cool, but space cool!!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foia.gov/developer.html">FOIA</a> needs a fucking API. No excuses. FOIA needs an API!</li>
<li>Some APIs it might be better to go back to data source and recreate API from scratch, they are so bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to share some of my notes, before the long list of developer areas, and their APIs. There are some specific notes for each APIs, but much of it is very general, helping grade each API, so I can go back through the list of B grade or higher APIs, and figure out which are candidates for me to create a Swagger API definition, APIs.json and ultimately adding to APIs.io.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this work I went down the <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 federal agency links</a>, which were billed as developer areas, but many were single APIs. So when a developer area resulted in multiple APIs, I grouped them together, and many of the agencies who have a single API I will group together, and include my commentary as necessary. I'm leaving the URLs visible to help as a reference, show the craziness of some of them, and because it would have been sooooo much work to apply all of them.</p>

<li><strong>National Water and Climate Center AWDB database -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/web_service/AWDB_Web_Service_Tutorial.htm">http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/web_service/AWDB_Web_Service_Tutorial.htm</a></span></li>

</ul>
<p>Overall I give USDA a <strong>D</strong> on all their APIs. A couple might be high value sources, and going after, but definitely not low hanging fruit for me. It would be easier to tackle as independent project for generating brand new APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there. The landing page looks good, but the API documentation isn't really there. Could be really easily. Looks like a well crafted API.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is Department of Commerce (<a href="http://www.commerce.gov/developer">http://www.commerce.gov/developer</a>), who definitely high some higher value resources, as well as some health API initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bureau of Economic Analysis API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm">http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm</a> -&nbsp;</span>Signed up for key, don&rsquo;t see any docs? Looks clean, but we&rsquo;ll see if anything there. An email address. yay!<strong> (C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Census Bureau API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">http://www.census.gov/developers/</a></span>&nbsp;- Yes, a real developer area with supporting building blocks. (Update, News, App Gallery, Forum, Mailing List).&nbsp;Really could use interactive document though. There are urls, but not active calls. Would be way easier if you could play with data, before committing. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>International Trade Administration Export Trade Events -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://new.export.gov/events">https://new.export.gov/events</a></span>&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t see an API<strong> (F)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology CDA Guideline Validation Tool -&nbsp; </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://ihe-pcd-con.nist.gov/PCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConcda-validation/webservice.html">http://ihe-pcd-con.nist.gov/PCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConcda-validation/webservice.html</a></span>&nbsp;- WTF is with this URL? Really? 404 <strong>(F)</strong></li>
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_api_doc.html">http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_api_doc.html</a></span>&nbsp;- Not really a web API. If I could find data, it would be a good facade project. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Legacy National Climatic Data Center RESTful Services -</strong> <a href="http://www7">http://www7</a>.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ncdc.noaa.gov/rest/</span>&nbsp;- Wouldn&rsquo;t take much to build a facade for this one, so that it would be a real API. As it is, its just too confusing. Simple, but confusing. Takes talent to do that. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>GIS Map Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.climate.gov/datasearch/">http://www.climate.gov/datasearch/</a></span>&nbsp;- Looks like a bunch of datasets, no real API found. Looks high value, and worthy of API, but you&rsquo;d need domain expert. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li>Severe Weather Data Inventory - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly basic interface, wouldn&rsquo;t take much to turn into modern web API. Right now its just a text file, with a spec style documentation explaining what to do. Looks high value. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>General National Climatatic Data Center THREDDS Data Server -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html</a></span>&nbsp;- File store with folders and folder and folders of data.

That is an API. No interactive docs, but nice clean ones, and would be some work, but could be done.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Digital Forecast Database SOAP Web Service -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/">http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/</a></span>&nbsp;- SOAP service.

Wouldn&rsquo;t be too much to generate a machine readable definition and make into a better API area.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Space Physics Interactive Data Resource Web Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf">http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf</a></span>&nbsp;- Well its a PDF, but looks like a decent web API. It would be some work but could turn into a decide API with Swagger specs.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Telecommunications and Information Administration -</strong> National Broadband Map - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/broadband-data">http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/broadband-data</a></span>&nbsp;- Not an API, but dataset, with a lot of work it could be turned into a decent experience. <strong>(C</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Patent and Trademark Office - </strong>Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t see any API, just a web search? <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li>International Trade Administration -&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">http://developer.trade.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- I didn&rsquo;t see any API. They talk about it, but don&rsquo;t see how to access.<strong> (F)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Weather Service -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/">http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/</a></span>&nbsp;- SOAP service. Could have a facade built turning into a web API, but would be a lot of work. Only if high value.<strong> (D)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly straightforward API, Simple. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate interactive docs for it. Spec needed. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Climate Data Center -</strong>&nbsp;<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/</a>&nbsp;- Sexy site, well done. But no API. Datasets, so API could be created. Cache API. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next with the <strong>Department of Defense (</strong><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.defense.gov/developer/">http://www.defense.gov/developer/</a>)</span></span><span>There are 8 things billed as aPIs, with a variety of datasets, API like things, and web services available.&nbsp; Not really sure whats up? <strong>(D)</strong></span></p>
<p>We have one by itself here:</p>
<ul>

Poor presentation, but well designed so it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate machine readable sec. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Then the department of education who is just riding their data.gov work as API area:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Education -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">http://www.ed.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of high value datasets.

</ul>
<p>Next some energy related efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Energy -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.energy.gov/developers">http://www.energy.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of datasets.

<li><strong>National Renewable Energy Laboratory -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">http://developer.nrel.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- Close to a modern Developer area with web APIs. Uses standardized access (umbrella). Some of them have Swagger specs, the rest would be easy to create.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Office of Scientific and Technical Information -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices">http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices</a></span>&nbsp;- Interfaces are pretty well designed, and Swagger specs would be straightforward.

<p>Ok that was it. I know there are more APIs to look at, but this is derived from the master list of federal government developer portals. This gives me what I need. Although, I'm a little disappointed I have less than 5 Swagger definitions, after looking at about 190 APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After looking at all of this, I'm overwhelmed. How do you solve API discovery for a mess like this? Holy shit!</p>
<p>I really need my fucking head examined for taking this shit on. I really am my own worst enemy, but I love it. I am obsessed with contributing to a solution for API discovery that will work in private sector, as well as a public sector mess like this. So where the hell do I start? &nbsp;More to come on that soon...</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently updated my APIs.json files for all my API Evangelist network domains, to use version 0.14, which is getting pretty close to a stable version. While I await <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a> to be updated to use this version, I wanted to to spend some time publishing APIs.json files, but this time across federal government APIs.</p>
<p>The thing I like most about APIs.json, is that you can do one for anybody else&rsquo;s APIs. In the case of our federal government, I don't anticipate any agency getting on board with APIs.json anytime soon, but I can do it for them! There are a lot of APIs in federal government, where do I get started?</p>
<p>To help me understand the scope of API discovery in our federal government <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">I looked through 77 developer portals</a>, outlined by <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. While browsing these developer portals for federal government agencies, I look at almost 190 APIs--with a goal of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">identifying the low hanging fruit</a>, when it came to API discovery across hundreds of government APIs.</p>
<p>Out of the 190 APIs, around 120 of them were actual web APIs, that were something I felt I could work with. I settled on a handful of APIs out of the GSA, hosted at <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">www.usa.gov</a>, and <a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/index.html">explore.data.gov</a>, and got to work creating APIs.json for their APIs.</p>
<p>Before I could generate an APIs.json at each of the two domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), I needed machine readable API definition for the four APIs. I purposely picked federal agency APIs that were REST(flu), and were something I could easily generate a Swagger definition for.</p>
<p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://explore.data.gov/developers/docs/federal-executive-agency-internet-domains">federal agency domain API at explore.data.gov</a> was pretty easy, ony taking me a few minutes to handcraft a Swagger definition. Then I moved on to the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtml">Federal Agency Directory API at www.usa.gov</a>, and I was happy to see there was already a Swagger definition for the API. After that I tackled the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">Social Media Registry API</a>, and <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/mobile-app-gallery/index.shtml">Mobile App Gallery API</a>, both of which I had to handcraft a Swagger definition for. The Mobile App Gallery API has a CORS issue, but I'm moving on and will setup a proxy to handle later.</p>
<p>Now I have four machine readable API definitions for some pretty valuable government APIs, and I got to work creating my APIs.json that would act as a directory for these API resources. APIs.json are designed to go into the root domain of any API provider, and the four GSA APIs I selected ran under two separate domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), so I needed two separate APIs.json files:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">www.usa.gov/apis.json</a></li>
<li><a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">explore.data.gov/apis.jso</a>n</li>
</ul>
<p>When APIs.io gets updated to the latest version of APIs.json, I will submit both of these APIs.json files for indexing. Even though I&rsquo;m not the owner of these domains, I can still submit for inclusion in the API search engine. It would be better if the GSA published the APIs.json, and Swagger API definitions at the actual domains, and submitted themselves--the listings would then show as being authoritative, and hold more weight in API searches.</p>
<p>I still have about 115 more federal government APIs to create machine readable API definitions for, and the resulting APIs.json files that will enable discovery of these APIs--this isn&rsquo;t something that will happen overnight, and will take a shit-ton of work.</p>
<p>My goal is to help harden the APIs.json format, while making APIs in federal government more accessible, and part of the larger API discovery conversation that is going on in the private sector. One of the powerful features of APIs.json, is that external actors can craft APIs.json collections, from the outside. You don&rsquo;t have to be an owner of a domain, where an API is hosted, to publish an APIs.json on its behalf--I think this represents the potential of the public sector and private sector working together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APis.json are meant to work as collections of APis, or virtual stacks of valuable API resources. Sometimes these virtual stacks are defined internally, within a domain, and sometimes they are mashups of multiple API resources, across numerous domains, by outside actors, or API curators. I will keep curating federal government APIs, generating machine readable API definitions, APIs.json files for their supporting domains--helping define this fun new world of API discovery.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apis-json-gears.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>An <a href="http://apis.json">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;file lives in the root of any domain, or subdomain, and provides references to a collection of API resources. The APIs.json is meant to be a lightweight framework, where someone can build a collection of APIs, give it a name, description, some tags, and the APIs collection points you where you need to go, to get more information about those APIs.</p>
<p>For each API, you can define a list of URLs, each with a defining &ldquo;type&rdquo;, letting you know what to expect when you visit the URL. Right now, most of those URLs are just for humans, pointing to the developer portal, document, and terms of service (TOS). We are adding other API url types, that API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> can expose in their search interfaces, like code samples, and application gallery, to the next version of APIs.json.</p>
<p>These human API URL types provide a reference, that API search engines can use to guide human users who are searching for APIs. However, where the real power of APIs.json comes in, is when an API URL type references a machine readable source, like a <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definition</a>, or an <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">API Commons manifest</a>. When it comes to API discovery, we need as many meaningful locations, that we can point human API consumers to, but also machine readable locations, that will help make API discovery much more rich, automated, and precise.</p>
<p>Imagine when I can do more than just search name, description, and tags, by keyword, much like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> works currently. Imagine when you can specify that you only want APIs that are in the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, and openly licensed. Imagine when I can search for APIs that allow me to use all my HTTP verbs, not just GET. Now, go even more in the future, when I can search for APIs who have a specific allowance in their terms of service, with a machine readable TOS type for APIs.json.</p>
<p>This is where I want to take APIs.json, and ultimately API discovery. Machine readable API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger are the very first API URL type that helps automate API discovery, and the API Commons manifest is the latest. My goal is to tackle terms of service, pricing, and other critical aspects of API integration, and push forward a machine readable definition, that can ultimately be baked into the API discovery process--in all API search engines.</p>
<p>What is important to me, is that the API URL types, in each APIs.json, remain independent, and only loosely coupled with the APIs.json format, using a simple label, and URL. I&rsquo;m not directly invested in the evolution of each Swagger version, however I am with API Commons, and potentially other future APIs.json API URL type definitions. I want anyone to be able to step up and suggest API URL types for the APIs.json spec, making APIs.json URL types a community driven API discovery layer, for the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2014</span>

<p>When I first published 11 simple API definitions, I had developed using <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, into the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, I made a mistake when I referenced the Swagger specifications for each of the APIs. I linked to the machine readable Swagger spec, but not the raw JSON stored on Github, errorneously I linked directly to the Github page.</p>
<p>I want the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-commons/api-commons/gh-pages/data/apis.json">machine readable API datastore</a>, at API Commons, which is used to drive the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API listing page</a>, to be completely machine readable, referencing all APIs, their machine readable API Commons manifest, as well as machine readable API definition. As the smart folks over at <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a> pointed out to me, I had been flip-flopping on this. Some of my later entries were machine readable pointers, but my earlier entries were not.</p>
<p>Now all of the entries in the commons, have machine readable references to both their API Commons manifest, and API definition. I've also added a &ldquo;<a href="http://apicommons.org/format.html">format</a>&rdquo; page, to explain each of the fields, in the the API Commons manifest format, to help API providers better understand, and not make the same mistake I made.</p>
<p>The API Commons manifest is meant to be a standalone, machine readable pointer to an APIs central truth (a machine readable API definition), and associated CC-BY-SA or CC0 licensing, and now, I think we have achieved our original goals around making this happen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve expanded my monitoring on the world of APIs, from just API management, which I&rsquo;ve been doing for four years, into tracking on APIs across multiple buckets I'm calling <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API monetization" href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, <a title="API aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation</a>, <a title="reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">reciprocity</a>, and <a title="API real time" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">real-time</a>. I am always working to understand who the key players are across the API space, but also make sure they are categorized into one, or many of these expanding buckets--helping me quantify things.</p>
<p>It is always very interesting to see how an API service provider fits into more than one of these buckets, as well as when new players emerge to cater to just one of these buckets, like Apiary did with API design. Playing on this theme, I was introduced to new a new API service provider, called <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMatic</a> the other day, who on the surface seems to cater to API providers with the automatic generation of SDKs, but really is a cross-over into API design, discovery, and integration, bringing a new perspective to the table.</p>
<p><strong>Generating SDKs Is The Carrot</strong><br /> As soon as you land on the APIMatic home page, they state very clearly what they do "Automatic SDK Generation for APIs&rdquo;. You can search common APIs that are available in the APIMatic API marketplace, import your own API definition, or build one using their web-based user interface&mdash;which pretty squarely makes APIMatic for API consumers, providing clear API integration benefits, but via the generation of SDKs.</p>
<p><strong>GUI Tool For API Design</strong><br /> The third option for generating an SDK from an API, is using the APIMatic web-based user interface, which allows you to build a definition of your API, using a web interface&mdash;no coding necessary.  You can create a new definition, manage its settings, define endpoints, and the underlying data model. When ready, you can generate your SDK, which is rendered, I&rsquo;m guessing using the default APIMatic format, and then also allows you to generate mock APIs, and sandbox environments--pretty squarely in the world of API design for me.</p>
<p><strong>Provides API Discovery</strong><br /> Then the first option for generating an SDK is from a marketplace of existing APIs, allowing developers to generate SDKs for the most common APIs they depend on. From an API provider standpoint, this is a huge incentive for generating machine readable API definitions like Swagger, and register with marketplaces like APIMatic. I&rsquo;d say APIMatic starts with a very Mashape style API marketplace for discovery, but then quickly focuses heavily on quality SDKS, and API integration as the end deliverable.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting API Integration</strong><br /> Since APIMatic generates the code that sits between your app and the API resources it depends on, it has a unique lens for looking into how your applications are using APIs. This provides an alternative approach to the proxies and tooling I'm seeing emerge to monitor, track, test, and report on API integration. I&rsquo;m not sure of the pros and cons to this type of API integration, but think APIMatic vision is worth taking a closer look at.</p>
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-search-import-specify.png" alt="" width="575" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Focused Software Development Kits (SDK)</strong><br /> APIMatic focuses on delivering mobile SDKs, for iOS, Android, Windows, and Java platforms. When I talked to the founders, they said they would eventually provide more web focused SDKs, but mobile is obviously a major driver of API consumption, and was the low hanging fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Centered Around Machine Readable API Definitions</strong><br /> Everything about APIMatic is centered around API definitions. When you select to import an API, you are given the option to import APIMatic, WADL, Swagger, IODocs, GoogleREST, and MashapeJSON. Each of the APIs available in marketplace have a machine readable definition, as well as the web-based form builder generating a machine readable API definition as well. These definitions are then used to generate SDKs, mock interfaces, and full circle back to listing you in the APIMatic marketplace for discovery&mdash;if you wish to make your API public.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Software Development Kits (SDK)</strong><br /> Another aspect I find interesting about APIMatic, is that they focus on not just generating code stubs, they focus on high quality SDKs. Which in an era where you here a lot of rhetoric around SDKs being poorly written, out of date, hard to maintain, and unecessary--this gives APIMatic a potentially important differentiator if they do it right. APIMatic takes pride in their code being well written, looking nice, and following good conventions--something that could go a long ways in benefiting both API providers, and consumers.</p>
<p>Seeing new breeds of API service providers continue to emerge, with even new perspectives on how the API lifecycle operates, makes me happy, and with everything centered around machine readable, common API definitions, I'm even more pleased. This is in sync with what I&rsquo;m seeing come out of the API design, deployment, management, and integration providers I've been tracking on&mdash;that API definitions are increasingly driving all stops along the API lifecycle subway.</p>
<p>I will play with APIMatic some more. To be honest, I was approaching this from an API providers perspective when I jumped on the Google Hangout with them, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they crossed over into API design, integration, discovery, as well as management. Now that I have a good idea of what they offer, I will revisit what the benefits to API providers could be. At the very least, it is another carrot for API providers to be sure and generate machine readable definitions for their APIs&mdash;without it your APIs won&rsquo;t be found, or be able to be imported, and drive the next generation of API tooling like APIMatic.</p>
<p>APIMatic is looking to meet API providers, and get your API listed, so if you reach out, make sure and let them know I sent you. If you <a href="https://apimatic.io/Account/Register?Reference=C402F205-7E97-40EF-9894-BF1AFDBA9055">use this link</a>, and sign up, you will automatically be let into the beta users group--APIMatic is currently &ldquo;invite only&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Oh, I also had a good conversation with them about the possibilities around integration of APIMatic with <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a>, and distributed API search engines like <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a>, using <a href="http://bit.ly/1ij6TTP">APIs.json</a>&mdash;so more to come. Much more!</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2014</span>

<p>I talk about this concept often, but couldn't find any definitive post on APIs opening up a company, organization, or agency to outside ideas. This is something I hear from startups, up to federal government agencies, and from well known business brands, such as Absolut Vodka.</p>
<p>Absolut was one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">keynotes at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, this last march. Eva Sjokvist, from Absolut, walked us through the development of their <a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/">Absolut Drinks Database API</a>.&nbsp;An amazing story by itself, but one thing she said that stood out to me, which is an interestingly common by-product of the API lifecycle, was the process itself opened up the company, making it more receptive to outside ideas, and collaboration.</p>
<p>I hear this sentiment often from groups who are developing API programs at their companies, and you see shining examples, like <a href="http://developer.edmunds.com/">from Edmunds.com</a> with their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/internal-api-summit-within-every-company/">internal API Summit</a>, but rarely do I see a metric to measure API driven, cultural change. APIs don't just open up your company&rsquo;s assets and resources for access by trusted partners, or potentially the public, establishing a sort of external R&amp;D lab, it has the potential to open up a valuable feedback loop as well, bringing in new ideas that have the potential to change how a group sees the world--evolving internal culture.</p>
<p>The potential for opening up a company, bringing them closer to their partners and customers, or a government agency, opening up healthier dialogue with constituents, is the most important results of an API program&mdash;greater than any single application that will get built on an API.</p>

<p>I was exchanging emails with someone regarding API design considerations at their large institutions today, and where they could find healthy patterns for API designs within their industry. As with any API provider, they were concerned with emulating the best API design patterns they could, and evolve the design of their own services. They put it like this:</p>
<blockquote><em>..."our APIs largely expose our internal mess and legacy design rather than presenting a well thought out, consistent view of the important resources and operations"...</em></blockquote>
<p>We all want to deploy the best designed API that we possibly can, but with a lack of meaningful API definition formats (until recently), and nowhere to go and search or browse for common API design patterns (something 3Scale and API Evangelist want to fix with <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1ij6TTP">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a>), it can be difficult to know exactly what is good API design for our respective industries.</p>
<p>It would be nice, if all of the APIs we designed were brand new, perfectly architected to follow best of breed REST patterns, and we had all the time in the world to research and design. In reality, many of the APIs we design will ony act as a facade for some legacy beast of a system, that won't go away anytime soon. We are working to get more places like API Commons and APIs.io available to find the best API design patterns, and you should always look at as many of the APIs in your industry as you can, when designing your APIs, but most importantly, don't be concerned with a perfect interface--right out of the gate.</p>
<p>In reality, we have to just walk a line between the perfect API design, and the ugly legacy IT worlds, we are building these API facades to hide. The sooner we get the first version of the facade up, we can then iterate, and turn our APIs into the mirror image of the designs we ultimately desire&mdash;until then it is just smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>I am continuing my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">research into how universities are using APIs</a>, and while I was going through the developer areas for the universities I track on, I noticed an interesting mobile developer toolkit, from <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>When you land on the homepage of the <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">University of Michigan developer portal</a>, to the right you will see some valuable resources that is looking to help developers think through the bigger picture of designing, developing, deploying, testing and distributing, mobile application that are built on campus resources.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan mobile developer toolkit is broken down into four separate groups:</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p><a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/university/university-of-michigan/universitiy-of-michigan-mobile-developer-toolkit.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>

</ul>
<p>I think the resources they provide, represent a very long term vision around delivering API resources to developers, who will be building applications for the institution--something that all universities should look at emulating.</p>
<p>You want developers, who are building mobile applications on top of campus API resources to be successful, so providing them with the education, training and resources they need to deliver, is critical.</p>
<p>I also think it is cool, that at the bottom of the mobile developer toolkit, they provide two other links:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/devtoolkit/collaborate">Collaborate</a> - Campus and local developer groups.</li>
<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/devtoolkit/opportunities">Opportunities</a> - App competition notices.</li>
</ul>
<p>They want their app developers to socialize with other campus application developers, and be aware of opportunities to compete in hackathons and other competitions--on and off campus.</p>
<p>Developing mobile applications is the number one incentive for universities to deploy APIs, and jumpstart their API efforts like at <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/display/SOA/Home">BYU</a>, <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">UW</a> and <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, and&nbsp;it just makes sense to provide a mobile developer toolkit for developers. Education around APIs and mobile application development is critical to the success of any API initiative, but even more so, when it occurs across a large institution, by a variety of internal and external groups.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add the mobile developer toolkit to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">list common building blocks</a> for not just university APIs, but all API initiatives.</p>

<p>I'm working a wider campaign focused on getting my shit together around my images, and part of that is continueing work I had started with my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and launch more image manipulation API resources.</p>
<p>I have a wide range of needs to resize, crop, filter, and apply other filters to photos I work with, as part of my storytelling, and if I had a set of image manipulation APIs, life would be better--so as I do with anything, I got to work building an API.</p>
<p>The result is the first, in a series of&nbsp;<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation APIs</a>. Right now I focused on some low hanging fruit, like applying filters to images, which includes Charcoal, Oil Painting, Polaroid, and Sketch. Next, I will tackle some more utility APIs like resize, crop, and rotate.</p>
<p>Like my other APIs, I will use my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">operational harness</a>, and operate a <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">cloud version of my image manipulation API</a>, where anyone can access, and take advantage of my API resources. Using my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/service-composition-for-my-screen-capture-api/">API service composition</a>, I setup access tiers for public, partners and internal usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also open source any code behind so that others can deploy image manipulation within their own infrastructure, or I'm happy to setup for you--for a fee! :-)</p>
<p>I have a number of APIs I want to get built, and image manipulation has been on my list for a while, I'm glad I finally was able to get this work started.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas while being the API Evangelist. It just comes with the territory. I have an Evernote folder that I publish these ideas to, and some of them, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">Screen Capture API</a>, I actually make a reality.</p>

I need a public place to store these ideas, and while I'm at it, I'll enable others to publish ideas there too.</p>
<p>What better way to allow collaboration around a content store or dataset, than a Github repository plus API. So I launched <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/">API Ideas</a>, as an individual API project, on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist Network</a>.

<p>In the tech space, when we see a pattern that works, we run with it. This is why you hear, &ldquo;It is the Uber for X&rdquo;, or &ldquo;It is the Github for X&rdquo;, and I recently talked about how I&rsquo;m starting to see more of, &ldquo;<a title="It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/16/its-if-this-then-that-for-x/">It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X</a>&rdquo;. The IFTTT model, or what I call &ldquo;reciprocity&rdquo;, is an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">evolution on the classic enterprise ETL model</a>, resulting in over 25 companies that I&rsquo;m tracking on in the space.</p>
<p>Reciprocity works, because it is about solving a simple problem for everyday users, using APIs to take a single action&mdash;if this happens over there, use APIs, to do that over there. There are many other words used to describe this evolution of ETL in the clouds, including interoperability, and automation, I use reciprocity because it better describes what is happening as part of the growing global API economy.</p>
<p>I recently went through all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">65+ of my research projects</a>, one of them being <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and as I was working on new research areas around open data, analysis, and visualization, I started thinking about how the IFTTT (reciprocity) model could be applied to analysis and visualization&mdash;resulting in a draft model I would call <strong><em>If This Then Visualize That (IFTVT)</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The IFTVT model provides the similar feedback loop as IFTTT, but instead of a resulting action, the end goal is a visualization.  If &ldquo;end of month&rdquo;, show me overview of Foursquare checkins. If &ldquo;Tweet receives 10 favorites&rdquo;, show me a list of Twitter users. If &ldquo;bank account goes below $50&rdquo;, show me last 25 charges. How you get your IFTVT visualizations would be up to you, maybe it is email, maybe SMS, maybe some sort of iGoogle like dashboard unit.</p>
<p>As with the IFTTT model, IFTVT gives us actionable, meaningful results from our increasingly disparate digital worlds. Using reciprocity, we are slowly being able to get a handle on the cloud versions of ourselves, and I think the next step could be analysis and resulting visualizations, in bit-size, meaningful, informative chunks via the channels that matter most to us.</p>
<p>Ok, get to work geeks! I&rsquo;ll tell the story, if you build it. ;-)</p>

<p>Much like API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, the world of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> is heating up in 2014. We are moving beyond the API directory as our primary mode of API search, in favor of a distributed approach using APIs.json, and supporting <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">open source search engines like APIs.io</a>. Another area of API discovery I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/18/integrated-development-environment-ide-for-apis/">watching for a while</a>, and predict will become an important layer of API discovery, will be via the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source SalesForce API IDE Plugin</strong><br /> SalesForce just<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/07/new-eclipse-plugin.html"> announced they have just open sourced their API IDE plugin on Github</a>, after developing on it since 2007, when <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/index_Left.htm">APEX</a> was born. The plugin is old, but is very much in use in the SalesForce ecosystem, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/04/salesforce-discusses-its-eclipse-plugin-release-approach/">something I&rsquo;ve written about before</a>. They will be accepting pull requests on the main branch, looking to improve on the codebase, while looking to also maintain a community branch, as well as encouraging you to establish your own branch.</p>
<p><strong>Does Your API Have An IDE Plugin?</strong><br /> How far along are you on your own APIs Eclipse Plugin? Are you trying to reach enterprise developers with your API resource? You should probably look at the pros and cons of providing your API developers with a plugin, for leading IDEs. With the open sourcing of SalesForce API IDE plugin, <a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/idecore">you can reverse engineer their approach</a> and see what you can use for your own APIs IDE plugin&mdash;smells like a good opportunity to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/07/new-eclipse-plugin.html" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/salesforce/apex_doc_plugin_menu.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Opportunity For General Or Niche API IDE Plugins</strong><br /> Not that using SalesForce open source IDE would be the place to start for this kind of project, but I think there is a huge opportunity to develop API focused IDE plugins, for top developed environments, across many popular APIs.

<p><strong>Native Opportunities For IDE Platforms</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of new development environments emerge, many are web-based, with varying degrees of being &ldquo;integrated&rdquo;.

<p>All I do as the API Evangelist, is shed light on what API pioneers like SalesForce are up to, and expand on their ideas, using my knowledge of the industry--resulting in these stories. SalesForce has been doing APIs for 14 years now, and the IDE has been part of their API driven ecosystem for the last seven years. I think their move to open source the technology, is an opportunity for the wider API space to run with, by helping improve the community SalesForce API IDE plugin, but also apply their experience, and legacy code to help evolve and improve on this layer of API discovery, available within the IDE.</p>

<p>Much like API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, the world of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> is heating up in 2014. We are moving beyond the API directory as our primary mode of API search, in favor of a distributed approach using APIs.json, and supporting <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">open source search engines like APIs.io</a>. Another area of API discovery I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/18/integrated-development-environment-ide-for-apis/">watching for a while</a>, and predict will become an important layer of API discovery, will be via the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source SalesForce API IDE Plugin</strong><br /> SalesForce just<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/07/new-eclipse-plugin.html"> announced they have just open sourced their API IDE plugin on Github</a>, after developing on it since 2007, when <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/index_Left.htm">APEX</a> was born. The plugin is old, but is very much in use in the SalesForce ecosystem, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/04/salesforce-discusses-its-eclipse-plugin-release-approach/">something I&rsquo;ve written about before</a>. They will be accepting pull requests on the main branch, looking to improve on the codebase, while looking to also maintain a community branch, as well as encouraging you to establish your own branch.</p>
<p><strong>Does Your API Have An IDE Plugin?</strong><br /> How far along are you on your own APIs Eclipse Plugin? Are you trying to reach enterprise developers with your API resource? You should probably look at the pros and cons of providing your API developers with a plugin, for leading IDEs. With the open sourcing of SalesForce API IDE plugin, <a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/idecore">you can reverse engineer their approach</a> and see what you can use for your own APIs IDE plugin&mdash;smells like a good opportunity to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/07/new-eclipse-plugin.html" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/salesforce/apex_doc_plugin_menu.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Opportunity For General Or Niche API IDE Plugins</strong><br /> Not that using SalesForce open source IDE would be the place to start for this kind of project, but I think there is a huge opportunity to develop API focused IDE plugins, for top developed environments, across many popular APIs. Developers shouldn&rsquo;t have to leave their development environments to find the resources they need, they should be able to have quick access to the APIs they depend on te most, and discover new API resources right from their local environment, aking IDE plugins an excellent API discovery opportunity.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to stop and reflect for a moment on the open source, distributed API search engine, that <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist developed, in support of the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json discovery format</a>. When we conceived the APIs.json API discovery format, we knew that the project would be dead in the water, if there wasn&rsquo;t a clear incentive for API providers to generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>&mdash;helping them get their APIs found.</p>
<p>Until 2014, when you said "search for APIs", it meant going to a website (<a href="http://programmableweb.com">programmableweb.com</a>), and searching for an API in a curated directory of APIs. In the last couple years, we&rsquo;ve seen an evolution on this directory search model from Mashape, in the form of a hub or marketplace. Managed directories have their place in the world of API discovery, similar to the web directory realm, but as the number of APIs grow, we are desperately needing to go beyond just directory based API discovery, and like with the web, establish a meaningful search layer&mdash;we need a Google of API search.</p>
<p>This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist developed APIs.json, and the first open tooling on top of the API discovery format, we called <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>. We do not believe APIs.json + APIs.io is the next Google, but we do feel it will jumpstart the conversation around what is needed when it comes to API discovery. How do we find the best of breed APIs, not just on keyword search in the title and description, or driven from tags? We need a way for API providers to describe their APIs, and supporting building blocks, in a machine readable, distributed way, that can be indexed by many API discovery solutions.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When searching for APIs, we will need to find specific API interfaces, with very specialized terms of service, and pricing. We will need API rating solutions like <a href="http://api500.com/">API Rating Agency</a> baked into our API search algorithms. We need an extensible API discovery format, this is APIs.json. We need an open source search engine, that can be deployed as general search engine, or deployed as a specialized, niche, API search engine serving a specific business sector, like government--this is APIs.io.</p>
<p>APIs.io now has 128 APIs in its index, submitted by 91 maintainers. We are just getting started, defining what is next for both APIs.json, and APIs.io, make sure and get involved early on, and help make your mark on this rapidly expanding world of API discovery.  You can <a href="http://apis.io/apis/add">add your APIs to APIs.io</a>, <a title="fork the open source API search engine code" href="https://github.com/apisio/apis.io">fork the open source API search engine code</a>&nbsp;(coming soon) and launch your own API search engine, or <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">provide feedback on the next version of APIs.json</a>, the format that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> help discover the valuable API resources everyone will be depending on in the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-aud-shadow.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In a perfect world, every government agency, non-profit organization, and company would have an API, and the content and data available via their website, mobile applications, and other systems, would be accessible in an easy, machine readable way. This perfect world does not exist. Even though many government agencies, non-profit organizations, and companies are getting hip to the world of APIs, there is still massive amounts of work to be done, and I'm afraid if we want to see APIs across our government, we are going to have to do much of it ourselves.</p>
<p>I was listening to an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/02/327797193/digital-homestead-records-reopen-a-crucial-chapter-of-u-s-history">NPR story on the release of files detailing Nebraska's homesteading history</a>, a project between the National Archives and National Park Service, today. I wish I could be at all federal agencies, in all meetings, advocating for an API first approach to these projects--I can&rsquo;t. So, while we can celebrate the fact that the records around Nebraska&rsquo;s history have been digitized, and <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/homestead/">the website is very nice</a>, and usable for humans, THERE IS NO API!</p>
<p>This is when the private sector has to step in and help our federal government realize the importance and potential of an API--we need a shadow API for the homestead records database. While the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/homestead/">website is great for human consumptio</a>n, we also need a simple, machine readable API that other applications can put to use. It would be nice if the National Archives and National Park Service had made the API a priority, but I think this is where the private sector needs to step in, and make it happen.</p>
<p>I have direct orders from my super secret White House contact(s) to challenge you, Joe and Jane citizen to see who can launch an API faster, around content or data that is already public (no hacking)&mdash;the federal government, or you the average tech savvy citizen. I won&rsquo;t give up my sources, but I&rsquo;m dead serious when I say the White House asked me to put the word out on this.</p>
<p>Data sources like Nebraskas homestead records, are well structured web searches, and not that difficult to scrape. A savvy programmer could easily write a script to do it, and hand roll a simple API for others access the records. I also think a tech savvy non-programmer, could make happen by employing a modern API deployment tools like <a href="http://bit.ly/1iZ9EQ6">ScraperWiki</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a>, or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>. I don&rsquo;t imagine it taking more than a day or two, to scrape the data, and deploy a simple API interface from the results.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a new concept, something API devlopers have been doing a while. The <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/2010/12/15">first Instagram API was a shadow API,</a> deployed by independent 3rd party developer, who reverse engineered the mobile application. Kimono Labs also just launched an <a href="http://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer">unofficial World Cup API</a>, allowing for <a href="http://webkite.com/world-cup/">some pretty cool applications to be built on top of the shadow API</a>. Shadow APIs have been being deployed for years, we just need to make them more of a mainstream, acceptable way to make resources available via APIs, real fast!</p>
<p>If you know of a shadow API you would like to see built, or you are available to deploy shadow APIs, let me know. There are some things I&rsquo;d like to see in quality shadow API deployments around government data (maybe another story), and I can help you get the word out when the time is right. In my opinion, if content or data is already available via a government website, or as a full data dowload, there should be an API for it. Period.</p>
<p>What do you think? Who is going to build my Nebraska homestead record API, before I can harass the National Archives and National Park Service to do it?</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> <em>I'm not going to disclose my confidential sources at the White House, don't even ask or render me to a black ops site.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a style="padding: 15px;" href="http://www.caulfield.pw:3000/view/welcome-visitors"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/smallest-federated-wiki/smallest-federated-wiki.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm always working to better understand the best of breed technology solutions available online today, and to me, this means, lightweight, machine readable apps that do one thing and do it well. One solution I&rsquo;m looking at is called the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caulfield.pw:3000/view/welcome-visitors">Smallest Federated Wiki</a>, from Mike Caulfield(<a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a>), which has been on my list for several weeks now, but one of his <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/20/smallest-federated-wiki-as-a-universal-json-canvas/">latest posts has floated it back onto my priority list</a>.</p>
<p>To understand what the Smallest Federated Wiki (SFW) is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikA5rHA1uDg">check out the video</a>. I haven&rsquo;t personally downloaded and installed yet, which is something I do with all solutions that I&rsquo;m evaluating. SFW is Node.js, and <a href="https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki-node-server">available on Github</a>, if you want to play with as well--I'm going to be installing on AWS if you need an AMI. This post is all about understanding SFW, and light the fire under my own use of SFW, and hopefully stimulating your interest.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong><br /> Building off the simplicity of the Wiki, SFW borrows from the best features of Wiki, Github, and rolled together into simple, but ultimately powerful implementation that embraces the latest in technology from Node.js to HTML5. I know how hard it can be to achieve "simple", and while playing with SFW, I can tell a lot of work has gone into keeping things as fucking simple as possible. #win</p>
<p><strong>Federated</strong><br /> I love me some Wikipedia and Github, but putting my valuable content, and hard work into someone else&rsquo;s silo is proving to be a very bad idea. For all of my projects, I want to be able maximize collaboration, syndication and reach, without giving away ownership of my intellectual exhaust (IE) . SFW reflects this emotion, and allows me to browse other people&rsquo;s work, fork, re-use, while also maintaining my own projects within my silo, and enable other people to fork, and re-use from my work as well--SFW is a sneak peak at how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> modern applications <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHOULD</span> operate.</p>
<p><strong>JSON Extensible</strong><br /> SFW has the look and feel of a new age wiki, allowing you two generate pages and pages of content, but the secret sauce underneath is JSON. Everything on SFW is JSON driven, allowing for unlimited extensibility. <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/20/smallest-federated-wiki-as-a-universal-json-canvas/">MIke's latest blog post on how SFW&rsquo;s extensibility is unlimited</a>, due to it's JSON driven architecture, is why I'm floating SFW back on my review list. My 60+ API Evangelist projects all start with basic page, and blog content, but then rely on JSON driven research for companies, building blocks, tools, services, and many other data points that I track on for the space&mdash;SFW reflects the JSON extensibility I&rsquo;ve been embracing for the last couple years, but I'm doing this manually, SFW is by default.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity And Complexity</strong><br /> SFW achieves a simplicity, combined with the ability to extend the complexity in any way you choose. I can create a simple 3 page project site with it, or I could create a federated news application, allowing thousands of people to publish, curate, fork, remix, and collaborate around links&mdash;think Reddit, but federated. I envision SFW templates or blueprints, that allow me to quickly deploy a basic project blog, or CRM, news, research, and other more complex solutions. With <a href="http://www.docker.com/">new cloud deployment options like Docker emerging</a>, I see a future where I can quickly deploy these federated blueprints, on the open web, on-premise, or anywhere I desire.</p>
<p>I have a lot of ideas that I want to contribute to the SFW roadmap, but I need to get more seat hours, playing with the code, before I can intelligently contribute. Once i get my base SFW setup, I will start brainstorming on the role APIs can play in the SFW plugin layer., and scenarios for rapidly building SFW blueprint containers.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> While SFW has been on my Evernote todo list for several weeks, it was Mike's continued storytelling which bumped up the priority. Without the storytelling and evangelism, nothing happens--something Mike references in his post.</p>

<p>As I generate shitloads of content playing the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>&nbsp;on the Internets, I struggle with certain words, as I write each day&mdash;one of these words is intellectual property (IP), which Wikipedia defines as:</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual property (IP) rights are the legally recognized exclusive rights to creations of the mind.[1] Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs. Common types of intellectual property rights include copyright, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights, trade dress, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.</a></em></blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the phrase intellectual property, specifically because it includes &ldquo;property&rdquo;. Nothing that comes from my intellect is property. Nothing. It isn&rsquo;t something you can own or control. Sorry, what gets generated from my intellect, wants to be free, not owned or controlled&mdash;it is just the way it is. I cannot be creative, generate my ideas and projects, if I know the output or results will be locked up.</p>
<p>With this in mind I want to craft a new expression to describe the result of my intellectual output, I&rsquo;m going to call intellectual exhaust (IE). I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust">term exhaust, which has numerous definitions</a>, and reflects what can be emitted from my daily thoughts. You are welcome to collect, observe, remix, learn from, or get high off of the exhaust off my daily work&mdash;go right ahead, this is one of the many reasons I work so hard each day. You my loyal reader. One. Single.</p>
<p>In my opinion, you can even make money off my intellectual exhaust, however, no matter what you do, make sure you attribute back, letting people know where your ideas come from. And if you do make some money from it, maybe you can kick some of that back, supporting the things that fuel my intellectual exhaust:  sleep, food, water, beer, and interactions with other smart people around the globe. ;-)</p>
<p>P.S. There are other things that fuel my intellectual exhaust, but my lawyer and my girlfriend say I can&rsquo;t include some of them.</p>
<p>P.S.S. My girlfriend is not my lawyer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>

<p>I'm spending a lot of time updating my<a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com"> API deployment research</a>&nbsp;lately, making sure it reflects what is truly going on out there in the space. In addition to tracking on legacy approaches to API deployment like enterprise API gateways, or using an open-source API frameworks, I am also trying to understand the realities of scraping data for deployment of APIs, and new solutions from API platforms like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1jLr1Pf">StrongLoop</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to the realities of deploying an API, your data or content sources is likely to come from a myriad of file stores, databases, and other systems, and I&rsquo;m looking to explore as many of the as I possibly can. Todays exploration is focused on deploying an API, using Amazon S3 as a file store. I use Amazon S3 for all my heavy object storage which includes images, PDFs, XML, JSON and CSV data stores&mdash;it makes sense that someone companies would want to deploy APIs using their Amazon S3 stores.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-s3.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APISpark as my API deployment platform, which allows me to first establish a datastore, which is mapped to a specific bucket within my Amazon S3. What I put into my buckets, and folders is up to me. I might use it to quickly provide access to my images, a folder of XML files, PDFs, or other resource. Once I have my datastore defined, I can deploy a simple web API using APISpark, which gives me all the expected features of an API&mdash;URL API endpoints, documentation, code samples, basic authentication (username / password), analytics, and much more.</p>
<p>As with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/30/deploy-an-api-from-a-google-spreadsheet-using-apispark/">Google Spreadsheet to API example I wrote on Monday</a>, this scenario allows anyone who manages content and data, to easily organize it on S3, then deploy an API for access, with no IT or developer experience required. You might need to share images, files, or other content with another department within your company or organization, partners outside the corporate firewall, or maybe some 3rd party developers you have building a new website or mobile application.</p>
<p>API deployment is getting easier, and cloud API service providers like APISpark are making API deployment something ANYONE can do&mdash;stop waiting for IT or developer resources! ;-)</p>

<p>As I continue my research the world of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a>, I'm trying to distill the services, and tooling I come across, down into what I consider to be a common set of building blocks. My goal with identifying API deployment building blocks is to provide a simple list of what the moving parts are, that enable API providers to successfully deploy their services.</p>
<p>Some of these building blocks overlap with other core areas of my research like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, but I hope this list captures the basic building blocks of what anyone needs to know, to be able to follow the world of API deployment. While this post is meant for a wider audience, beyond just developers, I think it provides a good reminder for developers as well, and can help things come into focus. (I know it does for me!)</p>
<p>Also there is some overlap between some of these building blocks, like API Gateway and API Proxy, both doing very similiar things, but labeled differently. Identifying building blocks for me, can be very difficult, and I'm constantly shifting definitions around, until I find a comfortable fit--so some of these will evolve, especially with the speed at which things are moving in 2014.</p>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>CSV to API</strong>&nbsp;- Text files that contain comma separate values or CSVs, is one of the quickest ways to convert existing data to an API. Each row of a CSV can be imported and converted to a record in a database, and easily generate a RESTful interface that represents the data stored in the CSV. CSV to API can be very messy depending on the quality of the data in the CSV, but can be a quick way to breathe new life into old catalogs of data lying around on servers or even desktops. The easiest way to deal with CSV is to import directly into database, than generate API from database, but the process can be done at time of API creation.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-database.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Database to API</strong>&nbsp;- Database to API is definitely the quickest way to generate an API. If you have valuable data, generally in 2013, it will reside in a Microsoft, MySQL, PostgreSQL or other common database platform. Connecting to a database and generate a CRUD, or create, read, updated and delete API on an existing data make sense for a lot of reason. This is the quickest way to open up product catalogs, public directories, blogs, calendars or any other commonly stored data. APIs are rapidly replace database connections, when bundled with common API management techniques, APIs can allow for much more versatile and secure access that can be made public and shared outside the firewall.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Framework</strong>&nbsp;- There is no reason to hand-craft an API from scratch these days. There are numerous frameworks out their that are designed for rapidly deploying web APIs. Deploying APIs using a framework is only an option when you have the necessary technical and developer talent to be able to understand the setup of environment and follow the design patterns of each framework. When it comes to planning the deployment of an API using a framework, it is best to select one of the common frameworks written in the preferred language of the available developer and IT resources. Frameworks can be used to deploy data APIs from CSVs and databases, content from documents or custom code resources that allow access to more complex objects.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-proxy.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Gateway</strong>&nbsp;- API gateways are enterprise quality solutions that are designed to expose API resources. Gateways are meant to provide a complete solution for exposing internal systems and connecting with external platforms. API gateways are often used to proxy and mediate existing API deployments, but may also provide solutions for connecting to other internal systems like databases, FTP, messaging and other common resources. Many public APIs are exposed using frameworks, most enterprise APIs are deployed via API gateways--supporting much larger ideployments.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-proxy.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Proxy</strong>&nbsp;- API proxy are common place for taking an existing API interface, running it through an intermediary which allows for translations, transformations and other added services on top of API. An API proxy does not deploy an API, but can take existing resources like SOAP, XML-RPC and transform into more common RESTful APIs with JSON formats. Proxies provide other functions such as service composition, rate limiting, filtering and securing of API endpoints. API gateways are the preffered approach for the enterprise, and the companies that provide services support larger API deployments.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-connector" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Connector</strong>&nbsp;- Contrary to an API proxy, there are API solutions that are proxyless, while just allowing an API to connect or plugin to the advanced API resources. While proxies work in many situations, allowing APIs to be mediated and transformed into required interfaces, API connectors may be preferred in situations where data should not be routed through proxy machines. API connector solutions only connect to existing API implementations are easily integrated with existing API frameworks as well as web servers like Nginx.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-hosting" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- Hosting is all about where you are going to park your API. Usual deployments are on-premise within your company or data center, in a public cloud like Amazon Web Services or a hybrid of the two. Most of the existing service providers in the space support all types of hosting, but some companies, who have the required technical talent host their own API platforms. With HTTP being the transport in which modern web APIs put to use, sharing the same infrastructure as web sites, hosting APIs does not take any additional skills or resources, if you already have a web site or application hosting environment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Versioning</strong>&nbsp;- There are many different approaches to managing different version of web APIs. When embarking on API deployment you will have to make a decision about how each endpoint will be versioned and maintained. Each API service provider offers versioning solutions, but generally it is handled within the API URI or passed as an HTTP header. Versioning is an inevitable part of the API life-cycle and is better to be integrated by design as opposed to waiting until you are forced to make a evolution in your API interface.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-documents.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- API documentation is an essential building block for all API endpoints. Quality, up to date documentation is essential for on-boarding developers and ensuring they successfully integrate with an API. Document needs to be derived from quality API designs, kept up to date and made accessible to developers via a portal. There are several tools available for automatically generting documentation and even what is called interactive documentation, that allows for developers to make live calls against an API while exploring the documentation. API documentation is part of every API deployment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Code Samples</strong>&nbsp;- Second to documentation, code samples in a variety of programming languages is essential to a successful API integration. With quality API design, generating samples that can be used across multiple API resources is possible. Many of the emerging API service providers and the same tools that generate API documentation from JSON definitions can also auto generate code samples that can be used by developers. Generation of code samples in a variety of programming languages is a requirement during API deployment.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-scraper.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Scraping</strong>&nbsp;- Harvesting or scraping of data from an existing website, content or data source. While we all would like content and data sources to be machine readable, sometimes you have just get your hands dirty and scrape it. While I don't support scraping of content in all scenarios, and business sectors, but in the right situations scraping can provide a perfectly acceptable content or data source for deploying an API.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Container</strong>&nbsp;- The new virtualization movement, lead by Docket, and support by Amazon, Google, Red Hat, Microsoft, and many more, is providing new ways to package up APIs, and deploy as small, modular, virtualized containers.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- Github provides a simple, but powerful way to support API deployment, allowing for publsihing of a developer portal, documentation, code libraries, TOS, and all your supporting API business building blocks, that are necessary for API effort. At a minimum Github should be used to manage public code libraries, and engage with API consumers using Github's social features.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Terms of Use / Service</strong>&nbsp;- Terms of Use provide a legal framework for developers to operate within. They set the stage for the business development relationships that will occur within an API ecosystem. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API. Make sure an APIs TOS pass insepection with the lawyers, but also strike a healthy balance within the ecosystem and foster innovation.</td>

<p>I'm feel like I'm finally getting a handle on the building blocks for API design, deployment, and management, and understanding the overlap in the different areas. I will revisit my design and management building blocks, and evolve <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my ideas of what my perfect API editor would look like</a>, and how this fits in with <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API management infrastructure from 3Scale</a>, and even API integration.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Spreadsheet are the most used datastore in business. When Google came out with their web-based spreadsheet, it was a game changer (for those who have access), when it came to managing, collaborating and sharing small data sets.</p>
<p>When it comes to data management, not all of us live in the world of big data, and spreadsheets are a quick and dirty data store that gets the job done.  As the web was maturing, Google saw an opportunity, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs">launched the labs version of Google Spreadsheets in mid 2006</a>, bringing spreadsheets into the web 2.0 era of the Internet. In 2014, the next step, in the evolution of the spreadsheet, is to be able to plug spreadsheets directly into the API economy, allowing spreadsheet data stewards to make their valuable content and data available to web, mobile and Internet of things (Iot) developers via simple web APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/gdata/samples/spreadsheet_sample">Google Spreadsheets allows for accessing data via a JSON feed natively</a>, and I wrote about adding an API, plus management layer on top of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">private</a> Google Spreadsheet, but there is also an instant, cloud-based approach to deploying an API from Google Spreadsheet, using <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>. Restlet has taken their open source REST framework, launched it as a service, and opened up the possibility for anyone to deploy an API, from an existing Google Spreadsheet&mdash;no coding necessary.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-spreadsheet-api.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>APISpark has provided both the API deployment, plus API management layer, spreadsheet owners will need. This is an important evolution in the API economy, because it allows people who are actually managing vital data to securely expose it, for use in applications, without needing any developer or IT resources. This will bring data stewards closer to the actual people who need their data, whether it be internally between systems or business units, externally with partners, or even publicly for anyone looking to use a dataset on a website or application.</p>
<p>A lot can be lost in translation, when a dataset has to go through IT, or developers before it can be made available as an API, not to mention the cost savings in being able to cut out the middleman. If we can equip any small business, enterprise, non-profit, or government data steward, who spends their day managing content and data in spreadsheets, with the ability to securely expose, and easily manage APIs from those data sources&mdash;imagine the fuel that will be fed to the API economy.</p>
<p>I am working on other walk-throughs, demonstrating how to expose datasets managed in <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Google Spreadsheets, as APIs, using APISpark.</a> When I get up, I will publish here on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, as well as on my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API Deployment research site</a>, for folks to learn from.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working the great feedback we've had on <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, an adding everything to the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">Github issues for consideration in the next version</a>. Today I&rsquo;m spending a little time thinking through the big picture of APIs.json, and some of the building blocks I'd like to see reflected when API providers generate their APIs.json.</p>
<p>Each API listed in an APIs.json has what we are calling: <em>"Properties Elements&rdquo;.</em> The properties element is a collection, with two values: <em>type and url.</em> While we provide you with a base set of property element types you can reference:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Swagger</li>
<li>RAML</li>
<li>Blueprint</li>
<li>WADL</li>
<li>WSDL</li>
<li>TermsOfService</li>
<li>InterfaceLicense</li>
<li>StatusPage</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>AlertsTwitterHandle</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to continue providing, &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; types that we recognize, while also leaving properties elements, being as organic as possible&mdash;meaning you can define your own references, and tell the story of why these are important building blocks in your own API strategy. We will continue adding the best properties we see being used, to the APIs.json spec.</p>
<p>To prepare for the next version of APIs.json, I want to have the next list of reserved property types. Working from my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a> I&rsquo;ve identified X I&rsquo;d like to see in the next version:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

</ul>
<p>These are the building blocks I think are important to API operations. Currently all of these will be links to human readable pages, within an APIs developer portal, but eventually I envision all of these potentially being machine readable.</p>
<p>I know, this is a big vision, but I intend to make it a reality. The first machine readable element on this list is the InterfaceLicense, which will reference the <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">machine readable JSON manifest</a> for <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>Next on the list is TermsOfService, which I will be using <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read&rsquo;s</a> machine readable format, and applying it to the world of APIs. If there are any types you&rsquo;d like to see in the next version of APIs.json, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues/44">Github issue I created for this discussion</a>, and make sure it is on the list.</p>

<p>My research for API Evangelist <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">spans 50+ projects</a>, but my core research is focused on seven projects in&nbsp;<a href="http://101.apievangelist.com">API 101</a>, <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com">history</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>. In each of these areas, I evaluate who the key players (companies and individuals) are, and the tools and services they produce.</p>
<p>Using my own, custom developed system, I monitor these key players, in all of the research areas, consuming blog posts, tweets, code commits, and much more, trying to establish a deep awareness in each of these fundamental layers of the API economy.  The goal of my monitoring is to help me in producing blog posts (short form), and white papers (long form), while generating valuable analysis for my research, and increasing my own understanding and awareness of the API economy.</p>
<p>I have already produced white papers for <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-api-101-white-paper-2.png">API 101</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-white-papers-history-of-apis-2.png">History of APIs</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-deployment-pdf-cover-3.png">API Deployment</a>, and <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-api-providers-guide-api-management-white-paper.png">API Management</a>, and I just now finished one for <a href="http://bit.ly/1pFDGeP">API Design</a>. As with all of my research projects, and the resulting white papers, they are a work in progress, and meant to be a living snapshot of my research. I generate this white paper using the same tools I publish my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design research to Github</a>. My CMS lets me format the static content, while also pulling dynamic content from my tracking system(s), and rolls it up into single PDF white paper, you can take with you and learn about the world of API design--it isn't perfect, but provides a good summary of my research.</p>
<p>The other white papers I've produced are all due for an update, but first I need to focus on producing the first version white paper for API discovery, and integration, both areas that are extremely relevant, fast moving layers of the API economy. Looking at the date on my other white papers, June 2013, it seems that summer is a good time to hibernate and produce these new, long form snapshots of my ongoing research into the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jun 2014</span>

<p>We are still in the infancy of the API economy, and now with barely 14 years of evolving web API design, we are only just now developing the languages we will need to communicate around APIs throughout their lifecycle, from the first mock of the API resource, to monitoring of a production API in the wild, or making available to a new breed of API search engines.</p>
<p>There has long been standards for describing APIs, such as WSDL for SOAP, and WADL for web APIs, but these formats would never actually enable the meaningful interactions around APIs that it would take to find widespread adoption. WSDL was too programmatic, and heavy handed, while WADL never possessed the incentives for API providers to take the time to define their APIs using the heavy XML format.</p>
<p>It wasn't until early 2011, we would see the first signs of a meaningful language for defining web APIs, that would enable us to have productive conversations, and take action around our API designs. In February 2011, <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">online word meaning and definition site Wordnik</a>, launched a <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/calling-all-developers-check-out-our-new-developer-site">new API developer portal, complete with a new way to document APIs</a>, that was interactive, and allowed developers to make live API calls, while learning about an API. In an effort to keep their API documentation up to date, Wordnik has also established a new way to not just document and communicate with an API, but allow us to actually have a shared conversation about the actual design of the API itself.</p>
<p>Later on that year, API management provider Mashery emulated Wordnik's approach, and <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/mashery-unveils-next-generation-of-api-documentation-1541728.htm">launched their I/O Docs</a>. Immediately after, in August 2011, <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/wordnik-news-swagger-jobs-nosql-now">Wordnik formally launched their approach to defining APIs</a>, generate interactive documentation, and server or client side code&mdash;which they called <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>. Over the next two years the Swagger ecosystem would grow and evolve, producing new versions, tooling, and implementations of both private and public API implementations.</p>
<p>During this time, the concept of API design would expand, with tech giants like Google establishing their own approach, which they called <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">Google Discovery</a>, and we would see a new breed of API design service providers emerge with <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>. By March 2013, Apiary had <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2013/03/28/New-API-Blueprint-Format-Roll-Out/">launched their own API definition format called API Blueprint</a>, which allowed API providers to define an API using markdown, and iterate on the design using Apiary.io services. Apiary moved the incentives for defining APIs in a machine readable format earlier on in the lifecycle. Now we didn't just generate machine readable definitions to deploy server code, or generate interactive docs and client side code, we would do it before we actually deployed the API, allowing us to mock our API designs, and collaborate around designing the actual API prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Then by the end of 2013, <a href="http://blogs.mulesoft.org/raml-web-tooling-unleashed/">we'd see another API definition language emerge, this time from enterprise technology provider Mulesoft</a>, called <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. This new approach to defining APIs, would use YAML to produce a machine readable, yet human friendly way to describe APIs. Now we had four new ways to describe our APIs, and as we push into 2014, we have a wealth of tooling, services, and a selection of maturing API design editors to choose from when planning and designing our APIs.</p>
<p>I feel like we are just moving from infancy, into the toddler phase of communicating throughout the web API lifecycle. We now have several languages to choose from, we just have to work hard to educate people that they exist, help them become fluent, and expand the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentives for generating machine readable definitions for our APIs</a>. In the next year, I predict we will see an increased adoption of the leading API definition formats, new tooling and services that helps us design, deploy, manage, monetize, evangelize and integrate with APIs that are driving the API, and app economy--driven from a central, machine readable API definition.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/restlet-apispark.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for common patterns that are working within the API space, and shine light on them, work to understand why they work, so that others can emulate these successful patterns in the space. One approach I&rsquo;ve seen work well, in many situations, is a combination of open source and a Platform as a Service (PaaS), and I&rsquo;m going to highlight the implementation of this model by one of the API Evangelist partners&mdash;<a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Restlet / APISpark</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source For Developers</strong><br /> First and foremost, Restlet is an open source web API framework, that any developer can download, and install to deliver their own API. The community benefits from this, Restlet benefits from this&mdash;open source API tooling is a fundamental building block for all of this to work. Many companies feel that open sourcing their core platform is just giving away their intellectual property, when in reality many consumers of your software won&rsquo;t have the resources to implement on their own, and will still need consulting resources to get the solution off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS) For Everyone</strong><br /> If you want the power of Restlet, but don&rsquo;t have the time or resources to download and install, and you just want to get up and running with APIs, Restlet provides a PaaS version of Restlet, called APISpark.  Using APISpark, anyone can deploy an API from new or existing data or file stores--no coding resources necessary. APISpark is a natural companion for Restlet, providing an out-of-the-box web API framework, that anyone can put to use--providing a viable commercial layer built on top of the open source Restlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professional Services For Everything Else</strong><br /> Of course, at any stage of development, whether you are looking to put Restlet or APISpark to work, there are professional services to help you achieve your goals. The Restlet team provides professional services, commercial licensing, and other opportunities to get the skills and resources you need to make your API deployment successful. Since Restlet is open source, this isn&rsquo;t limited to the Restlet professional services team itself, a community has evolved around the Restlet platform, allowing for community options when looking for assistance with any API deployment.</p>
<p>I believe the Restlet business model is significant, and represents the future of the API economy. It makes sense to have your core technology be open source, and allow the community to benefit from the availability of open tooling, as well as the platform to benefit from community driven software development.  This model acknowledges that not every will have the time and resources to deploy on their own, and provides a PaaS version, as well as the required paid support necessary to find success with any API deployment.</p>
<p>Open API frameworks are essential to the success of the API economy, and Restlet is a better product because its source code is open. They have acknowledged that there is plenty of money to be made around the platform version of Restlet (APISpark), and professional services surrounding both platforms. I believe this formula is fundamental to the API economy working, and is something other API infrastructure should look to follow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/nest-api-intro"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/nest/nest-developer-program.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had several folks point me to the <a href="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/nest-api-intro">Nest API</a> release the other day. I enjoy this, because I&rsquo;m not always the fastest in finding news&mdash;eventually I&rsquo;ll find it, but I rely on my human API monitoring network, just as much as my algorithmic API monitoring network, to bring stories to my attention. I&rsquo;m still reviewing the Nest API release, but one thing that stood out to me, was how real-time is baked into the API by default, and specifically using <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>.</p>
<p>The Nest API documentation states:</p>
<blockquote><em>Use the official Firebase client libraries (Web, iOS, Java, and Node), which allow you to synchronize your data with a subscription-based, near-real time platform. As you develop your client, you'll find these resources useful: Firebase Data Structure, Reading and Writing data.</em></blockquote>
<p>Nest also provides options, if you can&rsquo;t use the Firebase library (not sure why this would be):</p>
<blockquote><em>In cases where the platform you're developing your integration on has no available Firebase library, you may want to use REST or REST Streaming instead.</em></blockquote>
<p>I track on <a href="http://bit.ly/11RorBM">real-time technology</a> like Firebase as part of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">API trends research</a>, and much like other trends like <a title="aggregation" href="http://bit.ly/11RojT4">aggregation</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/19Li6cS/">reciprocity</a>,&nbsp;I think we&rsquo;ll start seeing these trending layers baked into API operations by default. I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">APIs reference default API reciprocity, using platforms like Zapier</a>, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more APIs adopt real-time frameworks by default in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.firebase.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/firebase/firebase-logo.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API providers need to focus on what they do best, providing API access to their valuable data, content and other programmatic resources. It is wise for providers to leverage existing providers to deliver real-time, aggregation, reciprocity, <a href="http://bit.ly/10sgWQI">voice</a>, and other complimentary API layers. I will continue to keep my eye out for how APIs are providing a much fuller stack of resources for developers, using their own resources, while also augmenting with other leading technology platforms.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not at Google I/O this week, enjoying some downtime in SoCal, but I am watching some of the news coming out of the event. One thing I noticed, was the addition of monitoring to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>, where&nbsp;Google is slowly working their <a href="https://www.stackdriver.com">StackDriver acquisition</a> into their fast growing API driven, cloud development platform.</p>
<p>You have to request access to the new monitoring services, and Google will open up "Stackdriver's monitoring capabilities available to select Google Cloud trusted testers at no charge&rdquo;. Wile Stackdriver is about monitoring your cloud infrastructure, it also provides <a href="http://www.stackdriver.com/announcing-endpoint-monitoring/">granular level, API endpoint monitoring solutions</a> that you can use to monitor the health of the API resources you depend on in your apps.</p>
<p>When Google makes a move to support a specific feature across its world of APIs, I take notice. Much like when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-20/">Google adopted OAuth 2.0 across all APIs</a>, I think their move to provide monitoring services, is a sign that monitoring of the resources you depend is going mainstream--something all web, mobile and Iot API resource providers need to have in place by default in 2014.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-editor.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about API design lately, the services and tooling coming from Apiary, RAML and Swagger, and wanted to explore some thoughts around what I would consider to be killer features for the killer API design editor.  Some of these thoughts are derived from the features I&rsquo;ve seen in Apiary and RAML editor, and most recently the Swagger Editor, but I&rsquo;d like to *riff* on a little bit and play with what could be the next generation of features.</p>
<p>While exploring my dream API design editor, I&rsquo;d like to walk through each group of features, organized around my indentations and objectives around my API designs.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br />When kicking off the API design process, I want to be able to jumpstart the API design lifecycle from multiple sources. There will be many times that I want to start from a clean slate, but many times I will be working from existing patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blank Canvas -</strong> I want to start with a blank canvas, no patterns to follow today, I&rsquo;m painting my masterpiece.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import Existing File -</strong> I have a loose API design file laying around, and I want to be able to open, import and get to work with it, in any of the formats.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fork From Gallery </strong>- I want to fork one of my existing API designs, that I have stored in my API design taller (I will outline below).&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import From API Commons -</strong> Select an existing API design pattern from API Commons and import into editor, and API design gallery.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goals in getting started with API design, will be centered around re-use the best patterns across the API space, as well as my own individual or company API design gallery. We are already mimicking much of this behavior, we just don&rsquo;t have a central API design editor for managing these flows.</p>
<p><strong>Editing My API Design</strong><br />Now we get to the meat of the post, the editor. I have several things in mind when I&rsquo;m actually editing a single API definition, functions I want, actions I want to take around my API design. These are just a handful of the editor specific features I&rsquo;d love to see in my perfect API design editor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Lingual -</strong> I want my editor to word with API definitions in API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger. I prefer to edit my API designs in JSON, but I know many people I work with will prefer markdown or YAML based, and my editor needs to support fluid editing between all popular formats.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Internationalization - How will I deal with making my API resources available to developers around the world? Beyond API definition langugages, how do I actually make my interfaces accessible, and understood by consuers around the glob.e</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary - </strong>I will outline my thoughts around a central dictionary below, but I want my editor to pull from a common dictionary, providing a standardized language that I work from, as well as my company when designing interfaces, data models, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Annotation -</strong> I want to be able to annotate various aspects of my API designs and have associated notes, conversation around these elements of my design.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Highlight</strong> - Built in highlighting would be good to support annotations, but also just reference various layers of my API designs to highlighting during conversations with others, or even allowing the reverse engineer of my designs, complete with the notes and layers of the onions for others to follow.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Source View -</strong> A view of my API design that allows me to see the underlying markdown, YAML, or JSON and directly edit the underlying API definition language.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>GUI View - </strong>A visual view of my API design, allowing for adding, editing and removing elements in an easy GUI interface, no source view necessary for designing APIs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Interactive View -</strong> A rendered visual view of my API, allowing me to play with either my live API or generated mock API, through interactive documentation within my editors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Save To Gallery -</strong> When I&rsquo;m done working with my API designs, all roads lead to saving it to my gallery, once saved to my working space I can decide to take other actions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions -</strong> I want my editor to suggest the best patterns available to me from private and public sources. I shouldn't ever design my APIs in the dark.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API design editor should work like most IDE&rsquo;s we see today, but keep it simple, and reflect extensibility like <a href="https://atom.io/">GIthub&rsquo;s Atom editor</a>. My editor should give me full control over my API designs, and enable me to take action in many pre-defined or custom ways one could imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Action </strong> <br />My API designs represent the truth of my API, at any point within its lifecycle, from initial conception to deprecation. In my perfect editor I should be able to take meaningful actions around my API designs. For the purposes of this story I&rsquo;m going to group actions into some meaningful buckets, that reflect the expanding areas of the API lifecycle. You will notice the four areas below, reflect the primary areas I track on via API Evangelist.</p>
<p><strong>Design Actions</strong><br />Early on in my API lifecycle, while I&rsquo;m crafting new designs, I will need to take action around my designs. Designs actions will help me iterate on designs before I reach expensive deployment and management phases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mock Interface - </strong>With each of my API designs I will need to generate mock interfaces that I can use to play with what my API will deliver. I will also need to share this URL with other stakeholders, so that they can play with, and provide feedback on my API interface.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Copy / Paste - </strong>API designs will evolve and branch out into other areas. I need to be able to copy / paste or fork my API designs, and my editor, and API gallery should keep track of these iterations so I don&rsquo;t have to. The API space essentially copy and pastes common patterns, we just don&rsquo;t have a formal way of doing it currently.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Email Share - </strong>I want to easily share my API designs via email with other key stakeholders that will be part of the API lifecycle. Ideally I wouldn&rsquo;t be emailing around the designs themselves, just pointers to the designs and tools for interacting within the lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Social Share - </strong>Sometimes the API design process all occur over common social networks, and in some cases be very public. I want to be able to easily share all my API designs via my most used social networks like Github, Twitter and LinkedIn.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration - </strong>API design should not be done in isolation, and should be a collaborative process with all key stockholders. I would like to to even have <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad style real-time interactions</a> around the design process with other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>API design actions are the first stop, in the expanding API design lifecycle. Being able to easily generate mocks, share my interfaces and collaborate with other stakeholders. Allowing me to quickly, seamlessly take action throughout the early design cycles will save me money, time and resources early on&mdash;something that only become more costly and restrictive later on in the lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment Actions </strong><br />Next station in the API design lifecycle, is being able to deploy APIs from my designs. Each of the existing API definition formats provide API deployment solutions, and with the evolution in cloud computing, we are seeing even more complete, modular ways to take action around your API designs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - With each of my API designs, I should be able to generate server side code in the languages that I use most. I should be able to register specific frameworks, languages, and other defining aspects of my API server code, then generate the code and make available for download, or publish using Github and FTP.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong> - Cloud computing has matured, producing a new way of deploying very modular architectural resources, giving rise to a new cloud movement, being called containers.  Container virtualization will do for APIs, what APIs have done for companies in the last 14 years. Containers provide a very defined, self-contained way of deploying APIs from API design blueprints, ushering a new ay of deploy API resources in coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need help to deploy my APIs, and with container solutions like <a href="http://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, I should have predefined packages I can configure with my API designs, and deploy using popular container solutions from Google, Amazon, or other coud provider.</p>
<p><strong>Management Actions </strong><br />After I deploy an API I will need to use my API definitions as a guide for an increasing number of areas of my management process, not just the technical, but the business and politics of my API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Generating of interactive API documentation is what kicked off the popularity of API design, and importance of API definitions. Swagger provider the Swagger UI, and interactive, hands-on way of learning about what an API offered, but this wasn&rsquo;t the only motivation&mdash;providing up to date documentation as well, added just the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentives API providers needed to generate machine readable documentation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - Second to API documentation, providing code samples, libraries, and SDKS is one of the best ways you can eliminate friction when on boarding new API users. API definitions provide a machine readable set of instructions, for generating the code that is necessary throughout the API management portion of the API lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - JavaScript provides a very meaningful way to demonstrate the value of APis, and embeddable JavaScript should always be part of the API lifecycle. Machine readable API definitions can easily generate visualizations that can be used in documentation, and other aspects of the API lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>I predict, with the increased adoption of machine readable API formats like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, we will see more layers of the API management process be expanded on, further automating how we manage APis.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Actions </strong><br />Having your APIs found, and being able to find the right API design for integration, are two sides of an essential coin in the API lifecycle. We are just now beginning to get a handle on what is need when it comes to API discovery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> - </strong>I should be able to organize API designs into groupings, and publish an APIs.json file for these groups. API designs should be able to be organized in multiple groups, organized by domain and sub-domain.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a> -</strong> Thanks to Oracle, the copyright of API of API definitions will be part of the API lifecycle. I want the ability to manage and publish all of my designs to the API Commons, or any other commons for sharing of API designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The discovery of APIs has long been a problem, but is just now reaching the critical point where we have to start develop solutions for not just finding APIs, but also understanding what they offer, and the details of of the interface, so we can make sense of not just the technical, but business and political decisions around API driven resources.</p>
<p><strong>Integration Actions</strong><br /> Flipping from providing APIs to consuming APIs, I envision a world where I can take actions around my API designs, that focus on the availability, and integration of valuable API driven resources.  As an API provider, I need as much as assistance as I can, to look at my APIs from an external perspective, and being able to take action in this area will grow increasingly important.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Using my machine readable API definitions, I should be able to publish testing definitions, that allow the execution of common API testing patterns. I&rsquo;d love to see providers like SmartBear, Runscope, APITools, and API Metrics offer services around the import of API design generated definitions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Just like API testing, I want to be able to generate definition that allow for the monitoring of API endpoints. My API monitoring tooling should allow for me to generate standard monitoring definitions, and import and run them in my API monitoring solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that API integration is the fastest growing area of the AP space, second only to API design itself. Understanding how an API operates, from an integrators perspective is valuable, not just to the integrator, but also the provider. I need to be thinking about integration issues early on in the API design lifecyle to minimize costly changes downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Actions</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve laid out some of the essential actions I&rsquo;d like to be able to take around my API definitions, throughout the API lifecycle. I expect the most amount of extensibility from my API design editor, in the future, and should be able to extend in any way that I need.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - I need a dead simple way to take an API design, and publish to a single URL, from within my editor. This approach provides the minimum amount of extensibility I will need in the API design lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - I will need to run JavaScript that I write against all of my API designs, generating specific results that I will need throughout the API design process. My editor should allow me to write, store and execute JavaScript against all my API designs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Marketplace</strong> - There should be a marketplace to find other custom actions I can take against my API designs. I want a way to publish my API actions to the marketplace, as well as browse other API actions, and add them to my own library.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a point where using API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger are common place, and being able to innovate around what actions we take throughout the API design lifecycle will be critical to the space moving forward, and how companies take action around their own APIs.</p>
<p><strong>API Design Gallery</strong><br /> In my editor, I need a central location to store and manage all of my API designs. I&rsquo;m calling this a gallery, because I do not want it only to be a closed off repository of designs, I want to encourage collaboration, and even public sharing of common API design patterns. I see several key API editor features I will need in my API design gallery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - I need to be able to search for API designs, based upon their content, as well as other meta data I assign to my designs. I should be able to easily expose my search criteria, and assist potential API consumers in finding my API designs as well.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import</strong> - I should be able to import any API design from a local file, or provide a public URL and generate local copy of any API design. Many of my Api designs will be generated from an import of existing definition.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong> - I want the API editor of the future to track all versioning of my API designs. Much like managing the code around  my API, I need the interface definitions to be versioned, and the standard feature set for managing this process.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - I will be working on many API designs, will various stakeholders in the success of any API design. I need a set of features in my API design editor to help me manage multiple groups, and their access to my API designs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - Much like the Internet itself, I need to organize my APIs by domain. I have numerous domains which I manage different groups of API resources. Generally I publish all of my API portals to Github under a specific domain, or sub-domain&mdash;I would like this level of control in my API design editor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Github plays a central role in my API design lifecycle. I need my API design editor to help me manage everything, via public and private Github repository. Using the Github API, my API design editor should be able to store all relevant data on Github&mdash;seamlessly.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Diff</strong> - What are the differences between my API designs? I would like to understand the difference between each of my API resource types, and versions of each API designs. It might be nice if I could see the difference between my API designs, and other public APIs I might consider as competitors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - The majority of my API designs will be public, but this won&rsquo;t be the case with every designer. API designers should have the control over whether or not their API designs are public or private.</li>
</ul>
<p>My API design gallery will be the central place i work from. Once I reach a critical mass of designs, I will have many of the patterns I need to design, deploy and manage my APIs. It will be important for me to have access to import the best patterns from public repositories like API Commons. To evolve as an API designer, I need to easily create, store, and evolve my own API designs, while also being influenced by the best patterns available in the public domain.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Gallery </strong><br />Simple visualization can be an effective tool in helping demonstrate the value an API delivers. I want to be able to manage open, API driven visualizations, using platforms like D3.js. I need an arsenal of embeddable, API driven visualizations to help tell the store of the API resources I provide, give me a gallery to manage them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - I want to be able to search the meta data around the API embeddable tools I develop. I will have a wealth of graphs, charts, and more functional, JavaScript widgets I generate.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> - Give me a way to group, and organize my embeddable tools. I want to be able to organize, group and share my embeddable tools, not just for my needs, but potentially to the public as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, and being able to easily generate interactive visualizations, driven by API resources, that can be embedded anywhere is critical to my storytelling process. I will use embeddable tools to tell the story of my API, but my API consumers will also use these visualizations as part of their efforts, and hopefully develop their own as well.</p>
<p><strong>API Dictionary </strong><br />I need a common dictionary to work from when designing my APIs. I need to use consistent interface names, field names, parameters, headers, media types, and other definitions that will assist me in providing the best API experience possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - My dictionary should be available to me in any area of my API design editor, and in true IDE style, while I&rsquo;m designing. Search of my dictionary, will be essential to my API design work, but also to the groups that I work with.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Schema.org </strong>- There are plenty of existing patterns to follow when defining my APIs, and my editor should always assist me in adopting, and reusing any existing pattern I determine as relevant to my API design lifecycle, like <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dublin Core</strong> - How do I define the metadata surrounding my API designs? My editor should assist me to use common metadata patterns available like <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Media Types</strong> - The results of my API should conform to existing document representations, when possible. Being able to explore the existing media types available while designing my API would help me emulate existing patterns, rather than reinventing the wheel each time I design an API.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - My dictionary should be able to be driven by existing definitions, or allow me to import and and define my own vocabulary based upon my operations. I want to extend my dictionary to meet the unique demands of my API design lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want my API design process to be driven by a common dictionary that fits my unique needs, but borrows from the best patterns already available in the public space. We already emulate many of the common patterns we come across, we just don&rsquo;t have any common dictionary to work from, enforcing healthy design via my editor.</p>
<p><strong>An Editor For Just My Own API Design Process</strong> <br />This story has evolved over the last two weeks, as I spent time in San Francisco, discussing API design, then spending a great deal of time driving, and thinking about the API design lifecycle. This is all part of my research into the expanding world of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a>, which will result in a white paper soon, and my intent is to just shed some light on what might be some of the future <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of the API design space</a>.  My thoughts are very much based in my own selfish API design needs, but based upon what i&rsquo;m seeing in the growing API design space.</p>
<p><strong>An Editor For A Collective API Design Process </strong><br />With this story, I intend to help keep the API design process a collaborative, and when relevant a public affair. I want to ensure we work from existing patterns that are defined in the space, and as we iterative and evolve APIs, we collectively share our best patterns. You should not just be proud of your API designs, and willing to share publicly, you should demonstrate the due diligence that went into your design, attribute the patterns you used to contribute to your designs, and share back your own interpretation&mdash;encouraging re-use and sharing further downstream.</p>
<p><strong>What Features Would Be Part of Your Perfect API Design Editor</strong> <br />This is my vision around the future of API design, and what I&rsquo;d like to have in my editor&mdash;what is yours? What do you need as part of your API design process? Are API definitions part of the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in your API lifecycle? I&rsquo;d love to hear what tools and services you think should be made available, to assist us in designing our APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Swift-Federal-Data-SDK"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/labor.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is a common theme, that government of any kind, especially the US federal government is too slow when it comes to adopting new technology. While this may be a popular meme for anti-government crusaders, and is true in many areas of government, there are growing pockets of resistance across federal agencies, who are not just keeping up with the latest technology, but they are leading.</p>
<p>An example of this is out of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> (DOL), with their new <a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Swift-Federal-Data-SDK">Swift Federal Data SDK</a>, which provides a powerful SDK that allows you to work with multiple federal government data APIs, using the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift programming language</a>. Swift is only a couple weeks old, and DOL didn't miss a beat in getting a new SDK published on Github for developers to take advantage of.</p>
<p>In my opinion, we can no longer use the tired old meme, that government is just too slow to adopt new technology. There are an increasing number of examples out there that prove otherwise. In the future when you want to criticize an agency for being to slow in their adoption of tech, don&rsquo;t tell the same old tired story&mdash;point to examples like what DOL and <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> are up to, and incentivize the agencies to change in a positive way.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/multiple-types-of-apisjson-for-discovery/">Multiple Types of APIs.json For Discovery</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working through thoughts around a suggestion for future versions of&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json API discovery format</a>, and as I do with other things I&rsquo;m trying to make sense of, I wanted to write a blog post on API Evangelist. If you aren't familiar with the format, APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable JSON file that provides an overview and listing APIs available within a specific domain.</p>
<p><strong>Authoritative APIs.json</strong><br /> This is an APIs.json that is made available in the root of a domain, that is providing detail on an API that is managed within the same domain. This use case is for API providers to list the APIs that they offer publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Tribute APIs.json</strong><br /> There is an API you use, and want to see it indexed in an API search engine like APIs.io&mdash;so you create a tribute APIs.json. This APIs.json index is not done by the owner of the API, but by a fan, or outside contributor. Tributes will weave together the world of APIs, when providers do not have the time.</p>
<p><strong>Facade APIs.json</strong><br /> There is an API you use, but doesn&rsquo;t have exactly the interface you would want. Some resourceful API architects will be building facades to existing, external API resources. In the API economy you do not settle if an API isn't exactly what you need. The remix able nature of APIs allow for extending by designing facades that transform and extend existing API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Cache APIs.json</strong><br /> If I learned anything working in the federal government last year, it is that APIs can go away at any point. In the future there will be a need for cached versions of existing APIs, providing redundancy and access to some important data and content.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate APIs.json</strong><br /> In fast growing areas of the API economy, we are seeing API aggregation trends, with sectors like social, media, cloud, financial, analytics, and other areas that have matured, and users are depending on potentially multiple API platforms.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Derived APIs.json</strong><br /> I envision derived APis as just an evolution of tribute or facade, stating that I started with a certain API design, but have evolved it beyond what it once was. Not acknowledging where we got our API patterns is a darker side of the API space that needs to go away&mdash;let&rsquo;s be honest about where we learned our patterns and give a nod to these sources.</p>
<p>In the API economy, I think there will be multiple types of APIs that are deployed. As APIs proliferate, if the industry focuses on interoperability and reuse, there will be more types of APIs than the single API provider and APIs.json will help us keep tabs on this.</p>
<p>Not all API providers will have time, desire and the access to resources to publish their APIs.json, and the augmentation, replication and other possible derivatives that will emerge to organically expand on existing patterns.</p>
<p>Right now we are working on just stabilizing the latest release of APIs.json, so that people can get to work on publishing their own APIs.json. My goal with these thoughts is to just explore what is possible, and maybe, if successful some of these thoughts will be incorporated in future versions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, the cloud-based API integration services is raising the bar for the space by <a href="https://docs.apitools.com/2014/06/11/announcing-apitools-on-premise-with-open-source-release.html">introducing an open source, on-premise version of their API monitoring service</a>. APITools only launched this year, and because of consumer demands, they moved up the timeframe for open sourcing the platform, which was already on the roadmap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say after <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a> services and tooling, for testing, monitoring, and transforming API calls is one of the fastest growing segments of the API space.

<p>The world of API integration service and tooling is rapidly expanding, and only time will tell whether developers prefer running in the cloud, or on-premise, and what features they are looking for, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">something I've been documenting as I study what each of the companies offer</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect, that along with other API design, deployment, and management tools we'll need a mix of freemium, open tiers, on-premise, and enterprise API integration services and tooling, to meet the demands of this fast growing segment that overlaps with both providing and consuming APIs.</p>

        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently reviewed a new API initiative from the Food &amp; Drug Administration, called <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">OpenFDA</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">I gave a whole list of things that they did right when launching the API</a>, but one item that I thought was particularly interesting, was the actual interactive documentation for the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/">Drugs API endpoint</a>.</p>
<p>I talk a lot about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/21/interactive-api-documentation-with-swagger/">interactive documentation for APIs</a>, something that has become commonplace, and a building block that developers are starting to expect. What is different about the OpenFDA Drug API, is that the interactive documentation provides a visual interface for building API calls, going beyond the interactive, and often very form based documentation that is commonly seen in other developer areas.</p>
<p>Via the OpenFDA Drug API documentation you can actually build an API query by selecting from radio button values, which then updates the resulting URL query, some summary text, and generates a graph visualization of the resulting query. After building your filter, you can run the API query, and see the request and response, which is a common feature other interactive API documentation implementations.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-endpoint-visualization.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The addition of a visualization, that is driven by each endpoint is very interesting, and something I&rsquo;d like to see baked into the DNA of interactive API documentation.  Helping me build an API call, visualize and understand the value contained within an API has huge potential. Currently we have Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML generated interactive documentation solution, which are pretty similar&mdash;I&rsquo;d love to see more visualizations integrated into future interactive documentation implementations.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/16/api-craft-san-francisco-wrapup-for-june-2014/">speaking at API Craft SF on Thursday</a>, I kept the API talk going with <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">two days of API car talk at API Days San Francisco</a>.  While there is a lot of focus specifically on the car itself, there was also a lot of talk beyond the auto at API Days San Francisco, which was dubbed "Disrupting the Car Industry and Driver Experience with APIs".</p>
<p><strong>Public Transportation</strong><br /> In 2014, you just can&rsquo;t talk about disrupting the car industry, without including public transportation. With smart phones in our pockets, we need to get "smarter" about when and how we drive our cars, but also when should not drive our cars. Public transportation has to be part of the conversation when developers are looking to &ldquo;disrupt the car industry&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Bicycle Culture</strong><br /> I was pleased to also hear bicycles mentioned during several of the talks, and that developers should think about bicycle culture when developing apps. Many automobile owners are also bicyclists, and merging car and bike culture, expanding the opportunities to ride to work, large public events, or just for recreation, should be part of the consideration when developers are looking to &ldquo;disrupt the car industry&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Driving Car Skepticism</strong><br /> It is easy to be captivated by the work coming out of Google around the self-driving car, but I was also so surprised to hear several folks express skepticism around whether or not the self-driving car will live up to the hype, and whether or not we even need the self-driving car at all&mdash;with investment around public transportation being a preferred alternative.</p>
<p>When preparing for API Days, I expected the usual API crowd, educating people generally on the API opportunity, with a handful of high level car talks from people who have worked for the major car companies, or those working for aftermarket startups. This existed, but I was pleasantly surprised to see so much "out of the box" conversation as well.</p>
<p>Seeing that the conversation wasn't just focused on automobiles, but also the wider world of transportation at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days San Francisco,</a> made me very hopeful for the future of APIs, and how they will be applied within the automobile industry.</p>

<p>One interesting theme I heard at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days San Francisco</a>&nbsp;last week, was the concept of API reciprocity, or <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That</a>(IFTTT) moving into more niche areas. This edition of API Days was focused on "Disrupting the Car Industry and Driver Experience with APIs&rdquo;, and I heard several times, people saying, &ldquo;Its If This Then That for cars&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After If This Then That put an iconographic face on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/28/from-etl-to-api-reciprocity-looking-at-20-service-providers/">classic practice of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</a>, and focused on not traditional database and IT system, but API driven software as a service (SaaS), I saw over <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">30 other providers</a> follow in their footsteps. It is my mission to understand how these companies are evolving the ETL world, and write about it across the API Evangelist network.</p>
<p>In 2014, I think the concept has reached a maturity point, where reciprocity and interoperability between API driven platforms is being applied to niche areas. With the popularity of IFTTT and Zapier, in helping tech savvy users understand how they can take control over how data and content flow in our increasingly digital worlds, it makes total sense that startups would look to apply this successful pattern to niche areas like the automobile experience.</p>
<p>While Zapier, IFTTT and many other reciprocity providers are providing general purpose recipes for keeping your online world in sync, there is a growing number of focused providers, like <a href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyInbox</a> for email, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet Labs</a> for cloud computing, and <a href="http://roadrules.co/">RoadRules.io</a> which was present at API Days in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I think this new breed of API focused ETL startups, delivering niche recipes of automation, interoperability and reciprocity in our digital worlds, will continue to expand. You will hear more startup pitches, where the founder says, &ldquo;Its like If This Then That for X&rdquo;.</p>

<p>One of the mutiple requests to review APIs currently in my inbox, is from the camera platform <a href="https://www.dropcam.com">Dropcam</a>. Every email or tweet I get, asking me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/12/12/an-api-evangelist-review-of-your-api/">review an API</a>, I at least click in to see what is happening, looking for that good story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the API itself, can be good enough to be the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that I tell a story about, but most often it is about a specific approach the API provider takes. Regardless, I look throughr all aspects of an API, sign up for an account, play with endpoints, look through documentation and code, and terms of service&mdash;trying to find any angle for a compelling story.</p>
<p>When I clicked into <a href="https://www.dropcam.com/developers">Dropcam's developer area</a>, I can&rsquo;t sign up for the API, play with endpoints, review documentation and code, but I can look at terms of service! Dropcam asks that you apply to be part of their beta program, before you can look at or play with anything.</p>
<p>Dropcam assures me that their API is RESTful and uses its verbs, with all endpoints using HTTPS, and requests and responses in JSON. Dropcam uses oAuth for authentication and authorization, showing that all the proper technology and security building blocks are in place--thing is I need to see for myself.</p>
<p>I can understand putting an approval layer at the point someone wants to take their application public, but if someone owns a Dropcam, they should be able to signup and start hacking on their device and the supporting cloud infrastructure. With modern API management infrastructure you have the power to control what resources developers have access to, with identify the bad actors, without limiting who has access to learn about your platform.</p>
<p>Most importantly it prevents people like me from just reviewing the endpoints, documentation and the real meat of the Dropcam developer program. I&rsquo;m not building an application, I just want to write a story about what is possible, and without playing with it I can&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;m not like many other tech journalists who will take a press release and rewrite it&mdash;I want to play!!</p>
<p>So far, that is my review Dropcam. Sorry. ;-(</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/san-francisco/api-craft-sf-june-2014.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I participated in an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/API-Craft-San-Francisco/events/185583452/">API Craft meetup this last Thursday</a>, hosted by 3Scale in San Francisco. The gathering included Uri Sarid(<a href="https://twitter.com/usarid">@usarid</a>)&nbsp;representing <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, Jakub Nesetril(<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>)&nbsp;on behalf of <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, Tony Tam(<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) with his <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, and myself, discussing the fast growing world of API design.</p>
<p>While there are other formats for defining APIs, API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger represent the leading API definition formats, tools, and services in the space right now. I assumed we'd be talking about each of the API definition formats, but the conversation was more about how we got here, and the motivations behind generating API descriptions.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">numerous reasons why API providers would want to generate API designs</a>, ranging from the ability to mock interfaces, to generating interactive documentation that helps onboard API consumers. Having this conversation is important, as not all API providers are generating API definitions, and many of those who do, do not understand all the benefits of have machine readable API definitions.</p>
<p>Thank you to Emmanuel Paraskakis(<a href="https://twitter.com/manp">@manp</a>)&nbsp;who organized the meet up, <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> for hosting and sponsoring the conversation, the beer (which included Stone IPA w00t!), and making it possible so the leaders in the space can discuss the increasingly relevant topic of API design, and share the insight with the San Francisco API audience.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/15/netflix-finally-shutters-support-for-public-api/">Netflix Finally Shutters Support For Public API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Netflix officially announced they will be ending support for their public API. Its no surprise, as they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">announced early in 2013 that they would longer accept new registrations for the API</a>.</p>
<p>While I think that Netflix could have put more resources into their API, and fought harder to make their public API a success, I still consider Netflix to be one of API pioneers that we can learn from when crafting our own API strategy.</p>
<p>While the public Netflix API was not a success, the internal and partner API strategy at Netflix was a success. APIs have allowed the company to scale into the cloud, grow internationally, and expand to sever over 1000 devices via their trusted partner network.</p>
<p>In addition to the internal API success at Netflix, they have been amazing at sharing their knowledge and experience with the wider API community via their blog, conferences like <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, and in books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, available on O'Reilly Publishing, written by Daniel Jacobsen, Greg Brail and Dan Woods.</p>
<p>Another positive byproduct of Netflix API operation, is that the company has been prolific in open sourcing the technology that goes into the API stack. When you visit the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix">Netflix Github account</a>, you will find a wealth of open tooling that they have worked hard on, and opened up for public use.</p>
<p>API success varies widely from company to company, sector to sector, and it doesn't always look like you think it will&mdash;this is part of the API experience. Just because Netflix doesn't reflect one vision of API success that open developers believed in, it doesn't mean Netflix as a whole was an API failure. There are plenty of lessons to learn from their public API failure, as well as their internal API success.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-recycling.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still extracting great examples of API design, deployment, and management, that other API providers can follow, from recent API projects out of our federal government, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">OpenFDA out of the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).</a></p>
<p>This particular post is about the approach to establishing a feedback loop with consumers of the OpenFDA API. If you visit the<a href="https://open.fda.gov/"> OpenFDA portal,</a>&nbsp;you will find that API consumers can seek help via three self-service channels:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://github.com/FDA">GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openfda">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get your question answered by searching through existing Github, StackExchange, and Twitter conversations, you have three ways to directly ask the OpenFDA team questions:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=openFDA">StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FDA">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>What is notable (thanks Gray Brooks), is that OpenFDA uses existing services to establish the feedback loop with API consumers&mdash;meaning they use Github, StackExchange, and Twitter rather than rolling their own tool. OpenFDA understands that there are existing conversation that are already occurring on StackExchange, and developers are used to going here to find the answers they need.</p>
<p>Additionally by stimulating the conversation on StackExchange and Twitter you are generating valuable social media and SEO exhaust that will help new consumers, potentially learn about the OpenFDA API, and how it is being used by developers.  This type of feedback loop doesn&rsquo;t just provide support for community, it establishes itself as the heartbeat of your API, showing that someone is home, and is there to support and listen.</p>
<p>The best part is that using Twitter, StackExchange, and Github are free for public conversations, and take almost no time to setup. OpenFDA directly links to the form for asking a question on StackExchange, they don&rsquo;t for Github, but easily could. They also directly link to #OpenFDA hashtag to join existing conversations on StackExchange and Twitter, which is a pretty slick way to weave external searches into your API feedback loop.</p>
<p>Lots of good patterns to follow, from the leading groups deploying APIs in the US federal government.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/09/the-edx-api/">The edX API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.edx.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/edx/edx-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This post should tell you about how behind I am in my storytelling&mdash;this story is from an <a href="/admin/blog/google">event I attended in Arlington TX</a>, on April 30th, and May 1st. While in Arlington, I spoke to a group of professionals who were crafting an online data &amp; analytics course. A couple of the participants were from edX, the online course platform partnership between MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley and other universities.</p>
<p>Over the course of two days, I had a cance ask the question, where was the edX API? Seemed like an obvious question, to which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/watsonemily">Emily Watson</a>, the program manager at edX, responded, &ldquo;Its on our roadmap&rdquo;!  An answer I get from many online companies, but Emily pulled up their roadmap on the wiki, and <a href="https://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OPENPROD/Open+edX+Public+Product+Roadmap">indeed it was on their roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>I told Emily, I&rsquo;d review the edX platform, and provide some feedback, that they could incorporate into their strategy. This one is easy, and is my basic feedback for any company with an online website and/or application&mdash;you make everything currently available on your site or application, available via an API. A quick glance at edX, these would be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Courses</strong> - The 175+ courses available on edX, should also be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
<li><strong>Faculty &amp; Staff </strong>- The 400+ faculty and staff involved in producing edX courses should be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
<li><strong>Schools &amp; Partners</strong>- All edX partners should be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
</ul>
<p>You start with the low hanging fruit, by establishing three, simply designed web APIs for those already, publicly available resources, then move on to providing the essential business building blocks for any API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Dedicated API Portal -</strong> Simple, dedicated portal for edX API integrations, that isn&rsquo;t just for developers. It should be easy enough for anyone to learn about the edX API, without too much technical detail front and center.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Landing Page -</strong> The home page of the edX API portal should be dead simple, explaining what the API does, providing easy one click access to get to whatever any API, or potential API consumer will need.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration </strong>- The edX API needs to be accessible 24/7, and developers should be able to register without approval, and at least get minimum access to the system to begin playing with resources, even if it takes approval to get higher levels of access. Modern <a href="https://bitly.com/13esk6Q+">API management solutions like 3Scale</a> work very well in managing this layer of access, and service composition.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation </strong>- The standard for all APIs in 2014 is to provide interactive documentation, making learning about an API, a hands on experience. There are some common approaches to defining an API using machine readable formats like <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger</a>, which will automatically generate interactive documentation for consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples &amp; Libraries -</strong> Developers need all the help they can in getting up and running with an API, and right after interactive API documentation, code libraries and samples are critical to onboarding API consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Blog W/ RSS </strong>- An active blog, with RSS for syndication provides the necessary stories and resulting SEO that helps communicate the value an API offers, and keeps new and existing consumers in tune with API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Presence - </strong>An active Twitter presence is common place for leading API platforms, and edX will need an active Twitter account to support its other communications, and support operations.</li>
<li><strong>Support Ticket System </strong>- An easy to use, trackable support system for the edX API platform will be essential to establishing a feedback loop with API consumers. Github issue management works very well, for an out of the box, API support ticket system for all public APis.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion Forum -</strong> Discussion forums are common place in APIs, and provide potential indirect, community support, that can help new and existing API consumers find what they are looking for. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to a local discussion forum, there are SaaS solutions, as well as existing developer driven communities like Stack Overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next make sure and cover the basic political building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> Provide simple, liberal terms of service that incentivize integrations and development.</li>
<li><strong>Content Licensing -</strong> Make sure all licensing for any content is explained front and center.</li>
<li><strong>Code Licensing -</strong> Clearly license all client side code samples, libraries and event potentially server side code for the API.</li>
<li><strong>API Licensing -</strong> Make sure the API definition is openly licensed, so that it can be re-used, re-mixed in many ways--consider putting into <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Branding Requirements -</strong> Provide clear direction when it comes to branding requirements around API integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong> Help developers understand what rate limits are in place to keep system stable, and what ways there are to get more access.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing -</strong> Are there any costs for API access? If there are, make sure and clearly explain what is free, and at what points do resources cost.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Tiers -</strong> Establish multiple layers of API access, allowing trusted partners to achieve higher rate limits, and write access to resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>That should do it! ;-) As you can see the APIs themselves are just the starting point. It is too late for edX to be API-first, which would have been much easier, but you have just get your basic APIs, the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">supporting business and political building blocks</a>, and get down to the hard work of evangelizing, managing, and iterating on the edX API. The learning doesn't start until you have the API up, being consumed, and have engage users who are providing feedback for the roadmap.</p>
<p>Once a basic edX API is up and running, and edX has some experience under their belt in managing the API community, then some thought can be put into creating a read / write API, allowing access to student information via oAuth, as well as letting trusted partners publish content, and student data into the system.  A read / write system could be done in a single release, but since edX is a little behind curve on getting API up, I recommend cutting teeth on a read only system for version 1.0.</p>
<p>In reality, this advice for designing, deploying, managing, and evangelizing an API applies to any company with an online presence. It is a pretty proven formula extracted from watching multiple API leaders like Twitter, Google and Amazon. In this particular scenario, edX needs to get on the ball--it is difficult for me to imagine being an online education platform that operates between multiple universities in 2014, and not having an active API. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>My friends over at Social Health Insights, <a href="http://socialhealthinsights.com/2014/06/openfda-api-launch-success/">wrote about their experience being one of the beta users for the new OpenFDA API</a>, and what they thought contributed to the success of the API launch from the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>What I found interesting about their post, is that contributing factors were not technical:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Getting Feedback Early -</strong> The openFDA team solicited feedback early on in the API development process from end users and consumers of the API. This feedback was listened to and ultimately helped shape a very nice API at launch.</li>
<li><strong>Being Collaborative - </strong>If you are going to do #1 then you must be willing to be collaborative. From the get-go, the openFDA team collaborated with a number of stakeholders and was open all the feedback that streamed in. This ultimately resulted in a great product at release. Beyond the initial collaboration they are still listening and we bet they will be open to the feedback that comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Being Responsive -</strong> Send a tweet or message to the team and see what you get. You will be shocked at how fast they get back with you to answer your question. We saw questions over Twitter being answered by the community and openFDA team members within minutes (pretty cool)!</li>
<li><strong>Explaining Use Cases Well -</strong> Go to the openFDA website and you will see several queries tied to real wold questions about the data exposed by the new adverse event API. This helps consumers understand the possibilities and content of the API quicker and simpler. Beyond this, they solicited private beta testers to build solutions on top of the API which also provided additional sample use cases of solutions that could be created using the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am present on the backchannel for the OpenFDA rollout, so I saw some of the back and forth on the technical aspects of OpenFDA, and there was definitely lots of tech talk, but ultimately the success depended on providing use cases, getting early feedback, while also being collaborative and responsive.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said a thousand times before, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how technically perfect your API is, without the business and politics of your API dialed in, you will fumble the ball. Always keep in mind, that the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">reasons why this whole API thing is working</a>, goes well beyond just the technology.</p>
