{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im always on the lookout for innovative data sets and examples of APIs that provide value in ever-day life.APIs are often a very geeky thing, and Im always trying to find examples of APIs that make sense to my mainstream audience, and help me explain what APIs are, and the value they can deliver.I found a story from John Mertens of Code for America, about building a Famers Market API, which I think tells a great story about how anyone with a need, can take a valuable dataset and make it available using an API.Like many of us Mertens loves getting his fruit and vegetables from a local Farmers Market.He was new to the San Francisco area and was unsure how to find the local Farmers Market.</p>
