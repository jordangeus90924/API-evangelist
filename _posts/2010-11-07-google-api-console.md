{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google released some updates to its API ecosystem the other day with a new release of Google Custom Search API.Google also rewrote a bunch of API documentation and more importantly released an API console for managing your Google APIs.I cant tell you how many Google APIs there are, let alone how many of them I use for personal or business.I think Google is having trouble keep track of the API sprawl itself, and is moving to provide its users with tools to manage their API usage confidently.The Google API Console allows you to create API Projects and activate different Google APIs underneath these projects.</p>
