        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/30/the-openapi-30.gui/">The OpenAPI 3.0 GUI</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openapi-gui/openapi-gui-dashboard.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I have been editing my OpenAPI definitions manually for some time now, as I just haven’t found a GUI editor that works well with my workflow. Swagger editor really isn’t a GUI solution, and while I enjoy services like Stoplight.io, APIMATIC, and others, I’m very picky about what I adopt within my world. One aspect of this is that I’ve been holding out for a solution that I can run 100% on Github using Github Pages. I’ve delusionally thought that someday I would craft a slick JavaScript solution that I could run using only Github Pages, but in reality I’ve never had the time to pull together. So, I just kept manually editing my OpenAPI definitions on the desktop using Atom, and publish to Github as I needed.</p>

<p>Well, now I can stop being so dumb, because my friend Mike Ralphson (<a href="https://twitter.com/permittedsoc">@permittedsoc</a>) has created <a href="https://github.com/Mermade/openapi-gui">my new favorite OpenAPI GUI</a>, that is OpenAPI 3.0 compliant by default. As Mike defines it, “OpenAPI-GUI is a GUI for creating and editing OpenAPI version 3.0.x JSON/YAML definitions. In its current form it is most useful as a tool for starting off and editing simple OpenAPI definitions. Imported OpenAPI 2.0 definitions are automatically converted to v3.0.”</p>

<p>He provides a pretty simple way to get up and running with OpenAPI GUI because, “OpenAPI-GUI runs entirely client-side using a number of Javascript frameworks including Vue.JS, jQuery and Bulma for CSS. To get the app up and running just browse to <a href="https://mermade.github.io/openapi-gui/">the live version on GitHub pages</a>, deploy a clone to GitHub pages, deploy to Heroku using the button below, or clone the repo and point a browser at index.html or host it yourself - couldn’t be simpler.” – “You only need to npm install the Node.js modules if you wish to use the openapi-gui embedded web server (i.e. not if you are running your own web-server), otherwise they are only there for PaaS deployments.”</p>

<p><strong>Portable, Forkable API Design GUI</strong>
The forkability of OpenAPI GUI is what attracts me to it. The client-side JavaScript approach makes it portable and forkable, allowing it to run wherever it is needed. The ability to quickly publish using Github Pages, or other static environment, makes it attractive. I’d like to work on a one click way for deploying locally, so I could make available to remote microservices teams to use locally to manage their OpenAPI definitions. I think it is important to have local, as well as cloud-based API design GUI locations, with more investment in the cloud-base solutions being more shared, possessing a team component, as well as a governance layer. However, I really like the thought of each OpenAPI having its own default editor, and you edit the definition within the repo it is located. I could see two editions of OpenAPI GUI, the isolated edition, and a more distributed team and definition approach. IDK, just thinking out loud.</p>

<p><strong>Setting the OpenAPI 3.0 Stage</strong>
The next thing I love about OpenAPI GUI is that it is all about OpenAPI 3.0, which I just haven’t had the time to fully migrate to. It has the automatic conversion of OpenAPI definitions, and gives you all the GUI elements you need to manage the robust features present in 3.0 of the OpenAPI specification. I’m itching to get ALL of my API definitions migrated from 2.0 to 3.0. The modular and reusable nature of OpenAPI 3.0, enabled by OpenAPI GUI is a formula for a rich API design experience. There are a lot of features built into the expand and collapse GUI, which I could see becoming pretty useful once you get the hang of working in there. Adding, duplicating, copying, and reusing your way to a powerful, API-first way of getting things done. I like.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing In The Magic With Wizards</strong>
Ok, now I’m gonna go all road map on you Mike. You know you don’t have to listen to everything I ask for, but cherry pick the things that make sense. I see what you are doing in the wizard section. I like it. I want a wizard marketplace. Go all Harry Potter and shit. Create a plugin framework and schema so we can all create OpenAPI driven wizards that do amazing things, and users can plugin and remove as they desire. Require each plug to be its own repo, which can be connected and disconnected easily via the wizards tab. I’d even consider opening up the ability to link to wizards from other locations in the editor, and via the navigation. Then we are talking about paid wizards. You know, of the API validation varietal. Free validations, and then more advanced paid validations. ($$)</p>

<p><strong>Branding And Navigation Customization</strong>
I would love to be able name, organize, and add my own buttons. ;-) Let’s add a page that allows for managing the navigation bars, and even the icons that show within the page. I know it would be a lot of work, but a great thing to have in the road map. You could easily turn on the ability to add logo, change color palette, and some other basics that allows companies to easily brand it, and make it their space. Don’t get me wrong. It looks great now. It is clean, simple, uncluttered. I’ve just seen enough re-skinned Swagger UI and editors to know that people are going to want to mod the hell out of their GUI API design tooling. Oh yeah, what about drag and drop–I’d like to reorder by paths. ;-) Ok, I’ll shut up now.</p>

<p><strong>OpenAPI GUI In A Microservices World</strong>
As I said before, I like the idea of one editor == one OpenAPI. Something that can be isolated within the repo of a service. Don’t make things too complicate and busy. In my API design editor I want to be able to focus on the task at hand. I don’t want to be distracted by other services. I’d like this GUI to be the self-container editor accessible via the Jekyll, Github Pages layer for each of my microservices. Imagine a slightly altered API design experience for each service. I could have the workspace configurable and personalized for exactly what I need to deliver a specific service. I would have a base API design editor for jumpstarting a new service, but I’d like to be able to make the OpenAPI GUI fit each service like a glove, even making the About tab a README for the service, rather than for the editor–making it a microservice dashboard landing page for each one of my services.</p>

<p><strong>Making API Design a Shareable Team Sport</strong>
Ok, contradicting my anti-social, microservices view of things. I want the OpenAPI GUI to be a shareable team environment. Where each team member possesses their own GUI, and the world comes to them. I want a shared catalog of OpenAPI definitions. I want to be able to discover widely, and checkout or subscribe to within my OpenAPI GUI. I want all the reusable components to have a sharing layer, allowing me to share my components, work with the shared components of other developers, and work from a central repository of components. I want a discovery layer across the users, environments, components, OpenAPI definitions, and wizards. I want to be able to load my API design editor with all of the things I need to deliver consistent API design at scale. I want to be able to reuse the healthiest patterns in use across teams, and possibly lead by helping define, and refine what reusable resources are available for development, staging, and production environments.</p>

<p><strong>Github, Gitlab, or BitBucket As A Backend For The OpenAPI GUI</strong>
I want to run on Github, Gitlab, or BitBucket environments, as a static site–no backend. Everything backend should be an API, and added as part of the wizard plugin (aka magic) environment. I want the OpenAPI, components, and any other artifacts to live as JSON or YAML within a Github, Gitlab, or BitBucket repository. If it is an isolated deployment, everything is self-contained within a single repository. If it is a distributed deployment, then you can subscribe to shared environments, catalogs, components, and wizards via many organizations and repositories. This is the first modification I’m going to do to my version, instead of the save button saving to the vue.js store, I’m going to have it write to Github using the Github API. I’m going to add a Github OAuth icon, which will give me a token, and then just read / write to the underlying Github repository. I’m going to begin with an isolated version, but then expand to search, discovery, read and write to many different Github repositories across the organizations I operate across.</p>

<p><strong>Annotation And Discussion Throughout</strong>
While OpenAPI GUI is a full featured, and potentially busy environment, I’d like to be able to annotate, share, and discuss within the API design environment. I’d like to be able to create Github issues at the path level, and establish conversations about the design of an API. I’d like to be able to discuss paths, schema, tags, and security elements as individual threads. Providing a conversational layer within the GUI, but one that spans many different Github repositories, organizations, and users. Adding to the coupling with the underlying repository. Baking a conversational layer into the GUI, but also into the API design process in a way that provides a history of the design lifecycle of any particular service. Continuing to make API design a team sport, and allowing teams to work together, rather than in isolation.</p>

<p><strong>API Governance Across Distributed OpenAPI GUIs</strong>
With everything stored on Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, and shareable across teams using organizations and repositories, I can envision some pretty interesting API governance possibilities. I can envision a distributed API catalog coming into focus. Indexing and aggregating all services, their definitions, and conversations aggregated across teams. You can see the seeds for this under the wizard tab with validation, visualization, and other extensions. I can see there being an API design governance framework present, where all API definitions have to meet certain number of validations before they can move forward. I can envision a whole suite of free and premium governance services present in a distributed OpenAPI GUI environment. With an underlying Github, BitBucket, and Gitlab base, and the OpenAPI GUI environment, you have the makings for some pretty sweet API governance possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Lot’s Of Potential With OpenAPI GUI</strong>
I’ll pause there. I have a lot of other ideas for the API design editor. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">I’ve been thinking about this stuff for a long time</a>. I’m stoked to adopt what you’ve built Mike. It’s got a lot of potential, and a nice clean start. I’ll begin to put to use immediately across my API Evangelist, API Stack, and other API consulting work. With several different deployments, I will have a lot more feedback. It’s an interesting leap forward in the API design tooling conversation, building on what is already going on with API service providers, and some of the other API design tooling like Apicurio, and publishing the API design conversation forward. I’m looking forward to baking OpenAPI GUI into operations a little more–it is lightweight, open source, and extensible enough to get me pretty excited about the possibilities.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/G0520270_blue_circuit.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>There is a lot of talk of an API design first way of doing things when it comes to delivering microservices. I’m seeing a lot of organizations make significant strides towards truly decoupling how they deliver the APIs they depend on, and continue to streamline their API lifecycle, as well as governance. However, if you are down in the weeds, doing this work at scale, you know how truly hard it is to actualy get everything working in concert across many different teams. While I feel like I have many of the answers, actually achieving this reality, and assembling the right tools and services for the job is much harder then it is in theory.</p>

<p>There was <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/api-craft/H3tpTPJnoZQ">a question posted on API Craft recently that I think gets at the challenges we all face</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>We plan to use Open API 3 specification for designing API’s that are required to build our enterprise web application. These API’s are being developed to integrate the backend with frontend. They are initially planned to be internal/private. To roll out an API First strategy across multiple teams (~ 30) in our organization we want to recommend and centrally deploy a standard set of tools that could be used by teams to design and document API’s.</em><br /><br />
<em>I am new to the swagger tool set. I understand that there is a swagger-editor tool that can help in API design while swagger-ui could help in API documentation. Trying them I realized a few problems</em><br /><br />
<em>1. How would teams save their API’s centrally on a server? Swagger editor does not provide a way to centrally store them.</em><br />
<em>2. How can we get a directory look up that displays all the designed API’s?</em><br />
<em>3. How can we integrate the API design and API documentation tool?</em><br />
<em>4. How can the API specifications be linked with the implementation (java) to keep them up-to-date?</em><br />
<em>5. How do we show API dependencies when one api uses the other one?</em><br /><br />
<em>We basically need to think about the end-to-end work-flow that helps teams in their SDLC to design API’s. For the start I am trying to see what can we achieve with free tools. Can someone share their thoughts based on their experience?</em>
This reflects what I’m hearing from the numerous projects I’m consulting with. Some of the OpenAPI (Swagger) related questions can be addressed using Github, but the code integration, dependency, and other aspects of this question are much harder to answer, let alone solve with a single tool. Each team has their existing workflows, pipelines, and software delivery processes in place, so helping articulate how you should do this at scale, gets pretty difficult very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Github, Gitlab, or BitBucket At Core</strong>
The first place you want to start is with Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket at the core. If you aren’t managing your services, and supporting API definitions as individual repositories within a version control system, achieving this at scale will be difficult. These software development platforms are where your APIs should begin, live and evolve, as well as experience their end of life. Making not just the code accessible throughout the lifecycle, but also the API definitions and other artifacts that are essential throughout the API lifecycle.</p>

<p><strong>Full API Lifecycle Service Providers</strong>
There are a handful of API service providers out there who will help you get pretty far down this road. Evolving towards being what I consider to be a full lifecycle API service provider. Not just helping you with design, or any other individual stop along the API lifecycle, and emerging to help you with as much of what you’ll need to get the job done. Here are just a handful of the leading ones out there that I track on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><strong>Postman</strong></a> - Focusing on the client, but bringing in a full stack of lifecycle development tools to support.</li>
  <li><a href="https://stoplight.io/"><strong>Stoplight</strong></a> - Beginning with API design, but then expanding quickly to help you manage and govern the lifecycle.</li>
  <li><a href="https://apimatic.io/"><strong>APIMATIC</strong></a> - Emphasis on quality SDK generation, but approach life cycle deployment as a pipeline.</li>
  <li><a href="https://swagger.io/"><strong>Swagger</strong></a> - Born out of the API definition, but quickly introducing other lifecycle solutions as part of the package.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can’t believe I’m talking about Swagger, but I’ll vent about that in another post. Anyways, these are what I’d consider to be the leading API lifecycle development solutions out there. They aren’t going to get you all the way towards everything listed above, but they will get you pretty far down the road. Another thing to note is that they ALL support OpenAPI definitions, which means you can actually use several of the providers, as long as your central truth is an OpenAPI available on a Github repository.</p>

<p>No single one of these services will address the questions posted above, but collectively they could. It shows how fragmented services in the space are, and how many different interpretations of the API lifecycle there are. However, it also shows the importance of an API definition-driven approach to the lifecycle, and how using OpenAPI and Postman Collections can help bridge our usage of multiple API service providers to get the job done. Next, I’ll work on a post outlining some of the open source tooling I’d suggest to help solve some of these problems, and then work to connect the dots more on how you could actually do this in practice on the ground within your organization.</p>

<p>I’m taking time to showcase any API I come across who have published their OpenAPI definitions to Github like <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/01/new-york-times-manages-their-openapi-using-github/">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/14/boxs-seamless-approach-to-api-documentation/">Box</a>, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/02/the-github-repo-stripe-users-to-manage-their-openapi/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/20/sendgrid-managing-their-openapi-using-github/">SendGrid</a>, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/26/nexmo-manages-their-openapi-30-definition-using-github/">Nexmo</a>, and others have. I’m also taking the time to publish stories showcasing any API provider who similarly publish Postman Collections as part of their API documentation. Next up on my list is <a href="https://developers.triathlon.org/docs/using-postman-to-explore-the-triathlon-api">the Triathlon API</a>, who provides a pretty sophisticated API stack for managing triathlons around the world, complete with a list of Postman Collections for exploring and getting up and running with their API.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/03/20/breaking-down-your-postman-api-collections-into-meaningful-units-of-compute/">Much like Okta, which I wrote about last week</a>, the <a href="https://developers.triathlon.org/docs/using-postman-to-explore-the-triathlon-api">Triathlon API has broken their Postman Collections into individual service collections</a>, and provides a nice list of them for easy access. Making it quick and easy to get up and running making calls to the API. Something that ALL API providers should be doing. Sorry, but Postman Collections should be a default part of your API documentation, just like OpenAPI definition should be as the driver of your interactive API docs, and the rest of your API lifecycle.</p>

<p>Every provider should be maintaining their OpenAPI definitions, as well as Postman Collections on Github, and baking them into their API documentation. Your OpenAPI should be the central truth for your API operations, and then you can easily import it, and generate Postman Collections as you design, test, and evolve your API using the Postman development suite. I know there are many API providers who haven’t caught up to this approach to delivering API resources, but it is something they need to tune into, and make the necessary shift in how you are delivering your resources.</p>

<p>In addition to regular stories like this on the blog, you will find me reaching out to individual API providers asking if they have an OpenAPI and / or Postman Collections. I’m personally invested in getting API providers to adopt their API definition formats. I want to see their APIs present in <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack work</a>, as well as other API discovery projects I’m contributing to like Streamdata.io, Postman Network, APIs.Guru, and others. Making sure your APIs are discovered, and making sure you are getting out of the way of your developers by baking API definitions into your API operations–it is just what you do in 2018.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2018/03/ten-years-of-aws-compartimentalization.html">Werner Vogels shared a great story looking back at 10 years of compartmentalization at AWS</a>, where he talks about the impact Amazon has made on the landscape by allowing for the deployment of resources into different cloud regions, zones, and jurisdictions. I agree with him regarding the significant impact this has had on how we deliver infrastructure, and honestly isn’t something that gets as much recognition and discussion as it should. I think this is partly due to the fact that many companies, organizations, institutions, and governments are still making their way to the cloud, and aren’t far enough in their journeys to be able to sufficiently take advantage of the different availability zones.</p>

<p>In Werner’s piece he focuses on the availability, scalability, and redundancy benefits of operating in different zones. Which I think gets at the technical benefits of this benefit of operating infrastructure in the cloud, but there are also significant business, and even political considerations at play here. As the web matures, the business and political implications of being able to operate precisely within a specific region, zone, and jurisdiction is becoming increasingly important. Sure, you want your API infrastructure to be reliable, redundant, and failover when there has been an outage in a specific region, but increasingly clients are asking for APIs to be delivered close to where business occurs, and regulatory bodies are beginning to mandate that digital business gets done within specific borders as well.</p>

<p>Regions have become a top level priority for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/">Azure</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/">Google</a>. Clearly, they are also becoming a top level priority for their customers who operate within their clouds. It is one of those things I notice evolving across the technology landscape and have felt the need to pay attention to more as I see more activity and chatter. I’ve begun documenting which regions each of the cloud providers are operating in, and have been increasing the number of stories I’m writing about the potential for API providers, as well as API service providers. So it was good to see Werner reflecting on the significant role regions have played in the evolution of the cloud, and backing up what I’m already feeling and seeing across the sector.</p>

<p>While Werner focused on the technical benefits, I think the political, legal, and regulatory benefits will soon dwarf the technical ones. While the web has enjoyed a borderless existence for the last 25 years, I think we are going to start seeing things change in the next decade. Making cloud regions more about maintaining control over your countries digital assets, how you generate tax revenue, and defend the critical digital infrastructure of your nation from your enemies. The cloud providers who are empowering companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to securely, but flexibly operate in multiple regions are going to be in a good position. Similarly, the API providers, and service providers who behave in a similar way, delivering API resources in a multi-cloud way, are going to emerge as the strongest players in the API economy.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apis-json-home-page-2018.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I know many folks in the API sector don’t know about <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json</a>, and if they do they often think it is yet another API definition format, competing wit OpenAPI, Postman Collections, and others. So, I want to take a moment to share the vision again, and maybe convert one or two more folks to the possibilities around having a machine readable format for the entire operations. This is where APIs.json elevates the conversation, is it isn’t just about defining an API, it is about defining API operations, looking to make things more discoverable, and executable by default.</p>

<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json</a> is a JSON format, as the name implies, but admittedly a bad name, as I’ve already started created APIs.yaml editions, which defines the entire API operations, not just any single API. It starts with the basics of the API providers, with: name, description, image, tags, created, and modified. Then it has a collection for defining one or many actual APIs. Repeating the need for a name, description, image, and tags, but this time for each API–admittedly this might be redundant in many cases. Each API also has a humanURL and baseURL for each API, providing two key links that developers will need. After that, we start getting to the meat of APIs.json, with the properties collection.</p>

<p>The properties collection is an array of URLs and types, which can point to many different building blocks of API operations. Common elements that should be present with every API provider like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - URL to the API documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Plans &amp; Pricing</strong> - Landing page for the API tiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - Where do you find the legal department.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign Up</strong> - How do you sign up for an API.</li>
</ul>

<p>These elements are often times meant for humans, but the goal of APIs.json is to also provide machine readable URLs of common building blocks, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a></strong> - Where do you find the OpenAPI definition?</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collections/creating_collections">Postman Collection</a></strong> - Is there a Postman Collection available?</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a></strong> - What is the licensing for the API?</li>
</ul>

<p>APIs.json isn’t meant to compete with these existing API definition formats, it is designed to index them. It is meant to provide a complete index of the human, and machine readable components required to operate an API platform. The properties collection is meant to index all of these, but also work to move the human elements towards being more machine readable, as we’ve seen happen with documentation and OpenAPI, as well as what we achieved with licensing and <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>. Ultimately we’d like to see all the essential aspects of API integration become machine readable–elements like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pricing</strong> - A machine readable breakdown of pricing, tiers, and limits.</li>
  <li><strong>Terms of Services</strong> - Breaking down TOS so they can be interpreted by a machine.</li>
  <li><strong>Signup</strong> - Making signup for APIs something that is automated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, this will all take a significant amount of work, just like indexing APIs, and making them more discoverable, but it has to be done. Currently, <a href="http://theapistack.com/">I’m just looking to keep APIs.json, OpenAPI, and Postman Collection definitions up to date across thousands of Github repositories included in my API Stack work</a>. As this work stabilizes, and continues to come into focus, I’ll be pushing forward with better defining signup and pricing across API providers, and then get to work on terms of service. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/28/what-we-need-to-be-machine-readable-at-api-run-time/">We need all of these elements of API operations to become machine readable and executable as part of the discovery process</a>, otherwise this shit will never scale.</p>

<p>That is a fresh look at the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json</a> vision. There is more to it than just indexing API operations and making them more discoverable. I am also using to build different topical, and industry level collections, which you can reference as part of the APIs.json includes property. But, we’ll save that for another story. In the mean time, I’m going to get back to work profiling APIs using APIsjson, and publishing them to my API Stack organization(s), and syndicating them out to other partners like APIs.io, Streamdata.io, and Postman Network. If you’d like to know more about APIs.json, feel free to reach out, and I’ll make sure and work on more stories around how I am using the API discovery format.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-bird-blue-on-white.png" width="30%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>It’s been a long, long road for Twitter when it comes to realizing the importance of having a plan when it comes to their API management strategy. Aside from monetizing the firehose through former parter, and now acquired solution Gnip, Twitter has never had any sort of plan when it came to providing access tiers for their API. I try to revisit the Twitter developer portal a couple times a year, but I’m going to have to increase the number of visits as there seems to be more rapid shifts towards getting control over their API management layer in recent months.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/pricing">API plan matrix that has emerged as part of Twitter’s pricing page</a> provides a view of the unfolding plan for the social media platform.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/pricing"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-pricing-plan.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<p>The Twitter API plan doesn’t show the entire scope, as it doesn’t cover the streaming layer of the API, but it does provide an important first step towards bringing coherence to how developers can access the API, and pay for premium levels of access. This conversation isn’t just about Twitter making money or Twitter charging for access to our data, this is about Twitter taking control over who has access to our data, and the platform. It is up to Twitter whether or not they focus on revenue, or the needs of end-users, something that we will only realize as their API plan continues to unfold.</p>

<p>This is the layer where Twitter will begin to reign in bots, and other malicious activity, but it is something that won’t be easy, and undoubtedly cause a lot of pain and frustration for developers, and end-users. It is something they should have done a long time ago, but as we are seeing play out with Facebook, to incentivize the growth their investors and shareholders desired, these platform needed to look the other way at the API management layer. To achieve the eyeballs, clicks, and engagements they desired, it required them to ignore harassment, bots, and other forms of abuse that occurs. Twitter is different than Facebook, because it is primarily a public platform, but the lack of a plan at the API management layer, has had a similar impact.</p>

<p>I’ll keep an eye on where Twitter is headed with all of this. While I’m concerned for how they’ll prioritize the needs of end-users and developers, It makes me happy to see them putting a plan in place at the API management level. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter has operated for too long without a plan</a>, and without a clear path for serious applications built on the platform to grow and evolve. I’ll keep an eye out for continued examples of Twitter restricting access to our own data, and call them out when they lean to heavily towards revenue generation. While it is a decade too late, I have to commend them for putting their API plan in place, and begin the messy work of reigning in API access to the platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/43_113_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-5.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve pushed my Github driven, Jekyll fueled, application delivery process to a new levels the last couple of weeks. I’ve been investing more cycles into <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack work</a>, as I build out an <a href="http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/">API Gallery for Streamdata.io</a>. All of my work as the API Evangelist has long lived as independent Github repositories, with a JSON or YAML core that drives the static Jekyll UI for my websites, applications, and API developer portals. Designed to be independent, data and API driven micro-solutions to some related aspect of my API research. I’m just turning up the volume on what already exists.</p>

<p>I’m taking this to the next level with my approach to API discovery. API Stack used to be a single Github repository with huge number of APIs.json and OpenAPI definitions, but after hitting the ceiling with the size of the repository, I’ve begun to shard projects by entity, topic, and collection. So far I have <a href="https://github.com/api-stack-providers">285 entities</a>, with 9850 API paths, <a href="https://github.com/api-stack-topics">spanning 397 topics</a>. Each entity, and topic exists within its own Github repository, acting as an individual set of API definitions, including an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index. Allowing me to move forward each API definition for an entity independently, and begin aggregating APIs into interesting collections by topic, industry, or other relevant area.</p>

<p>There is no backend database for these projects. Well, there is a central system I use to help me orchestrate things, but each project is standalone, with everything it needs stored in the Github repository. It is something that took some engineering, and time to setup and first, but now that it is setup, managing it is actually pretty easy. The approach has also allowing me to scale it without any additional performance issues. Each entity I add becomes its own repo, and unless I hit some magic number for the number of repositories I can have within an organization, I should be able to scale to several thousand repos pretty quickly. Doing the same thing for topics, and other types of collections I’m aggregating APIs into.</p>

<p>Each entity repository has the OpenAPI, and Postman Collection for its provider. I’m also breaking out each individual API path into it’s own OpenAPI definition, and considering doing the same for Postman Collections–distilling things down to its smallest possible unit of compute. The APIs.json for each repository indexes the OpenAPI, Postman collection, as well as the other elements of API operations like documentation, blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. In the future I will be publishing other machine readable artifacts here including details on plans and pricing, terms of service, monitoring, performance, and other aspects of the ranking and profiling of the API sector that I do.</p>

<p>I’m getting ready to softly launch Streamdata.io’s API Gallery, but my API Stack work will continue to be my workbench for this type of API discovery work. I’ll keep harvesting, scraping, and profiling APIs and their operations, and as they come into focus I’ll sync with Streamdata.io’s API Gallery, and look at how I can help Postman with their API Network, APIs.guru with their directory, as well as other API aggregation and integration platforms like AnyAPI, APIDeck, and others. I’m just getting to the point where I feel like things are working as I want them to, and are ready for me to shift into higher gear. There are still a lot of issues with individual entities, and topics, but the process is working well–I just need to spend more time refining the API definitions themselves, and work on syncing with other efforts in the space.</p>

<p>Right now I’m heavily using the Github API to make all this work, but I’m probably going to switch to relying on Git for the heaviest lifting. However, as a 30 year database person, I have admit that I am rather enjoying the scope of delivering JSON and YAML driven API-driven continuous deployment and integration projects like this that have a machine readable layer, but also a UI layer for humans to put to use. It provides me a with a very API way of driving how I profile APIs, quantify what it is they do, and begin to rank and make sense of the growing API landscape. Continuing with my way of doing things out in the open, while hopefully providing more value to the API discovery conversation, in an OpenAPI and Postman Collection driven API universe.</p>

<p>I was enjoying the REST API Notes newsletter from my friend Matthew Reinbold (<a href="https://twitter.com/libel_vox">@libel_vox</a>) today, and wanted to share my thoughts on his mention of my work while it was top of my mind. I always enjoy what Matt has to say, and regularly encourage him writing on his blog, and keep publishing his extremely thoughtful newsletter. It is important for the API sector to have many thoughtful, intelligent voices breaking down what is going on. I recommend <a href="https://tinyletter.com/RESTAPINotes/">subscribing to REST API Notes</a> if you haven’t, you won’t regret it.</p>

<p>Anyways, Matt replied with the following about my Facebook response:</p>

<p><em>Kin Lane did a fine job <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/26/a-regulatory-framework-for-facebook-and-other-platforms-is-already-in-place/">identifying the mechanisms most companies already have in place to mitigate the kind of bad behavior displayed by Cambridge Analytica</a>. It is a good starting point. However, I do want to challenge one of his assertions. Kin implies that OAuth consent is a sufficient control for folks to manage their data. While better than nothing, I maintain that most consumers are incapable of making informed decisions. It’s not a question of their intelligence. It is a question of complexity and incentives for the business to be deliberately opaque.</em></p>

<p>I agree. To quote my other friend Mehdi Medjaoui (<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>), “OAuth is flawed, but it is the best we have”. I would say that “consumers are incapable of making informed decisions”, because we’ve crafted the world this way, and our profit margins depend on customers not being able to make informed decisions. It is how markets work things out, and “smart” people get ahead, and all that bullshit. You see this same thing playing out at the terms of service level as well. As a consumer of online services, I am regularly incapable of being able to make informed decisions around how my data is being used, in exchange for using a free web application. Is it because I’m not smart? No, it is because terms of service are purposefully confusing, verbose, legalize, and mind numbing. Why? So I don’t read them, understand them, and run the other way.</p>

<p>This is intentional. You see this in the Tweet responses from Facebook engineers as they call all of us ignorant fools, and say that we agreed to all of this. The problem isn’t OAuth. The problem is intentional deceit and manipulation by corporations, and for some reason we keep showcasing this type of behavior as being savvy, smart, and just doing business. There is no reason that terms of service or OAuth flows can’t be helpful, informative, and in plain language. Platforms just choose to not invest in these areas, because an uninformed user means more profit for the platform, its investors, and shareholders. The lack of available startups, services, and tooling at the terms of service and privacy layer of technology sector demonstrates what a scam all of this has been. If startups cared about their users, we would have seen investment in tools and services that help us all make sense of things. Period.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/14/the-future-of-public-private-sector-partnerships-being-negotiated-at-the-api-oauth-scope-level/">I’ve sat in multi-day OAuth negotiation sessions on behalf of the White House</a>, negotiating OAuth scopes on behalf of power customers. I’ve seen how strong armed the corporations can be, and how little defense the average consumer has. I’ve seen technology platforms intentionally complexify things over and over. I’ve also seen plain language terms of service that actually make sense–<a href="https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api">read Slack’s for an example</a>. I’ve seen OAuth flows that protect a user’s interest, however I haven’t seen ANY investment in actually educating end-users about what is OAuth, and why it matters. You know, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">like the personal finance classes we all get in high school</a>? (I wrote that shit in 2013!!!) Why aren’t we educating the average consumer about managing their personal data and privacy? Why aren’t we setting standards for OAuth scopes, and flows for technology platforms? Good question!</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last eight years trying to encourage platforms to be better citizens using their APIs. I’ve been aggregating and showcasing the healthy building blocks they can use to better serve their customers, and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/07/18/diagramming-the-components-of-api-observability/">provide more observability into how they operate</a>. At this point, I feel like the tech sector has had their chance. Y’all chose to willfully ignore the interest of end-users, and get rich on all of our data. I know you all will cry foul now that the regulatory winds are starting to blow. Too bad. You had you chance. I’m going to focus all my energy and resources into educating policy and lawmakers about how they can use APIs, OAuth, and other building blocks already in use to put y’all into check. There is no reason the average consumer can’t make an informed decision around the terms of service of the platforms they depend on, and intelligently participate in conversations around access to their data using OAuth. As Matt said, “it is a question of complexity and incentives for the business to be deliberately opaque.”–regulations and policy is how we shift that.</p>

<p>I’ve been publishing regular posts from the API design guides of API providers I’ve been studying. API providers who publish their API design guides tends to be further along in their API journey. These API providers tend to have more experience and insight, and are often worth studying further, and learning from. <a href="https://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/">I’ve bee getting a wealth of valuable information from the German fashion and technology company Zalando, who has shared some pretty valuable API first principles</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell Zalando’s API First principles focuses on two areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>define APIs outside the code first using a standard specification language</li>
  <li>get early review feedback from peers and client developers</li>
</ul>

<p>By defining APIs outside the code, Zalando wants to facilitate early review feedback and also a development discipline that focus service interface design on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>profound understanding of the domain and required functionality</li>
  <li>generalized business entities / resources, i.e. avoidance of use case specific APIs</li>
  <li>clear separation of WHAT vs. HOW concerns, i.e. abstraction from implementation aspects — APIs should be stable even if we replace complete service implementation including its underlying technology stack</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, API definitions with standardized specification format also facilitate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>single source of truth for the API specification; it is a crucial part of a contract between service provider and client users</li>
  <li>infrastructure tooling for API discovery, API GUIs, API documents, automated quality checks</li>
</ul>

<p>Their guidance continues by stating:</p>

<p><em>An element of API rirst are also a review process to get early review feedback from peers and client developers. Peer review is important for us to get high quality APIs, to enable architectural and design alignment and to supported development of client applications decoupled from service provider engineering life cycle.</em></p>

<p><em>It is important to learn, that API First is not in conflict with the agile development principles that we love. Service applications should evolve incrementally — and so its APIs.</em></p>

<p><em>Of course, our API specification will and should evolve iteratively in different cycles; however, each starting with draft status and early team and peer review feedback. API may change and profit from implementation concerns and automated testing feedback. API evolution during development life cycle may include breaking changes for not yet productive features and as long as we have aligned the changes with the clients. Hence, API First does not mean that you must have 100% domain and requirement understanding and can never produce code before you have defined the complete API and get it confirmed by peer review.</em></p>

<p><em>On the other hand, API First obviously is in conflict with the bad practice of publishing API definition and asking for peer review after the service integration or even the service productive operation has started. It is crucial to request and get early feedback — as early as possible, but not before the API changes are comprehensive with focus to the next evolution step and have a certain quality (including API Guideline compliance), already confirmed via team internal reviews.</em></p>

<p>Zalando get’s at one of the reasons I’m a big advocate for a design, mock, and document API lifecycle, forcing developers to realize their API vision, get feedback, and iterate upon their designs, before they ever consider moving into a production environment. I feel like there are many views of what API first means, and many do not focus on the process, and obsess too much on just API design. I think Zalando’s API design guide reflects this, where the guide is more about API guidance, than it is just about the design of an API. It provides a wealth of wisdom and knowledge, but is still labeled as being about API design.</p>

<p>Similar to pushing companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to do in APIs in the first place, I’m encouraging more of them to begin publishing their API design guides as part of their journey. It seems like it is an important part of being able to articulate not just the API design guidelines, but also a place to articulate the overall reasons behind doing APIs in the first place, and the principle, ethics, and process surrounding how we are doing APIs across the disparate teams that make things go around in our worlds.</p>

<p>I hear a lot of complaining about this being just about democrats being upset that it was the  republicans who were doing this, when in reality there are so many camps that are complicit in this game, if you are focusing in on any single camp you are probably looking to shift attention and blame from your own camp, in my opinion. I’m all for calling everyone out, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/the-api-driven-marketplace-that-is-my-digital-self/">even ourselves for being so fucking complicit in this game where we allow ourselves to be turned into a surveillance marketplace</a>. Something that benefits the Mark Zuckerbergs, Cambridge Analyticas, and the surveillance capitalist platform, but also providing a pipeline to government, and law enforcement.</p>

<p>If government is going to jump on the bandwagon calling for change at Facebook, they need to acknowledge that they’ve been benefitting from the data free for all that is the Facebook API. We’ve heard stories about 3rd party developers building applications for law enforcement to target Black Lives Matters, all the way up to Peter Thiel’s (a Facebook Investor) Palantir who actively works with NSA, and other law enforcement. If we are going to shine a light on what is happening on Facebook, let’s make it a spotlight and call out ALL of the actors who have been sucking user’s data out of the API, and better understand what they have been doing. I’m all for a complete audit of how the RNC, DNC, and EVERY other election, policing, and government entity has been doing with social data they have access to.</p>

<p>Let’s bring all of the activity out of the shadows. Let’s take EVERY Facebook application and publish as part of a public database, with an API for making sense of who is behind each one. Let’s require every application share the name’s of individuals and business interests behind their applications, as well as their data retention, storage, and sharing practices. Let’s make the application database observable by the public, journalists, and researchers. If we are going to understand what is going on with our data, we need to turn the lights on in the application warehouse that is built on the Facebook API. Let’s not just point the finger at one group, let’s shine a spotlight on EVERYONE, and make sure we are actually being honest at this point in time, or we are going to see this same scenario play out every fiver years or so.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/76_16_800_500_0_max_0_1_1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>When I started doing API Evangelist in 2010 I was still very, very, very naive about why people were doing APIs. While I do not always expect everyone doing APIs to be ethical and sensible with the reasons behind doing APIs, I have been regularly surprised at how many different views there are out there regarding why we should be doing APIs in the first place. The lesson for me is to never assume that someone is doing APIs for the same reasons I am doing APIs, because rarely that will ever be the case–hopefully minimizing the chances I’ll get continue to be surprised down the road.</p>

<p>After watching Salesforce, then Amazon, Flickr, Twitter, Facebook, and Google Maps doing APIs, I saw the potential for APIs to open up access to resources like never before. I also saw the potential for not just opening up these new opportunities to developers, but OAuth was beginning to give end-users a voice in how their data and content could be put to use. I saw the opportunity for a new type of partnership between platforms, developers, and end-users emerging that could change how we do business online, how government works, and much, much more. Sadly my white male privilege, and powers of denial prevented me from seeing the many other ways in which APIs were being seen as an opportunity.</p>

<p>I find that the reasons people publish regarding why they are doing APIs rarely size up with the real reasons why they are actually doing APIs. Sometimes you can read between the lines by evaluating their overall business model, or lack of one. Other times you can find some telling signs present in the design of their API, as the paths, parameters, and technical details tend to tell a more accidentally honest view of what is happening behind the curtain. However, when it comes to the theater of “open APIs”, everything quickly becomes a funhouse of mirrors when it comes to trying to understand why someone is doing APIs, with the only constant being that nothing last forever–all APIs will eventually change, and go away, no matter what the reasons are behind them.</p>

<p>The reasons I recommend doing APIs centers around opening up access to valuable data, content, and algorithms in a secure and observable way, that protects the privacy of everyone involved. I’m an advocate for API literacy amongst everyone involved in the API conversation, even the non-technical end-user who is most likely being impacted by their existence. I’m team API because they can bring observability into some very black box algorithms, and closed door platforms, that are increasingly governing our lives. My belief in APIs is not purely based on their technical merit, but in that some proven processes involving them have been established, which introduce some healthy balance into how we deliver web, mobile, and device-based applications. It isn’t the technology, it is how us humans are using the technology.</p>

<p>Like other web-based technology, APIs have been weaponized, and identified as a valuable tool for exploitation. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have demonstrated how they can help a platform grow and evolve, but when this growth is in the service of an advertising-focused business, they can be used to influence, nudge, and harass people in some very damaging ways. With all the exploitation, bad behavior, and looking the other way that occurs around API operations, I find it very difficult to consider representing the sector, but I do find it important that I continue making sense of what is happening. I just need to make sure that I remember that the reasons I’m doing APIs will almost always be different than why others are doing API, and I should never assume folks have the healthiest, and most meaningful intent behind operating their API platforms, and why they are reaching out to me.</p>

<p>I’m big on supporting API providers that publish their OpenAPI definitions to Github. It is important for the wider API community that ALL API definitions are machine readable, and available in a way that can be forked, and integrated into continuous integration pipelines. I’m not even talking about the benefits to the API providers when it comes to managing their own API lifecycle. I’m just focusing on the benefits to API consumers, and helping make on-boarding, integration, and keeping in sync with the road map as frictionless as possible.</p>

<p>To help incentivize API providers doing this I’m committed to writing up stories for each API provider that publishes their OpenAPI, APIs.json, or Postman Collections to Github. Bonus points if you are doing it in an interesting way that further benefits your operations, as well as your community. Today’s API provider to showcase is <a href="https://www.nexmo.com">the SMS, voice and phone verifications API provider Nexmo</a>, who tweeted <a href="https://github.com/Nexmo/api-specification">the Github repository at me, which contains their OpenAPI definition for their APIs</a>. As they say, it is a work in progress, but it provides a damn good start for a machine readable definition for their API(s), and I mean c’mon, aren’t all of our APIs a working progress?</p>

<p>Nexmo uses their API definition as “a single point of truth that can be used end-to-end can we used to:”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Planning Shared during product discussions for planning API functionality</li>
  <li>Implementation Inform engineering during development</li>
  <li>Testing As the basis for testing or mocking API endpoints</li>
  <li>Documentation For producing thorough and interactive documentation</li>
  <li>Tooling To generate server stubs and client SDKs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nexmo has adopted version 3.0 of the OpenAPI definition, which is forward leaning for the API provider. They also provide a list of resources, tooling, and their API definition available as Ruby packages for easier integration. Another thing they do that I think is interesting, is they list the owner, and contributors for each API definition they have published, or are working on. Which is a concept I fully support, and would like to bake into my own API stack work. Working on API definitions is hard work, and we should be showcasing, and supporting anyone that steps up to do the hard work, as well as providing a point of contact for each available definition.</p>

<p>I am going to spend some time going through Nexmo’s API definition, and learning more about OpenAPI 3.0. I will also be spending time going through their API developer portal creating an APIs.json, and Postman Collection for their API. I’m looking to add their API to the Postman API Network, as well as my API Stack, Streamdata.io API Gallery, and other API aggregation, integration, and discovery projects I am working on. Thanks for bringing to my attention Nexmo, and keep up the good work. I’ll keep paying attention to what you are doing, with Github, and your OpenAPI definition being a conduit for guiding my attention.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/docks_copper_circuit.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>There is lots of talk this week about regulating Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica story broke. Individuals, businesses, lawmakers, and even Facebook are talking about how we begin to better regulate not just Facebook, but the entire data industry. From my perspective, as the API Evangelist, the mechanisms are already in place, they just aren’t being used to their fullest by providers, with no sufficient policy in place at the federal level to incentivize healthy behavior by API providers, data brokers, and 3rd party application developers.</p>

<p><strong>API Management Is Already In Place</strong><br />
Modern API platforms, Facebook included, leverage what is called an API management layer, to help manage the applications being developed on their platforms. Every developer who wants to access platform APIs has to sign up, submit the name and details of their application(s), and then receive an API key which they have to include with each call they make to a platform’s API when requesting ANY data, content, or usage of an algorithm. This means that all the platforms should already be in tune with every application that is using their platform, unless they allow internal groups, and specific partners to bypass the API management layer.</p>

<p><strong>An Application Review Process</strong><br />
Every application submitting for API keys has to go through some sort of review process. The bar for this review process might be as low as requiring you to have an email address, or as high as submitting drivers and business licenses, and verify how you are storing your data. Facebook has an application review process in place, and is something they are promising to tighten up a bit in response to Cambridge Analytica. How loose, or tight a platform is with their application review process is always in alignment with the platform’s business model, and how the value their user’s privacy and security.</p>

<p><strong>Govern Data Access OAuth Using Scopes</strong><br />
Most platforms use a standard called OAuth for enabling 3rd party developers access to a platform user’s data. Each quiz, game, and application has to ask a user to authorize access to their data, and OAuth scopes govern how much, or how little data can be accessed. OAuth scopes are defined by the platform, and negotiated by 3rd party developers, and end-users. Facebook has tightened their OAuth scopes in recent years, but has more work ahead of them to make sure they protect end user’s interest, and that 3rd party developers are properly following OAuth healthy practices, and end-users are aware and literate of what they are doing when participating in OAuth flows.</p>

<p><strong>Logging Of Every API Access</strong><br />
When it comes to API access, everything is logged, and you know exactly who has accessed what, and when. Everything an application does with Facebook, or any other platform’s data via their API is logged. This is standard practice across the industry. Since every application passes their API key with each call, you know the details of what each application is doing in real time. Saying you aren’t aware of what an application is doing with user’s data doesn’t exist in an API-driven world, it just means that you aren’t actively paying attention to, and responding to log activity in real time.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis And Reporting Of Usage</strong><br />
Detailed analysis and reporting is baked into API management, providing visual dashboards for API platforms, application developers, and end-users to understand how data is being accessed and put to use by applications. Understanding activity at the API management layer is one of the fundamental elements of striking a balance between access and control over platform data consumption. APIs aren’t secure if nobody is paying attention to what is happening, and actively responding to bad behavior, and undesirable access. Platforms, 3rd party developers, as well as end-users should all be equipped, and educated regarding the analysis and reporting that is available via all any platform in which they operate on.</p>

<p><strong>Application Directory And Showcase</strong><br />
Many API platforms actively showcase the applications that are built upon their APIs, sharing the interesting applications that are available, and allowing consumers to put them to use. When it comes to regulation, this existing practice just needs expanded upon, requiring ALL applications to be registered, whether for internal, partner, or external use. Then also expanding upon the data that is required and published as part of the application submission, review, and operation practice. Additionally, the application directory and showcase should be operated and audited by external entities, who aren’t beholden to platform interest, providing a more transparent, observable, and accountable approach to understanding what an application’s motivations are, and fairly reporting upon all platform usage.</p>

<p><strong>Recurring Application Auditing Practices</strong><br />
Building on the existing application review process, and in conjunction with the application directory, all active applications should be subject to a recurring review process triggered by time, and by different levels of consumption. You already see some of this from providers like Twitter who limit applications to 1M OAuth tokens, which then you are subject to further scrutiny. This is something that should happen regularly for all applications, pushing for annual review and audit of their operations, as well as at 10K, 100K, and 1M OAuth token levels, pushing to further understand the data gathering, storage, funding, and partner relationships in play behind the scenes with each application built on top of a platform’s API.</p>

<p><strong>Breach Notifications And Awareness</strong><br />
Every platform should be required to communicate with users, and the public regarding any breach that occurs within a 72 hour period. We see this practice taking hold in Europe around the GDPR regulation, and is something that needs to be adopted throughout the United States. This shouldn’t be limited to large scale, and malicious breaches, and also include any terms of service, privacy, or security violations incurred by individual applications. Publishing and sharing the details of the incident as part of the application directory and showcase. Highlighting not just the healthy behavior on the platform, but being open and transparent regarding the bad behavior that occurs. Bringing bad actors out of the shadows, and holding platforms, as well as 3rd party developers accountable for what goes on behind the scenes.</p>

<p><strong>API Access For API Management Layer</strong><br />
All aspects of a platform should have APIs. Every feature available in the UI for a web or mobile application, should have a corresponding API. This applies to the platform as well, requiring that the entire API management, logging, and application directory layers outlined above all have APIs. Providing access to all applications who are accessing a platform, as well as understanding how they are putting API resources to work, and consuming valuable data and content. Making the platform more observable and accountable, allowing it to be audited by 3rd party research, journalists, regulators, and other industry level actors. Of course, not everyone would gain access to this layer by default, requiring different tiers of access, but still holding ALL API consumers to the same levels of accountability, no matter which tier they are working at.</p>

<p><strong>Service Composition For Different Types Of Users</strong><br />
Another fundemental aspect of API management that exists across the tech sector, but isn’t always discussed or understood, is the different tiers of access available, depending on who you are. API service composition at the API management layer is what dictates that new API consumers only get access to a limited amount of resources, while more trusted partner, and internal groups get access to higher volumes, as well as additional number of API resources. Service composition is what limits the scope of API terms of service, privacy, and security breaches, and also allows for the trusted auditing, reporting, and analysis of how a platform operates by researchers, regulators, and other 3rd party actors. Every platform has different levels of API access as defined through their service composition at the API management layer. Sometimes this is reflected on their plans and pricing pages, but often times when there is no clear business models, these levels of access operate in the shadows.</p>

<p><strong>Looking At Existing Solutions When it Comes To Platform Regulations</strong><br />
The cat is out of the bag. APIs have been used to measure, understand, and police the access to data, content, and algorithms at the API level for over a decade. Nothing I’ve outline is groundbreaking, or suggests anything new be developed. The only changes required are at the government policy level, and a change in behavior at the platform level. The tooling and services to implement the regulations of platforms already exists, and in most cases are already in place–it just happens that they are serving the platform masters, and have not be enlisted to serve end-users, and most definitely not at the regulatory level. API management is how platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others have gotten to where they are, by incentivizing development and user growth via API integrations, the problem is this often involves turning the API faucet completely on, and not limiting access based upon privacy or security, and only in service of the business model when it makes sense.</p>

<p>Facebook has the ability to understand what Cambridge Analytic was doing. They can identify healthy and not so healthy practices via API consumption long before they become a problem. The problem is that their business model hasn’t been in alignment with taking control of things at the API management level–it encourages bad behavior, not limits it. There also isn’t any API access to this API management layer, and no observability into the applications that are built on top of existing APIs. There is no understanding at the regulatory level that these things are possible, and there are no policies in place requiring platforms have APIs, or provide industry level regulatory access to their API management layers. You can see <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">the beginning of this emerge with banking regulatory efforts out of the UK</a>, and requiring the API management layer be operated by a 3rd part entity, with all actors be registered in the API management directory, and accountable to the community, and the industry. Setting a precedent for regulatory change at the API management layer, and providing a working blueprint for how this can work.</p>

<p>API management is over a decade old, and something that is baked into the Amazon, Azure, and Google Clouds. It is standard practice across all leading API providers like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, and others. The concept of regulating data, content, and algorithmic access and usage at the API layer isn’t anything new. The only thing missing is the policy, and regulatory mandate to make it so. Americans are acting like this is something new, but we see a precent already being set in Europe through GDPR, and PSD2 in banking. The CFPB in DC was already working on moving this conversation forward until the Trump White House began unraveling things at the agency. Regulating our personal data won’t be a technical, or business challenge to solve, it will ultimately be about the politics of how we operate our platforms in a more sustainable way, and truly begin protecting the privacy and security of users (or not).</p>

<p>I have a lot of conversations with folks down in the trenches about API security, and what they are doing to be proactive when it comes to keeping their API infrastructure secure. The will and the desire amongst folks I talk to regarding API security is present. They want to do what it takes to truly understand what is needed to keep their APIs secure, but many have their hands tied because lack of resources to actually do what is needed. Every API team I know is short-handed, and doing the best they can with what they have available to them. A lack of investment in API security isn’t always intentional, it ends up just begin a reality of the priorities on the ground within the organizations they work in.</p>

<p>While I’m sure leaders within these companies are concerned about breaches within their API infrastructure, the urgency to invest in this area isn’t always a priority. Despite an increase in high profile, often API-induced breaches, IT and API groups are still not given the amount of resources they need to do something about potential security incidents. Other than the stress and bad press of a breach, there really are no consequences in the United States. We have seen this play out over and over, and when high profile breaches like Equifax go unpunished, other corporate leaders fully understand that there will no consequences, so why invest in preventative measures–we will just respond to it “if” it happens.</p>

<p>This is why GDPR, and other similar legislation will become important to the API security industry. Without real civil or criminal penalties involved with breaches, and even heavier penalties for poorly handled breaches, companies just aren’t going to care. Data is just a replaceable commodity, and a company can recover from the hit to their brand when a breach does occur. Making the investment in proactive API security training, staffing, services, and processes an unnecessary thing. Reflecting how health care is handled in this country, with 95% of the investment in treating things after they happen, and about 5% investment in preventative care. Hoping all along you don’t get sick, or have a breach.</p>

<p>I can talk until I blue in the face to business leaders about API security, and make them aware of healthy practices, but if there isn’t an incentive to invest in API security, it will never happen. At this point I feel that API security is more a reflection of a wider systemic illness around how we view data, and that country and industry level policy is where change needs to occur. I will keep showcasing specific building blocks of an API security strategy, as well as showcase services and tools to help you implement your strategy, but I feel like the most meaningful change will have to occur at the policy level. Otherwise business leaders will never prioritize API security, leaving all of OUR data vulnerable to exploitation–it is just a cost of doing business at this point.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/adam-smith_blue_circuit.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>All the controls for Facebook to have done something about the Cambridge Analytics situation are already in place. The Facebook API management layer has everything needed to have prevented the type of user data abuse we’ve experienced, and honestly the user data abuse that has happens in many other applications, and will continue to occur. The cause of this behavior is rooted in Facebook’s business model, and a wider culture that is fueled by venture capital investment, and backdoor data brokering. It is just how the big data / app economy is funded, and when your business model is all based upon advertising, user engagement to generate data / signals, and being about leveraging that behavior for targeting–you are never going to reign in your API management layer.</p>

<p>In alignment with my other story today around lack of investment in security, Facebook just doesn’t have the incentive to invest in policing their API management layer. There is no motivation to thoroughly vet new applications, let alone regularly review and audit what each application is doing as they approach 10K tokens, 100K, or 270K tokens. Sure you can’t get at all the friends data anymore, so they did work tighten things down at the API management schema layer, but most action we’ve seen is in response to bad situations, and not preventative. If you are properly managing the access to your APIs, and have the resources to monitor and respond to activity in real time, you are going to see the bad actors, and respond accordingly. Minimizing the damage that occurs to end-user, developing a robust set of patterns to keep an eye out for, and just get better at keeping your platform data consumption tight.</p>

<p>The problem is when your primary business model is centered around advertising, and providing a wealth of controls around targeting users based upon the data points they provide, you want as many apps, as many data points, and as many users as you possible can. You have no incentive to police what your applications are doing, as long as it drives the bottom line. You won’t invest in properly mapping out and restricting your schema, understanding what applications are doing, and sorting out the good from the bad. If it is fueling the delivery of advertising, allowing for more data points to target users based upon, driving clicking, sharing, and the eye balls on advertising, then it is by definition good. Investment in your API management becomes an extra cost that doesn’t need more investment, especially when it will ultimately hurt the bottom line.</p>

<p>We see this same behavior playing out via Twitter, Google, and other platforms. They will only manage their APIs if it directly competes with them, or makes for bad publicity. This is why Twitter hasn’t reigned in their bot networks until recently, and why Google doesn’t reign in the fake news, conspiracy, and propaganda networks. When advertising is your business model, you want the API faucet open wide, with very little filter on what flows. It isn’t a question of what mechanism we can put in place to bring some balance, these are already in place in the form of API management layers. The challenge is bringing business models in alignment with this layer, and incentivizing platforms to behave differently. Use Amazon as an example of this. Imagine if Amazon EC2 or S3 were advertising-driven, what type of bad behavior would we see? I’m not saying bad things don’t happen on these platforms, but they are managed much better, with different incentive models in play.</p>

<p>This conversation reflects one of the reasons I do API Evangelist. I don’t believe everyone should be doing APIs. However, the cat is out of the bag. The APIs are in place, and driving the web, mobile, and device applications across our Internet connected lives. The mechanisms are in place to monitor, limit, control, and understand what applications are doing with platform data. We just have to push for more observability at the API layer, and acknowledge that the business model for these platforms, and the wider technology sector is out of balance. This will prove to be the biggest challenge in changing all of this behavior, is that entrepreneurs and investors have gotten a taste of the value that can be generated at this layer, and it won’t be something they will give up easily. There is a lot of money to be via platforms when you can easily look the other way and say, “I didn’t know that was happening, so I shouldn’t be responsible.”</p>

<p>This is a post that has been in my API notebook for quite a while. I feel it is important to keep showcasing the growing number of API providers who are not just using OpenAPI, but also managing them on Github, so I had to make the time to talk about <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-oai">the email API provider SendGrid managing their OpenAPI using Github</a>. Adding to the stack of top tier API providers managing their API definitions in this way.</p>

<p>SendGrid is managing announcements around their OpenAPI definition using Github, allowing developers to signup <a href="https://dx.sendgrid.com/newsletter/oai">for email notifications around releases and breaking changes</a>. You can use the Github repository to stay in tune with the API roadmap, and <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-oai/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-request">contribute feature requests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-oai/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-a-bug-report">submit bug reports</a>, and even <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-oai/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cla">submit a pull request with the changes</a> you’d like to see. Going beyond just an API definition being about API documentation, and actually driving the API road map and feedback loop.</p>

<p>This approach to managing an API definition, while also making it a centerpiece of the feedback loop with your community is why I keep beating this drum, and showcasing API providers who are doing this. It is a way to manage the central API contract, where the platform provider and API consumers both have a voice, and producing a machine readable artifact that can be then used across the API lifecycle, from design to deprecation. Elevating the API definition beyond just a bi-product of creating API docs, and making it a central actor in everything that occurs as part of API operations.</p>

<p>I’m still struggling with convincing API providers that they should be adopting OpenAPI. That it is much more than an artifact driving interactive documentation. Showcasing companies like SendGrid using OpenAPI, as well as their usage of Github, is an important part of me convincing other API providers to do the same. If you want me to write about your API, and what you are working to accomplish with your API resources, then publish your OpenAPI definition to Github, and engage with your community there. It may take me a few months, but eventually I will get around to writing it up, and incorporating your story into my toolbox for changing behavior in our API community.</p>

<p>I’m fascinated with the unit of compute as defined by a microservice, OpenAPI definition, Postman Collection, or other way of quantifying an API-driven resource. Asking the question, “<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/15/how-big-or-small-is-an-api/">how big or how small is an API?</a>”, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/03/09/defining-the-smallest-unit-possible-for-use-at-api-runtime/">working to define the small unit of compute needed at runtime</a>. I do not feel there is a perfect answer to any of these questions, but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be asking the questions, and packaging up our API definitions in a more meaningful way.</p>

<p>As I was profiling APIs, and creating Postman Collections, the Okta team tweeted at me, their own approach to delivering their APIs. They tactically place Run in Postman buttons throughout their API documentation, as well as <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/api_test_client.html#collections-quick-reference">provide a complete listing of all the Postman Collections they have</a>. Showcasing that they have broken up their Postman Collections along what I’d consider to be service lines. Providing small, meaningful collections for each of <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/api_test_client.html">their user authentication and authorization APIs</a>:</p>

<p>Okta’s approach delivers a pretty coherent, microservices approach to crafting their Postman Collections, providing separate API runtimes for each service they bring to the table. Which I think gets at what I’m looking to understand when it comes to defining and presenting our APIs. It can be a lot more work to create your Postman Collections like this, rather than just creating one single collection, with all API paths, but I think from a API consumer standpoint, I’d rather have them broken down like this. I may not care about all APIs, and I’m just looking at getting my hands on a couple of services–why make me wade through everything?</p>

<p>I have imported the Postman Collections for the Okta API, and added to my API Stack research. I’m going to convert them into OpenAPI definitions so I can use beyond just Postman. I will end up merging them all back into a single OpenAPI definition, and Postman Collection for all the API paths. However, I will also be exploding them into individual OpenAPIs and Postman Collections for each individual API path, going well beyond what Okta has done. Further distilling down each unit of compute, allowing it to be profiled, executed, streamed, or other meaningful action in isolation, without the constraints of the other services surrounding it.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/19/gdpr-forcing-us-to-ask-questions-about-our-data/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Forcing Us To Ask Questions About Our Data</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/face-2_blue_circuit.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve been learning more about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recently, and have been having conversation about compliance with companies in the EU, as well as the US. In short, GDPR requires anyone working with personal data to be up front about the data they collect, making sure what they do with that data is observable to end-users, and takes a privacy and security by design approach when it comes to working with all personal data. While the regulations seems heavy handed and unrealistic to many, it really reflects a healthy view of what personal data is, and what a sustainable digital future will look like.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge with becoming GDPR compliant is the data mess most companies operate in. Most companies collect huge amounts of data, believing it is essential to the value they bring to the table, without no real understanding of everything that is being collected, and any logical reasons behind why it is gathered, stored, and kept around. A “gather it all”, big data mentality has dominated the last decade of doing business online. Database groups within organizations hold a lot of power and control because of the data they possess. There is a lot of money to be made when it comes to data access, aggregation, and brokering. It won’t be easy to unwind and change the data-driven culture that has emerged and flourished in the Internet age.</p>

<p>I regularly work with companies who do not have coherent maps of all the data they possess. If you asked them for details on what they track about any given customer, very few will be able to give you a consistent answer. Doing web APIs has forced many organizations to think more deeply about what data they posses, and how they can make it more discoverable, accessible, and usable across systems, web, mobile, and device applications. Even with this opportunity, most large organizations are still struggling with what data they have, where it is stored, and how to access it in a consistent, and meaningful way. Database culture within most organizations is just a mess, which contributes to why so many are freaking out about GDPR.</p>

<p>I’m guessing many companies are worried about complying with GDPR, as well as being able to even respond to any sort of regulatory policing event that may occur. This fear is going to force data stewards to begin thinking about the data the have on hand. I’ve already had conversations with some banks who are working on PSD2 compliant APIs, who are working in tandem on GDPR compliance efforts. Both are making them think deeply about what data they collect, where it is stored, and whether or not it has any value. Something I’m hoping will force some companies to stop collecting some of the data all together, because it just won’t be worth justifying its existence in the current cyber(in)secure, and increasingly accountable regulatory environment.</p>

<p>Doing APIs and becoming GDPR compliant go hand in hand. To do APIs you need to map out the data landscape across your organization, something that will contribute to GDPR. To respond to GDPR events, you will need APIs that provide access to end-users data, and leverage API authentication protocols like OAuth to ensure partnerships, and 3rd party access to end-users data are accountable. I’m optimistic that GDPR will continue to push forward healthy, transparent, and observable conversations around our personal data. One that focuses on, and includes the end-users who’s data we are collecting, storing, and often time selling. I’m hopeful that the stakes become higher, regarding the penalty for breaches, and shady brokering of personal data, and that GDPR becomes the normal mode of doing business online in the EU, and beyond.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/facebook/suspending-cambridge-analytica-facebook.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m processing <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/">the recent announcement by Facebook to shut off the access of Cambridge Analytica</a> to it’s valuable social data. The story emphasizes the importance of having a real time awareness and response to API consumers at the API management level, as well as the difficulty in ensuring that API consumers are doing what they should be with the data and content being made available via APIs. Access to platforms using APIs is more art than science, but there are some proven ways to help mitigate serious abuses, and identify the bad actors early on, and prevent their operation within the community.</p>

<p>While I applaud Facebook’s response, I’m guessing they could have taken more action earlier on. Their response is more about damage control to their reputation, after the fact, than it is about preventing the problem from happening. Facebook most likely had plenty of warning signs regarding what Aleksandr Kogan, Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, were up to. If they weren’t than that is a problem in itself, and Facebook should be investing in more policing of their API consumers activity, as they claim they are doing in their release.</p>

<p>If Aleksandr Kogan has that many OAuth tokens for Facebook users, then Facebook should be up in his business, better understanding what he is doing, where his money comes from, and who is partners are. I’m guessing Facebook probably had more knowledge, but because it drove traffic, generated ad revenue, and was in alignment with their business model, it wasn’t a problem. They were willing to look the other way with the data sharing that was occurring, until it became a wider problem for the election, our democracy, and in the press. Facebook should have more awareness, oversight, and enforcement at the API management layer of their platform.</p>

<p>This situation I think highlights another problem of doing APIs, and ensuring API consumers are behaving appropriately with the data, content, and algorithms they are accessing. It can be tough to police what a developer does with data once they’ve pulled from an API. Where they store it, and who they share it with. You just can’t trust that all developers will have the platform, as well as the end user’s best interest in mind. Once the data has left the nest, you really don’t have much control over what happens with it. There are ways you can identify unhealthy patterns of consumption via the API management layer, but Aleksandr Kogan’s quizzes probably would appear as a normal application pattern, with no clear signs of the relationships, and data sharing going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>While I sympathize with Facebook’s struggle to police what people do with their data, I also know they haven’t invested in API management as much as they should have, and they are more than willing to overlook bad behavior when it supports their bottom line. The culture of the tech space supports and incentivizes this type of bad behavior from platforms, as well as consumers like Cambridge Analytica. This is something that regulations like GDPR out of the EU is looking to correct, but the culture in the United States is all about exploitation at this level, that is until it becomes front page news, then of course you act concerned, and begin acting accordingly. The app, big data, and API economy runs on the generating, consuming, buying, and selling of people’s data, and this type of practice isn’t going to go away anytime soon.</p>

<p>As Facebook states, they are taking measures to reign in bad actors in their developer community by being more strict in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/792552774106866">their application review process</a>. I agree, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/15/some-common-features-of-an-api-application-review-process/">a healthy application review process is an important aspect of API management</a>. However, this does not address the regular review of applications usage at the API management level, assessing their consumption as they accumulate access tokens, to more user’s data, and go viral. I’d like to have more visibility into how Facebook will be regularly reviewing, assessing, and auditing applications. I’d even go so far as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/03/01/an-observable-industry-level-directory-of-api-providers-and-consumers/">requiring more observability into ALL applications that are using the Facebook API, providing a community directory that will encourage transparency around what people are building</a>. I know that sounds crazy from a platform perspective, but it isn’t, and would actually force Facebook to know their customers.</p>

<p>If platforms truly want to address this problem they will embrace more observability around what is happening in their API communities. They would allow certified and verified researchers and auditors to get at application level consumption data available at the API management layer. I’m sorry y’all, self-regulation isn’t going to cut it here. We need independent 3rd party access at the platform API level to better understand what is happening, otherwise we’ll only see platform action after problems occur, and when major news stories are published. This is the beauty / ugliness of APIs. The cats out of the bag, and platforms need them to innovate, deliver resources to web, mobile, and device applications, as well as remain competitive. APIs also provide the opportunity to peek behind the curtain, and better understand what is happening, and profile the good and the bad actors within each ecosystem–let’s take advantage of the good here, to help regulate the bad.</p>

<p>I struggle calling this a lifecycle, as most of these do not occur in any sort of linear fashion. This is why I’m resorting to using the API Transit approach, as it is something that reflects the ever-changing, but also hopefully eventually more consistent nature of delivering microservices. Ideally, every microservice passes through each of these stops in a consistent fashion, making sure that they operate in concert with a larger API platform strategy. However, I know what the reality on the ground is, and know that not all of these relevant to each organization I am talking with, requiring me to trim down and change the order in which I present these.</p>

<p>If you’d like to talk about how these stops apply to your API operations, feel free to reach out. I’m doing more API lifecycle and governance strategy consulting with my partners Streamdata.io, and I’m happy to help your company, organization, institution, or government agency develop your own API transit map, which can be used across your API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2018</span>

<p>Interactive API documentation is nothing new. We’ve had Swagger UI, and other incarnations for over five years now. We also have API explorers, and full API lifecycle client solutions like Postman to help us engage with APIs, and be able to quickly see responses from the APIs we are consuming. In my effort to keep pushing forward the API documentation conversation I’ve  been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">beating the drum for more visual solutions to be baked into our interactive documentation for a while now</a>, encouraging providers to make the responses we receive much more meaningful, and intuitive for consumers.</p>

<p>To help drum up awareness to this aspect of API documentation I’m always on the lookout for any interesting examples of it in the wild. There was <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">the interesting approach out of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a>, and now I’ve seen one out of <a href="https://webhose.io/">the web data feeds API provider Webhose.io</a>. When you are making API calls in their interactive dashboard you get a JSON response for things like news articles on the left hand side, but you also get an interesting slider that will show a visual representation of the JSON response on the right side–making it much more readable to non-developers.</p>

<p>It provides a nice way to quickly make sense of API responses. Making them more accessible. Making it something that even non-developers can do. Essentially providing a reverse view source (view results?) for API responses. Taking the raw JSON, and providing an HTML lens for the humans trying to make decisions around the usage of a particular API. View source is how I learned HTML back in the mid 1990s, and I can see visualization tools for API responses helping average businesses users learn JSON, or at least make it a little less intimidating, and something they feel like they put to work for them.</p>

<p>I really feel like more visualizations baked into API documentation is the future of interactive API docs. Being able to see API responses rendered as HTML, or as graphs, charts, and other visualizations, makes a lot of sense. APIs are an abstract thing, and even as a developer, I have a hard time understand what is contained within each API response. I think having visual API responses will help us craft a more meaningful API request, making our API consumption much precise, and impactful. If you see any interesting visualization layers to your favorite API’s documentation, please drop me a line, I’d like to add it to my list of interesting approaches.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/dawex/requiring-linkedin-validation.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was on-boarding with <a href="https://www.dawex.com/en/">the data marketplace Dawex</a> the other day, and I thought their on-boarding process was interesting. It is pretty rigid, requiring users to validate themselves in multiple ways, but it provides some interesting approaches to knowing more about who your API developers are. Dawex has the basic level email and phone number validation, but they have added a 3rd dimension, validating who you are using your LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>After signing up, I was required to validate my email account–pretty standard stuff. Then I was asked to enter a code sent to my cell phone via SMS–not as common, but increasingly a way that platforms are using to verify you. Then I was asked to OAuth and connect my LinkedIn account to my Dawex profile. I’ve seen sign up and login using LinkedIn, but never using it as a 3rd type of validating who you are, and that you are truly a legitimate business user. I haven’t been verified yet, it says it will take up to 72 hour is what the notification at the top of my dashboard says, but it caught my attention.</p>

<p>Dawes also has a complete, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> process, which takes the validation to another level, and something I’ll write about separately. I think the social profile validation provides an interesting look at how platforms validate who we are. In an environment where API developers will often sign up for multiple accounts, and do other shady things with anonymous accounts, I can get behind requiring consumers to prove who they are. I also think that providing robust, active, verifiable social media accounts using Github, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook makes a lot of sense. I’d say that all four of these profiles represent who I am as a person, as well as a business.</p>

<p>I have talked about using Github to validate and rate API consumers before. I could see a world where I get validated upon signup using my social profile(s), and the amount of access to an API I am entitled to varies depending on how complete, robust, and verifiable my presence is. I’m not keen on giving up all my data to every API I sign up, but providing access to my profile so they can validate and rank who I am, and then get out of my way when it comes to using their resources, is something I can get behind. I could even envision where you throw Paypal into the mix, and my billing profile is further rounded off, allowing me to consume whatever I desire, and pay for what I used.</p>

<p>The clothing marketplace Zalando has an interesting approach to classifying their APIs based upon who is consuming them. It isn’t just about APIs being published publicly, or privately, they actually have standardized their definition, and have established an OpenAPI vendor extension, so that the definition is machine readable and available via their OpenAPI.</p>

<p><a href="http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/index.html#219">According to the Zalando API design guide</a>, “<em>each API must be classified with respect to the intended target audience supposed to consume the API, to facilitate differentiated standards on APIs for discoverability, changeability, quality of design and documentation, as well as permission granting. We differentiate the following API audience groups with clear organisational and legal boundaries.</em>”</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>component-internal</strong> - The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of the same functional component (internal link). All services of a functional component are owned by specific dedicated owner and engineering team. Typical examples are APIs being used by internal helper and worker services or that support service operation.</li>
  <li><strong>business-unit-internal</strong> - The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of a specific product portfolio owned by the same business unit.</li>
  <li><strong>company-internal</strong> - The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications owned by the business units of the same the company (e.g. Zalando company with Zalando SE, Zalando Payments SE &amp; Co. KG. etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>external-partner</strong> - The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of business partners of the company owning the API and the company itself.</li>
  <li><strong>external-public</strong> - APIs with this audience can be accessed by anyone with Internet access.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> a smaller audience group is intentionally included in the wider group and thus does not need to be declared additionally. The API audience is provided as API meta information in the info-block of the Open API specification and must conform to the following specification</em>:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#/info/x-audience:
  type: string
  x-extensible-enum:
    - component-internal
    - business-unit-internal
    - company-internal
    - external-partner
    - external-public
  description: |
    Intended target audience of the API. Relevant for standards around
    quality of design and documentation, reviews, discoverability,
    changeability, and permission granting.
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Exactly one audience per API specification is allowed. For this reason a smaller audience group is intentionally included in the wider group and thus does not need to be declared additionally. If parts of your API have a different target audience, we recommend to split API specifications along the target audience — even if this creates redundancies (rationale).</em></p>

<p>Here is an example of the OpenAPI vendor extension in action, as part of the info block:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>swagger: '2.0'
info:
  x-audience: company-internal
  title: Parcel Helper Service API
  description: API for &lt;...&gt;
  version: 1.2.4
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Providing a pretty interesting way of establishing the scope and reach of each API in a way that makes each API owner think deeply about who they are / should be targeting with the service. Done in a way that makes the audience focus machine readable, and available as part of it’s OpenAPI definition which can be then used across discovery, documentation, and through API governance and security.</p>

<p>I like the multiple views of who the audience could be, going beyond just public and private APIs. I like that it is an OpenAPI vendor extension. I like that they even have a schema crafted for the vendor extension–another interesting concept I’d like to see more of. Overall, making for a pretty compelling approach to define the reach of our APIs, and quantifying the audience we are looking to reach with each API we publish.</p>

<p>I’m spending time learning from the API design guides of other leading API providers, absorbing their healthy practices, and assimilating them into my own consulting and storytelling. One API design guide I am learning a lot from is out of <a href="https://adidas-group.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/">the Adidas Group</a>, which contains a wealth of wisdom regarding not just the design of your API, but also the deployment and evolution of the API resources we are publishing.</p>

<p><a href="https://adidas-group.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/content/core-principles/rules-for-extending.html">One particularly interesting piece of advice I found within Adidas API design guidance were their rules for extending an API</a>, which I think is pretty healthy advice for an API developer to think about.</p>

<p><em>Any modification to an existing API MUST avoid breaking changes and MUST maintain backward compatibility.</em></p>

<p><em>In particular, any change to an API MUST follow the following Rules for Extending:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>You MUST NOT take anything away (related: Minimal Surface Principle , Robustness Principle)</em></li>
  <li><em>You MUST NOT change processing rules</em></li>
  <li><em>You MUST NOT make optional things required</em></li>
  <li><em>Anything you add MUST be optional (related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Robustness Principle</a>)</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>NOTE: These rules cover also renaming and change to identifiers (URIs). Names and identifiers should be stable over the time including their semantics.</em></p>

<p>First of all, I think many API developers aren’t even thinking about what constitutes a breaking change most of the time. So having any guidance that makes them pause and think about this topic is a good thing. Second, I think we should be sharing more stories about when things break, helping folks think more about these elements–the problem is that many folks are embarrassed they introduced a breaking changes, and would rather not talk about it, let alone make it publicly known.</p>

<p>I am working my way through <a href="http://apistylebook.com/">the API Stylebook</a>, learning from all the API design guides it has aggregated. There is a wealth of knowledge in there to learn from, and contains topics that make for great stories here on the blog. I wish more API providers would actively publish their API governance strategy, so that we can keep aggregating, and learning from each other. Making the wider API space more consistent, and hopefully more reliable along the way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/13439120_10154285627219813_3054276594176638940_n_copper_circuit_2.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m generating OpenAPI definitions for a wide variety of APIs currently, and I’m regularly stumbling on the messiness of the API design practices being deployed. When you are exposed to a large number of different APIs it is easy to get frustrated, begin ranting, and bitching about how ignorant people are of healthy, sensible API practices. This is the easy route. Making sense of it all, finding the interesting signals and patterns, and extracting where the opportunity are takes a significant amount of effort (so does biting tongue).</p>

<p>After profiling almost 500 API providers, I have almost 25K separate API paths indexed using OpenAPI, and APIs.json. I’ve tagged each API path using its OpenAPI definition. Pulling words from the path name, and any summary and description provided within the API documentation. Doing my best to describe the value contained within each API resource. Then I started grouping by these tags, to see what it produced. Sometimes the API paths it lists makes total sense, but most of the time it makes no sense at all. Then, I started noticing interesting patterns in how people describe their resources. Grouping things like “favorites” across all types of APIs, revealing some pretty interesting perspectives, and honest views of the resources being exposed.</p>

<p>Something as simple as “activities” can mean 30 or 40 different things when applied across CRM, storage, DNS, travel or sports APIs. At first, I’m like this shit is broken. The more time I spend with the mess, the more I’m starting to think there is more to this mess than meets the eye. I could be wrong. I often am. It is likely just my contrarian view of things, and my unique view of the API landscape in action. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/31/you-see-duplicate-work-while-i-see-common-patterns/">Where many people see duplicative work, I see common patterns</a>. I just see the landscape differently than people who are just looking to get their work done, sell a product or service, and find an exit for their startup. I’m not looking for any solution, doorway, or exit. I just see all of this as a journey, and I’m fascinated by how people view their API resources, then describe, tag and bag them.</p>

<p>I’m not sure where all of this API indexing and tagging will lead me. I don’t feel compelled to sort out the mess, and covert any of these API providers to a more sensible API religion. I’m just looking to understand more about the motivations behind why they did what they did. Provide commentary on where they fit into the bigger picture, and if they are delivering interesting and valuable API resources, help make them more discoverable, and executable when it matters. As I have been doing for the las eight years, I’m just looking to learn from others, and stay in tune with where things are headed, no matter how messy it might be. I see APIs as a kind of controlled chaos, which are increasingly driving our already chaotic lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2018</span>

<p>Google is renewing its interest in the healthcare space by <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2018/03/making-healthcare-data-work-better-with.html">releasing a protocol buffer implementation of the fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR) standard</a>. Protocol buffers are “Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler”. Its the core of the next generation of APIs at Google, often using HTTP/2 as a transport, while also living side by side with RESTful APIs, which use OpenAPI as the definition, in parallel to what protocol buffers deliver.</p>

<p>It’s a smart move by Google. Providing a gateway for healthcare data to find its way to their data platform products like Google Cloud BigQuery, and their machine learning solutions built on Tensorflow. They want to empower healthcare providers with powerful solutions that help onboard their data, and be able to connect the dots, and make sense of it at scale. However, I wouldn’t stop with protocol buffers. I would also make sure they also invest in API infrastructure on the RESTful side of the equation, developing OpenAPI specs alongside the protocol buffers, and providing translation between, and tooling for both realms.</p>

<p>While I am a big supporter of gRPC, and protocol buffers, I’m skeptical of the complexity it brings, in exchange for higher performance. Part of making sense of health care data will require not just technical folks being able to make sense of what is going on, but also business folks, and protocol buffers, and gRPC solutions will be out of reach of these users. Web APIs, combined with YAML OpenAPI has begun to make the API contracts involved in all of this much more accessible to business users, putting everything within their reach. In our technological push forward, let’s not forget the simplicity of web APIs, and exclude business healthcare users as IT has done historically.</p>

<p>I’m happy to see more FHIR-compliant APIs emerging on the landscape. PSD2 for banking, and FHIR for healthcare are the two best examples we have of industry specific API standards. So it is important that the definitions proliferate, and the services and tooling emerge and evolve. I’m hoping we see even more movement on this front in 2018, but I have to say I’m skeptical of Google’s role, as they’ve come and gone within this arena before, and are exceptional at making sure all roads lead to their solutions, without many roads leading back to enrich the data owners, and stewards. If we can keep API definitions, simple, accessible, and usable by everyone, not just developers and IT folks, we can help empower healthcare data practitioners, and not limit, or restrict them, when it is most important.</p>

Allowing them to “serve a truly global customer base with following language options for our key APIs (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Keyword generator)”. Something that I think more APIs providers are going to have to think about in coming years, as the need for API resources expands around the globe.</p>

<p>I’m tracking on the localization efforts of different API providers, and I’d say that having service availability in different regions, and multi-lingual support are the top two areas I’m seeing movement. I see two driving forces behind this, 1) the customers are demanding localization for their businesses, and 2) the governments in those countries are imposing regulations and other laws that dictate where resources can be stored and operate. I guess, something that can be seen as markets working things out, if you also believe in the value of regulations.</p>

<p>I also see a negative in all of this, specifically in this case, the imperialistic aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Meaning, the models are trained here in western countries, but then being applied, injected, and imposed upon people in other countries. Selling the service as some sort of truth, watermark, and organic solution to sentiment, emotion, and intelligence without actually localizing the models. I’m not making any assumptions around ParralelDots motivations, just pointing out that this will be a problem, and should be ignored–if it makes you mad, then you are probably part of the problem.</p>

<p>As I conduct my API research, I will keep tracking on localization efforts like this. When I have the bandwidth I will dive in deeper and better understand how providers are defining these localization layers to their APIs in their API design, deployment, documentation, and other elements. I’ll be keeping an eye on which industries are moving fastest when it comes to API localization, and try to understand where it is deemed the most important by providers, consumers, and regulators. Lots to keep an eye on, and understand in 2018 when it comes to the expansion of the world of APIs.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/zalando/zalando-api-guidelines.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>As I’m working through the API design guides from API leaders, looking for useful practices that I can include in my own API guidance, I’m finding <a href="zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/">electronic commerce company Zalando’s API design guide</a> full of some pretty interesting advice. I wanted to showcase the section about their API as a product principles, which I think reflects what I hear many companies striving for when they do APIs.</p>

<p>From the Zalando API design guide principles:</p>

<p><em>Zalando is transforming from an online shop into an expansive fashion platform comprising a rich set of products following a Software as a Platform (SaaP) model for our business partners. As a company we want to deliver products to our (internal and external) customers which can be consumed like a service.</em></p>

<p><em>Platform products provide their functionality via (public) APIs; hence, the design of our APIs should be based on the API as a Product principle:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Treat your API as product and act like a product owner</em></li>
  <li><em>Put yourself into the place of your customers; be an advocate for their needs</em></li>
  <li><em>Emphasize simplicity, comprehensibility, and usability of APIs to make them irresistible for client engineers</em></li>
  <li><em>Actively improve and maintain API consistency over the long term</em></li>
  <li><em>Make use of customer feedback and provide service level support</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>RESTful API as a Product makes the difference between enterprise integration business and agile, innovative product service business built on a platform of APIs.</em></p>

<p><em>Based on your concrete customer use cases, you should carefully check the trade-offs of API design variants and avoid short-term server side implementation optimizations at the expense of unnecessary client side obligations and have a high attention on API quality and client developer experience.</em></p>

<p><em>API as a Product is closely related to our API First principle which is more focused on how we engineer high quality APIs.</em></p>

<p>Zalando provides a pretty coherent vision for how we all should be doing APIs. I like this guidance because it helps quantify something we hear a lot–APIs as a product. However, it also focuses in on what is expected of the product owners. It also gets at why companies should be doing APIs in the first place, talking about the benefits they bring to the table.</p>

<p>I’m enjoying the principles section of Zalando’s API design guide. It goes well beyond just API design, and reflects what I consider to be principles for wider API governance. Many companies are still considering this API design guidance, but I find that companies who are publishing these documents publicly are often maturing and moving beyond just thinking deeply about design–providing a wealth of other wisdom when it comes to doing APIs right.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/contrafabulists/machine+learning.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am profiling APIs as part of my partnership with <a href="http://streamdata.io">Streamdata.io</a>, and my continued <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> work. As part of my work, I am creating OpenAPI, Postman Collections, and APIs.json indexes for APIs in a variety of business sectors, and as I’m finishing up the profile for <a href="https://docs.paralleldots.com/">ParallelDots machine learning APIs</a>, I am struck (again) by the importance of tags within OpenAPI definitions when it comes to defining what any API does, and something that will have significant effects on the growing machine learning, and artificial intelligence space.</p>

<p>While profiling ParallelDots, I had to generate the OpenAPI definition from the Postman Collection they provide, which was void of any tags. I went through the handful of API paths, manually adding tags for each of the machine learning resources. I’m adding tags like sentiment, emotions, semantics, taxonomy, and classification, to each path. Trying to capture what resources were available, allowing for the discovery, filtering, and execution of each individual machine learning model being exposed using a simple web API. While the summary and description explain what each API does to developers, the tags are really the precise meaning in a machine readable context.</p>

<p>In the fast moving, abstract realm of machine learning, and artificial intelligence it can be difficult to truly understand what each API does, or doesn’t do. I struggle with it, and I’m pretty well versed in what is possible and not possible with machine learning. Precise tagging provide us with a single definition of what each machine learning API does, setting a baseline of understanding for putting ML APIs to work. Something that if I consistently apply across all of the machine learning APIs I’m profiling, I can can begin honing and dialing in my catalog of valuable API resources, and begin creating a coherent map of what is possible with machine learning APIs–helping ground us in this often hyped realm.</p>

<p>Once I have a map of the machine learning landscape established, I want to continue evolving my API ranking strategy to apply specifically to machine learning models being exposed via APIs. Not just understanding what they do, but also the quality of what they do. Are the machine algorithms delivering as advertised? Which APIs have a consistent track record in not just the reliability of the APIs, but also the reliability of the responses. Further bringing clarity to the fast moving, venture capital fueled, magical, mystical realm of artificial intelligence. Helping average business consumers better understand which APIs they can depend on, and which ones they might want to avoid.</p>

<p>I’m hoping my API Stack profiling will encourage more API providers to begin doing the heavy lifting of creating OpenAPI definitions, complete with tags themselves. We are always going to need the participation of the community to help make sure they are complete, and as meaningful as they can, but API providers will need to step up and invest in the process whenever possible. As the machine learning and artificial intelligence realms mature, we are going to need a meaningful vocabulary for describing what it is they do, and a ranking system for sorting out the good, the mediocre, and the bad. We’ll need all of this to be contained within the machine readable definitions we are using for discovery, and at runtime, allowing us to automate more efficiently using machine learning APIs.</p>

<p>I’m continuing my exploration of the API design guidance published by leading API providers. This time, I am taking a look at the API design guide publish by Adidas, <a href="https://adidas-group.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/content/application/common-data-types.html">specifically the portion of it addressing what some of the common API types should be</a>. Providing some API design essentials, that all of us API providers should be baking into our APIs by default.</p>

<p>Here is the short list of <a href="https://adidas-group.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/">default standards Adidas</a> is supporting across their API operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Date and Time Format</strong> - Date and Time MUST always conform to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 format</a> e.g.: 2017-06-21T14:07:17Z (date time) or 2017-06-21 (date), it MUST use the UTC (without time offsets).</li>
  <li><strong>Duration Format</strong> - Duration format MUST conform to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 format</a> standard e.g.: P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S (three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds).</li>
  <li><strong>Time Interval Format</strong> - Time Interval format MUST conform to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 format</a> standard e.g.: 2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z.</li>
  <li><strong>Standard Time Stamps</strong> - Where applicable, a resource representation SHOULD contain the standard timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt, and finishedAt, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 format</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Language Code Format</strong> - Language codes MUST conform to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">the ISO 639</a> e.g.: en for English.</li>
  <li><strong>Country Code Format</strong> - Country codes MUST conform to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">the ISO 3166-1</a> alpha-2 e.g.: DE for Germany.</li>
  <li><strong>Currency Format</strong> - Currency codes MUST conform to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">the ISO 4217</a> e.g.: EUR for Euro.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the common data formats we are all using across our APIs. We should be working to support standard formats wherever possible, embracing the wider web, and investing in the longevity and usability of our API designs. Making our APIs sure that they speak to as wide of audience as they possibly can, and operate in a consistent way, no matter which API you are integrating with.</p>

<p>I want to also give a shout out to the <a href="http://apistylebook.com/">API Stylebook</a>, where I’m easily finding these API design guides that I’m using for these stories, and including in my API design guidance in my consulting work. Also, I’d like to encourage other API providers to reuse the patterns present in these guides, as well as publishing their own API design governance guidance whenever possible. It is critical that we all share these stories, so that we can learn from each other, and emulate the healthiest patterns already in use across the space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2018</span>

<p>I am pulling together some API design guidance for some projects I’m consulting on, so I’m spending time reviewing the API design guides the leading API providers who have published them publicly. Learning from what they are doing across their own companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies when it comes to sensible API governance.</p>

<p>Today, I am learning from the British food delivery company, Deliveroo, and documenting <a href="https://deliveroo.engineering/guidelines/api-design/#external-facing">their guidance for which HTTP status codes should be returned for any API methods that use DELETE</a>:</p>

<p>If it exists, it should return status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>204 No Content if the entity was successfully destroyed,</li>
  <li>404 Not Found if the entity does not exist</li>
  <li>410 Gone if the entity is known to have existed but no longer does.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally 4xx response codes may be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>412 Precondition Failed</li>
  <li>415 Unsupported if using versioning and the server doesn’t support the specified version.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have to admit, I haven’t been properly publishing status codes any DELETE methods I provide. I’ve just been returning a 200 if successful, and 404 if it didn’t exist. I hadn’t put any further thought into the proper way of handling it. I just haven’t had the time, or the knowledge within reach to be able to handle properly.</p>

<p>I know that the RESTafarians enjoy debating these finer details of API design, and using HTTP, but for the rest of us, we just need some guidance from y’all. Which is why I spend time learning from existing API leaders who publish their API design guidance, and sharing as individual stories here on the blog, as well as including in my official project consulting guidance.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-definitions-api-stack.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m rebooting <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a> work as part of my partnership with <a href="http://streamdata.io">Streamdata.io</a>. I’m spending a significant portion of my day profiling API providers, documenting what it is they bring to the table. Historically I’ve published the resulting APIs.json and OpenAPI definition(s) to a single Github repository driving theapistack.com. The primary folder was already getting too big, and since I’m looking at adding at least a thousand more API providers to the stack, I am going to need to shard things out a bit.</p>

<p>To help accommodate the increased scale, I’m breaking up the API Stack into two separate Github organizations. One for individual API providers called <a href="https://github.com/api-stack-providers">api-stack-providers</a>, and a second for individual topics called <a href="https://github.com/api-stack-topics">api-stack-topics</a>. I’ve began publishing individual repositories for each API provider that I am monitoring, establishing a self-contained, continuously deployable, and integratabtle set of definitions for each API. I’m needing each API provider to be independent from each other, and I’m even publishing individual API definitions for each API path, distilling things down to the smallest possible unit of compute possible.</p>

<p>Each repository contains three main API definitions, using <a href="https://github.com/api-stack-providers/paralleldots">the ParallelDots machine learning API</a> as an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/api-stack-providers/paralleldots/blob/master/apis.yaml">APIs.json</a> - The entire index of the API provider’s operation.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/api-stack-providers/paralleldots/blob/master/openapi/complete.yaml">OpenAPI</a> - The definition of the surface area of entire API.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/api-stack-providers/paralleldots/blob/master/postmancollections/complete.json">Postman Collection</a> - An execute-time ready definition for the Postman client.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m also publishing an individual OpenAPI for each API path within a listings folder, allowing me to provide the detailed execute-time definition I’m needing to work with each API. I’m also considering how I can do this with the Postman Collections. Next, I’m looking to understand how I can include the multiple source definitions within the repository, providing original copies of API definitions that I’m pulling from sources like <a href="http://apis.guru">APIs.guru</a>, <a href="https://any-api.com/">Any API</a>, and directly from API providers. Sharing the entire history behind how each set of API definitions has come together, and hopefully encouraging others to submit pull requests with fresh copies.</p>

<p>Ideally, each API provider is maintaining their own set of definitions in their own Github repository, like <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/22/box-goes-all-in-on-openapi/">Box</a>, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/01/new-york-times-manages-their-openapi-using-github/">NY Times</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/11/06/an-example-of-how-every-api-provider-should-be-using-openapi-out-of-the-slack-platform/">Slack</a> do, which I’ll just keep in sync with. However, for the rest, I’m looking to maintain an independent Github repository for each API providers, providing a single repo, URL, and set of issues for discussing the evolution of the OpenAPI, Postman, and APIs.json indexes. Each project will also have <a href="http://paralleldots.stack.network/">its own portal landing page</a>, with generated API docs. It’s a lot to maintain, but it is something I’m already doing behind the scenes in a database, and I might as well continue the work out in the open where I can solicit the help of the community, and build on the hard work of existing projects.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/28/what-we-need-to-be-machine-readable-at-api-run-time/">I’m thinking a lot about what is needed at API runtime lately</a>. How we document and provide machine readable definitions for APIs, and how we provide authentication, pricing, and even terms of service to help reduce friction. As Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) puts it, to enable “find and bind”. This goes beyond simple API on-boarding, and getting started pages, and looks to make APIs executable within a single click, allowing us to put them to use as soon as we find them.</p>

<p>The most real world example of this in action can be found with <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman_for_publishers/run_button/creating_run_button">the Run in Postman button</a>, which won’t always deal with the business and politics of APIs at runtime, but will deal with just about everything else. Allowing API providers to publish Run in Postman Buttons, defined using a Postman Collection, which include authentication environment details, that API consumers can use to quickly fire up an API in a single click. One characteristic I’ve come across that contributes to Postman Collections being truly executable is that they reflect the small unit possible for use at API runtime.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.peachtreedata.com/Documentation#overview">You can see an example of this in action over at Peachtree Data</a>, who like many other API providers have crafted Run in Postman buttons, but instead of doing this for the entire surface area of their API, they have done it for a single API path. Making the Run in Postman button much more precise, and executable. Taking it beyond just documentation, to actually being more of a API runtime executable artifact. This is a simple shift in how Postman Collections can be used, but a pretty significant one. Now instead of wading through all of Peachtree’s APIs in my Postman, I can just do an address cleanse, zip code lookup, or email validation–getting down to business in a single click.</p>

<p>This is an important aspect of on-boarding developers. I may not care about wading through and learning about all your APIs right now. I’m just looking for the API solution I need to a particular problem. Why clutter up my journey with a whole bunch of other resources? Just give me what I need, and get out of my way. Most other API providers I have looked at in <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/api-network/">Postman’s API Network</a> have provided a single Run in Postman button for all of their APIs, where Peachtree has opted to provide many Run in Postman buttons for each of their APIs. Distinguishing themselves, and the value of each of their API resources in a pretty significant way.</p>

<p>I asked the questions the other week, regarding <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/15/how-big-or-small-is-an-api/">how big or how small is an API</a>? I’m struggling with this question in my API stack work, as part of an investment by Streamdata.io to develop an API gallery. Do people want to find Amazon Web Services APIs? Amazon EC2 APIs? Or the single path for firing up an instance of EC2? What is the small unit of compute we should be documenting, generating OpenAPI and Postman Collections for? I feel like this is an important API discovery conversation to be having. I think depending on the circumstances, the answer will be different. It is a question I’ll keep asking in different scenarios, to help me better understand how I can document, publish, and make APIs not just more discoverable, but usable at runtime.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/api-network/">The Postman API Network</a> is one of the recent movements in the API discovery space I’ve been working to get around to covering. As Postman continues its expansion from being just an API client, to a full lifecycle API development solution, they’ve added a network for discovering existing APIs that you can begin using within Postman in a single click. Postman Collections make it ridiculously easy to get up and running with an API. So easy, I’m confounded why ALL APIs aren’t publishing Postman Collections with Run in Postman Buttons published in their API docs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/api-network/">The Postman API Network</a> provides a catalog of APIs in over ten categories, with links to each API’s documentation. All of the APIs in the network have a Run in Postman button available as part of their documentation, which includes them in the Postman API Network. It is a pretty sensible approach to building a network of valuable APIs, who all have invested in there being a runtime-ready, machine readable Postman Collection for their APIs. One of the more interesting approaches I’ve seen introduced to help solve the API discovery problem in the eight years I’ve been doing API Evangelist.</p>

<p>I’ve been talking to Abhinav Asthana (<a href="https://twitter.com/a85">@a85</a>) about the Postman API Network, and working to understand how I can contribute, and help grow the catalog as part of my work as the API Evangelist. I’m a fan of Postman, and an advocate of it as an API lifecycle development solution, but I’m also really keen on bringing comprehensive API discovery solutions to the table. With the Postman API Network, and other API discovery solutions I’m seeing emerge recently, I’m finding renewed energy for this area of my work. Something I’ll be brainstorming and writing about more frequently in coming months.</p>

<p><a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a> has been investing in me moving forward the API discovery conversation, to build out their vision of a Streamdata.io API Gallery, but also to contribute to the overall API discovery conversation. I’m in the middle of understanding how this aligns with my existing API Stack work, APIs.json and APIs.io effort, as well as with APIs.guru, AnyAPI, and the wider OpenAPI Initiative.

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/code-gov/code-gov-screenshot.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Open source software is increasingly driving the federal government, <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2017/10/04/oracle-rips-18f-usds.aspx">despite the wishes of companies like Oracle</a>. I’ve been watching an interesting project grow within the federal government to help quantify open source across the federal government called Code.gov, which “leverages the power of code sharing and collaboration to help the US Government cut down on duplicative software development and save millions of taxpayer dollars for the American people.” Something I think we can all get behind, when it comes to the collision of technology and government we are seeing play out.</p>

<p>Code.gov allows you to <a href="https://code.gov/#/explore-code">browse open source projects by government agency</a>, see the details for the project, visit the repository, and contact the project owners. The project even has <a href="https://code.gov/#/help-wanted">a help wanted section where you can roll up your sleeves and actually contribute to specific projects</a>, and help agencies push forward their project. You can follow up on what is happening using <a href="https://code.gov/#/roadmap">the Code.gov roadmap</a>, and stay in tune with whats next for the very important project. However, the aspect I’m most interested in, is the evolution of the Code.gov API.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-api">an open source API behind the Code.gov project</a>, providing programmatic access to government agencies repositories, the code, types of programming languages used, status, and other critical details for projects. There is <a href="https://api.code.gov/docs/">an OpenAPI-driven, Swagger UI documentation for the project</a>, providing a nice look at the programmatic surface for the project. You can use the API they have provided, or <a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-api">you can fork the API and operate yourself</a>, providing an interesting look at delivering open source APIs that span multiple federal agencies–a blueprint that should be considered for other types of projects.</p>

<p>Code.gov reflects what I want to see come out of the federal government when it comes to technology. Open source. API-driven. Doing on thing, and doing it well. I can see spinoffs of the project emerge, focusing on just the environment, transportation, healthcare, and other verticals, helping shine a light on important projects going on across the federal government, attract and orchestrate talent and partnerships around those projects. Then build valuable dashboards, visualizations, and other applications on top of the APIs behind the project(s). I’ll be continuing to document Code.gov’s approach, and the API behind it, so that I can have the blueprint ready as part of my federal government API toolbox.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/08/a-mock-only-api-development-reality/">Imagine A Mock Only API Development Reality</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/gears_smoking_cigarette.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Imagine if we didn’t actually write code when we developed our APIs initially. What if the bar for putting an API into production was so high, that many APIs never actually made it to that level. I spend a lot of time mocking and prototyping APIs, but I don’t have a strict maturity model determining when I actually bring an API to life using code. I’d love it if I never actually write code for many of my API prototypes and just mocked them, and iterated upon the mocks instead of thinking they needed actually have a database backend, and code or gateway front-end.</p>

<p>What if I only executed these stops along the API lifecycle, instead of actually writing any code:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Define</strong> - Define what I want my API to do, and what types of resources will be involved.</li>
  <li><strong>Design</strong> - Actually design my API and underlying schema using an OpenAPI definition.</li>
  <li><strong>Mock</strong> - Publish a mock representation of my API, complete with virtualized data behind responses.</li>
  <li><strong>Document</strong> - Make sure and publish documentation to a simple developer portal.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong> - A overview of what it will cost, and the model for managing consumption.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong> - Set up tests to ensure each API is up and doing what it was intended to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate</strong> - Actually write stories, and communicate around what an API does.</li>
  <li><strong>Support</strong> - Establish and maintain feedback loops around the API to listen to consumers.</li>
  <li><strong>Road Map</strong> - Gather feedback into a road map, and plan next version, complete with a change log.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this life cycle I would never actually write any code. I would never actually setup a database backend. Everything would be mocked and virtualized, but seem as real as I possibly can. Even maybe providing different types of virtualized datasets and responses, so people can experience different types of responses or scenarios. I’d work hard to make sure each API was as complete, and function like a real APIs, as I possibly could.</p>

<p>Now imagine within a company, if I had to do all of this, and before I would ever be allowed to begin developing my API for real, I had to sell my API. Show its value, and get some consumers to buy into my overall API design, and even develop some mock integrations showing the potential. Before my API would be considered for inclusion in the production road map, I’d have to prove that my approach was mature enough in each of the areas outlined above:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Define</strong> - Robust OpenAPI and JSON schema present.</li>
  <li><strong>Design</strong> - A complete design meeting all governance guidelines.</li>
  <li><strong>Document</strong> - Complete, up to date API document present.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong> - A clear definition of costs, and how consumption will be measured.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong> - A full suite of tests available with 100% coverage.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate</strong> - Demonstrated ability to communicate around its operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Support</strong> - Demonstrated ability to support the APIs operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Road Map</strong> - Clearly articulated road map, and change log for the API.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an API developer, once I’ve build the case for my microservice, presented it, and demonstrated its value–then I would be approved to actually begin developing it. Maybe in some cases I would be required to iterate upon it for another version, and engage with a larger audience before actually given the license and budget to do it for real. Going well beyond just an API design first reality, and enforcing a maturity model around how we define and communicate around our services, and raising the bar for what gets let into production.</p>

<p>Many of the companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies I’m working with are having a hard time adopting a define and design first strategy, let alone a reality such as this. Imagine how different our production worlds would look if you had all this experience before you were ever given the license to write code. Think about how much worthless code gets written, when we should just be iterating on our ideas. How much of our budget gets wasted on writing code that should never have existed to begin with. It’s a nice thought. However, it is just a fantasy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/berlin_wall_graham_sutherland.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve been profiling a number of market data APIs as part of my work with <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a> to identify valuable sources of data that could be streamed using their service. A significant portion of the APIs I come across are making it difficult for me to get at the data they have because of their views around the value of the data, intellectual property, and maintaining control over it in an API-driven world. These APIs don’t end up on the list of APIs I’m including in the profiling work, the gallery / directory, and don’t get included in any of the stories I’m telling, as a result of this tight control.</p>

<p>The side effect of this is I end up getting repeated sales emails and phone calls asking if I am still interested in their data. If there was just one or two of these, I’d jump on phones and explain, but because I’m dealing with 50+ of them, I just don’t have the bandwidth, and I have to move on. The thing is, I’m personally not interested in their data. I’m interested in other people being interested in their data, and being an enabler to helping them to get at it. However, since I can’t actually profile the APIs, create OpenAPI definitions for the request and response structure for inclusion in the API gallery / directory I’m building, I really don’t need their APIs in my work.</p>

<p>I know these platforms are protective of their data because it is valuable. They should be. However modern API management allows for them to open up the sampling of everything they have to offer, without giving away the farm. This allows enablers, analysts, and storytellers like me to test drive things, profile what they have to offer, and include within our applications. Then my users find what they want, head over to the source of the data, sign up for API keys, talk to their sales staff about what data sets they are interested in. I’m just a middle man, a broker, someone who is looking to enable engagements with their data. I’m only interested in the data, because I understand it is valuable to others, not because I am personally interested in doing anything with it.</p>

<p>This reality is common amongst data brokers who live in the pre-API era. They don’t understand API management, and they don’t understand how innovation using APIs work. They still rely on a pretty closed, tight-gripped approach to selling data. API enablers like me don’t have the time to mess around in these worlds. There are too many APIs out there to waste our time. I’m looking to profile the best quality market data source, that are frictionless to get up and running with. I’m not looking for free data, I understand it costs to get at. I just want to send leads their way, but I need to be able to profile what you have to offer in detailed, in a machine readable way. In the end, it doesn’t matter, because these providers won’t be around for long. Other, more API-savvy data providers will emerge, and run them out of business–it is the circle of API life.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/beachclouds_clean_view.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>We are working closely with <a href="https://www.axway.com/en">Axway</a> on a number of projects over here at <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a>. After we got out of a meeting with their team the other day we received an email from them asking if we had an OpenAPI definition for a demo Streamdata.io market data API. They were wanting to include it in some marketing materials, and needed a screenshot of it. To be able to generate the visual they desired, they needed an OpenAPI to make it tangible enough for capturing in a screenshot and presenting as part of a larger story.</p>

<p>This may sound like a pretty banal thing, but when you step back and realize the importance of OPenAPI when it comes to communication, and making something very abstract a tangible, visual thing, it becomes more significant. You can tell someone there is a market data API, but taking a screenshot of documentation generated via an OpenAPI which displays the market data paths, a couple of parameters like stocker ticker symbol and maybe date range, and then plug in some actual values like the ticker symbol for AAPL, and show the JSON response takes things to a new level. This is OpenAPI empowered storytelling, marketing and communications in my book. Elevating what OpenAPI brings to the table to new stops along the API life cycle.</p>

<p>This isn’t just about documentation. This is about making an abstract API concept more visual, more meaningful, and able to be captured in an image. Axway is trying to demonstrate the value of their API solutions, coupled potentially with Streamdata.io services, in a single image–providing a lot more rich context, and visualizations that amplify their marketing materials. This isn’t just documenting what is going on so that developers know what to do with an API, this is telling stories so that business users understanding what is possible with an API–using a machine readable format like OpenAPI to help deliver the 1000 words the image will be worth.</p>

<p>Using OpenAPI like this reflects where I’d like to see API documentation go. Sure, we still need dynamic API documentation driven by OpenAPI definitions for developers to understand what is going on, but we need more snippets, visualization, and emotion driving solutions to exist. Things that marketers, bloggers, and other storytellers can use in their materials. We need OpenAPI-driven tools that help them plug in a relevant API definition, and generate a meaningful visual that they can use in a slide deck, blog post, or other material. We need our API documentation to speak beyond the developer community and become something that anyone can put to work in their API storytelling efforts–no coding required.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/cityscape_dali_three.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>It can be tough to know where to start with APIs at your large organization. Everyone is already in motion, in a variety of groups, geographic regions, serving different lines of business. The API conversation is already occurring across your organization, it is just happening in a distributed and fragmented way, without any coherent orchestration, and strategy moving it forward in unison. I’d like to sit down with your team(s), and understand what APIs look like across your organization, and help work through a first draft of your API strategy, and define how we can better orchestrate existing efforts, and begin establishing an API governance framework for bringing the API vision into focus.</p>

<p>Let’s put together a schedule for me to sit down with a variety of teams in a partial day, full day, or multi-day series of workshops. Where we can work to define a more comprehensive, and coherent strategy for APIs. One that is rooted in what is already happening, but works to brig together the disparate voices from each team into a single conversation about how APIs can make change across your organization in a more consistent, and meaningful way. Let’s sit down and begin to define what APIs mean at your organization and map of what is already occurring, and develop framework that will allow us to begin to move things forward.</p>

<p><strong>Define Objectives</strong><br />
I’d like to learn more about the objectives behind your investment in an organization-wide API strategy, and understand more around the motivations, vision behind what you are looking to achieve. I’d like to cut through the hype, and get to the real reasons you want to be doing APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal</strong> - What benefits should APIs bring to internal teams within the organization?</li>
  <li><strong>Partner</strong> - How will APIs be used to further partner engagements, and maximize their deliverables?</li>
  <li><strong>Public</strong> - What can be achieved by performing APIs in the public sphere, and engaging 3rd party developers, and media?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like everyone to bring their stories of how APIs are currently being done within their groups, and how each team sees the future of ther API programs. As well as learning from leadership about what they’d like to achieve by doing APIs in a more coordinated fashion across the organizations and lines of business.</p>

<p><strong>Define Organization</strong><br />
To help move forward the conversation, I’d like to learn more about your organizational structure, and understand the cultural makeup of all groups, individuals, the leadership structures in place–all of which will impact how APIs are realized (or not).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Groups</strong> - What groups will be involved with defining, deploying, managing, and consuming APIs?</li>
  <li><strong>Actors</strong> - Who are the different types of actors involved in shaping what APIs look like within your organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Partners</strong> - What external partners will immediately impact how APIs are done, and the value they can bring to the table?</li>
</ul>

<p>Your organizational map will have everything to do with why APIs are working or not working. Your organizational DNA will help define the impact APIs can have internally, as well as externally with partners and the wider public.</p>

<p><strong>Define Architecture</strong><br />
Next, I’d like to get a handle on the architecture that is currently in place across your organization. Understand the current technological makeup of how your organization gets business done on a day to day basis. Learning about how technology is being leveraged to deliver services today, and will continue as part of a wider API strategy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Platforms</strong> - Which of the major cloud platforms are you operating on?</li>
  <li><strong>Systems</strong> - What major systems are in place that drive services today?</li>
  <li><strong>Services</strong> - What external services do you currently put to use across operations?</li>
  <li><strong>Tools</strong> - What are the open source tools in use across your organization?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m looking to understand how web services, APIs, and applications are delivered (and consumed) today. I’d like to learn more about the technical makeup of your organization so that I can better understand the current state of things, and how existing technology can be leveraged to deliver the next generation of APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Define Services</strong><br />
Then, I’d like to paint a landscape picture of APIs across your organization, starting with the past, understanding how you have gotten to where you are today. Identify existing, successful APIs that are in place, while also getting to work on what the future will bring.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Legacy</strong> - What web services are already in place to make things work across organizations?</li>
  <li><strong>Existing</strong> - What are the existing APIs already in place which we can use as a blueprint for how APIs should be done?</li>
  <li><strong>Future</strong> - I’d like to learn about what the future will hold when it comes to APIs across the organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process can be as high level, or as technical as needed, depending on the different actors we assemble at the table. I’d like to learn about the services in terms of business leadership, as well as the finer technical views–of course, being respectful of the time we have.</p>

<p><strong>Define Lifecycle</strong><br />
With an understanding of the organization, and the existing architecture and services in play, let’s start defining the lifecycle(s) that exists for moving each individual APIs forward, understanding all the stops they’ll pass through from design to deprecation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Defining</strong> - How are APIs currently defined, from interface to schema?</li>
  <li><strong>Designing</strong> - What does API design look like across the organization?</li>
  <li><strong>Mocking</strong> - Is virtualization of APIs and data a common practice?</li>
  <li><strong>Documenting</strong> - How are APIs documented and detailed for wider usage?</li>
  <li><strong>Clients</strong> - What interfaces, SDKs, IDEs, and client tooling are used for API development?</li>
  <li><strong>Deploying</strong> - What does the current API build and deploy process look like?</li>
  <li><strong>Managing</strong> - What management and gateway layers exist as part of API operations?</li>
  <li><strong>Planning</strong> - How are costs and value generation quantified and measured involving APIs?</li>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong> - What are the current API monitoring, testing, and performance practices look like?</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> - How is security defined, evaluated, and responded to across API operations?</li>
  <li><strong>Legal</strong> - How do terms of service, privacy policies, licensing, and other regulations get addressed?</li>
  <li><strong>Discovery</strong> - How are APIs and services catalogued and discovered throughout operations?</li>
  <li><strong>Support</strong> - What does support look like when it comes to the API lifecycle?</li>
  <li><strong>Communications</strong> - What is expected around communications across teams for each API?</li>
  <li><strong>Evangelism</strong> - How are APIs evangelized internally, and externally amongst partners?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m looking to develop an understanding of how the API lifecycle is currently approached, while also discussing what the first draft of the future organizational wide API lifecycle will look like. Something we can put put into action immediately, and begin measuring as part of an overall governance strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Define Governance</strong><br />
We should now have enough to begin talking about how a comprehensive API strategy can be put into place. How individual APIs will be developed and managed, as well as the organizations and actors who will be responsible for their existence. I’d like to talk about how we’ll establish a wider understanding of API operations, measure what is happening, and begin orchestrating its movement in a organized way:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mapping</strong> - Let’s take the map of the organization, architecture, and lifecycle, and talk about how we’ll turn it into a living map of API operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Measuring</strong> - What metrics will we use to measure our progress, and understand how APIs are moving forward throughout the lifecycle in a consistent way.</li>
  <li><strong>Maturity</strong> - How do we define maturity throughout API operations, understanding not all APIs will be production ready, and always allowing for innovation.</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting</strong> - Let’s discuss how we’ll be reporting on API operations, and communicating with leadership, and across teams about the progress being made.</li>
  <li><strong>Incentives</strong> - What are the incentives we can use to help make sure everyone is a team player, and working towards a common goal across the organization?</li>
  <li><strong>Coaching</strong> - I’d like to better understand how we can implement an evangelism and coaching strategy as part of the wider API governance execution.</li>
  <li><strong>Auditing</strong> - How will we be auditing the API governance strategy, as well as the wider API operations, and understanding where the gaps are?</li>
  <li><strong>Refining</strong> - Let’s make sure everyone understands that API governance will require constance refining, and evolving to make it work as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to understand what API governance means to your organization. Is it more carrot, or more stick. I’d like to understand how a draft governance plan can be put into place immediately, but fully knowing that it will be a living, evolving, and maturing approach to ensuring quality and consistency of delivering APIs at scale across your organization.</p>

<p><strong>Initial, As Well As Ongoing Engagement</strong><br />
Let’s get to work setting up an initial engagement. I’ll leave to you to decide whether it should be a partial, full, or multi day affair. This work to define an API strategy can be invested in at multiple scopes (high level, or in detail), and should continue to live on, expand, and evolve with each engagement. Ideally, it is is something that is worked through with as many teams possible, then repeated as part of a recurring schedule, as time allows. As the map of the organization, the existing architecture and service landscape, lifecycle and governance comes into focus, these working sessions will become even more important, and productive.</p>

<p>I’d like to ask anyone joining the conversation to bring any answers, thoughts, concerns, and questions they have regarding this outline with them. They are welcome to be as high level, or down in the technical weeds as they like–I’ll absorb it all. Ideally, there is a mix of business and technical folks present, with varying levels of leadership in attendance reflecting how API decision making occurs, or will occur across your organization. I’m looking forward to learning more about APIs across your organization, and learning from everyone at the table, while also sharing my knowledge and experience from studying the API sector for the last eight years.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/gargoyle-nd-paris_atari_missle.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I find it to be a telling sign of the culture at US companies when it comes to their response, or lack of response to EU regulations. I’ve been curating stories from the API providers that I track on when it comes to GDPR or PSD2, keeping a notebook or research that is ready when I get around to diving in deeper. The companies who are openly talking about these regulations and being proactive about responding to them, are usually the API providers who have a strong stance in the US market, and are poised to, or already expanding this reach to Europe. Companies who haven’t made any noise are probably not concerned with the European market, or just hoping the regulations fizzle out I guess?</p>

<p>After diving into my curation notebook the first company to stand out is <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, with a variety of blog posts, and resources on navigating both PSD2 and GDPR. Auth0 is in a good position to provide critical authentication and user information management APIs to other companies who are working to comply with the regulations, so it makes sense that they would be getting ahead of all of this. I fully grasp that many companies are simply issuing their press releases stating they can help with GDPR or PSD2, but you can quickly cut through the fluff by looking at how much they’ve invested in their response, materials, and services. <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/compliance/gdpr">Auth0 has a pretty extensive knowledge-base on GDPR</a>, <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/open-auth-standards-psd2/">providing PSD2 guidance on their blog</a>, as well as <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-europe-launches/">investing in their EU region for a couple of years</a>–demonstrating it is more than just a press release.</p>

<p>I’m working my way through the list of US API providers, and service providers who are being active on the subject of EU regulations. I feel it is an important sign of the strength of the company, and demonstrates a healthy understanding of how regulations aren’t always bad, and that they can actually help industries thrive. I’m actively working on projects involving GDPR and PSD2 in Europe, and I’m eager to develop my understanding of how these regulations are changing the face of the technology industry in Europe, but also how this will impact US companies. I’m hoping that it will begin to shift and evolve the culture around data ownership, privacy, and APIs as industry standards in the US. I feel that as Internet technology matures, we are going to need to view data a little different, otherwise things won’t be sustainable. I’m hopeful that EU regulations can help set this into motion–we’ll see, maybe I’m naive.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/castle-on-hill-edinburgh_propaganda_leaflets.JPG" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve been tasked with helping explain API security to senior leadership, and wanted to work through my ideas here on the blog. For this audience, I’m not going to get down into the weeds regarding the technical specification behind OAuth, and other approaches, and try to keep things high level, introducing folks to the art that is API security. The phrase API security represents a balance of concepts because APIs are by nature about providing access, while security is about controlling and sometimes limiting access, resulting in a new way of getting business done on the open web.</p>

<p><strong>First, What Are APIs?</strong><br />
APIs are not the latest trend, or vendor solution, they are the next evolution in the web. Web sites and applications return HTML via a URL, and meant to display information to humans in a browser, while APIs return JSON or XML of the same information, but meant to be used in other applications and systems. API security is designed to allow access to our digital resources using the web, while also securing it in a way to ensure only the intended audience is able to obtain  access. APIs are designed to securely provide access to data, content, media, and algorithms using the same web that us humans use to access information online via our browsers.</p>

<p><strong>Access Using Secure URLs</strong><br />
APIs use web URLs get read and write data, content, media, and to allow engagement with algorithms. If you want a list of press releases, you visit https://api.example.com/press/. If you want a list of contacts from the CRM, you visit https://api.example.com/contacts/. The URL for all API resources should be encrypted by default, protecting all requests and responses in transit. Providing the first layer of security for APIs, ensuring only approved consumers can view data, content, media, and valuable algorithms being transmitted online.</p>

<p><strong>Registration Always Required For APIs</strong><br />
A common misconception about web APIs is that they are all like Twitter, and are publicly available on the web. However, almost all web APIs actually require that you register before you get any access to any resources. This process is the beginning of what is called API management, where developers have to sign up for an account, and in some cases be approved before they get access to APIs. Most of the time there is self-service, automatic registration, but developers only get limited access, which once they’ve been approved, proven their identity, or put in a credit card–will be able to obtain higher levels of access to resources.</p>

<p><strong>Application Keys For Each API Call</strong><br />
Once developers have been approved for access, they can begin making API calls. However, each API will require that API keys, and required credentials are present with each call. Providing identification of every API consumer, and exactly what they are consuming. API keys are often seen as all that is needed to properly securing APIs, but in reality, they are much more about identifying and tracking what API consumers are doing. Going beyond just focusing on securing the digital resources, and really developing an awareness of who is accessing what, which will prove to be more valuable than just requiring registration to access APIs alone.</p>

<p><strong>Suite Of Authentication Options</strong><br />
There are a handful of approaches in use when it comes to requiring developers to authenticate and pass along their API keys with each response. Each approach has pros and cons, but the industry has widely settled in on four main ways to require API developers to authenticate themselves when using APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Basic Auth</strong> - Usage of the basic authentication format that is part of the standard HTTP operations, employing a username and password as credentials for accessing API resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Access</strong> - Providing simple tokens, often called API key as a common way to access to APIs, issuing one to each developer and per application they register.</li>
  <li><strong>JSON Web Token</strong> - JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.</li>
  <li><strong>oAuth</strong> - Providing an oAuth layer to API operations, securing high value APIs, while also opening up a conversation between an API platform, developers, and end-users regarding the access of their content and data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the security requirements of the resource, and whether or not users generated data and content is involved, you may select a different path for how you require API developers to authenticate. API keys via the URL or headers, as well as Basic Auth are the most common. with JSON Web Tokens, and OAuth being put to work in higher security environments, and where users data, and permission might be required.</p>

<p><strong>Logging Of All API Activity</strong><br />
A essential aspect of securing APIs involves the logging of ALL API calls, no matter who the consumer is, what application it is serving, and whether it is for internal, or external consumption. All API calls get logged equally, and when all API developers are required to authenticate and pass their keys with each API call, all the evidence needed to understand API activity and consumption is present. When you combine the API level logging with backend database logs, and front-end DNS logs, you can define a set of perimeters that will help ensure the security of your API resources.</p>

<p><strong>Modern API Management Solutions</strong><br />
API management combines the authentication and logging described above with API plans, rate limiting, and analytics, to achieve a heightened awareness regarding who is access what API resources, and how they are putting them to use. Modern API management allows for the monitoring of API registrations, authentication, and consumption in real time, with controls for limiting or shutting off access whenever terms of service and security violations are identified. Providing API providers with the tools they need to monitor and respond to any security concerns, while staying in tune with exactly how resources are being accessed via APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Defining Access To APIs Using Service Composition</strong><br />
API management also allows API providers to develop different levels of API access plans, which govern the APIs that developers will have access to, and how much they are entitled to consume. API service composition is all about organizing different APIs into different plans, and setting rate limits that govern how much a user can use per second, minute, days, or by the month. New users are often placed into plans with stricter limitations, while more trusted, partner, and internal consumers enjoy higher rate limits, and less restrictive plans. Service composition helps minimize the damage that occurs whenever there are bad actors present, or security incidents occur, keeping the breaches limited to a small subset of low value APIs, and limited amount of resources accessed.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring All API Availability</strong><br />
Beyond API management, and the analysis of API consumption, it is common for API providers to setup external monitors that keep an eye on whether APIs are up or down, and what their overall availability are. Providing a status dashboard showing whether APIs are available, which also often shows historical availability over time. The health and availability of an API is usually a barometer of the security of an API. Insecure, and compromised APIs often times have an unreliable availability and track record. Making monitoring critical to the overall security of API operations.</p>

<p><strong>Granular Testing of All APIs</strong><br />
Augmenting API management and monitoring, the most mature and secure API providers out there also run recurring tests on APIs, going beyond just seeing if they are up and available, and actually making sure they respond, and deliver the data and content that is expected. These tests will sometimes go further and test for the ability to publish bad data to APIs, input incorrect or additional information, and push the boundaries of what an API will respond to. Mimicking some of the behaviors in which malicious users and applications will perform, and testing the quality of the surface area of API.</p>

<p><strong>Security Scans For All APIs</strong><br />
Beyond granular tests for all APIs, more general security scans are regularly performed, looking beyond the potentially known security problems, and finding the more unknown issues. Scanning additional URLS, parameters, headers, and checking for holes, gaps, and other areas of the surface area for APIs which may have been overlooked or forgotten. Security scanning reflects the scanning that already occurs on most web and mobile applications, but will also consider many of the API specific vulnerabilities that we’ve seen behind breaches of the past, and those that are unique to API integration scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>API Security Is More About Building An Awareness</strong><br />
While API security centers around establishing a defensive perimeter around API resources, policing and enforcing rules along this perimeter, and encrypting all traffic, most of API security is realized through an awareness around how APIs are being accessed. API management, logging, monitoring, testing, and analytics provide an approach to understanding how data, content, media, and algorithms are being used, or not being used. Providing an evolved level of awareness that goes well beyond legacy web services and database connectivity.</p>

<p>API security should center around encryption, and common approaches to authenticating APIs. However, if they are not being properly monitored, tested, analyzed, and audited, a strong security perimeter, encryption, and strong authentication will not mean much. It is important for all key stakeholders involved in API operations to understand that API security is a balance between allowing for access and consumption, while also locking down, encrypting, and defending the perimeter. The API providers who find the most success with their API operations tend to strike a balance between these two opposing personalities of API security, making sure everything is secure, while also making sure providers, developers, and end-users feel secure while also being able to get access the resource they need to do their job.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/capital-one/capital-one-banking-home-page.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>When you take a look at the banking API landscape in the United States, there is one clear leader in the game–Capital One. Their <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">DevExchange</a> program is miles ahead of every one of their competitors, giving them a significant head start when it comes to the banking API economy. Their approach to delivering APIs meets all of my minimum requirements for any successful API platform, and even exceeds it, providing what I’d consider to be a leading example blueprint that all banking API providers should be following.</p>

<p>The Capital One DevExchange begins as any API operation should, with a dedicated portal located at developer.[domain]:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">developer.capitalone.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After landing on the home page for the Capital One DevExchange you get everything you need to get up and running with the APIs they have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/platform-documentation/getting-started/">Getting started</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/platform-documentation/authorization-with-oauth-20/">Authentication</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/sign-in/">Login</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/sign-up">Registration</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Capital One DevExchange provides four main groups of public APIs currently, started with access to account information in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Retrieve account products - /deposits/account-products (GET)</li>
  <li>Retrieve account product details - /deposits/account-products/{productId} (GET)</li>

</ul>

<p>Which you can actually sign up for and do a pre-qualification via APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create prequalification check - /credit-offers/prequalifications (POST)</li>
  <li>Create prequalification acknowledgment - /credit-offers/prequalifications/{prequalificationId} (POST)</li>

  <li>Retrieve rewards account details - /rewards/accounts/{rewardsAccountReferenceId} (GET)</li>
</ul>

<p>And details about merchants involved in transactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Retrieve merchant data - /merchant-insights/merchants (GET)</li>
  <li>Refresh merchant details - /merchant-insights/merchants/{merchantId} (GET)</li>
</ul>

<p>This version of the API is available in a sandbox and production environments:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/platform-documentation/using-the-sandbox/">Sandbox</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://api.reimaginebanking.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/capital-one/capital-one-hackathon-api.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>You can tell Capital One is moving cautiously with their public APIs, but they are definitely further along than other banks. Beyond what is publicly available in their sandbox and production environment they have another exploratory set of APIs coming from a project they call Nessie, <a href="http://api.reimaginebanking.com/">Capital One’s Hackathon API</a> that gives you access to a multitude of real public-facing data, such as ATM and bank branch locations, complete with mock customer account data. This set of APIs was used as part of a hackathon put on by the bank, but are worth showcasing as an example of where the bank is headed with their API road map.</p>

<p>By providing a pretty robust stack of API paths for working with accounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get all accounts - /accounts (GET)</li>
  <li>Delete a specific existing account - /accounts/{id} (DELETE)</li>
  <li>Get account by id - /accounts/{id} (GET)</li>

<ul>
  <li>Get all ATMs - /atms (GET)</li>
  <li>Get ATM by id - /atms/{id} (GET)</li>
</ul>

<p>And Bank Branches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get all branches - /branches (GET)</li>
  <li>Get branch by id - /branches/{id} (GET)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not sure what Capital One’s intentions are with introducing these APIs to the main stack of public APIs, but they are still available within a separate Hackathon sandbox environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://api.reimaginebanking.com/">Hackathon API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond the sandbox, hackathon, and production APIs available, Capital One provides all the expected support and communication channels that you expect out of an active API program:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/support/">Support</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer-support.capitalone.com/apex/DXSearchArticles">Knowledgebase</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/blogs/">Blog</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOneDevEx">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As well as not forgetting the required elements present from the legal department, helping set the tone for API engagements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.capitalone.com/identity-protection/privacy/statement">Privacy policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/single/terms-and-conditions/">Terms of service</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/open-source/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/capital-one/capital-one-open-source.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>Where the Capital One API program really begins to impress is with their usage of Github, and providing of open source solutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/capitalone">Capital One Github</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CapitalOne-DevExchange">Capital One Devexchange Github</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/open-source/">Open Source</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It isn’t easy doing Open Source in a highly regulated industry, and Capital One not only is doing it, <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/blog-post/open-source-in-a-regulated-environment-lessons-learned-on-our-open-source-journey-at-capital-one/">they actually share some of the story behind their struggle</a>. The open source projects they have been releasing, and the stories they’ve told about them on the blog tell just as important of a story as each of their APIs do. Further externalizing how the bank delivers technology at the bank, as well as with partners and 3rd party developers.</p>

<p>The Capital One DevExchange is what ALL US banks should be emulating. This isn’t just about publicly available APIs. This is about being able to deliver APIs consistently, in ways that are in sync with your lines of business. The more you can deliver this publicly, tell the story of it, and release open source code that demonstrates the value it brings, the more you will be able to do this internally, across groups, and amongst your partners. The biggest mistake any bank can be making in 2018 is thinking doing APIs is purely about retail banking. It is really about how agile and effective your bank will be leverage web technology internally, and externally within your company.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/death-valley-national-park_dali_three_just_road.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am not buying into all the hype around the recent serverless evolution in compute. However, like most trends I study, I am seeing some interesting aspects of how people are doing it, and some positive outcomes for teams who are doing it sensibly. I am not going all in on serverless when it comes to deploying or integrating with APIs, but I am using it for some projects, when it makes sense. I find AWS Lambda to be a great way to get in between the AWS API Gateway and backend resources, in order to conduct a little transformation. Keeping serverless as just one of many tools in my API deployment and integration toolbox, yet never going overboard with any single solution.</p>

<p>I put serverless into the same section of my toolbox as I do microservices. Serverless is all about decoupling how I deploy my APIs, helping me keep things doing small, meaningful things behind each of my API paths. Serverless forces me to think through how I am decoupling my backend, and pushes me to identify dependencies, acknowledge constraints, and get more creative in how I write code in this environment. To do one thing, and do it well, I need an intimate understanding of where my data and other backend resources are, and how I can distill a unit of compute down to the smallest unit as I possibly can. Identifying, reducing, and being honest about what my dependencies are is essential to serverless working or not working for me.</p>

<p>The challenge I’m having with serverless at the moment is that it can be easy to ignore many of the benefits I get from dependencies, while just assuming all dependencies are bad. Specifically around the frameworks I deploy as part of my API solutions. When coupled with AWS API Gateway this isn’t much of a problem, but all by itself, AWS Lambda doesn’t have all fo the other HTTP, transformation, header, request, and response goodness I enjoy from the API frameworks I’ve historically depend on. Showing me that understanding our dependencies is important, both good and bad. Not all dependencies are bad, as long as I am aware of them, have a knowledge of what they bring to the table, and it is a stable, healthy, and regularly evaluated relationships. This is a challenge I also come across regularly in microservices as well as serverless journeys, that we just throw things out for the sake of size, without thinking deeply about why we are doing something, and whether or not it is worth it.</p>

<p>I can see plenty of scenarios where I will be thinking that a serverless approach is good, but after careful evaluation of dependencies and constraints, I abandon this path as an option. I’m guessing we’ll see a goldilocks style of serverless emerge that helps us find this sweet spot. Similar to what we are finding with the microservices evolution, in that micro isn’t always about small–it is often just about finding the sweet spot between big and small, hot and cold, dependent and independent. Being sensible about how we use the tools in our API toolbox, and realizing most of these approaches are more about the journey, than they are about the actual tool.</p>

<p>Phil Sturgeon (<a href="https://twitter.com/philsturgeon">@philsturgeon</a>) alerted me to a pretty cool project he is cooking up, called <a href="https://github.com/wework/speccy">Speccy</a>. Which provides a rules engine for validating your OpenAPI definitions. “Taking off from where <a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc/">Mike Ralphson</a> started with linting in <a href="https://github.com/Mermade/swagger2openapi/">swagger2openapi</a>, Speccy aims to become the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">rubocop</a> or <a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> of OpenAPI”, and to “sniff your files for potentially bad things. “Bad” is objective, but you’ll see validation errors, along with special rules for making your APIs better.” Helping make sure your API definitions are as consistent as they possibly can be, and deliver on your API governance strategy (you have one right?)</p>

<p>With Speccy, there are a default set of rules, things like ensuring you have a summary or a description for each API path:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
	"name": "operation-summary-or-description",
	"object": "operation",
	"enabled": true,
	"description": "operation should have summary or description",

}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or making sure you add descriptions to your parameters:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
	"name": "parameter-description",
	"object": "parameter",
	"enabled": true,
	"description": "parameter objects should have a description",
	"truthy": "description"
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or making sure you include tags for each aPI path:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
	"name": "operation-tags",
	"object": "operation",
	"enabled": true,
	"description": "operation should have non-empty tags array",
	"truthy": "tags",
	"skip": "isCallback"
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you can get more strict by requiring contact information:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
	"name": "contact-properties",
	"object": "contact",
	"enabled": true,
	"description": "contact object should have name, url and email",
	"truthy": [ "name", "url", "email" ]&lt;br /&gt;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And make sure youi have a license applied to your API:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
	"name": "license-url",
	"object": "license",
	"enabled": true,
	"description": "license object should include url",
	"truthy": "url"
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Speccy is available <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/speccy">as a Node package</a>, which you can easily run at the command line. Speccy is definitely what is needed out there right now, helping us validate the growing number of OpenAPI definitions in our life. As many companies are thinking about how they can apply API governance across their operations, they should be looking at contributing to <a href="https://github.com/wework/speccy">Speccy</a>. It is something I’ve been talking with API service providers about for some time, but haven’t seen an open source answer emerge, that can help us develop rules for what we expect of our OpenAPI definitions.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openapi/openapi-logo.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>My only feedback right now, is that we need lots of people using it, and helping contribute rules. Oh, and wrap it in an API, and make it available as an easy to use, and deploy containerized microservice. Then lets get to work on the Github Gist-driven marketplace of rules, where I can publish the rules I develop across the projects I’m working on, and of the clients I consult with. Let’s get to work making sure there are a wealth of rules, broken down into different categories for API providers to choose from. Then let’s get API tooling and service providers to begin baking a Speccy rules engine into their solutions, and allow for the import and management of open source rules.</p>

<p>Speccy only works with OpenAPI 3.0, which makes sense if we are going to be moving forward with this conversation. Spreccy is how we will validate that banking APIs are PSD2 compliant. It is how we will ensure healthcare APIs support the FHIR specification. I have other suggestions for the CLI and API usage of Speccy, but I’d rather see investment in the available rules, before I make too many functional suggestions. I think the rules are where we will begin to define what we are looking for in an OpenAPI rules engine, and that should drive the Speccy features which end up on the road map.</p>

<p>While I wish everyone saw the modular potential of APIs and microservices like I do, I’ve come to the realization that most people are just interested in ready to go kits that walk them through every detail of doing APIs, rather than actually playing, learning, evolving, and learning to be productive with a big bucket of APIs. I’m not just focusing on business users here, I am talking about a significant portion of the developers I come across, who really don’t seem that interested in learning to apply API concepts, and understanding when and where to use them, they just want a set of instructions that walk them through each step of deploying an API.</p>

<p>I actually am a proponent of there being more boxed, lego style API kits that teach you how to build the product API, task API, press release API, and other common implementations. Robust, detailed, ready-to-go API implementations that would walk people through each and every step of defining, designing, deploying, managing, monitoring, testing, and documenting their API. I feel like this would significantly help folks think through what are healthy API practices, and be introduced to different ways of thinking around APIs. However, I do not want people to become reliant on only being able to operate within this paradigm, and not actually be able to fix, evolve, and deliver their own custom API solutions, using the healthy practices they are being introduced to.</p>

<p>People seem to just want shortcuts, and things done for them. People want the solutions packaged and delivered to their doorstep. They seem unable to be able to find the solutions on their own, or even be able to absorb a lesson delivered via a packaged solution. I’m not sure what the cure for this condition is. It is hard to tell whether it is vendor induced, or (would be) API provider induced. Have people been conditioned by vendors to just be spoon fed solutions? Or are people just lazy, and not interested in truly learning, truly tackling their technical debt, and finding a new path forward? IDK. I’m feeling like it is probably a little of both, feeding off of each other.</p>

<p>I get why the pre-built, ready-to-go Lego API kit is appealing. Everyone wants to have a full-blown millennium falcon when they are done working on a project, and not some blocky mcsquare flying machine. However, it takes time before you are able to deliver at that scope. You need to practice building smaller implementations, and yes playing with other pre-built kits, doing some reverse engineering, in addition to some forward engineering. I’m guessing this all comes down to if you truly want to know and understand, or if you are just looking for solutions. If you are just looking for solutions, I’m guessing in 5 years you’ll be eagerly buying the next solution for the API mess you are putting into place currently. It is the natural evolution of how technology gets bought and sold.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/02/introducing-Cloud-Billing-Catalog-API-GCP-pricing-in-real-time.html">Google launched their Cloud Billing Catalog API, providing access to thee pricing for their cloud API catalog</a> the other day. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/">Azure has their billing API</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">AWS has their cost explorer API service</a>, showing that programmatic access to what API resources cost, as well as management of usage, billing, invoicing, and other aspects of doing business with APIs is becoming the normal mode of operating an API platform.</p>

<p>I’ve long used AWS, Google, and increasingly Azure as a blueprint for what us smaller API providers should be doing. They are full of positive and negative lessons for any API provider. However, I’m starting to see what they are doing as not just a blueprint, but potentially something that will force many of us API providers out of businesses if we cannot emulate what they are doing at scale. The tractor beam that is the cloud providers is strong. They bring a lot of benefits to the table. So much so, it is getting harder and harder for independent API providers to compete. Offering benefits to consumers that will become deal breakers with using other 3rd party API providers services, pushing API consumers to stay within their chosen cloud platform walled garden.</p>

<p>As a developer, if I can programmatically manage the plans, pricing, and billing for ALL the APIs I use via AWS, Google, and Azure, but I have to manually manage this across many different 3rd party providers, I am going to be hesitant when it comes to adopting any new services that aren’t within my cloud domain. As I depend on more APIs, the benefits of being able to programmatically manage the business of my API consumption is becoming increasingly critical. If the individual 3rd party API providers I use don’t begin to offer APIs for managing the business of my API consumption, and adopting a standardized interface across all the APIs I depend on, I’m going to favor my cloud native API solutions over the 3rd party, and custom ones–giving cloud providers a significant advantage.</p>

<p>It is something that smaller API providers are going to have to start thinking about, and stop being special little snowflakes, and consider how they can start standardizing and being interoperable. Otherwise the cloud API providers are going to continue to gain marketshare, and everyone will just use the APIs available to use in the cloud. Reducing the competition, diversity, and utility that the API sector has become known for. We will just use Amazon, Google, and Azure APIs, and if they don’t have it, it probably won’t be done. Innovation will only occur within the cloud marketplaces, and be way less vibrant than the API sector we’ve enjoyed over the last decade.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" width="30%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m putting some thought into <a href="https://webapi-discovery.github.io/rfcs/rfc0001.html#content-types">the Schema.Org WebAPI Type Extension proposal</a> by Mike Ralphson (Mermade Software) and Ivan Goncharov (APIs.guru), to “facilitate better automatic discovery of WebAPIs and associated machine and human-readable documentation”. It’s an interesting evolution in how we define APIs, in terms of API discovery, but I would also add potentially at “execute time”.</p>

<p>Here is what a base WebAPI type schema could look like:</p>

<p>```{</p>

<p>“@context”: “http://schema.org/”,</p>

<p>“@type”: “WebAPI”,</p>

<p>“name”: “Google Knowledge Graph Search API”,</p>

<p>“description”: “The Knowledge Graph Search API lets you find entities in the Google Knowledge Graph. The API uses standard schema.org types and is compliant with the JSON-LD specification.”,</p>

<p>“documentation”: “https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/”,</p>

<p>“termsOfService”: “https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/terms”,</p>

<p>“provider”: {</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"@type": "Organization",

"name": "Google Inc."   } }```
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the proposed extensions could include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>versions</strong> (OPTIONAL array of <a href="https://schema.org/Thing">thing</a> -&gt; <a href="http://meta.schema.org/Property">Property</a> -&gt; <a href="http://schema.org/softwareVersion">softwareVersion</a>). It is RECOMMENDED that APIs be versioned using [semver]</li>
  <li><strong>entryPoints</strong> (OPTIONAL array of <a href="https://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a> -&gt; <a href="https://schema.org/Intangible">Intangible</a> -&gt; <a href="https://schema.org/EntryPoint">EntryPoint</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>license</strong> (OPTIONAL, <a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a> or <a href="http://schema.org/URL">URL</a>) - the license for the design/signature of the API</li>
  <li><strong>transport</strong> (enumerated <a href="http://schema.org/Text">Text</a>: HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP,  MQTT, WS, WSS etc)&lt;/p&gt;</li>
  <li><strong>apiProtocol</strong> (OPTIONAL, enumerated <a href="http://schema.org/Text">Text</a>:  SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, Hydra, JSON API, XML-RPC, JSON-RPC etc)</li>
  <li><strong>webApiDefinitions</strong> (OPTIONAL array of <a href="http://schema.org/EntryPoint">EntryPoints</a>) containing links to <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#machine-readable-api-definition" id="ref-for-machine-readable-api-definition-1">machine-readable API definition</a>s</li>
  <li><strong>webApiActions</strong> (OPTIONAL array of potential <a href="http://schema.org/Action">Actions</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The webApiDefinitions (EntryPoint) contentType property contains a reference to one of the following conten types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI / Swagger in JSON</strong> - application/openapi+json or application/x-openapi+json</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI / Swagger in YAML</strong> - application/openapi</li>
  <li><strong>RAML</strong> - application/raml+yaml</li>
  <li><strong>API Blueprint in markdown</strong> - text/vnd.apiblueprint</li>
  <li><strong>API Blueprint parsed in JSON</strong> - application/vnd.refract.parse-result+json</li>
  <li><strong>API Blueprint parsed in YAML</strong> - application/vnd.refract.parse-result+yaml</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the webApiActions property brings a handful of actions to the table, with the following being suggested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>apiAuthentication</strong> - Links to a resource detailing authentication requirements. Note this is a human-readable resource, not an authentication endpoint</li>
  <li><strong>apiClientRegistration</strong> - Links to a resource where a client may register to use the API</li>
  <li><strong>apiConsole</strong> - Links to an interactive console where API calls may be tested</li>
  <li><strong>apiPayment</strong> - Links to a resource detailing pricing details of the API</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully support extending the Schema.org WebAPI vocabulary in this way. It adds all the bindings needed to make the WebAPI type executable at runtime, as well as it states at discovery time. I like the transport and protocol additions, helping ensure the WebAPI vocabulary is as robust as it possibly can. webApiDefinitions provides all the technical details regarding the surface area of the API we need to actually engage with it at runtime, and webApiActions begins to get at some of the business of APIs friction that exists at runtime. Making for an interesting vocabulary that can be used to describe web APIs, which also becomes more actionable by providing everything you need to get up and running.</p>

<p>The suggestions are well thought out and complete. If I was to add any elements, I’d say it also needs a support link. There will be contact information embedded within the API definitions, but having a direct link along with registration, documentation, terms of service, authentication, and payment would help out significantly. I would say that the content type to transport and protocol coverage is deficient a bit. Meaning you have SOAP, but not referencing WSDL. I know that there isn’t a direct definition covering every transport and protocol, but eventually it should be as comprehensive as it can. (ie. adding AsyncAPI, etc. in the future)</p>

<p>The WebAPI type extensions reflect what we have been trying to push forward with our <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> work, but comes at it from a different direction. I feel there are significant benefits to having all these details as part of the Schema.org vocabulary, expanding on what you can describe in a common way. Which can then also be used as part of each APIs requests, responses, and messages. I don’t see APIs.json as part of a formal vocabulary like this–I see it more as the agile format for indexing APIs that exist, and building versatile collections of APIs which could also contain a WebAPI reference.</p>

<p>I wish I had more constructive criticism or feedback, but I think it is a great first draft of suggestions for evolving the WebAPI type. There are other webApiActions properties I’d like to see based upon my APIs.json work, but I think this represents an excellent first step. There will be some fuzziness between documentation and apiConsole, as well as gaps in actionability between apiAuthentication, and apiClientRegistration–thinks like application creation (to get keys), and opportunities to have Github, Twitter, and other OpenID/OAuth authentication, but these things can be worked out down the road. Sadly there isn’t much standardization at this layer currently, and I see this extension as a first start towards making this happen. As I said, this is a good start, and we have lots of work ahead as we see more adoption.</p>

<p>Nice work Mike and Ivan! Let me know how I can continue to amplify and get the word out. We need to help make sure folks are describing their APIs using Schema.org. I’d love to be able to automate the discovery of APIs, using existing search engines and tooling–I know that you two would like to see this as well. API discovery is a huge problem, which there hasn’t been much movement on in the last decade, and having a common vocabulary that API providers can use to describe their APIs, which search engines can tune into would help move us further down the road when it comes to having more robust API discovery.</p>

<p>I’ve been breaking down the work on banking APIs coming out of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/21/what-is-open-banking-in-the-uk/">Open Banking in the UK</a> lately. I recently took all their <a href="http://open.banking.blueprint.apievangelist.com/">OpenAPI definitions and published as a demo API developer portal</a>. Bringing the definitions out of the shadows a little bit, and showing was is possible with the specification. Pushing the project forward some more today I published <a href="http://open.banking.blueprint.apievangelist.com/#Open Banking - Directory APIs">the Open Banking API Directory specification to the project</a>, showing the surface area of the very interesting, and important component of open banking APIs in the UK.</p>

<p>The Open Banking Directory provides a pretty complete, albeit rough and technical approach to delivering observability for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/26/the-banking-api-actors-in-the-uk/">the UK banking industry API ecosystem actor layer</a>. Everyone involved in the banking API ecosystem in UK has to be registered in the directory. It provides profiles of the banks, as well as any third party players. It really provides an unprecedented, industry level look at how you can make API ecosystems more transparent and observable. This thing doesn’t exist at the startup level because nobody wants to be open with the number of developers, or much else regarding the operation of their APIs. Making any single, or industry level API ecosystem, operate as black boxes–even if they claim to be an “open API”.</p>

<p>Could you imagine if API providers didn’t handle their own API management layer, and an industry level organization would handle the registration, certification, directory, and dispute resolution between API providers and API consumers? Could you imagine if we could see the entire directory of Facebook and Twitter developers, understand what businesses and individuals were behind the bots and other applications? Imagine if API providers couldn’t lie about the number of active developers, and we knew how many different APIs each application developers used? And it was all public data? An entirely different API landscape would exist, with entirely different incentive models around providing and consuming gAPIs.</p>

<p>The Open Banking Directory is an interesting precedent. It’s not just an observable API authentication and management layer. It also is an API. Making the whole thing something that can be baked into the industry level, as well as each individual application. I’m going to have to simmer on this concept some more. I’ve thought a lot about collective API developer and client solutions, but never anything like this. I’m curious to see how this plays out in a heavily regulated country and industry, but also eager to think about how something like this might work (or not) in government API circles, or even in the private sector, within smaller, less regulated industries.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2018</span>
        <p>I have been learning all about <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">the banking API efforts out of Open Banking in the UK lately</a>. They are evolving a set of read / write account and transaction API, as well as public data APIs for some of the common information 3rd party developers are looking to get their hands on. I'm intrigued with the traction the organization has gotten, and I want to be able to fully understand what they are developing, as well help contribute where I can.</p>
<p>To help me understand the API specification, as well as hopefully contribute to the conversation, I am publishing <a href="http://open.banking.blueprint.apievangelist.com/">an blueprint API portal for the API</a>. It is a demo portal, running on Github, which uses the API Evangelist graphical look, but I am also publishing documentation for v1.1.1 of the account and payments API, as well as v2.1 of the public data APIs. I'm looking to publish the API specification like any bank would, but it won't actually be a live API--yet. I'd like to turn it into a mock API, with some virtualized data to demonstrate what is possible.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://open.banking.blueprint.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-banking/open-banking-accounts-documentation-screenshot.png" width="90%" align="center" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I've only had time to publish the overview of the project, and the documentation for each current version. I have a todo list of things I would like to invest in when I have more time. Eventually, I want it to be a complete, forkable Open Banking API portal that any bank in the UK could publish. Then I'm looking to create country specific versions to help push French, German, and other banks to push a portal. It doesn't have to be my solution that the banks use, but hopefully they'll at least use what I have provided as a blueprint. The goal isn't just to get them to use the portal, it is to get them implementing their bank's API developer portal in a standardized way--similar to the API specification from Open Banking, but this is the portal specification.</p>
<p>I will spend time on the portal over the next couple of weeks. If there is something you'd like to see accomplished, or something I'm missing entirely, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/european-banking-apis/open-banking-blueprint/issues">submit a Github issue for the project</a>. The project repository is a little messy right now as it is in full development, so if you fork, be careful--you might want to wait.</p>

<p>I had breakfast with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) and Matt McLarty (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>) of the CA API Academy team this morning in midtown this morning. As we were sharing stories of what each other was working on, the topic of what is needed to execute an API call came up. Not the time consuming find an API, sign up for an account, figure out the terms of service and pricing version, but all of this condensed into something that can happen in a split second within applications and systems.</p>

<p>How do we distill down the essential ingredients of API consumption into a single, machine readable unit that can be automated into what Mike Amundsen calls, “find and bind”. This is something I’ve been thinking a lot about lately as I work on my API discovery research, and there are a handful of elements that need to be present:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Having keys to be able to authentication.</li>
  <li><strong>Surface Area</strong> - What is the host, base url, path, headers, and parameters for a request.</li>
  <li><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - What are the legal terms of service for consumption.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing</strong> - How much does each API request cost me?</li>
</ul>

<p>We need these elements to be machine readable and easily accessible at discover and runtime. Currently the surface area of the API can be described using OpenAPI, that isn’t a problem. The authentication details can be included in this, but it means you already have to have an application setup, with keys. It doesn’t include new users into the equation, meaning, discovering, registering, and obtaining keys. I have a draft specification I call “API plans” for the pricing portion of it, but it is something that still needs a lot of work. So, in short, we are nowhere near having this layer ready for automation–which we will need to scale all of this API stuff.</p>

<p>This is all stuff I’ve been beating a drum about for years, and I anticipate it is a drum I’ll be beating for a number of more years before we see come into focus. I’m eager to see Mike’s prototype on “find and bind”, because it is the only automated, runtime, discovery, registration, and execute research I’ve come across that isn’t some proprietary magic. I’m going to be investing more cycles into my API plans research, as well as the terms of service stuff I started way back when alongside my API Commons project. Hopefully, moving all this forward another inch or two, and flesh out more of the machine readable components we’ll need at this layer.</p>
