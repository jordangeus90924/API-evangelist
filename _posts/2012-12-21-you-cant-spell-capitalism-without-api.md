I like a good API shirt.  If you've ever seen me in person you've seen my API Evangelist shirt(s).  At least you guys hope its multiple shirts, otherwise...ewwwee!

I recently started a new design - my [Che P.I. t-shirt.][2]  

There is an OG API t-shirt that recirculated this week for me--the [You Can't Spell Capitalism Without API][3].  This is an awesome shirt from the [social advertising platform, 140 Proof][4].  

140 Proof launched the shirt at the Twitter Chirp Conference, and I think it is a classic, that should never go away.

I'm ordering one for christmas!
