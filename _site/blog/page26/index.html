			<p>
I getting ready to heading to Berlin in the morning. I'm scheduled to speak at APIDays Berlin on Monday. APIDays is the sister site to #APIStrat, an event you will always find me at, no matter where it is at in the world.
APIDays has been pushing the conversation around APIs across Europe and the United States for a couple years now. While #APIStrat is focused on larger markets, and bigger events&mdash;APIDays is focused on new markets, and conversations within new business verticals, like the automobile API conversation, in San Francisco this June.
I&rsquo;m scheduled for the end of the day Monday, so my talk titled &ldquo;The Kin Lane Show&rdquo;, will be a summary of the current state of API space, while also integrating the other talks I will see throughout the day. Something that will helps me fine tune a talk for a local audience and specifically for APIDays Berlin.
Hopefully you already have your tickets, if not you can catch me at the end of May at APIDays Mediterranea in Barcelona, and at APIDays San Francisco in June.

			<p>Its official, the next edition of API Strategy will be in Chicago, September 24,25, and 26th 2014. We've dubbed this version of the conference, 'APIs Going Mainstream'! As APIs make their way into almost every business sector imaginable, we thought it would make sense to have an API conversation with some of the top brands, in the heartland of the United States--Chicago. We are kicking things off with six speakers: Ashe Dryden Ashe is an outspoken educator for diversity, inclusiveness, and empathy. She's currently writing a book on increasing diversity within companies, as well as working on a video series and site to serve as a resource to people who want to get involved.&nbsp; John Ellis As Global Technologist and Head of the Ford Developer Program with Ford Motor Company, John is tasked with expanding Ford&rsquo;s &ldquo;brought-in&rdquo; strategy of integrating mobile technology into the vehicle. John Musser John Musser is the CEO of API Science and previously founded ProgrammableWeb, the leading online resource on open APIs. Marten Mickos Marten Mickos is CEO of Eucalyptus Systems, the leader in open source cloud computing platforms for on-premise use. Previously as CEO of MySQL AB, Marten grew that company from a garage start-up to the second largest open source company in the world. Phil Windley Phil is the founder and CTO of Kynetx, which provides a cloud-based application platform that is uniquely architected to use events, personal data, and APIs to create social products and services. Pratap Ranade Pratap is the Co-founder of Kimono Labs - Kimono makes it easy for developers turn web data into APIs. His work on APIs and Big Data has been published in Forbes and the McKinsey Quarterly. This group of speakers represents what API Strategy &amp; Practice is all about, with speakers ranging API veterans like John Musser, pillars of the american economy from Ford, cloud computing pioneers, the future of APIs, and tech diversity leaders like Ashe Dryden. &nbsp; API Strategy...[<a href="/2014/05/01/come-talk-api-strategy-and-practice-in-chicago-september-2426th/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I spoke on the business of internal APIs at the IBM Impact conference in Las Vegas, this last Tuesday. About 15 people attended my talk, but the conversations I had with folks afterwards, signaled to me that my talk was a success.
I do not expect IBM or the enterprise to listen to my brand of API evangelism, but I&rsquo;m still determined to better understand the collision of the enterprise with the open  world of web APIs. Even if I convert just one or two individuals at any event, my mission was a success.

Impressed that IBM invited @kinlane to speak at #IBMImpact. Maybe this isn&rsquo;t your father&rsquo;s IBM!
&mdash; Michael Facemire (@ASocialFace) April 29, 2014

As I walked around the event talking to people I was reminded of how hungry the enterprise is for conversation about the API space that aren&rsquo;t linked to a product or particular company. As soon as people realize I have no sales pipeline, and I&rsquo;m genuinely trying to understand the space, and help them be successful, the tone always shifts dramatically.
You can find my slide deck for the talk on Github, unfortunately its in my minimalist style, so you need to have my narration&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll work on longer post to summarize what I covered during the talk. I&rsquo;ll have more thoughts on my experience at IBM Impact in Vegas, but will publish as separate posts across Kin Lane, and API Evangelist.

			<p><em>26 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying the API space exclusively for the last four years, and have worked hard to try and understand the space by studying the history of APIs, and as a result I can confidently say we are smack dab in the middle of what I consider to be an enterprise phase. In 2013 and 2014 I&rsquo;ve seen the enterprise across multiple business sectors turn their attention to this curiosity called the web API. So why is the enterprise so interested in APIs? Many technologists from the enterprise claim that it is no difference than their own earlier SOA efforts, but there has to be more under the hood, that is attracting the enterprise, beyond just a shiny new label, API&mdash;so what are they? Simplicity - Keep things small, modular and intuitive Access - You should be widening access to your resources, not ever limiting Openness - While not everything should be 100% open, be as open as possible Transparency - Provide insight into operations and your roadmap allowing consumers to operate in alignment Communication - Two way communication between you and your consumers Privacy - Protect the privacy of your consumers Ownership - Be open to alternative licensing and ownership of content and data that is favorable to consumers Legal - Be as open as you can be with copyright, patents and trademark in API initiatives Terms - Establish terms of use that favor your business, but also the interests of consumers Revenue - Acknowledge the monetization needs of your consumers Quantify - Define and understand how digital resources are being consumed If you're looking at the web API phenomenon purely through a technical lens, as many SOA practitioners do, you will not even see most of these characteristics&mdash;they are irrelevant to your tech driven goals.

			<p><em>25 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>The number of APIs in government has grown significantly in the last couple of years, increasing access to public data, potentially driving the private sector to build web and mobile apps around government resources data. Even with this growth in API deployment and resulting app development, this movement has been severely handicapped by one aspect&mdash;99% of these APis are read only, you cannot write data to government via APIs. APIs being a two way street is one of those subtle, but very important aspects of API operations that can define whether an API initiative will be success or not. Since government is so risk averse, most entities are afraid of what can happen when they launch APIs, and completely terrified around what will happen with an API that people can write data to. I&rsquo;ve been pushing for more read / write APis in government for some time now, and for the first time I'm seeing the potential for things to change, with a new beta API project from the We The People API. I couldn't think of a better program to test a writable API for, than We The People&mdash;pushing the democratic powers of web APIs. First, what is We The People? We the People is the White House's petitions platform -- giving people a new way to petition the government. The way it works is pretty simple: People can create or sign petitions on WhiteHouse.gov. If it gets enough support (i.e. signatures), it will receive an official response. And with more than 13 million users, it's been a big success. Second, why an API? An API opens up the petition platform to exist within any website, application and mobile applications. A read API allows for content to display on any site or app, and a write API allows for participation in the petition process via any site or app&mdash;changing the dynamics of the petition process, moving it off of just .gov websites, ultimately evolving...[<a href="/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I just finished up participating in an API specification session for Green Button data with Southern California Edison (SCE), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E), and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E). The discussion at one point during the last day was around &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; of huge data sets that a provider wants to allow for download over http. The group has been talking about scenarios for how this will work, and after over an hour they are getting to some pretty edge case scenarios surrounding &ldquo;chunking&rdquo;. As I listen, I can&rsquo;t help but thinking about he pros and cons of upfront planning vs. iterating on your API over time. Are they planning for scenarios that will never happen, and building in development time for use cases that may never become a reality? They know their data and industry best, so I am not educated enough to make a determination, but it doesn't stop me from having these thoughts. I understand that large companies, like wihtin the utility inudstry, have to plan as much as they can, as they operate in a pretty unforgiving environment when it involves physical integrations, government regulations, and other constraints in the industry. Even with this understanding, I think some larger institutions are very used to planning, and covering every possible scenario that they can think of, and in the process, spending unnecessary resources, and also limiting any positive unknowns from occurring. Developers from the open API space definitely have to better understand planning, and doing their due diligence before just leaping, but I also think the enterprise will have even more challenges when it comes to letting go and realizing the innovation that can occur around APIs. That you can cover your ass by considering the obvious negative scenarios, then building quality management tooling and processes, and identify other negative scenarios in realtime--when you actually have the data evidence to support.

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on education and university APIs for a while now, but after kicking off some work on the FAFSA API prototype, and preparing a response for to the request for information (RFI) on the use of APIs in higher education data and student aid process, I'm ramping up the time I&rsquo;m spending on education related APIs. APIs in higher education is also one of the areas 3Scale and API Evangelist are partnering, to help define what the API landscape looks like across higher education institutions, and as I do with other business sectors, we are looking to stimulate the API conversation amongst existing leaders from the space&mdash;online, and offline at as many events as we can. In support of all of this, I went through the API efforts of 10 institutions I&rsquo;m currently monitoring, to see what was new, reacquainting myself with what each of the institutions were up to. My primary goal was to establish a list of the common services that other universities could offer, based upon these existing API leaders, and I was well on my to compiling a pretty robust list, until I got to Brigham Young University (BYU), and I was blown out of the water. BYU wins the API deployment game within a university with the 261 web services they have listed in their registry. Every aspect of university operation is represented as a web service, and as you scan down the list, and you look at the XSDs, you realize how much work went into their API stack. There are definitely some interesting things going on at University of Washington, UC Berkeley and in Poland around university APIs, but BYU blows everyone away. I will go through the list of web service from BYU, clean up a little, and use to seed a general list of potential services that other universities could use when planning their own API program.

			<p><em>22 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>I was introduced to the ReliefWeb API last week, which provides information including reports, jobs, training, countries, and source details on global crises and disasters going back to 1996. The ReliefWeb API follows a trend of organizations realizing not just the potential of APIs for delivering content to mobile applications, but also the benefits of opening up publicly. As the site states: The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) originally built the ReliefWeb API to power a mobile version of the ReliefWeb website. Since then they have normalized the interfaces for public consumption, hoping that &ldquo;developers can build tools that increase exposure for valuable content and facilitate analysis for better decisions.&rdquo; The ReliefWeb API provides seven valuable API endpoints: Discovery - Providing discovery, navigability and insight into other APIs. Reports - Content API of updates, headlines and maps available on ReliefWeb. Jobs - Job offers available on ReliefWeb. Trainings - Training opportunities available via ReliefWeb. Countries - Countries from Reliefweb. Disasters - Disasters tracked on as part of ReliefWeb. Sources - Sources of information available on ReliefWeb. The design of the API is pretty well thought out, providing some common, as well as some forward thinking technical elements: Documentation - Detailed information about all API endpoints, including content types, versions, data model, including full text and interactive version using Swagger. Hypermedia - Control links facilitate paging, deep cross-linking of content allows navigating between related resources, and all resources can be reached by drilling down from the top level of the API at http://api.rwlabs.org. Caching - Uses Cache-Control headers to point out how often ReliefWeb recommends checking for updates. I started playing around making some calls and enjoyed the way the API flows, and excited about the potential. I do have some critique of the implementation, with the hope of influencing their roadmap. Side Project The API initiative has a very side project feel.

			<p><em>18 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve been involved in a lot of conversations lately around turning government forms into APIs. Which seems like a great idea, right up until the part where I&rsquo;m thinking about the original workflow represented by many legacy forms, and realize that maybe this form was a bad idea to begin with.
If I develop an API for a form, and the original form all by itself is a bad idea, am I just making a bad idea worse, by attaching an API to it? I'd say yes!
I don&rsquo;t feel like this will be true in all situations. I think APIs will allow us to hopefully break free of what the original intent of a form was, explore new opportunities for gathering and managing data, and changing the concept of what a form is.
Even with the potential, I can&rsquo;t help but think APIs on forms may not be good in all scenarios. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t just limited to forms, before we attach an API to anything, we should probably think&mdash;is this a good idea?

			<p><em>17 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The first consumer of all of my APIs, including my screen capture API is me. I develop my APIs first for my use, and only recently have decided to make available to the public. So when I sat down to create my service composition for my APIs, I needed to figure out what I was going to do about my internal consumption.
My first instinct was that I didn't need to include my internal API consumption alongside my partner and public API consumption. I quickly changed my tune as I realized that it was going to be important that I monitor my own API usage in the exact same ways I would partners or public consumers.
I need to better understand how I consume my own APIs, identify security breaches or just unhealthy ways I&rsquo;m consuming my own API resources. I've seen too many APIs like Instagram and even Tesla get burned by not having the proper management layer on their own internally consumed APIs--allowing hackers to get through doorways that weren't monitored.
While my internal API usage won't be billed as it will with my partner, retail or wholesale API consumers, it will be tracked, limited and analyzed alongside the other target API consumption groups.
I need to understand how my API resources are being consumed, and this includes my own usage. This is a very important lesson for all of us API providers to understand, helping us see the complete picture of how APIs are put to use.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>The biggest impact APIs will have at your company will be the internal, cultural change regarding how you do business. We are in the middle of an explosion of APIs, and while there are many new public APIs emerging, the majority of growth is coming from the deployment of internal APIs. There is a lot that companies can learn from the open API movement over the last fourteen years, with many building blocks, and healthy practices that can be applied when internally deploying APIs. This is a topic I will be exploring on API Evangelist, and at the IBM Impact conference at the Venetian in Las Vegas, NV&mdash;April 27th through May 1st. The abstract from my talk, titled "Business of Internal APIs&rdquo; is: The largest area of growth in the last couple years of APIs is internally within the enterprise. There are numerous lessons that can be extracted from the world of public APIs, and applied internally within any company, helping increase agility, efficiency, while also helping develop new business lines. When it comes to APIs, the secret to success isn&rsquo;t all about technology, and this session will help introduce you to the business of internal APIs, extracted from the approach of leaders in the space. In my experience there are fundamental elements that make APIs successful, where more classic approaches like service oriented architecture (SOA) fall short. When companies are deploying APIs for internal consumption, you have to consider elements like self-service access, up to date API docs, code samples, and the human elements, that have made public API deployments successful. Even though internal APIs consumers will have some unique needs that your partner or public API consumers won't, there will also be many similar patterns across your internal, partner and public API customers that you will need to leverage.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>If you read my blog regularly, you know I am constantly pushing the boundaries of how I see the API space, and sometimes my ramblings can be pretty out there, but API Evangelist is how I work through these thoughts out loud, and hopefully bring them down to a more sane, practical level that everyone can understand. My crazy vision for the day centers around virtual API stack composition, as beautiful as the Absolut Drinks Database API. Ok, before you can even begin to get up to speed with my crazy rant, you need to be following some of my rants around using virtual cloud containers like we are seeing from docker, AWS and OpenShift, and you need to watch this video from APIStrategy &amp; Practice about Absolut Drink Databse API deployment. Ok, you up to speed? Are you with me now? Today, as I was playing around with the deployment of granular API resources using AWS CloudFormations, I was using their CloudFormer tool, that allows me to browse through ALL of my AWS cloud resources (ie. DNS, EC2 Servers, S3 Storage, RDS Databases), and assemble them into a CloudFormation Templates, which is just a JSON definition of this stack I&rsquo;m going to generate. Immediately I think of the presentation from Absolut, and how they spent years assembling the image and video parts and pieces that went into the 3500 drinks they wanted available via their API, for developers to use when developing interactive cocktail apps. They had 750 images, and video clips, with a combination of 30K mixing steps, that went into the generation of the 3500 drink combinations. * mind blown * Now give me this same approach but for composing virtual API stacks, instead of cocktails. With this approach you could define individual API resources such as product API or screen capture API. These are all independent API resources, with open source server and client side code, openly licensed interface via API...[<a href="/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am evolving my own approach to deploying my API resources, and I needed an important sounding name for it, so came up with &ldquo;operational harness&rdquo; over a couple pints of IPAs. Ok, so what do I mean when I say operational harness?
Based upon the way that I evolve my stories, I evolve my API projects in real-time with the help of Github. For my screen capture API I will be focusing on delivering four separate architectural pieces:

Open Source Version - An open source, server implementation of my screen capture API, which will PHP initially with other languages next.
API Service - A publicly accessible, cloud version of the screen capture API, allowing users to a certain amount of calls in a specific time frame before they are charged a per call rate, depending on their service their. 
API Containers - OpenShift and AWS CloudFormation version of the screen capture API for rapid deployment in cloud environment.
Wholesale Service - A wholesale version of the screen capture that a partner can pay me to deploy and / or manage in mine or theirs cloud environment.

I call this my operational harness because I will be operating live instances of these components, scaling as I need in the cloud, but will also be maintaining the open source version, and container versions on Github, while also supporting wholesale deployment. &nbsp;My definition will act as a sort of harness holding together all the architectural pieces of the screenshot API, but also in sync with other utility APIs I will be deploying--helping guide me as I push it all forward.
I&rsquo;m enjoying putting together my strategy around my own API platform. It gives me some good material to work through for stories here on the blog, and helps me push forward with new approaches to API deployment, like deploying and scaling in virtual containers, and providing wholesale access to resources.

			<p>
If you aren&rsquo;t already familiar with Traffic and Weather, it is an extremely structured discussion between John Sheehan&nbsp;(Runscope) and&nbsp;Steve Marx&nbsp;(Dropbox), about "the latest API and cloud tools, news and technologies&rdquo;.
Its not often I learn something new from the show (kidding), but today I learned about two new things:



  
Flask RESTful - Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. It is a lightweight abstraction that works with your existing ORM/libraries. Flask-RESTful encourages best practices with minimal setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTful should be easy to pick up.


  
Flynn - Flynn simplifies deploying and maintaining applications. Instead of using complex configuration management systems, Flynn allows self-serve management of containerized deployments, making life easier for ops and developers.



Its nice to hear more discussion about the evolution of deploying API resources and micro services, and the use of virtual containers from Docker, OpenShift and Cloud Formations&mdash;especially since its a topic Traffic and Weather and API Evangelist have discussed before. ;-)
Seriously though, they put on a good show, forward thinking API conversation, with lots of humor and not-so-funny humor mixed in. I always recommend listening when you have time, you might learn a thing or two about APIs along the way.&nbsp;
Tip: If it sounds like the show is almost over, it is. Turn off the podcast.

			<p>
I look at a lot of API developers areas in my work, and the first sign I see that nobody is home behind an API, is that their blog is out of date.
I found myself at the ESPN developer center last night, clicked on the blog, which has a great tag line of &ldquo;API-focused musings and rambling&rdquo;, but alas hasn't been updated in over a year.
Your API developer blog posts do not have to be anything master planned, and should just be thoughts from the daily life of running your API. A little effort goes a long way on your API developer blog, and when it becomes out of date, it also will send a strong signal to developers&mdash;nobody is home, don&rsquo;t use this API.
Make sure your API-focused musing and ramblings occur more than once very year, I know that personally I need it daily, but maybe you need it a little less frequent. ;-)

			<p>
Its not often I find myself referencing Cisco when it comes to shedding light on interesting practices for the API space, but today is not your usual day.
At some point yesterday, I found myself at cisco.com, and I stumbled across their social page, which gives equal real estate to their blog, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Youtube channel, as well as highlights from their community forum.

I like the idea of having a page like this for API providers. It helps you establish a single page, that can act as a one-stop shop for getting information about what is going on within an API community.
From a planning perspective it also helps providers understand they need to have more than one channel when it comes to providing API support via social channels.
Cisco&rsquo;s social media page is a pretty basic example, but I think a potentially powerful one that API providers can follow when organizing their own social platform, for their own API communities.

			<p>I just wrote up a piece about how to deploy an API driven application backend using Orchestrate.io, and wrote a piece last week on API deployment using Solr and government data. After writing about both of these approaches, I can't shake the thought that external, API driven approaches like this will become commonplace in the next couple of years. Both the approach using Solr, and the other using Orchestrate.io, identify that data is available via a machine readable data dump and even an API, but neither solution provide the simple web API access that would make application development easy. In both these stroies, 18F and Orchestrate.io are both looking to just get the job done, achieving their development goals--in one case deploy an API of federal business opportunities, and the other is to build a web application that will make browsing super hero characters easier. Granted these two scenarios have radically different outcomes, but both share a common approach to meeting their goals: Orchestrate.io - Uses Orchestrate.io to extract, store and normalize data from the Marvel API, making it much more accessible, searchable and usable in their MarvelousDB web application FBOpen - Uses Solr to mount and index business opportunities with the federal government in an XML dump, then deliver a web API so they can build the web interface for FBOpen, but also provide an open source API that anyone can use as is, or deploy on their own infrastructure Both of these approaches are all about making the data and content they need for web and mobile apps, easily accessible via a simple API. Both of these projects acknowledge the data source they have to work with doesn&rsquo;t meet their exact requirements, but for very different reasons. One project uses open source software to tackle their problems, while the other uses the latest cloud services to provide a solution&mdash;both get the job done.

			<p><em>15 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
There is a great post over on the Orchestrate.io blog about how they deployed a backend for the MarvelousDB app, using data from the Marvel API, allowing you to explore the world of Marvel comic book characters, through a simple web interface
As developers often face with valuable API resources, the Marvel API leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to available interfaces, data access, and rate limit restrictions. This is common with new APIs, where it takes time to understand the right levers and dials to turn, that will make the API more usable by developers.
Even with these challenges, the Orchestrate team wanted to build the MarvelousDB so they could easily browse the world of Marvel comic book characters, putting the Marvel API to use, but also showing what is possible when using Orchestrate.io. The result is a great example of dynamically building a backend from API resources, in a way that delivers the access and performance you need.

To deliver the MarvelousDB the project employs Node.js, Express.js, Orchestrate.js, Handlebars for templating, and Q for async operations. Using the Marvel API, they pull the data they needed to drive the app, pulling it into Orchestrate.io, giving them the data model and performance they needed, but also adding in capabilities like full text search on top of the data&mdash;something that isn&rsquo;t available from the Marvel API alone.
MarvelousDB is an great example of what is possible via the API driven, database as a service platform Orchestrate.io, but is also a great model to follow when developing web or mobile applications that depend on APIs. Sometimes APIs aren&rsquo;t structured exactly as we need, and we can use platforms like Orchestrate.io, to well&hellip;orchestrate exactly the backend experience we need to get the job done.

This gave me an opportunity to update my list of APIs that I depend on, adding about 4 or 5 new ones. First I depend on a couple of the core Google APIs: Gmail - Integrate my daily emails, as well as email blasts with my administrative system Google Contacts - Keep business and individual profiles in my admin system in sync with my daily Google Contacts activity. Google Calendar - Publish hackathon calendars to Google Calendar as well as keep conferences, meetups and other events I pull through APIs and curate in sync Google Docs - Publish copies of blog posts to Google Docs, as well as version of pages from my content management system to Google Docs Google Sites - All of my research is in Google Sites. So I tend to publish lists of curated news, blog posts and other research to wiki pages under specific projects Next, I would say Amazon Web Services delivers some pretty critical APIs I can't live without: Amazon EC2 - I deploy and shutdown various EC2 instances for various jobs I run for API Evangelist.

I need to compose some tiers of access to my screen capture API, that makes sense to my business goals and how it will be consumed by a variety of users. So far I&rsquo;ve come up with five levels of access to my API: Private / Internal - This is where my API is consumer currently, internally my own systems. I need this tier to be unlimited use, no charge, but still tracking on how I am consuming the screen capture API so I can evaluate along with all my other service levels. Private / Partner - I have partners who can make use of my screen capture API, I want to offer them special access to my resource, but I still want to track on how they are using the resource.

			<p>
I reviewed the deployment the FBOpen API the other day, which is a simple API resource of&nbsp;business&nbsp;opportunities with the U.S. Federal Government. An interesting aspect of the FBOpen implementation was that 18F used Solr to deploy the API layer.
Solr is an open source search tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation, which can take any document store and easily generate a simple, yet pretty powerful web API&mdash;opening up access to content, without costly infrastructure. I showcased how the Free Law Project launched the Court Opinion API, using Solr, opening up access to archives of legal documents from across the country.
18F took XML dumps of business opportunities from FBO.gov, then deployed Apache Solr as the API layer. You can download or fork 18F&rsquo;s FBOpen API, and deploy the API in your own infrastructure. This provides a pretty interesting blueprint for how government can easily open up data, then launch an API for developers to build on top of.
I&rsquo;m thinking that government data dumps, plus web API deployed using Solr, plus interactive documentation deployed via Github, combined with frictionless API access via api.data.gov or 3Scale, open licensing and terms of use&mdash;all sounds like a pretty health formula for open, reusable government API infrastructure.
Along with other healthy patterns for API design, deployment, management and evangelism I find out in the API space, I think what 18F has done with the FBOpen API, needs highlighting. I think government data plus web API using Solr is a recipe I&rsquo;d like to see used across all government projects.

I will be asking some questions of each online service, questions like, why do I use this service? does this service have an API? Questions that will help me establish a profile of that service, to better understand how I use it, and whether there is any valuable content or information I should be organizing in a better way. I produce a lot of content each day, and on the surface it seems like I maintain control over most of this, but in reality my content resides in online services like Twitter, LinkedIn, and other places that I frequent daily. I do a pretty good job of centrally managing the blog content I generate each day. I have a central CMS where I create my blog entries, and then syndicate to my network of 60+ Github repositories, that use Github Pages + Jekyll. When it comes to my social media streams, I do a very poor job of maintaining control over my network. I do not store my Tweets, Facebook, Linked or other social streams anywhere. I don&rsquo;t centrally sync my network of friends and business contact, until recently. I now have a central CRM alongside my blog CMS, but I&rsquo;m just getting started there. Overall, there is just a lot of content I generate on the Internet, and in addition to understanding my online footprint, to make sure it is secure, I want to make sure I maintain as much control over the intellectual exhaust I generate each day, as I can.

I purchased kin lane.com from a website hosting provider I found online, and after they drained over 1K from my bank account for a simple $10.00 website and domain purchase, they proceeded to squat on my domain for almost two years. Eventually I got my domain back, but it taught me some serious lessons about navigating this new online world we were creating for ourselves. Fast-forward ten years, and I&rsquo;ve not just learned a lot more about operating online, I have generated quite a bit of content, and value within my domain, giving me even more reason to protect not just my domain, but my brand. I produce a lot of content online, in the form of Tweets, blog posts, and other online exhaust from my daily life as the API Evangelist, and it is in my best interest to control as much of this content as I can. While I have my online brand to protect, and overall I have a heightened awareness around my online persona, this is something everyone should learn about. You may not have a valuable blog, online portfolio or other valuable online assets, but eventually you might. No matter who you are online, you should work to understand where your content, images, video and other assets you generate reside, and retain as much control over them as possible. The business model of major companies like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Instagram and Youtube are all based upon you generating valuable content that people want to view, which then allows these companies to generate revenue by selling advertising or access to your (their) content.

			<p>I have been using 3Scale API Infrastructure to manage API Evangelis's public APIs for almost two years now. My APIs provide access to my blog posts, news I curate, and the tools I track on. I also use the same infrastructure to secure and manage various projects I work on. You can view a list of my APi deployments on my API account management home page. In reality I haven't been all that serious about the management of my APIs until now. I have enough content I&rsquo;d like to make available via APIs, and I have a growing number of new APIs, some of which I'd like to make available for a fee, and see if I can&rsquo;t generate some new revenue streams off my research. Until now I've been on the 3Scale base plan, which is free and allows for 150,000 API transactions a day, and all the API management tools I needed to get going. This has been plenty for me to get my APIs established, but now I&rsquo;d like to be able to generate more API transactions, as well as be able to bill for API usage if I choose. With this in mind I've finally upgraded beyond the basic 3Scale plan to the plus plan, which at $125.00 / month gives me up to 250,000 calls a day, and the ability to charge for access to select APIs, opening up the possiblity to generate revenue on some of my content and programmatic resources. The ability to sign up, deploy and management my APIs until I found my way, has been essential to me getting to this point. I would not have been able to play with different configurations of access to my APIs, without 3Scale. This ability to on-board into the world of APIs, experiment and iterate, before having to pay a monthly fee is essential to many companies figuring out what this whole API thing is about. I&rsquo;m pretty excited...[<a href="/2014/04/12/moving-beyond-my-basic-3scale-api-infrastructure-plan/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>Earlier this year I created a screen capture API, filling a need I have across my network&mdash;capturing an image snapshot of any web page. Not all APIs are created the same, but I think this screen capture API represents a very fundamental layer of the API economy, the utility API. This API isn't Twitter or Google Maps, it does one thing and it does it well&mdash;something most APIs should work hard to achieve. I've been using my screen capture API internally for several months now, and I think it is time to do more with it. I want to make this API available publicly, but I don&rsquo;t want to just make freely available to anyone on the open Internet, to use as much as they want. I want to create an access layer, using 3Scale API infrastructure management that allows me to control who has access, and what they can, or cannot do with it. To help me plan the next steps for my screen capture API I'm working on: Service Composition - An outline of the different ways I will sell access to my screen capture API Operational Harness - An overview of how I will deliver these API services to my target customers My goal in all of this is to generate stories for API Evangelist, but I also want to push forward my own understanding of how API resources can be delivered, and what better way than providing my own APIs. I have a number of other APIs I would consider very utility in nature, that I want to launch, but I&rsquo;m going to focus on just the screen capture API for now, and try to establish a blueprint I can use across all of my APIs. I will publish my screen capture API service composition and operational harness as separate blog posts. Then I will look at actually deploy the API in accordance with my service composition, and establish an operational...[<a href="/2014/04/11/next-steps-for-my-screen-capture-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>As the API Evangelist I spend a lot of time cheering for companies to have APIs, and in 2014 I&rsquo;m continuing a slow shift from cheerleading to calling out companies who do not have an API. If you are an older company or institution I will be a lot more forgiving about whether or not an API exists, but with newer tech companies, there is NO excuse --an API is mandatory! As a digital citizen in 2014, you should not use any online service that doesn&rsquo;t allow for data portability, which starts with the ability to just download a complete file of all your account settings and data, and is fully realized when a fully read/write API exists, with the support of a healthy, vibrant API community. If a company doesn&rsquo;t provide you with these basic data portability features, you are most likely in a hostage situation where you are generating content and value for a company, with no say in how your content is used, monetized or even removed. I am reminded of an example of a modern tech company, who is harvesting the knowledge and wisdom of the crowd, but offers nothing back in return to its users, by Andy Baio (@waxpancake): Worth noting: Quora has no public API, no backup/export tools, blocks anonymous display of answers, and banned the Wayback Machine entirely. &mdash; Andy Baio (@waxpancake) April 9, 2014 After I retweeted Andy&rsquo;s reminder, one of my followers said they would like to retweet, but they want to make sure it was true. Andy said to go look for their self, and that after over 300+ retweets nobody had challenged his statement--which the reply was he didn't have time. Well I have time to go look, and verify whether or not Quora has an API&mdash;let&rsquo;s take a look, and what better way than to just ask Quora! Does a Quora API exist? The short answer is yes.

			<p>I am playing with different ways of explaining the 100K view of how companies, and ultimately governments will participate in the API economy. As with APIs themselves, visualizing something like how an API platform can position itself in the emerging API economy, is very difficult to do&mdash;something that takes refinement, something I do by blogging, so here we go... Much like developers are looking into the details of each API call, using API integration tools like RunScope and APITools, to better understand how their applications are consuming APIs, API providers need to understand all the moving parts involved with successfully executing an API strategy.

			<p><em>10 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I just published a post showcasing Socrata's use of Github to deploy their new open data and API developer portal. There are numerous reasons for using Github as part of your API management strategy, with one of the main reasons being the collaborative features that Git, and the social coding platform Github introduce.
I've had the news about Socrata&rsquo;s new developer portal open for over a day now, and what triggered that story was seeing a link to the regulations API on data.gov, which not only just uses Swagger for the API definition, it employs a simple portal that is deployed using Github pages.
Deploying API developer areas on Github, using Github pages is nothing new, we've been doing it a while now. However there is a groundswell within federal government recently, so I think its worth noting&mdash;hoping other open data and API folks in government jump in too!
I like the basic layout of the regulations API portal. It is a simple overview, changelog, terms of service and interactive API documentation using Swagger. Then demonstrating one of the biggest benefits of deploying your developer portal on Github, it simply says: &ldquo;Help Improve This Content&rdquo;, directing users to edit, fork and submit a pull requests on the portal&rsquo;s Github repository&mdash;enabling anyone to improve the portal content, with the approval of the API administrator of course.

			<p><em>10 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The end of last year I was asked to spent time thinking about three things: 1) An API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)  2) Next steps for the Green Button API 3) API strategy for the overall United States Government. I managed to find the bandwidth to get two of the three projects active, but neglected to spend time on the Green Button API.
To support my research I established a Green Button API repository on Github, where  will track all my work. My goal is to pull together all the existing pieces of the Green Button API into one place, and evolve a strategy for taking Green Button API the next step. Like I did with the FAFSA API, I just want to explore what is possible, and jump start a conversation either within government and outside with other 3rd parties.
I've spent a few hours gathering what elements I could find about Green Button&mdash;existing sites, APIs, code, documentation, etc. Over the next couple of weeks I will spend more time connecting the dots, and tell the story via my Green Button API project blog.
If you have any resources I should consider, or would like to provide any feedback, you can use the Github issue management for the Green Button API repository.

			<p>Civic data platform Socrata has launched a new developer area to support developers who are building apps on top of city, county, state and federal data, as well as the publishers of this data. A release of a new developer area is always worthy of note in my tracking of the API space&mdash;anytime I see a tweet or blog post about the release of new developer area, I will visit to see what is going on. The first thing I find particularly interesting about Socrata&rsquo;s approach is that they published as a Github repository, using Github Pages. We are seeing more government developer areas move onto Github, because of the easy site hosting with Github Pages, and the benefits of managing your projects with Git, as well as social benefits of Github and its underlying API. Application Developers Socrata provides a wealth of information for application developers, including a getting started guide, robust API documentation, client libraries, and D3.js assistance for those looking to build visualizations on top of government data. Data Publishers On the other side of the coin, Socrata also provides data publishers with what they need to get started, clean and organize their data, and the ability publish or sync with the Socrata platform, providing R, Ruby and Java libraries that really jumpstart integration. The second thing I really like about the new Socrata portal is that it is more educational than it is technical, and tailored to onboard the next generation of government data publishers and consumers. Socrata doesn&rsquo;t just provide details about API endpoints, they provide information on what is JSON and HTTP verbs. From years of experience, Socrata has a firm grasp of the amount of education the space needs to get up to speed, and it shows in their developer portal. To provide some critique of the implementation, the formatting of the text wasn&rsquo;t the easiest to consume.

			<p>The mission of API Evangelist is all about bringing awareness of APIs to the masses. The biggest challenge I face in doing this, is that API Evangelist is primarily a blog, which means a chronological listing of content I produce. When you are new to the API space, you can start with home page, but then you have to start sprinting to keep up with what I'm dish'n up on the blog. I have been working to address this by deploying other static research sites like design, deployment, management, evangelism, monetization for API providers, and discovery and integration on the API consumption side&mdash;however, even with this work its not enough. This is why its great to see other resources emerge that help new API providers and consumers get up to speed on the space, while still remaining informative for the advanced users, or anywhere on the API proficiency spectrum. In this case I&rsquo;m talking about API Codex , the curated site for API news from 3Scale--if you want to find the best articles from the API space, addressing all levels of expertise, API Codex is the resource you are looking for. The first thing you see when you land on API Codex: Just getting started? Check out our API101 page! Then you can browse the best articles from the space, by level of expertise, and by tag, as well as find the best API stories organized by author. This isn&rsquo;t just a random stream of articles from the API space, it is the best of the best from the API space. There is also an API tools section along with the API news, showcasing the best in tooling for both API providers and consumers. As the API universe expands we are going to have to get better at organizing the most valuable educational API resource, and making them accessible to users.

			<p>Scraping has been something I&rsquo;ve done since I first started working on the web. Sometimes you just need some data or a piece of content that isn't available in a machine readable format, and the only way is to get it scrape it off a web page. Scraping is widespread, but something very few individuals or companies will admit to doing. Just like writing scripts for pulling data from APIs, I write a lot of scripts that pull content and data from websites and RSS feeds. Even though I tend to write my own scripts for scraping, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching the new breed of scraping tools like Scraperwiki: ScraperWiki ScraperWiki is a web-based platform for collaboratively building programs to extract and analyze public (online) data, in a wiki-like fashion. "Scraper" refers to screen scrapers, programs that extract data from websites. "Wiki" means that any user with programming experience can create or edit such programs for extracting new data, or for analyzing existing datasets. The main use of the website is providing a place for programmers and journalists to collaborate on analyzing public data I was first attracted to Scraperwiki as a way to harvest Tweets, and further interested by their web and PDF extraction tools. Scraperwiki has already been around for a while, founded back in 2010, and recently there is a new wave of scraping tools that have emerged: import.io Importio turns the web into a database, releasing the vast potential of data trapped in websites. Allowing you to identify a website, select the data and treat it as a table in your database. In effect transform the data into a row and column format. You can then add more websites to your data set, the same as adding more rows and query in real-time to access the data. Kimono Kimono is a way to turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds.

			<p>When I first started API Evangelist, I wanted to better understand the business of APIs, which really focused on API management. Over the course of four years, the list of companies delivering API management services has expanded with new entrants, an evolved with acquisitions of some of the major players. Visit my API management research site for more news, companies, tools and analysis from this part of API operations. API Management In 2011, people would always ask me, which API management company will help you with deployment? For a while, the answer was none of them, but this soon changed with new players emerging, and expanding of services from existing providers. To help me understand the expanding API lifecycle I started two new separate research areas: API Design API Deployment Once you design, deploy your API, and you get a management plan in place, you have to start looking at how you are going to make money and get the word out. In an effort to better understand the business of APIs, I setup research sites for researching the monetizationand evangelizing of APIs: API Evangelism API Monetization As the API space has matured, I started seeing that I would have to pay better attention to not just providing APIs, but also better track on the consumption of APIs. With this in mind I start looking into how APIs are discovered and what service and tools developers are using when integrating with APIs: API Discovery API Integration While shifting my gaze to what developers are up to when building applications using APIs, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the rapidly expanding world of backend as a service, often called BaaS: Backend as a Service (BaaS) As I watch the space, I carefully tag interesting news, companies, services and tools that have an API focus, or influence the API sector in any way.

I stumbled into a pretty interesting use of Github yesterday, which I&rsquo;m seeing as part of a greater push from our government to use the popoular social coding platform. The government blog Govfresh held a live chat session with FCC CIO David Bray (@fcc_cio), where some really interesting questions were asked of the very progressive CIO.
I&rsquo;m going to break up a few of the questions into separate blog posts, what I wanted to highlight in this post was the use of Github as a chat forum, showing once again that the platform isn&rsquo;t just about managing code, but can be used to openly manage a multitude of collaborative government technical operations.
Luke Fretwell (@lukefretwell) opened up the discussion which ran for about an hour, asking Bray several questions, and then Steve Spiker (@spjika), myself and the infamous Alex Howard (@digiphile) chimed in with further questions&mdash;making for a pretty interesting discussion.
Govfresh used Gitchat, a way of turning Github Issue Management + Github APIs into a chat thread, for the conversation. I like this approach to managing and controlling a live conversation, with the ability to archive for future use. I think it is also a great way to help people in government understand that Github is more than just code, it is also about being very social and collaborative around technical ideas.

			<p>There has been some great coverage of the new group of tech specialists out of the GSA, dubbed 18F. According to their own home page, 18F: ...builds effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between government and the people and businesses it serves. We help agencies deliver on their mission through the development of digital and web services. I know most of the team members from my work with the GSA, and my own time (albeit short) as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and I am extremely optimistic about the potential of the team. This optimism is being seriously validated after looking through the groups recent release of the FBOpen API, which is a simple API resource to get access to opportunities to do business with the U.S. Federal Government. Use Existing Tools The 18F demonstrates their tech chops by not re-inventing the wheel when it comes to designing and developing the FBOpen API. After they downloaded the existing business opportunity XML dumps from FBO.gov, they employed Apache Solr to develop a thin API layer on top of the files. Solr does two things well, it provides a REST interface on top of document stores, and supports the Lucene query syntax, which provides a powerful query interface on top of the simple API. Beyond Solr, 18F also used Apiary and Github, to cobble together a platform for API operations, demonstrating their dedication to agility and speed. Simplicity Rules The FBOpen API interface adheres to API simplicity by providing logical, versioned URI for accessing the government business opportunities, with a query and data source parameter allowing you to tailor the source of your query. Then you can filter by noncompetes or closed opportunities, as well as controlling the number of results returned, including common pagination controls developers are used to when working with APIs. FBOpen API does one thing, and does it well--the calling card of successful APis.

I was just having another conversation about virtualized cloud containers like Docker.io, and the approaches from leading cloud providers like Amazon with Cloud Formations, and RedHat with OpenShift. This is a subject that seems to be coming up more and more, and is definitely something you&rsquo;ll see more of on API Evangelist, as well as being discussed at future API Strategy &amp; Practice and API Days.
John Sheehan (@johnsheehan)&nbsp;of Runscope put it best, a couple weeks back during a similar conversation:

@kinlane containers will do for APIs what APIs do for companies.
&mdash; John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) March 13, 2014

Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I&rsquo;d consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are sold b2b, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use in the API economy.
In preparation for some research on the subject, I pulled together my stories on this subject from the last couple months:

The Power Of Designing And Deploying API Driven Resources In Containers
Virtual Containers, Stacks, APIs And Application Management
Server Side API Templates On AWS Cloud Formation And OpenShift
Modular APIs Driven From Github Blueprints Using OpenShift
Deploy Instances Of APIs At Heroku Or PaaS Of Your Choice
Github As The Central Presence, Definition, Configuration, And Source Code For Your API
A Wholesale On-Premise Version Of My API For Sale

Hopefully I can organize some of my thoughts, review some of the more innovative implementations I&rsquo;m seeing out there, and shed even more light on how virtual containers are being used to deploy the next generation of APIs. If you are doing something cool in this space, please let me know.

I gave the talk for the first 15 minutes, then Sumit Sharma (@sumitcan), Ole Lensmar (@olensmar), and Ruben Verborgh (@RubenVerborgh) followed me-- the full video is on Youtube if you are interested. Over the last couple months I've been doing a deeper dive into the area of API design, with a specific look at API definition formats from API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, so the session was intended to help me continue the conversation, in person, on the stage at #APIStrat Amsterdam. I'm happy I did, because Ole came to the table with some valuable data on API definitions, that save me some valuable research hours. I'm breaking up his work into several smaller posts, you can find his full deck on slideshare, next up after API Definitions: What Is Behind The Name?,&nbsp;is a side by side comparison of how Blueprint, RAML and Swagger each model REST: &nbsp; API-Blueprint RAML Swagger Resources X X X (&ldquo;api&rdquo;) Methods/Actions X (&ldquo;action&rdquo;) X (&ldquo;method&rdquo;) X (&ldquo;operation&rdquo;) Query Parameters X X X Path/URL Parameters X X X Header Parameters X X X Representations (status codes, mime-types) X X X Documentation X X X Authentication &nbsp; Basic, Digest, Oauth 1&amp;2, (*) Basic, API-Key, OAuth 2 Representation Metadata &lt;any&gt; (inline) &lt;any&gt; (inline/external) JSON Schema (subset) Nested Resources X X &nbsp; Composition/Inheritance Resource Models Traits, Resource Types &nbsp; File inclusions &nbsp; X &nbsp; API Version metadata &nbsp; X X Sample Representations X X &nbsp; Ole provides a nice overview of the three leading API definition formats, giving API providers a good side-by-side summary that can be used when deciding which format to support.

			<p><em>07 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The Internet of things (Iot), and security camera API platform evercam.io has submitted the API definition for their camera API to the API Commons.
I&rsquo;ve been impressed with the amount of leadership that is coming out of this new startup in a potentially very political, and inevitable aspect of the API economy&mdash;cameras.
Marco Herbst (@marcoherbst) of evercam.io approached me during #APIStrat in Amsterdam and expressed interest in submitting their Swagger API definition into the commons, and this last weekend we created the API Commons manifest and published to the commons.

When I spoke with Marco several months ago about API Commons, he took the importance of submitting an API definition to heart. By doing so evercam.io is saying that their API definition is significant in their industry, and something that others in the industry should follow.
This type of stance in an industry like Iot is going to become crucial in encouraging not just manufacturers to adhere to a common format, but also saving application developers and data scientists time when their are building Iot solutions.
Thanks evercam.io for sharing your API definition with the world, and taking your role and responsibility in defining an interface to a very important layer of the API economy, so seriously.

As I have evolved my blog from a content management system into an API industry monitoring system, much like other companies I work with, I&rsquo;m making the switch to use more APIs in my operations. As I roll out these APIs, I want to share them with you, here within the API Evangelist developer area.
Here at developer.apievangelist.com you will find APIs that give you access to the content I curate and turn into stories, the analysis I provide on the API space, and companies, tools and other resources that I use make API Evangelist go around.
Sometimes I will roll out APIs as separate projects, and other times I will roll them out here, the central API area for API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m working to separate out some of my resources, much like other companies do in the space, and allow my internal systems to read / write, while also providing public and partner access to these resources. I am even working to create premium, pay for use API resources, but most of the time you will find my APIs are free.
If there is anything you&rsquo;d like to see me publish, let me know. You can use the issue management for the Github repository that houses this project to share any comments, thoughts or issues. Thanks for tuning in!

			<p><em>04 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Last week at #APIStrat in Amsterdam, I had the pleasure of watching a keynote by Romain Huet (@romainhuet), Developer Advocate at Twitter, aptly titled &ldquo;connecting to the pulse of the planet&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Romain give this talk twice now, and he really delivers&mdash;you can watch the whole video on Youtube.
Romain used Twitter as a conduit for not just one, but two live Internet of things (Iot) demos. First he took a live selfie of him and the audience with a Raspberry Pi camera he had developed, and second he made a drone take off on stage using commands he sent via Twitter.
When talking to Romain earlier in Amsterdam, we were discussing APIs and Iot, and I said that Twitter seems to be a wonderful gateway for developers, when it came to connecting devices to the Internet. As an API driven messaging channel, developers just get Twitter and its APIs, so it makes sense we&rsquo;d use this familiar channel for exploration communication in the Internet of things.
Twitter works well as a gateway API to Iot for developers because of its familiarity and ease of use, but it also immediately makes it social, allowing us to open up Iot communications to a trusted network, or even the public. While we don&rsquo;t want every device in our lives immediately social, it works well for us to learn new thing, allowing us to learn using tools we are already familiar with, and have a network of established friends.
Like it or not, I think many Iot devices will come pre-configured to work with our common social networks, and as the Iot world matures, we will find more logical ways to communicate with these devices in our lives&mdash;realizing that not everything needs to social and on the web, but in the early days we&rsquo;ll depend on these characteristics to understand how to make devices and sensors communicate.

			<p><em>04 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
As I go through the management of my 60+ research sites that make up my API Evangelist network, I can't help but think about how I can automate specific aspects of the process. This is the way my custom built platform works, I have workflows and tasks I accomplish each day, and as I have time, I will write scripts and automate where I can.
In an ordinary week I will process hundreds of blog feeds, tweets and new APIs, and sometimes I&rsquo;m tempted to automated my curation, sorting, tagging and other aspects of what I do, but then I find valuable nuggets on company sites, blog and other places. Valuable insight that my algorithms wouldn't necessarily find, things that I can use in stories across the API Evangelist network, as well as expand my own knowledge.
Each day I work to strike this balance between manually monitoring the API space, and automating what I do. I am constantly re-evaluating whether something is better automated, and at what point does something need my critical eye.
As I write this post, I can't help but think about all the talk of automation via the web, mobile apps and Internet of things (Iot) each day, and hope that we all can find restraint, and apply critical thinking around how we best use Internet enabled technology in our lives&mdash;minimizing what we lose by automating our worlds.

			<p><em>03 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a wave of blog posts about additions to the developer and partner programs, of some of the leading APIs in the industry, making me think its time for some more research into the area. Partner programs come in several shapes and sizes, and go by different names, and are something I would like to understand better. I have several Evernote folders full of research on API partner programs, now I just need to polish it and publish it here on the blog, and possibly give it its own research repository on Github. Many companies consider their API partner programs, a type of partner all by itself. However when I talk about partner or developer programs, it is about establishing multiple tiers of API access, within an API developer ecosystem. When most think of APIs, a vision of an open, public API comes to mind&mdash;when in reality, many APIs will have multiple levels of access, with public just being the first rung of the partner ladder. Some APIs start with signing up to be a partner, and require developers share details of their integration idea, before they can gain access to an API. IBM does this with their Watson platform, requiring developers to share their idea, and wait for approval before they can access resources. I always recommend providing a open access version of API resources, something that is self-service, and can be accessed 24/7 by developers, but this won&rsquo;t be applicable with all APIs. To find solid examples of API partner programs, I wanted to start with the API pioneers, as they have been doing this a while, and have a great deal of experience managing very large, mature developer ecosystems. Salesforce This early pioneer in the API space crafted their AppExchange Partner Program to have two separate models that developers can take advantage of: ISVforce allowing developers to build, market, and sell apps only to salesforce.com customers at 15% cut, and Force.com...[<a href="/2014/04/03/taking-a-quick-look-at-the-leading-api-partner-programs/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the websites of API companies, trying to understand not just the way they do business, but their role in their overall industry, or possibly how they influence other industries. I have been spending more time looking through the payment API space lately, and recently pulled together a list of key players in this space, as well as the common building blocks being used across the sector. Much like other significant areas of APIs like cloud computing, messaging, geo, and social, I can&rsquo;t help but consider the impact these payment APIs will have across all business sectors, and our government. The 50 building blocks I identified as part of my payment API research will not just be the essential components of the payment API space, but will ultimately be some of the building blocks of the API economy itself--take a look. Merchant Account&nbsp;- Creation, management and integration with merchant accounts that are required to process credit cards. Bank Account&nbsp;- Integration with existing bank accounts, for linking with payment workflows. Processor / Gateways&nbsp;- Access to multiple payent processors and gateways in multiple countries. Currencies&nbsp;- Ability to conduct transactions in multiple currencies, handling all the conversions for developers. Credit Card Transactions&nbsp;- The option to process major credit cards. ACH Transactions&nbsp;- The option to process transactions over the ACH network. Checks / Wire Transactions&nbsp;- The option to do bank to bank, wire and check transactions.

			<p><em>02 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>API Infrastructure provider 3Scale has moved beyond just API management, with a launch of a new API integration service called APITools. 3Scale, one of the original API management providers, is moving out of just providing tools for API providers, and now targeting developers who are depending on API services for their web and mobile applications&mdash;catering to both sides of the API infrastructure coin. As developers depend on more API driven resources for their web and applications, the need to be in tune with the inner workings of an API is increasing. We don't just need access to the results of an API anymore, we need to understand the composition, performance and overall availability of the web APIs we depend on. The number of tools and services dedicated to assisting developers with API Integration is one of the fastest growing API areas, right along with API design. Getting In Front Of The APIs You Depend On APITools allows you to add all the APIs you depend on, whether they are public APIs like Twitter and LinkedIn, or the homegrown services of your own company and your partners. Once connected, APITools does all the work to profile communication with APIs, and how applications are consuming them. Establish Middleware Between Your Apps and APIs Without API integration tools, the inside of API calls are a black box. APITools doesn't just profile API transactions, it allows you to establish a middleware platform between your apps and the API they depend on. This middleware allows you to transform and inject elements into API transactions, allowing you to not just understand API operations, but force them to execute as you desire. Evolved Awareness Of How Your APIs Operate Once web API services are connected with APITools, and the middleware configured, the learning begins via a visual dashboard, providing you with intelligence on all API operations. This awareness of API operations can become real-time, with notifications of API events, staying in tune...[<a href="/2014/04/02/3scale-moves-into-api-integration-space-with-apitools/">Read More</a>]</p>

Sorry, while VC investment in companies that have APIs is a relevant data point, I just don't think its newsworthy enough to warrant its own blog post, usually just a tweet.
One thing that I did find interesting in this post, was the image depicting the distribution via the BandPages platform:

This image provides a very simple and clear way to articulate the value delivered via an API driven platform--showing users what BandPages does in a single image.
I wish every API I came across had an image like this, demonstrating what value the API delivers, in a very visual way.

			<p>I just got an email from an open data, API evangelist, working on a "New Zealand cross government program that is set up to deliver better public services for businesses and providing more and better APIs is a core vehicle that we have identified for that&rdquo;, who asked a question I see a lot, and thought I should do another post on: Should government provide the full download of datasets or encourage API access of data assets? The answer is both, but only if you have the resources to properly design, deploy, manage and evangelize the APIs, and you should always start with providing the full download of datasets. Many open data folks feel APIs are unnecessary when you have the full data download, but in reality this is a narrow view of the world&mdash;not everyone has the resources to consume entire data downloads, and there are so many lessons for government to learn from when providing APIs. Always Provide Raw Data Downloads Publishing of government data assets in machine readable formats like CSV, XML and JSON should be default for all government agencies. Period. If a dataset is not classified or contains personably identifiable information (PII), it should be available in a central location on government web sites for download. This is where ALL government agencies should start, before embarking on any API. Deploy APIs When Resources Are Available APIs should only be deployed by government agencies when they have the resources to do so properly. At the very least you should be able to properly design, deploy and respond via email requests around APIs in a timely manner. Nothing is more frustrating than integrating with an API where nobody is home. Also remember that EVERY API operations is short handed, even companies like Twilio and SendGrid could use more resources, so don&rsquo;t wait for the perfect resource levels before you launch, however you should make sure and give your APIs enough investment so...[<a href="/2014/03/31/should-government-provide-download-or-api-of-government-data-resources/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am back in Los Angeles, after being in Amsterdam last week for API Strategy &amp; Practice. It's Monday morning, with the event ending Friday, and rather than being drained and exhausted, I'm still glowing and very charged and excited for APIs, after all the amazing discussions.
First off, thank you to 3Scale for making API Strategy &amp; Practice possible. Without 3Scale, not only would the event not exist, it would not have the tone that it does. 3Scale is investing in the conversation happening, with the priority being an open, inclusive community discussion around APIs&mdash;products, brands and companies are not the focus, API strategy and practice lead.
Second, thank you to all the sponsors, WSO2, IBM, Mulesoft, Pearson, BladeRunnerJS, Context.io, NGINX, Node1, API Days, Apiary, Application Developers Alliance, Amsterdam Marketing, Nordic APIs, SendGrid, and WIP. Without these company&rsquo;s support, the conversation wouldn't happen.
Third, thank you to the 96 speakers who elevated the API conversation at #APIStrat, bringing the stories of their API efforts to the event. There are already three of the talks up on the APIStrat Youtube channel, and the rest will be going up over the next couple weeks&mdash;if you weren't there, you have an opportunity to hear the talks.
I know 3Scale shares my vision of the event, and once again we nailed it! #APIStrat was the open and inclusive discussion of APIs I feel is critical for moving the industry forward. It is this type of open, vendor neutral discussion occur regularly around the globe, otherwise we just operate within our silos, and will never achieve the interoperability, integration and reciprocity that is needed to make the API economy work in a healthy way.
Thanks everyone for making such an amazing #APIStratAMS!

			<p><em>21 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I spend a lot of time each week reading the blog feeds, and twitter streams from the best API providers in the space. In my opinion this represents the lowest hanging fruit in my API monitoring, where the stories just land in my lap, delivered to me by my feeds&mdash;then once I've picked all this fruit, I find myself looking through the Twitter followers of many of these APIs.
The Twitter followers can contain some really interesting gems from across the API sector that I wouldn't find through my normal channels. By manually browsing the Twitter followers for APIs I&rsquo;m looking for:

People - Interesting folks doing innovative stuff across the API space.&nbsp;
Companies - New startups that have trouble cutting through the noise in space.&nbsp;
Stories - The lesser known stories that I see when looking through my unique lens.&nbsp;
Services - API related services that might be shifting from the norm, pushing the API space forward.&nbsp;
Tools - Developers are notoriously bad at marketing their work, and I find some cool tools on Twitter.

I have tools that I have developed that help me filter, search and easily look through thousands of Twitters followers, but I also find manually looking through them allows me to find the gems that my algorithm can&rsquo;t always find. A balance of programmatic and human approach to scanning the followers seems to work best.
Some of my best companies, individuals and stories I&rsquo;ve written, have come from trolling through Twitter followers. While I focus on my core feeds to understand the space daily, each week I try to remember to expand my network, adding new users, and blogs to my network, and Twitter followers is a great place to do this.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The first day at API Strategy &amp; Practice is always workshops that expose you the world of APIs, and #APIStrat in Amsterdam next week is no different. We had four workshops, but successful development and deployment best practices to secure, monitor and manage APIs, by Isabelle Mauny, Director of Product Management at WSO2 is already sold out.
That leaves us with three workshops currently available:

API-First Development with RAML from Daniel Feist, Architect @ Mulesoft
Introduction to APIs from Kirsten Hunter and D. Keith Casey
CitySDK APIs Boosting Civic App Development from Hanna Niemi-Hugaerts, Project Manager at Helsinki, Forum Virium

I know most of them are getting full and I see emails coming with regularly with new registrations, so if you are interesting in participating in any of these workshops head over to the workshops page #APIStrat.
Remember that #APIStrat isn't just for the seasoned developer, there are many sessions to get you up to speed on APIs, including Kirsten&rsquo;s and Keith&rsquo;s Introduction to 101, and the workshops on Civic API hacking is meant for everyone looking to make a change in our government works.
I look forward to seeing you there next week.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Content and data aggregation provider Gnip just announced a new API from their &ldquo;Plugged In Partner&rdquo; Brandwatch, who launched the Brandwatch API, giving developers access to social data, filtered through their a brand lens, so they can build custom tools, visualizations and other apps around Twitter data.
The Brandwatch API itself isn't that groundbreaking, there are plenty of other social analysis APIs offering similar features, but the fact that it was an API built on top of Gnip, one of the only approved Twitter firehose providers remaining, I found to be interesting.
Gnip is trusted Twitter provider, with firehose access to Twitter data, and Brandwatch is a trusted Gnip partner, providing an API with access to Twitter data. At this point I can't tell if I&rsquo;m in a dream, or a dream within a dream?
I feel like we've moved into a strange post Twitter API apocalypse land where turmoil in the Twitter ecosystem has died down, Gnip and other Twitter partners are thriving, and we are even seeing new APIs being built on Twitter data. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this, to be honest I can't tell if I&rsquo;m awake anymore.

			<p><em>19 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m adding the API Rating Agency to my stack of companies who deliver in the area of API discovery.  The API Rating Agency helps API consumers understand each API provider on a whole list of metrics, ranging from terms of service to platform uptime.
Rating of APIs has been a nut I&rsquo;ve been trying to crack for a couple years now, resulting in a ranking system that is more human, than algorithm&mdash;so I know how hard  it is to go through hundreds of APIs, and develop some sort of coherent ranking system.
The API Rating Agency is a work in progress. I know they are hard at work reviewing API providers, so if you have an API make sure and contact them and see how you can put together a package that will help them understand your API.
To achieve the scale we need in the API economy, we will have to have an unbiased, 3rd party ranking, kind of sorta like Moody&rsquo;s or Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, but hopefully more neutral. Developers have to be able to understand which platforms they can depend on.
You can catch Jonathan Bourguignon (@jon_bou) of the API Rating Agency at API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam, participating in the discovery and trust session&mdash;I hope to see you there!

			<p><em>18 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm going through the schedule for API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam, getting intimate with each keynote, panel, and session, and their speakers. On day one we have a keynote from Mike Amundsen (@mamund), API Architect at Layer7 titled, "Self-Replication, Strandbeest, and the Game of Life What von Neumann, Jansen, and Conway can teach us about scaling the API economy&rdquo;. I have not seen this talk by Mike, so I have no idea what he is planning, but I have to share an epiphany I had when I first contacted Mike about speaking at #APIStrat Amsterdam. Mike had responded to my initial email asking me what I was interested in having him talk about, which I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Mike&rsquo;s approach to storytelling, so I&rsquo;m leaving it up to him. However Mike responded with a link to Strandbeest, simply stating he would like to incorporate this into a talk. As I watched Strandbeest I had a realization, this was a physical manifestation of what I envision as API driven application architecture for the API economy. Over the years I had built up visualizations in my mind of what architecture will look like when you are building applications with not 1 or 2, or 10 or 20 API, but hundreds of API driven resources, all working together in concert for a single outcome. The Strandbeest is the first physical object I've seen to come close to what i was seeing in my minds eye, and even more telling was that it was Mike Amundsen who introduced me to this object. When you watch the Strandbeest video, imagine each tube as a single API, and each resulting "beest" as a system or application you intend to build with APIs. Imagine being an architect at this scale, orchestrating hundreds of APIs into a workflow, or series of workflows that produces a virtual "strandbeest" that doesn't just run on the beach, but operates within the API...[<a href="/2014/03/18/strandbeest-apis-and-orchestrating-the-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I use both Bitly and Google shortened URLs to track activity across my networks. I don&rsquo;t just track click throughs, I also track image impressions for many of my projects and partners. This usage of shortened URLs lets me quantity the scope of my network, and understand interest across the network in the form of impression and click-throughs. After talking with Plot.ly about their embed strategy for API driven data visualizations, the topic of a sensible API branding has floated to the top of my story list again. I consider an APIs branding strategy to be an important building block that contributes to the politics of an API and its ecosystem (both internal and external). If an API branding strategy is too strict, it can turn developers off from using your API, but a well planned branding strategy that includes a healthy suite of embeddable tools can be a serious asset, and go a long way in satisfying internal concerns about brand integrity--which is major concern for companies when it comes to API deployment. What is a branding strategy? At its simplest it is about providing your API developers with a set of simple links and / or images that they should publish on their site, providing attribution for API resources consumed. A complete branding strategy provides the links, images and possibly JavaScript tools, as well as guidance on how they should be published on websites and within apps, providing proper attribution. In the context of a basic API branding strategy, URL shorteners can provide a wealth of data about the scope of your API ecosystem, as well has help measure specific activity across deployments by your developers. You should be able to quantity the impressions and click throughs everywhere your API resources are put to use. Of course, a healthy API partner structure also allows for developers to opt out of tracking and possibly deploy white label solutions.

			<p><em>18 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I'm continuing my journey through the session line-up at API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam, next up is the API discovery and trust session, where the conversation will be about API directories, service descriptions and of trust and rating systems for APIs.
Speakers for the API discovery and trust session are:

Bruno Pedro (@bpedro), CTO at CloudWork
Jonathan Bourguignon (@jon_bou), Co-founder at Reelstorm and APIRatings.org
Rix Groenboom (@rix_groenboom), Solution Architect at Parasoft
Stefan Rust (@srust99), Founder &amp; CEO at Exicon

It will be tough to decide between the API design and development and this one in the first session, on Day 1 for me. Thankfully that everything is recorded!
API discovery is an area we have a lot of work to do to prepare for the explosive growth in the space. It is tough to find quality APIs, understand the differences between APIs, and know who you can really depend on after you&rsquo;ve integrated into your applications.  This will be an important session.

			<p>In preparation for a fireside chat with Tyler Singletary at API Strategy &amp; Practice next week I&rsquo;m reviewing many of what I consider the political API building blocks, and reading some of my past stories to refresh my thoughts on the most pressing topics in the space. The technical building blocks of APIs are pretty clear at this point, and the business of APIs has been being hammered out over the last five or so years, by API infrastructure providers like 3Scale, but the politics of APIs are an aspect of the API economy we are going to see become more and more of a hot topic as the space continues its growth. There are a handful of building blocks that are clearly driving how APIs are used (or not used): Legal &nbsp; Branding&nbsp;- Along with the other business assets made available via an API ecosystem, the API owners brand is also being put on the on the line. Branding Guidelines set the tone for how partners and developers can use the resources and assets made available via an API. The branding guidelines will provide a framework for attributing the API owner, how resources can be displayed and provide visual assets to support the company brand. As with terms of use and privacy policies, branding guidelines need protect the API owner but also provide developers with enough freedom to innovate. &nbsp; Terms of Use / Conditions&nbsp;- Terms of Use provide a legal framework for developers to operate within. They set the stage for the business development relationships that will occur within an API ecosystem. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API. Make sure an APIs TOS pass insepection with the lawyers, but also strike a healthy balance within the ecosystem and foster innovation. &nbsp; Privacy&nbsp;- Privacy policies protect the rights of partners, developers and platform users...[<a href="/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2014/03/17/job-postings-provide-view-into-internal-api-efforts/">Job Postings Provide View Into Internal API Efforts</a></h3>
			<p><em>17 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The API space has been pretty easy to monitor until recently, with most API efforts being public, but lately everything is trending is towards internal APIs, making it a lot harder to track on what some companies are up.
I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for new signals I can use to track on what companies are up to when it comes to their API strategy. A signal I&rsquo;ve been using for a while, but is an increasingly important part of my monitoring, is the job posting for API architect, developer and evangelists.
An example of this is the posting for an API platform engineer from video collaboration platform BlueJeans. We know that BlueJeans gets APIs when it comes to integration, but there isn&rsquo;t much public discussion about their internal API initiatives or any publicly available developer program.
According to the job posting BlueJeans is looking for a developer to help in, "building and scaling the API platform of our cloud application". It is pretty clear that APIs is what make the video collaboration platform operate, and I will add BlueJeans to my list of companies using APIs, just not into showcasing it publicly.
In the future, job postings will be just one of many signals we use to understand how companies are using Apis. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to get companies to share stories publicly about their APIs, but in some cases I don&rsquo;t think that companies are ready, and not used to talking about their operations in this way.

			<p>Its always funny to come across the hyperbolic folks that exist in technology, that blindly believe that technology will save us. I seem to get attract a lot of these people with my API Evangelism (its the name), which on the surface I can imagine seems like I'm advocating use of APIS BY EVERYONE, in ALL SITUATIONS--when in reality, this is furthest from the case. At API Evangelist, I focus on having conversations about APIs in all situations, but not necessarily the deployment or consumption of APIs. I don't think APIs by themselves are a solution. I think APIs employed by a savvy business and technology team, providing access access to valuable data, content and other resources to consumers, are a good idea. My missions is for: businesses to understand how APIs can potentially benefit them, and change how they operate internally, with partners and the public at large and even influence how an entire industry operates government of all shapes and sizes to know that APIs can help democratize access to public resources, empowering the public to help share the load of governing cities, counties, states / provinces and countries every individual to realize the messages, photos, banking, location, and other information they depend on via their cell phone travels through APIs, and that they, the end-user has an important role to play I do not want every business and object in our life to have an API and be connected to the Internet. I evangelize an awareness and healthy understanding of APIs by everyone, as well as sensible approaches to designing, deploying, managing and evangelizing APIs. This is what happens at API Strategy &amp; Practice. If we were just pushing APIs for everything, the name would be something like APIs - Do It! In reality the conference in Amsterdam next week will be a mix of business and technical folks, listening to the stories from API leaders, about their strategy and practices from...[<a href="/2014/03/17/its-not-just-about-doing-apis-its-about-having-conversation-about-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t have a love of infographics, mostly because they more graphic, than info, and I&rsquo;ve stated before that all infographics should have the data behind them. I&rsquo;ve been working with data of over 20 years, I thoroughly believe in its importance when used right, but it seriously pisses me off when it is distorted in support of any argument&mdash;whether I agree with the argument or not. This sentiment is shared by a startup I was introduced this last week, called Plot.ly. I had a great conversation Nolan Browne the co-founder &amp; chief business officer at Plot.ly, and he conveyed to me about how serious Plot.ly is about providing embeddable, API driven data analysis and visualizations tools that really empower data stewards. First, I really like Plot.ly because it is JSON driven. Next they provide you with all the web-based tool you need to import, manage and share data in a way that lets you collaborate and publish along the way. Plot.ly even provides an API to help you manage everything about your data analysis and visualization work. The most important thing about Plot.ly is that each visualization is embeddable, like a Youtube video, allowing you to share not just the visualization, but also the data behind it. Each embeddable Plot.ly visualizations contains the entire story behind it, allowing you to understand the credibility of the author, and how the data has evolved, and potentially adding your own stamp on its history with the ability to save, reverse engineer, and edit in your own Plot.ly account. Plot.ly has some pretty impressive tools for importing, analyzing and visualizing data, but I think its samples and gallery, with the ability to save and fork the works of others which will make it work for the masses. Data stewards across the government, and private sector need not just the tools, but simple blueprints they can reverse engineer, helping them understand how they can better analyze and visualize their...[<a href="/2014/03/17/i-always-want-to-see-the-data-behind-and-so-does-plot-ly/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2014/03/14/api-service-accord/">API Service Accord</a></h3>
			<p><em>14 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>Building off a conversation I had with a fellow evangelist in the federal government today, regarding API service level agreements (SLA), I wanted to talk through some thoughts I&rsquo;m having about a couple of key API building blocks. Reflecting what I see across the API space, API terms of service (TOS) are the legal agreement that API consumers agree to before using an API resource. API best practices, tends to reflect what the API TOS lays out, but are delivered in plain english, avoiding the legalese of the standard TOS. When these two building blocks (terms of service, best practices) are deployed well, an API consumer can easily make a decision on whether an API is in alignment with their goals, then also being able to pass it off to the lawyer for a deeper analysis. Secondarily, API service level agreements (SLA) are the legal agreement that API providers agree to when offering up their service for consumption--setting the bar for what API consumers can expect from a service provider. While TOS, SLA and best practices involve both API providers and consumers, I&rsquo;d say the TOS and best practices lean towards guiding API consumer behavior. Where the SLA leans toward guiding the API provider behavior. What I&rsquo;m looking for is a phrase to describe the friendlier, plain english version of an SLA. I want a building block that API providers can use to set the same eexpectations that a low-level SLA would, but without the legal baggage that comes with an SLA. After reading through wikipedia entries, and several great articles on SLAs, and looking through what is contained in common SLAs, I&rsquo;m playing around with several phrases including operational understanding, operational accord, and service accord&mdash;leaning towards service accord, based upon the definition of accord: 1) give or grant someone (power, status, or recognition). 2) (of a concept or fact) be harmonious or consistent with. Like best practices, a service accord would explain service levels...[<a href="/2014/03/14/api-service-accord/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>One of the transformative experiences of my career was when I worked for SAP, running SAP events as VP of Engineering at WebEvents Global. When I started, I was handed an architecture that was completely hosted in a hostage colocation facility, where I had no support. Long story short is, I was able to redefine my architecture using an API-centric approach, coupled with AWS EC2 and S3 APIs, I re-deployed infrastructure piece by piece into the cloud, exiting my restrictive environment, but then also giving me a newfound agility, and the ability to scale in new an exciting ways, that were very liberating. This experience was the birth of API Evangelist. After three years doing this, I needed a change, and knew that APIs was the space I wanted to be in, so I started a research blog to study the space--four years later I&rsquo;m still doing the research and publishing in real-time across the 60+ Github repos that make up API Evangelist. I evangelize APIs to not just spread the gospel of the technical benefits of APIs, I have remained passionate about APIs after four years by evangelizing the business, legal and cultural effects of an API-centric approach to business and government. The ability to break up operations into little bite size resources, that allow these resources to be used in their current context, but also allowing them to be used in entirely new ways is very appealing. Along with a more modular approach to business, comes a flexibility, agility, and transparency that will change culture at any company, and potentially an entire industry, or industries as we saw with Amazon. In my opinion business operations is about 30% technical, with the other 70% being about humans, and APIs deliver across 100% of that spectrum. As it did in 2006, the cloud is playing a transformative role in the world APIs in 2014, building on the concept that an API is a single, modular...[<a href="/2014/03/13/the-power-of-designing-and-deploying-api-driven-resources-in-containers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am getting psyched going through the schedule lineup of 15 sessions at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam. In planning the session outline, Steve, Vanessa and I listened to what the #APIStrat audience asked for after New York and San Francisco, which was more of the deep technical, as well as a balance of the business and politics of APIs.
I think our lineup delivers on this, which we've broken up into three tracks:
API Provider


Design and Development
Service Descriptions
Hypermedia APIs
API Marketing &amp; Developer Communities
Hardware and Internet of Things (IOT)

API By Industry


Media, Music and Audio APIs
Civic APIs
Enterprise APis
APIs in Financial Services
Community APIs

API Consumer

Discovery and Trust
Security and Testing
High Scalability
API Based App Development
Business Models

This lineup of sessions represent what we are seeing across the API space, with API design coming front and center, to hypermedia moving beyond an academic discussion and actually getting traction.  That is what API Strategy &amp; Practice is about, providing a venue to have discussions about the areas that are impacting the industry.
The best thing is, this is just the session lineup, we still have workshops, keynotes, fireside chats and panels.

			<h3><a href="/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">API Management: Adding Reciprocity Building Blocks</a></h3>
			<p><em>13 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m adding a new grouping to my list of API management building blocks, called reciprocity. If you want to know what I mean by reciprocity check out my earlier post From ETL to API Reciprocity, Looking at 20 Service Providers. As I was working with Nimble the CRM system last night, and I was planning out some workflows associated with keeping contact data up to date, and noticed that Nimble provides access to Zapier automation tools directly from their interface, using an iframe. Providing access to API automation tools for your developers, and end-users, is an important piece of a larger reciprocity puzzle. As an API provider you should allow for developers and end-users to access, migrate, download, and orchestrate the flow of their own data. With this in mind I&rsquo;m adding four building blocks for reciprocity as part of my API management recommendations: Data Portability - Providing users with the ability to get data out of a system through a bulk download and via an API is essential to reciprocity existing. Along with other basic web literacy skills that every user should possess, every person should demand that any services they sign up for, should allow for data portability of all their resources. Terms of Service - The Terms of Service (TOS) is the central hub which makes the API economy work (or not work). TOS is where the protections for platform owners, developers and end-users exists. Restrictive TOS can suffocate the reciprocity of platform, while more sensible ones allow for the movement, and collaboration around resources that will make a platform thrive. oAuth - While not a perfect standard, oAuth is the best we have when it comes to providing an identify and access layer for API driven resource, one that allows for reciprocity to occur within a single API ecosystem, and between multiple ecosystems. oAuth gives the platform, developer and end-users a (potentially) equal role in who has access to API driven...[<a href="/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am watching Airpair and Workmob step up to meet the demand for developer talent in the API space, and can&rsquo;t help but selfishly want to see the same for API evangelism talent.
Along with the growth of the API space, the need for quality API developer talent has grown exponentially. Airpair and Workmob have both identified this (obvious) need, and will do well, if they can truly qualify, organize and direct talent to where it is needed across the space.
I would call Airpair and Workmob, API talent agencies, with a focus on development. I want to see the same emerge for API evangelism, advocacy, or whatever label you give it where you are from. The need for developers is greater, but there is a huge, unmet demand for evangelists. This is literally from an email I received today:
No one interesting is replying to our job postings, and I am wondering if you have any thoughts or suggestions on who the right person is and how to find them.
I see this throughout the week, and feel bad for many of the companies reaching out. An API evangelism talent agency wouldn&rsquo;t be your average marketing or PR agency. An API evangelism talent agency would have to be a tech savvy group, bringing not just outreach skills to the table, but some serious hacking chops.
If you have the desire (and resources) to start such an agency, let me know. I don&rsquo;t have the desire to run such an operation (or the resources), but I have the understanding of what the market needs, and can probably bring all the clients you'd need.

			<p>I wish I had more time to take many of the questions I get behind the scenes via email and publish as stories, but with an insane inbox I only can make time for some of the more relevant ones. I had one from a couple weeks ago that I just got around to responding to, which had to do with which support building blocks should an API provider use. This particular question comes from Jamie Parkins (@jamieparkins) from JustGiving: In your experience of documented APIs, when you come across the need for help, do you find the simple Google Group approach works or do you prefer the more ticket like approach that a Zendesk might offer (and possibly wrapped with some FAQs)? I only have a resource of 1 dev so have to pick my battles carefully but I can't help thinking I'll end up gaining time if I can help users solve their own problems or questions better from the start (i.e. A self service approach) Which building blocks you use in supporting your community is a balancing act based upon the amount of resources you have, the size of your community, and the types of users you have in your API community. Based upon what I've seen available at other APis, and the one's I've developed strategy for, you try and balance between self-service and direct support building blocks--with emphasis on self-service and asynchronous communication. Depending on your target audience, some consumers may be needier than others, and will not be accustom to self-service API approaches, coming from more of a sales and direct support culture. The goal within any API community is to steer as many of these users as you can towards a self and community supported model, but you want to make sure your company is actively present as well, engaging and supporting your developers&mdash;not absent and relying just on your community and self-service. There is no standard template...[<a href="/2014/03/11/which-building-blocks-should-i-use-as-part-of-my-api-support-strategy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been profiling the API management space for almost four years now, and one of the things I keep track of is what some of the common building blocks of API management are. Recently I&rsquo;ve pushed into other areas like API design, integration and into payment APIs, trying to understand what the common elements providers are using to meet developer needs. Usually I have to look through the sites of leading companies in the space, like the 38 payment API providers I&rsquo;m tracking on to find all the building blocks that make up the space, but when it came to cloud computing it was different. While there are several providers in the space, there is but a single undisputed leader&mdash;Amazon Cloud Services.

			<p><em>10 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am spending time getting to know the APIs coming out of the Netherlands, as we prepare for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam March 26-28th, and one API I was checking out is from the Portfolio platform Viewbook.
Viewbook provides an API for users to add and manage their photos, building very attractive portfolios for photographers. What I thought was pretty cool when I was going through their API, was their re-use of the Flickr API design, rather than re-inventing their own.
Viewbook is a great argument why we need API Commons, and a central, sensibly licensed place to find leading API patterns that providers can put to use. There are a lot of benefits for Viewbook to use the same design as Flickr, allowing developers to reuse code and other resources available as part of the Flickr API ecosystem--as well as just developer familiarity with the interface.
When it comes to many types of APIs, there is no reason to reinvent the wheel, and making use of the best API patterns already available just makes sense. Help me convince API providers to contribute their API designs to the commons, to help startups like Viewbook save time, and be successful in delivering their tools and services that make users lives easier--something that will only make all of our API communities stronger.

			<p><em>10 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I spent some time developing a hello world product API with Blueprint, RAML And Swagger this last week, and along the way I had several experiences that I think are influential in the API design process. One of these was while I was designing my product API using Apiary.io. After I had gotten to a certain point in my design, and I wanted to see it in action, so I clicked on the preview button. A panel slid out showing me the interactive documentation my developers will see when it is published, and potentially see how it will work with sample API responses, and code samples in a variety of programming languages. Just like interactive API documentation has been important in teaching developers about an API interface, it will also assist API providers in understanding their own interface throughout the design process, and be able to better articulate the interface to developers. Another important thing I saw exposed in the Apiary preview pane was code samples for making calls against my product API in PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, and Node.js. I think this option, built into the API design process is a pretty significant part of the lifecycle, by providing API designers with a constant reminder that their API interface will be consumed in a variety of languages. A common mistake I see from API deployments is that developers see the world through the lens of their preferred programming language. I&rsquo;ve seen very PHP centric design patterns, ones that cater to .NET and even APIs that consider only Node.js in their interface design patterns. It is not just the fact that they are thinking only in their programming language that is a problem, its just the fact that they aren't willing see the world through the eyes of their potential developers. Anything we can do to expand the horizons of API developers during the API design process, helping them see the wider...[<a href="/2014/03/10/expanding-an-api-designers-horizon-using-apiary/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>APIs are being used as the pipes that drive mobile apps, and beginning to connect our homes, automobiles, buildings and public space to the Internet. The decision on whether or not this is a good idea isn not even on the table, it is already happening, and there isn't anything you can do about it. What matters now is the path we take, and how open these API pipes are, how transparent providers are, how inclusive they are to developers and end users, and how much we respect privacy and invest in security. The big challenge in all of this is how do we steer all the actors in this new API economy towards a healthy balance: Providers - The potential of innovation and new partnerships, as well as access to new talent, and fresh ideas around a company's resources. Developers - Access to free and low cost resources for apps, that they couldn't create on their own. End-Users - Access to apps that entertain and meet their needs, with better control over content and data, as well as privacy and security. Government - All government being machine readable by default, increasing efficiency, as well as transparency along the way. APIs offer a lot of benefits for everyone involved, and are quickly establishing a presence across all business sectors. When it comes to APIs, most of the benefit comes not from the technical usage of APIs, it will be from healthy business and political aspects that empower and incentivize not just companies, but developers and the end-users to build new things. I don't evangelize APIs just so they get deployed, I evangelize API in hopes of persuading companies to adopt an API-centric approach to operating their company, a way of life that opens it up to partners, and the public&mdash;changing the culture of the company, the way it does business, and potentially changing the way we all do business.

			<p>Over the last couple months I&rsquo;ve been taking a deeper look at the API design space, trying to understand more about the tools and services that are emerging, and the different approaches being employed throughout the API design lifecycle. I started first with trying to understand the evolving motivations behind why people are using API definitions, then I spoke with API with the creators of API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, the three leading API design providers out there, to understand more about the vision behind their various approaches to API design. After talking to each of the providers, I wanted to understand more about the tooling that was emerging from each of the providers, and went through what has emerged out of each of the Blueprint, RAML and Swagger communities. I&rsquo;m continuing my research this week this time and expanding my understanding of the differences between the three API definition formats of API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger. To push my understanding of each approach I worked on developing an API definition for a simple product API, in each of the three formats. API Blueprint RAML Swagger I&rsquo;m not done with each of these definitions, I&rsquo;m still learning the nuances of each of the approaches to describing an API, but I learned a lot about each of the definition formats. Honestly, each format has its pros and cons, but all of them get you to the end goal of being able to describe an API interface.

Github just announced a new developer program, which will allow Github API developers to receive notifications about upcoming changes to the API, and get early access on some feature releases.
As part of the new developer program, you can also submit your work for inclusion on their integrations page, which is essentially a showcase of the best Github integrations out there.
A beta program or refined developer group within your API ecosystem makes sense. Having an API access tier where the more engaged developers can step up, and play a closer role in the API roadmap, can bring some serious value to the table.
I&rsquo;ve blogged about the benefits of multiple levels of API access for a couple years now, and Github&rsquo;s approach shows their API ecosystem is maturing, and they are further formalizing the incubation of ideas, applications and partnerships within the Github API ecosystem.

			<p>One of the most enjoyable thing about being the API Evangelist is talking to API providers about their strategy, and helping brainstorm what they should do next. I have multiple APIs I do this with regularly, either because I&rsquo;m an advisor, big fan, or simply because they pay me. ;-) My favorite discussions are from the providers that are fine with me retelling their story publicly, APIs like the Cashtie API and the Popup Archive. Anne and Bailey over at Popup, a audio transcription API, talk with me regularly about their API development, deployment and now evangelism strategy. The Popup Archive API meets the first rule of APIs for me&mdash;do one thing and do it well, providing clear value for developers. The Popup Archive does this with audio transcription, opening up a whole world of audio to being searchable via an API. Think about the potential of making old radio programs indexed, and searchable online, giving new life to legacy content. Anne and Bailey have built a high value web site and API, and recently finished their interactive documentation, and are ready for business. They are at that amazingly exciting, and at the same completely terrifying step of having to evangelize their API and make the rubber meet the road--they have a valuable API resource, but now what? Anne and Bailey have some great ideas about how the audio transcription API could be used, and they have some partners who are kicking the tires, understanding what is possible with integrating with Popup Archive API. This is where you start! You harness the ideas, and the early integrations and you tell the story of how the Popup Archive is providing a solution. Tell these stories on the Popup Archive Blog, on the Twitterz, and anywhere else you can find an audience.

			<p><em>07 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>There is an interesting conversation triggered by a question from Mr. Gray Brooks at the GSA on the federal government API Google Group, regarding whether there are any agencies who are charging for access to their APIs. I thoroughly enjoy the growing community of open data and API folks that are operating around city, state and federal government currently, and how we are all turning these questions into full blown conversations that can actually help move things forward. First Luke Fretwell(@lukefretwell)&nbsp;from Govfresh responded with Should government charge API fees? I totally agree with Luke, that we shouldn't be imposing fees on API consumers at this stage, potentially scaring users off, or stifling innovation that could occur. Government should understand that the costs of data gathering, publishing, and managing APIs should be an accepted cost of doing business as a public entity. Luke ends with potentially charging for high volume usage in the future, but for now let the resources flow! Next Mark Head(@mheadd), Open Data Evangelist for City of Philadelphia chimed in with APIs : To Charge or Not to Charge. Mark makes three excellent points that need to be considered before you charge for access to APIs 1) identifying who is using government APIs 2) APIs as a shared resource 3) sustainability of IT infrastructure. Mark nails it, in that that are more questions to be asked, and great deal of understanding needs be achieved before you can answer the question of &ldquo;to charge or not to charge&rdquo;. Getting To Know Your Resources Before government agencies consider charging for their API resources, they need to make sure they have an intimate understanding of what it takes to operate and scale existing APIs. Many people feel that applying API keys to government APIs is bad, and is all about locking up or controlling public data. In reality, keying up API access, measuring how APIs are actually used, applying meaningful metrics, presenting in sensible dashboards is...[<a href="/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>A question I get regularly at API Evangelist is around the need for spreadsheet to API, and database to API services. Every couple weeks I get DMs and emails from someone who ask what tools are available, and that they were thinking about developing a solution. Right now I have three separate people asking this, and rather than just reply in email I figured I&rsquo;d write a piece to respond, based upon my experience. First, let me state that there is a need for simple spreadsheet to API solution. Much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, and in control of data stewards who don't access to API deployment resources. However, I'm not sure there is a lot of money to be made in providing this as a service, i feels like something that should just be default for all spreadsheet operations&mdash;you know like Google Spreadsheet. Google Spreadsheet allows XML and JSON access to spreadsheets by default. in addition to the full blown Google Spreadsheet API.&nbsp;The only problem is with Google Spreadsheet you have some size limitations that make it a solution for only the simplest of data sources. I have written several posts on deploying APIs from Google Docs for both public and private spreadsheets, and have received numerous requests for a cloud version of this functionality, that would allow anyone to quickly deploy APIs from Google Spreadsheet sources. I think the fact that Google Spreadsheet is free to use, and has API access to is spreadsheets, make this a real tough space to make money in, even if you do smooth out the process. To further convince people to not reinvent the wheel, there is already the &ldquo;Wordpress&rdquo; for data management, called CKAN, which is, "a powerful data management system that makes data accessible &ndash; by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data.&rdquo; CKAN is open source, and a tool that city, state, county and federal governments around...[<a href="/2014/03/06/so-you-wanna-do-a-spreadsheet-or-database-to-api-startup/">Read More</a>]</p>

The session was nothing formal, just a conversation about cars and APIs. The conversation triggered several potential stories for me, but after the talk I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about how they talked about the Carvoyant API being a research &amp; development (R&amp;D) lab, and conversation starter about whats next for the automobile industry. Auto companies are on board with APIs playing a significant role in the future of the auto industry, but their window for change is in not just years, but multiple years. Tech giants like Google and Apple are turning their attention to the opportunities surrounding the connected car, but their runway is pretty lengthy as well&mdash;highly dependent on the car manufacturers. Carvoyant has options for connecting cars right now, providing a device you can plug in cars that are 1996 and newer, and an API for developers to build apps that integrate with user&rsquo;s vehicles. Carvoyant isn&rsquo;t about delivering content to your vehicle like Apple and Google are working on, it is about getting data from your vehicle, about its location, engine, tires, fuel and other vehicle data points and automobile centric events. Like other Internet connected devices in our lives its going to take some experimentation before we find the right formula that works for people and their beloved cars, the sort of R&amp;D that APIs are well suited for. I think vehicles play a pretty clear role in our lives, we understand the value they deliver, but I think its going to take some time to understand how to safely, and sensibly connect our cars to the Internet, and we need to jumpstart this conversation&mdash;not let it just be between car manufacturers and tech giants, but include auto enthusiasts, mechanics, developers and most importantly car owners.

			<p>I'm taking a look at the&nbsp;world of payment APIs&nbsp;right now. As with all my other monitoring of the API space, I am only looking for the best approaches, by the most interesting companies in the space--I don't have time to track on everything,&nbsp; I am looking to take a snapshot of the payment API space, understand who the key players are, and how they are delivering valuable payment API resources that developers are actually using. Last week I puled together 38 payment APIs that I'm watching, and this week I am spending some time going through their sites, looking for what I'd consider to be some of the common building blocks of payment APIs.&nbsp; Currently I have 50 building blocks I found across these 38 payment providers: Merchant Account&nbsp;- Creation, management and integration with merchant accounts that are required to process credit cards. Bank Account&nbsp;- Integration with existing bank accounts, for inclusion in payment workflows. Processor / Gateways&nbsp;- Access to multiple payment processors and gateways in multiple countries. Currencies&nbsp;- Ability to conduct transactions in multiple currencies. Credit Card Transactions&nbsp;- The option to process major credit cards. ACH Transactions&nbsp;- The option to process transactions over the ACH network. Checks / Wire Transactions&nbsp;- The option to do bank to bank, wire and check transactions. Cash Transactions - The option to process major credit cards. Virtual Transactions&nbsp;- The option to accept transactions for credits via virtual accounts. Aggregate Transactions&nbsp;- Tools for performing multiple transactions at once. Credit Card Reader&nbsp;- A physical credit card reading device. Credit Card Scan / Picture&nbsp;- A mobile phone scan or picture of a credit card. One Click / One Touch / Instant Buy&nbsp;- The ability to enable single action transactions. Recurring Payments&nbsp;- The ability to perform recurring or subscription based transactions. Prepayments&nbsp;- The ability to setup payment(s) prior to designated payment date. Metered Payments&nbsp;- Payments based upon some metered usage of a resource.

			<p><em>05 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I have a number of APIs that I've successfully integrated with, and an even greater number that I've just played around with, pulling data, seeing what is possible. If you have spent the time learning what an API does, and gotten familiar with the interface, that is worth something.  If you've successfully integrated with an API, understand its ins and outs, have code in production that depends on that API&mdash;that is worth a lot.
With all of this experience in working with APIs, how do you demonstrate it? We are seeing freelance agencies emerge that are focused on delivering developer talent that companies can put to use when building web and mobile apps using APIs&mdash;how will they demonstrate an individuals skills when it comes to a variety of APIs?
At some point we are going to need some sort of badging or credentialing system to help us demonstrate the mad API skills we all possess. I'm not talking badges in terms of check-ins or game levels, I&rsquo;m talking it terms of demonstrated project experience on specific APIs. How much of an API interface have I hacked on? Do I have production experience with an API, if so how much?
There needs to be a central badge authority, using an open technology like Mozilla Open Badges, and each API provider can work to establish various levels of badging. There will probably be a lot of meaningless badges that will emerge, but I think if we work at it, we can establish some real ways to measure and demonstrate API talent.
Right now I have a lot of API related experience, but no real way demonstrate this to any company or individual, beyond my blog, Twitter, Github and my charming personality. It would be cool if we could establish a badging and credential system that would work for quantifying all the amazing talent in the API sector and make sure it is put to good use.

			<p><em>04 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>The shortage of good API developer talent is something I see regularly, with the constant stream of job and project offers I get via email and LinkedIn. The first place companies and recruiters go when looking for API evangelists, developer evangelists, and API developers is apievangelist.com. I feel bad for some of the newbies I encounter, thinking they are going to easily find API talent. There just aren&rsquo;t enough developers who demonstrate their API skills, and even fewer who strive to be API evangelists. With the growth of the space, this is increasingly a problem, something I think is beginning to turn around. I recently stumbled across a site called APIXChange which focused on delivering API developer talent, but has recently pivoted to become Workmob: Workmob WorkMob is a company built by freelance developers, for freelance developers. Its founders have been on both sides of the freelance fence. We've been developers who hated the hassle of sourcing work, dealing with mindless projects, and competing with one another as low-priced commodities in a freelance meat market. We've also been founders and product managers who needed to hire freelance developers to supplement our teams. We overcome many of the same hurdles from the other side. Finding the great freelancers in the noise of all the mediocre ones, accurately describing what we're trying to accomplish, and keeping our hires on track and productive. URL: theworkmob.com Then I read about AirPair&rsquo;s network of pay-per-hour API experts want to make your next integration a doddle on Nextweb: AirPair AirPair is an extensive network of experts with deep knowledge across many technology stacks and solutions. AirPair accelerates software development by &ldquo;pairing&rdquo; experts with engineers in real-&shy;time via video and screen sharing - leading to better software, produced faster, and at lower costs. URL: airpair.com I think Workmob and Airpair are just the beginning. We will see talent shops who focus specifically on API developers, and eventually specific API sectors like healthcare,...[<a href="/2014/03/04/finding-good-api-developer-talent-is-hard/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Over the last couple months I&rsquo;ve been taking a deeper look at the API design space, trying to understand more about the tools and services that are emerging, and the different approaches being employed throughout the API design lifecycle. I started first with trying to understand the evolving motivations behind why people are using API definitions, then I spoke with API with the creators of API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, the three leading API design providers out there, to understand more about the vision behind their various approaches to API design. After talking to each of the providers, I wanted to understand more about the tooling that was emerging from each of the providers: API Blueprint RAML Swagger While each of these providers have their own approach to defining APIs, and the API design lifecycle, after looking through what they offer, you start seeing patterns emerge. After reviewing what API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger bring to the table, I squinted my eyes and try to understand what some of the common building blocks are for the API design space&mdash;resulting in what I consider 22 separate building blocks: Definition&nbsp;- A central, machine readable definition of an API interface, authentication and potentially data model, in XML, JSON or Markdown. (Examples: API Blueprint, RAML, Swagger) Parser&nbsp;- An API definition parser, available potentially in multiple languages and open up the programmatic generation of other API building blocks. Design Tools&nbsp;- User interface tools, allowing for the building of central API definitions, either in a code view or GUI view. Versioning&nbsp;- Systems allowing for the versioning of API definition, keeping track of all changes, allowing for rolling back of changes to previous versions. Forkable&nbsp;- The ability to fork an existing API definition, and create a new branch, that can live separately from the API definition it originates from.

As we gear up for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th, I&rsquo;m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.
You tend to not think of what country an API is from, unless its attached to public infrastructure, or a company is extremely vocal about their home country. I confess that I couldn&rsquo;t name a single API from Amsterdam before this week, but now I notice that Distimo, Drillster, ElasticSearch, Peerreach, and TwitterCounter were all out of the Netherlands, and were APIs I am already familiar with.
I was able to easily find 17 separate APIs out of the Netherlands:

			<p><em>04 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m working with the&nbsp;Cashtie API&nbsp;to pull together an API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together, it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.
Next up is what I call "landscape analysis", which is about monitoring the blogs, and other social network activity of the sector(s) you are evangelizing your API within:

Competition Monitoring - Evaluation of regular the activity of competitors, visiting their sites, and getting to know their customers.
Industry Monitoring - Evaluation of relevant topics and trends of overall industry, industries that you are evangelizing within.
Keywords - Established a list of keywords to use when searching for topics at search engines, QA, forums, social bookmarking and social networks&mdash;this should dovetail nicely into any SEO work your doing. You are doing SEO work?
City and Country Targeting - Target specific markets with your evangelism. Get to know where your existing developers and target developers reside, and get local--be on the ground.
Social Media Monitoring - Have a solid strategy and platform for pulling relevant data from Twitter accounts, #hashtag conversations, Github profiles, and other relevant platforms to use in your landscape analysis.

The "landscape", is the space you are looking at each and every day out your virtual window, as well as what your existing and target developers will see each day. It is your job as an evangelist or advocate to know this space well, understand all the elements of the landscape, key players, relationships, and be a contributing member to this landscape.
Lanscape analysis should be something you do every day, weaving it into your regular social media, and other online activities. Remember you aren&rsquo;t targeting this landscape of companies and users, you are looking to participate in the conversation, while also bring your API resources to the table.

I'm spending some time looking at how universities are using APIs across campus. I have been doing research in the area for a couple years, but I feel it is time that we generate more stories and blueprints, of how leading universities are putting them to use, so that the others can follow.
Right now I'm tracking on:







Brigham Young University







Cambridge University Library







Harvard







University of British Columbia







University of California Berkeley







University of Michigan







University of Warsaw







University of Warwick







University of Washington







University of Waterloo







York University Library




Only University of Washington, University of Waterloo, University of Michigan, and UC Berkeley have formal API developer programs. The rest just have an API for a specific purpose.&nbsp;
I'd like to see all universities have a formal API program, this is why I want to tell more stories and publish blueprints that schools can follow.
If you work at University or are a student, and you know of APIs that are listed, or even want to help evangelize APIs at your school let me know--I need you to help make this happen.

			<p><em>02 Mar 2014</em></p>

I am preparing a job description for an API evangelist position at the Cashtie API, something I do for companies from time to time. When working on a new one, I go out and look at current API evangelist job positions, to see what is new and noteworthy since last time I did it.
While doing this today, I came across a posting for API Evangelist at Akamai, and while&nbsp;reading, two lines really stood out:
As an API Evangelist, you are a thoughtful voice that represents a new developer mode of interaction, both inside and outside the company.
You will spread awareness of and encourage participation in our emerging API program to mold the future of our entire developer experience.
Both of these lines reflect what any company should be looking for in their API evangelist. I really like the use of &ldquo;thoughtful voice&rdquo;, &ldquo;spread awareness&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourage participation&rdquo; and talking about how important the role is to the future of a company's &ldquo;entire developer experience&rdquo;.
When crafting your own role description for an API evangelist, make sure you spend some time looking through other companies job postings and see what details are most important to you.

			<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about the politics of APIs, which in my opinion is the soul of the API economy. There are numerous things that go into the politics of an API, including your terms of service (TOS), privacy policy all the way to sharing your security strategy and communicating with your developers. The politics of APIs is all about the balance you take in your API operations, and how open, public, secure, transparent, accessible, and real you are in your overall approach. The politics of an API can reveal a lot about the company behind the resource, and will play a big role in how successful an API will ultimately be with the developer community. Every once in a while I stumble across a new building block being used by a company, that I think is worthy of being added to my master list. This weekend I found a new one from the chat &amp; inbox API Flowdock&mdash;the &ldquo;thanks" page. Usually in the footer of an API developer site you will find links to an APIs terms of use, privacy policy, security and the other political building blocks of an API. Flowdock has all of this, but also has a new one&mdash;simply, thanks. On their &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; page, Flowdock highlights &ldquo;the tools we use to create the best real-time teamwork environment possible&rdquo;, and says: Flowdock wouldn't be possible without some fine open-source software projects. These are some of the components we rely on, and we'd like to extend our thanks to all the authors Flowdock is right, we all depend on open-source software to make our increasingly API driven world go around. Whether it's the language(s) we program in, server OS, database platform, or the code libraries we use for API integration, open source software is an essential element of the API economy. I think we all recognize this, and some of us talk about it publicly, and even fewer actively support...[<a href="/2014/03/01/giving-thanks-to-the-open-source-software-gods/">Read More</a>]</p>

I&rsquo;m working with the&nbsp;Cashtie API&nbsp;to pull together an API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together, it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.
Next up is blogging, an area I feel is the single most important part of your API evangelism strategy:

Projects - Establishing of editorial assembly line of technical projects that can feed blog stories, how-tos, samples and code libraries.
Stories - Writing, editing and posting of stories derived from projects, with SEO and API area support by design.
Syndication - Syndication to Tumblr, Blogger and other relevant blogging sites that actually add value to readers, not being spammy.

This part of evangelism can be as involved as you like, being the work of a lone evangelist, or the work of a team of coders, writers, editors and community managers. The goal is to generate exhaust around your API, that will attract new developers to an API, as well as educate existing developers about the value an API delivers.
If you aren&rsquo;t producing interesting projects around your API, and telling these stories far and wide, nobody will ever know your API exists, let alone put it to use.

I have already look at the&nbsp;evolving motivations behind API definitions, and some insight into the&nbsp;vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML, next up is taking a look at the tooling that is emerged around each approach. I began with a look at the tooling around Swagger, then I laid out what is offered around API Blueprint, from Apiary.io&mdash;next up, RAML which is developed by Mulesoft, and reflects the evolution of the API design space, making it much more attractive to the enterprise. Like API Blueprint, RAML is a markdown based API description format, which is an evolution from the XML of WADL, and the JSON of Swagger. I think this approach to defining APIs has significance when exposing API design beyond the developers community, but only time will tell. Everything RAML centers around the RESTful API Modeling Language: RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) - A concise, expressive language for describing RESTful APIs. RAML is built on broadly used standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open spec. With RAML interpreters available in JS and Java: RAML JavaScript Parser - A reference implementation of a RAML parser for JavaScript. It's based on PyYAML, written in CoffeeScript, and can be used as a node.js module or in-browser. It is compliant with RAML 0.8, and provided under an Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; RAML Java Parser - A reference implementation of a RAML parser for Java. It's based on SnakeYAML, and written in Java. It can be added as a Java library into a project directly or through Apache Maven. It is compliant with RAML 0.8, and provided under an Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; Beyond the RAML interpreter you start seeing some pretty sophisticated tooling for the API design process emerge:...[<a href="/2014/03/01/api-design-tooling-from-raml/">Read More</a>]</p>

Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy. Next up is developer engagement, and focusing on the ways you reach out to API consumers. You don&rsquo;t need to describe every way you are going to engage with developers, but you should make sure and pick a handful of channels and stick with them, regularly reaching out to developers, providing a communication platform they can depend on. There are some proven approaches to developer outreach: Fresh Engagement - Emailing new developers who have registered to see what their immediate needs are, while their registration is fresh in their minds Active User Engagement - Reaching out to existing, active users of an API and find out what they need. Profile them, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and pull any profile information, then grade and categorize each developer Historical Engagement - Emailing historical active and / or inactive developers to engage and understand what their needs are and would make them active or increase activity, consider newsletter or personalized emails when appropriate Social Engagement - When emailing any developer, using Rapportive you can establish any URL, Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn profile they have and reach out via these networks There are many other ways to reach out to developers, but you should have a regular rhythm for reaching out to new developers, existing developers will re-enforce relationships with your developers consistently through the channels that make the most sense. If developers know they will get regularly information from you via a newsletter, and that you are accessible via common social media channels, they are more likely to reach out when they need help, and have you in the back of their mind when they do encounter a problem that your API provides a...[<a href="/2014/02/26/api-evangelism-strategy-developer-outreach/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>As part of my research in the world of API design, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs. I have already look at the evolving motivations behind API definitions, and some insight into the vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML, next up is take a look at the tooling that is evolving around each approach. First up is Swagger, from the folks over at Wordnik. I would consider Swagger the first mover in this new world of API design, with the Wordnik team&rsquo;s approach centered around a JSON based API definition: Swagger Core - A JSON based API definition format, which allows for the description of REST APIs Around the Swagger core the Wordnik team developed a core set of tooling that met their immediate needs for the Wordnik API: Swagger CodeGen - A template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing a Swagger Core definition Swagger UI - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger defined API Secondarily other more specific tools have emerged: Swagger JS - Javascript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or nodejs Swagger Node Express - Swagger module for node.js w/express module Swagger Socket - A REST over WebSocket Swagger Play 2 - Provides automatically-generated Swagger JSON for the Play! framework Swagger was born out of Wordnik&rsquo;s desire for interactive documentation, but evolved into tooling for generating server and client side code, and has ended up providing a central language for facilitating discussions around API design, deployment and integration in many other areas. I know there are some other tools available out there for Swagger, this just represents would I could find easily off their Github account. If there are other Swagger tools you know of, let me know and I&rsquo;m happy to add to...[<a href="/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
It can be pretty difficult to explain exactly what an API does to the average person. Some people think of APIs being associated with databases, where others think they are always attached to online applications like Facebook or Twitter.  Then there are so many types of APIs, where do you start, when someone asks what is an API?
To help people understand APIs, it is best to move away from the technical explanation and get closer to the actual problem being solved by your API. Example, a new API I&rsquo;m working with called the Cashtie API lets you generate barcodes that can be scanned from mobile phones at the point of sale (POS) systems at major retailers&mdash;a technical explanation
Let&rsquo;s talk about a problem. Anyone selling a product or service (online or offline) would love to have their product in major retailers like Walmart, Target and CVS. The problem is how do you get your product into these stores? In this case, the solution is the Cashtie API, which allows mobile application developers to generate the barcodes that allow your customers to pay cash for products and services, or pay their bills at these retail locations.
It can be easy to think of your API in a technical sense, especially if you are the geek who developed it. What is really important, is that you think of it terms of providing solutions to actual problems businesses are facing. If you think of your API in these terms, and can easily articulate to any random person the value it delivers, there is a much greater chance your API will be put to use.

			<p><em>24 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m stepping back and trying to understand more about where we are at in the history of APIs. Looking at the API space in terms of our past, provides me with a healthier understanding of where we are currently, and where things are possibly headed. I tend to not get blinded by the shiny new technology that surrounds us, hopefuly allowing me to see a bigger picture. I just wrote about how I feel we are in what I would call the enterprise phase of APIs, where large companies, not just tech startups are seeing the benefit of web APIs. I think there will still be lots of innovation from startups, but to take the API economy to the level, where it is truly part of the global economy, the enterprise has to get on the train. These phases of API evolution don&rsquo;t happen one after another, they overlap, with commerce, social, cloud and mobile all feeding into what is attracting large global enterprises to APIs, while all these sectors also need the enterprise to get on board--everything is interconnected. As with the enterprise layer of the API economy, I think the recent increased government awareness of APIs, is just as significant as the attention we are seeing from the enterprise. While writing my post about the the enterprise phase, I noticed that I&rsquo;m speaking with just as many federal agencies as I have been from the enterprise. I can&rsquo;t help but look at this movement in government alongside the big moves from the enterprise. Many folks aren&rsquo;t seeing the movement they&rsquo;d like to from our government when it comes to APIs, but even though things aren't perfect, we are seeing big movement from all levels of government when it comes to open data and API, with over 75 federal agencies deploying APIs. In the last month, I&rsquo;ve talked to numerous federal agencies about their API strategies, beyond just open data&mdash;I mean census, regulatory, patent,...[<a href="/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
While looking through hundreds of blogs from API providers, one practice that I&rsquo;m seeing more of is companies showcasing their own use of their API. Some of you may think this is obvious, but I think a lot of companies are using their own API and never tell the story about how they are using their own services&mdash;I mean if your API is so great, demonstrate to people why it is so kick ass.
Don&rsquo;t just say dumb shit like we eat our own dog food, show us how, where and why you use it. Prove to us that you use the same APIs that you are delivering to external developers. Are you using to drive your website? mobile devices? partner integrations? Let us know the details about how it was designed, deployed and the challenges you face in not just managing but also integrating it with your apps.
I&rsquo;m sure you are using your APIs in some pretty cool ways internally, but if you don&rsquo;t tell the story to your external partners and developers, they will never know how cool your APIs really are. You never know, one of your stories might convince one of them to use your APIs as well.

			<h3><a href="/2014/02/24/landscape-targeting-payment-apis/">Landscape Targeting: Payment APIs</a></h3>
			<p><em>24 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>When I want to understand a business sector as part of my overall analysis, or part of a specific API strategy, I kick off what I call a &ldquo;landscape targeting&rdquo; campaign. This time around I am interested in better understanding the the landscape of the payment API space. Every landscape targeting campaign begins with some Googling of the top key phrase, which this time is "payment API". From this I manually build a list of key players in the payment API space. My goal is to not build a complete list, but a list of the players doing it well&mdash;screw the rest. I only have time to target the best approaches, and in the payment space I find roughly 35 players, which I will publish later. While I am conducting this same procedure on all 35 payment companies, I start with the one I know the best, and feel will produce the most meaningful results&mdash;Stripe. To help me quantify Stripe&rsquo;s ecosystem landscape I execute the following: Pull a Twitter profile for @Stripe, which gives me a snapshot of their Twitter account, via the Twitter API Pull lists of @Stripe Twitter followers and friends Twitter IDs using the Twitter API Pull a Twitter profile for the followers and friends of @Stripe, so I have each of their names, bios, location, and friend / follower count Pull a Github profile for Stripe, which gives me a snapshot of their Github account, with overall activity, via the Github API Pull a list of all Stripe repositories using the Github API Pull a list of each repositories watchers, subscribers and contributors using the Github API Pull each of those repo watchers, subscribers and contributors Github profiles using the Github API Profile each Twitter follower using Full Contact API to obtain their alternate Github or LinkedIn profile Profile each Github user that shared their email address using Full Contact API to obtain their alternate Twitter or LinkedIn profile For Stripe,...[<a href="/2014/02/24/landscape-targeting-payment-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2014/02/24/apistrat-is-where-the-key-api-conversations-are-happening/">#APIStrat Is Where The Key API Conversations Are Happening</a></h3>
			<p><em>24 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m working with Phil Legetter (@leggetter) to put together a panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam on APIs and realtime, and as I&rsquo;m working to bring together the leaders from the space together, I can&rsquo;t help but think of past APIStrat panels. At APIStrat we are looking to pull together the leaders from different business sectors and have a conversation on where we are, and where things are going with trends like API aggregation, automation, design, BaaS and realtime.
At APIStrat, NYC 203 we brought together the leaders from the backend as a service (BaaS) space, including Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of&nbsp;Parse, Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of&nbsp;Kinvey, Marc Weil (@marcweil) of&nbsp;Cloudmine, Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of&nbsp;Kii, Ty Amell (@tyamell) of&nbsp;StackMob&nbsp;James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of&nbsp;Firebase, resulting in a pretty interesting discuss about what is BaaS, and the future of the fast growing trend in using APIs for mobile development.
Fast-forward to March of 2014, Parse has been acquired by Facebook, Stackmob acquired by Paypal and shut-down just last week, and the speed at which the tech sector moves is really evident. I started tracking on BaaS in 2011, and just 3 years later the space has evolved fast&mdash;making conversations like the APIStrat BaaS panel critical in helping shape the industry.
As APIs + realtime technologies gain in popularity amongst startups and leading tech companies, its time to get together and have a conversation with leading tech companies in the realtime space like Pusher, Pubnub, Firebase, and Fanout.io to name a few. Much like BaaS, the important conversations around key trends in API like realtime, will be occurring at APIStrat.
These conversations are why the 3Scale team and API Evangelist put on #APIStrat, and look forward to you being part of these important discussions. Make sure you are registered for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 26-28th.

			<p><em>24 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working with the Cashtie API to pull together API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy. First up, is goals. What are the goals of your API initiative? Increase Awareness of API Program - The number one priority for any API, increase awareness that you even exist! Growth in New Users - Everyone wants new registrations for the API--it s a great goal, but don&rsquo;t get too caught up in just acquiring new users. Growth in Existing User API Usage - How do we encourage existing users to consume more, be more successful in using API resources. Brand Awareness - Elevate the awareness of not just an API but the overall company brand(s), establishing life long customers. These are just a few initial goals every company should consider when crafting an API evangelism campaign, but don&rsquo;t stop there, what are some other goals? New Customers For Other Products - Do you have other products and services you&rsquo;d like your API end-users to be aware of? Value Add For Existing Customers - Maybe you have an existing customer base you want to encourage development of products, services and features that add value to their existing engagement. Revenue - Money, of course, we all need to make money. How do we leverage API resources into new sources of revenue for our company? Having short term, and long term goals is essential to any API evangelism strategy. What are our long term goals? What goals do we have this week? How do they change over time? Documenting our goals is critical, so we can deliver on them, but also understand how we need to shift our goals to be more successful over time. Do you have goals for your API program that aren't listed here? Share them with me...[<a href="/2014/02/24/api-evangelism-strategy-goals/">Read More</a>]</p>
