<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3D-Nylon-Bike.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm watching the future of manufacturing and printing unfold slowly in front of us.  I'm paying attention to 3D printing solutions evolving from companies like <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>, <a title="Makerbot" href="https://www.makerbot.com/">MakerBot</a>, <a title="Materialise" href="http://www.materialise.com/">Materialise</a>, <a title="ZCorp" href="http://www.zcorp.com/">ZCorp</a>, and <a title="Object" href="http://www.objet.com/">Objet</a>.<p>
At the same time I'm involved with the rollout of <a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a>, an API for managing printing to any printer over the Internet.<p>
I'm using <a title="Google Docs as a Publishing Platform" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-docs-as-a-publishing-platform/">Google Docs as a publishing platform</a>, integrating Google Cloud Print with the <a title="Mimeo Connect API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect API</a> and evolving whats possible with commercial cloud printing.<p>
Google has added <a title="Support for many more native file formats in Google Docs" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-docs-file-formats-viewer-web-and-api/">support for many more native file formats in Google Docs</a>.  Now all they need to do is add support for common 3D printing file formats:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>.<a title=".stl file format" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">stl</a> - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".iges file format" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGES">iges</a> - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".obj file format" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">obj</a> - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".3ds file format" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.3ds">3ds</a> - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software.</li>
</ul>
To support 3D printing file formats I'm sure they will have to introduce a new app to the Google Apps suite or evolve Google Drawings.<p>
Google Drawings only supports importing of .wmf files and exporting of .jpg, .pdf, .png, and .svg formats.<p>
I'm working on some modifications to the Google Cloud Print capabilities definition via .ppd or .xps for commericial cloud printing, I think we could also bend this definition to support 3D printing and mnufacturing.<p>
We have a ways to go, but I see the future of cloud 3D printing and manufacturing unfold in front of us with 3-D printing and cloud printing.

<img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/scraping.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" />I'm organizing my code libraries tonight. These are PHP, JavaScript, Regular Expressions, SQL, and other tools I use for different purposes.
<p>One such purpose is harvesting and scraping. I have an extensive library of PHP code I've used in the last 5 years to pull web pages, parse tables, submit forms, and what not.
<p>As I'm organizing these snippets of code into <a title="Snippely" href="https://code.google.com/p/snippely/">Snippely</a>, I'm thinking about all the effort I've put into getting content.
<p>I've harvested government data, craigslist posting, real estate listings, and a wide variety of news, products, and geo-data.
<p>If I need some data, I much prefer using an API, but if I have a need and there is data available on a web page...I just harvest it.
<p>If a content provider does not have an open API, I view them much differently than if they do. I see them as a source of content, there is no real relationship. <img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/harvesting.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> When a content provider has an open API, I will use their API. If the API offers enough value, I will pay to use it, and establish a relationship with the content provider.
<p>Content providers will have far more control over their content by providing an open API, even if the content is also available on their site. This control will allow owners to track usage and even monetize it.
<p>I would much prefer to pull data and other content from an API rather than scrape or harvest it.

<a title="Phaxio" href="http://www.phaxio.com/">Phaxio</a>, an API that allows developers to <a title="integrating faxing capabilities into application" href="http://www.phaxio.com/">integrate faxing capabilities into their applications</a>, has  email invitation as a main menu option in its API area.<p>
The Phaxio API is in private beta, but existing users can send off a Phaxio invitation code that allows other developers to discover and sign up for the faxing service.<p>
Application email invites are clearly not something new.  And with the growth of social media, it may be that sharing via Twitter or Facebook has become more associated with the steps necessary to make things "go viral."  Nevertheless, having the ability to send out invitations via email can still provide essential word-of-mouth marketing for your API and shouldn't be overlooked.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-popularity.png" alt="" width="375" align="right" />How do you measure the popularity of your API, or someone else's API?<p>
If its your API, hopefully you have metrics established for every part of your API and supporting API area.<p>
But how can we measure the API space as a whole?  I get asked a lot about, what are the top APIs out there.<p>
<a title="ProgrammableWeb Measures Popularity" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">ProgrammableWeb measures popularity</a> by the number of mashups that are built on an API.  Using this metric, Google Maps, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube rise to the top.<p>
Not all APIs are suited for mashups, and we definitely need more ideas of how to measure popularity and usage of Open APIs.<p>
I would start by using <a title="Alexa" href="https://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>, <a title="Compete" href="http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a>, and <a title="Quantcast" href="https://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> who provide SEO related analytics and ranking for web sites.<p>
Next I would look at the number of partners an API has showcased in their developers area or web site.<p>
After partners I would look for the number of developers showcased as part of an API ecosystem.  Not all APIs provide tools for developers to have a public profile, but if they do, this can be an important measurement.<p>
After the number of partner and public users, I would take a close look at how many applications are developed on a platform.  Both internally and community developed applications.  These represent completed projects where developers have successfully integrated with an API.<p>
Then I think overall API community activity and resources would be a good thing to measure.  How many code samples, language kits, FAQ, forum posts, and other resources are provided. This reflects the amount of resources a company and community has put into an API.<p>
There is no perfect way to measure the success and popularity of an API on the open Internet, but these are a few ideas for variables the industry might consider when developing an algorithm for tracking the popularity of APIs in this fast growing space.

As an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I'm always grouping and targeting my API consumers, to better meet their needs and identify their role within my <a title="API Ecosystem" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php">API ecosystem</a>.
<p>The three main groups that I break my API users into, are:<img src="https://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=300x225&amp;cht=p3&amp;chd=s:SSMG&amp;chdl=Partner|Public|Inernal|Platform&amp;chdlp=b&amp;chma=1,1,1,1&amp;chtt=API+Ecosystem&amp;chts=000000,14" alt="API Ecosystem" width="300" height="225" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Partners Developers
     </li>
     <li>Public Developers
     </li>
     <li>Internal Developers
     </li>
</ul>When I first started working with APIs, I generally focused on API access for partners.
<p>With the introduction of Open APIs, I began paying attention to a wider audience of developers from different countries, industries, programming languages and platforms.
<p>Recently APIs are also being recognized for their use internally. API owners often target other departments or business locations when deploying or consuming APIs.
<p>As the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>, I'm seeing a new target emerge, platform partners.
<p>Platform partners are tend to be other complimentary APIs and / or <a title="self-service application platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application platforms</a> like <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.
<p>Just like with my partners, public, and internal developers I'm developing specific strategies, code samples, documentation and other tools targeting my designated partner platforms.
<p>Partner platforms are quickly becoming an important part of my API ecosystem, we'll see where this trend goes.

title: 'API Business Models - How to choose the right one for you?'
image: http://www.3scale.net/wp-content/uploads/Biz-Model-Complementary-and-Core-Assets.png
---

Presentation assets are the user interface or visual front-end to an application.  Logic assets are the algorithms, analytics or services which take data inputs, do some processing and provide a response.  Data is the raw content but can also include simple transformations of the content.  Different services can be linked together to provide a complete application system.<p>
It is important to break out of the mind-set that your company has to deliver all three assets.  It is true that traditionally the only way to deliver applications was for a company to own responsibility of all three.  However the World Wide Web and APIs liberate companies from the need to deliver all three.  Now more and more companies benefit if they focus on their unique value-add.  Once you identify your core assets, it becomes clear which complementary assets will be provided by your partners.  Thus to reach a strategy you are satisfied with, follow the simple steps:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Identify your own core asset(s)</li>
	<li>Choose the complementary asset which will deliver most value</li>
	<li>Define the strategy to capture the value most effectively</li>
</ol>
For example for <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> the core asset that they distribute via their API is data, in the form of the immense stream of 140 character tweets.  They made a decision early in the company history to focus all their resources on this core asset - notwithstanding recent strategy changes where they are trying to re-assert control of more of the Presentation and Logic assets.  This means that with the original strategy the complementary assets were Presentation and Logic assets.  In these two areas the company would build partnerships to deliver enhanced solutions to meet the diverse needs of Twitter users - a far greater variety that Twitter alone could ever deliver.<p>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-38112" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/?attachment_id=38112"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38112" src="https://www.3scale.net/wp-content/uploads/Biz-Model-Complementary-and-Core-Assets.png" alt="API Business Model: Core and Complementary Assets" width="542" height="275" /></a><p>
Let us say that of the two complementary assets, Twitter decided to focus on Presentation, because they realised that it is critical to get mobile client coverage.  Then the strategy definition was to power mobile apps.  The company defined the specific APIs and a business model that would attract developers to create new mobile front-ends for Twitter.  An example of a Twitter partner that leverages the API to deliver a mobile client and fulfil this strategy is <a href="https://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a>:<p>

<em>Note that the highlighted boxes are not the only assets that the company provides, but rather they indicate the most important, or core asset.  The remaining two are candidates for complementary partners, even if there may be some level of co-opetition.</em>
<h3>Business Model options with an API</h3>
Once the strategy is agreed, you will find that the use of an API opens up new options in the choice of business model.  For each potential business strategy you need to evaluate which is an appropriate business model to execute. The options related to APIs include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Product / Service</strong>: if the main way for the company to deliver value is through its API e.g. Twilio from the table above.</li>
	<li><strong>Distribution</strong>: to extend the company's reach, the API allows the company's content or services to be accessed from other applications or devices (such as smartphones).  This could be in the form of a channel business model, but it may simply be to broaden access via partnerships.  There are several options for monetizing the channel option including product resale, whitelabel licensing, or affiliate commissions.   An example of this is Wolfram Alpha's partnership agreement with Microsoft's Bing search engine.</li>
	<li><strong>Promotion</strong>: if an important role is to raise awareness for the company's products or brand, and generate additional traffic.  This is the business model used by Netflix and The Guardian for movies and news content respectively.</li>
	<li><strong>Content Acquisition</strong>: to make it easy to gather content which will then form a strong base for the value of a company.  An example of this when job posting websites cross-post job openings to Indeed via their APIs.</li>
</ul>
These business model options are not exclusive.  In fact the presence of an API will usually mean that several of these are achieved.  A good way to think about it is to choose one focus area for the business model, and additionally one or two supporting areas.  We will elaborate on some detailed examples later.  A related choice to the business model is to identify how directly the value of the API will be monetized.  This is typically not a black-and-white decision, but rather there is a spectrum of possibilities.  The following table gives examples at several points along the spectrum from very direct pricing based on API calls, to completely indirect value capture.

We have now seen a framework to evaluate the best business model options for your API.  It began with an assessment of your core asset to determine what strategy will guide your API.  Then you explore four different directions for business models to find which is the best fit for your strategy.  In parallel with the business model evaluation, you can optionally define some high-level pricing approaches.  In the next post in the series we will look at each of the four business model options in more detail, before applying this framework to a number of existing companies to show how these business models look in the real world.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/nieman-journalism-labs-icon.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" />There is an excellent analysis of Open API usage in news organizations at the Nieman Journalism Lab, called <a title="Wisdom of the crowd: Key lessons from news organizations using open APIs to ramp up R&amp;D" href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/04/wisdom-of-the-developer-crowd-key-lessons-from-news-organizations-using-open-apis-to-ramp-up-rd/">Wisdom of the (developer) crowd: Key lessons from news organizations using open APIs to ramp up R&amp;D</a>.<p>
This analysis is a summary of a paper by<a title="Seth Lewis" href="http://sethlewis.org/">Seth Lewis</a>, professor at University of Minnesota, and <a title="Tanja Altamurto" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tanja-aitamurto">Tanja Aitamurto</a>, a Finish PH.D student at Stanford, that was presented at the International Symposium on Online Journalism earlier this month.<p>
After studying the approaches of the four biggest players with open APIs are <a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR</a>, <a title="The New York Times" href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, <a title="The Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">The Guardian</a>, and <a title="USA Today" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, Lewis and Aitamurto came away with five key lessons:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Open APIs can serve as external R&amp;D labs</li>
	<li>Open APIs present a revenue opportunity</li>
	<li>Open APIs help weave news organizations into the fabric of the web</li>
	<li>Open APIs create an ecosystem effect</li>
	<li>Open APIs can be a challenge, especially within the news organization</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/the_guardian.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> Lewis and Aitamurto conclude that Open APIs are not the solution to all of the news industries problems, but they are significant step toward a form of online publishing that is in sync with the web, and also allow publishers to take advantage of thewisdomof the (developer) crowd for research &amp; development.<p>
These new approaches offer a first glimpse of what <a title="Open Innovation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation">open innovation</a> using APIs could bring to the news business when it comes to revenue and partnerships.<p>

---

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/hackeducation.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I've been watching my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>, evolve her online presence as a freelance writer working for <a title="ReadWriteWeb" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/author/audrey-watters.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a title="O'Reilly" href="http://radar.oreilly.com/audreyw/">O'Reilly</a>, <a title="NPR Mindshift" href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/">NPR Mindshift</a>, and other high profile blogs.
<p><a title="@AudreyWatters" href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@AudreyWatters</a> has large Twitter following, however she keeps her Facebook very private.
<p>A growing portion of her user base are sending her Facebook friend requests, because she keeps her profile private, she doesn't accept. So naturally she created a <a title="Facebook page" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Audrey-Watters/100999103321790">Facebook page</a>.
<p>I watched her install the Facebook <a title="like social-plugin" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/">like social plug-in</a> to the single.php file, which will display it on each blog post, and added an <a title="activity feed social plug-in" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/activity/">activity feed social plug-in</a> to the sidebar of her blog. She runs her blog on Wordpress, and was able to do this easily.
<p>Facebook social plug-ins make your site social, but by using the <a title="Open Graph Protocol" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/">Open Graph Protocol</a> she was able to offer a deeper integration with Facebook. By having her blog integrated with the Open Graph API she is able to push content to her "fans" Facebook wall, increasing the reach of her blog to their social streams.
<p>Audrey got her inspiration to do this from the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/journalist">Journalist on Facebook</a> fan page, a page created by Facebook to educate journalists about best practices using Facebook to disseminate information.
<p>I see Facebook doing two things to encourage this kind of API usage:<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook_logo-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>API User Targetin</strong>g - Going beyond the current definition of partner and (internal and external)l developer focus, and identifying other target groups of users beyond the developer community, and providing a Facebook page and other information for a target group.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API Embed Strategy</strong> - Facebook has a great API embed strategy, providing a suite of embeddable tools that any user can use to make their sites social -- extending their sites reach to Facebook, while also expanding Facebook's presence on to other sites.
     </li>
</ul>I'm seeing shifts in many APIs lately to a more embeddable approach, such as <a title="Twitter Web Intents" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/simpler-twitter-api-integration-with-web-intents/">Twitter's Web Intents</a>, and <a title="LinkedIn Evolution of its Developer Platform" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/linkedin-api-platform-and-the-evolution-of-the-api/">LinkedIn's evolution of its developer platform</a>.
<p>In addition to an embed strategy, Facebook is creating pages and other resources targeting specific user groups. This is a potentially powerful combination for attracting new users and extending the reach of Facebook across the web.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Freshbooks_610x564.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="Sample Code Libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">Sample code libraries</a> are an essential part of an API ecosystem. They give developers a head start when integrating their applications with an API.<p>
I've explored the concept of <a title="letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/01/use-your-community-to-build-api-code-libraries/">letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries</a>. Doing this may create a more engaged community and give developers a sense of ownership and attachment to the API.<p>
As I <a title="reviewed the Freshbooks API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/freshbooks-api-review/">reviewed the Freshbooks API</a>, I noticed they have a very community-driven API code samples area.<p>
The Freshbooks API provides client libraries in Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, JavaScript, ActionScript, Java, .NET, and C++, as well as plug-ins for popular frameworks like Zend, Drupal and Symphony.<p>
Many of the <a title="client libraries and plug-ins" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/sample-code/">client libraries and plug-ins</a> are built by the Freshbooks API community, such as:
<blockquote><img style="padding-bottom: 5px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/ryan-szrama.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="right" /><em>Drupal plugin by <a title="Ryan Szrama" href="https://drupal.org/user/49344">Ryan Szrama</a>.  Szrama is an active member of the Drupal community.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><img style="padding-bottom: 5px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/matt-culbreth.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="right" /><em>Python client libraries by <a title="Matt Culbreth" href="http://mattculbreth.com/index.html">Matt Culbreth</a>, a software developer in Marietta, Georgia USA.</em></blockquote>
By encouraging your API developers to build code samples, plug-ins, and code libraries, you can get necessary tools built for an API.  But just as importantly, you're building community and providing a much needed spotlight for your developers.  This in turn helps them be successful in their careers.

<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/washington-crossing-the-delaware-cropped.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />We are witnessing some <a title="tremendous growth in the number of new web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">tremendous growth in the number of new Web APIs</a>.  <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, for example, added 1000 new APIs to its directory over the last year.<p>
Many of these APIs are brand new and have very few code samples or libraries to go with them.<p>
These new APIs represent a huge opportunity for developers to stake a claim within these communities -- to build their portfolios and their resumes.<p>
Recently Google released their <a title="Google Cloud Print Service" href="https://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a>.   The only thing available was some documentation describing the handful of API endpoints for managing printers and print jobs.<p>
I went to work trying to understand Google's vision of cloud printing, and I wrote a simple PHP class for working with Google Cloud Print.   I published on <a title="Github - Google Cloud Print" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Google-Cloud-Print-Proxy">Github</a> and <a title="Google Code - Google Cloud Print" href="https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-print-proxy/">Google Code</a> and blogged about my work.<p>
By creating a PHP class for Google Cloud Print I established myself as an early mover in the space, and I attracted attention to my work. Even Google noticed and someone from Google contacted me.<p>
Since Google Cloud Print was so new, and they are actively encouraging community participation, there was an opportunity for me establish a presence.<p>
Many API providers are taking a similiar <a title="community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/15/community-driven-api-code-samples-and-libraries/">community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries</a>.  Within these communities, there are windows of opportunities for developers to claim their territory, get a little of the spotlight, while building their portfolios and resumes along the way.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Developer-Network.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> refreshed its <a title="LinkedIn Developer Platform" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">developer platform</a> recently, updating its <a title="RESTful API" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/community/apis">RESTful API</a> and <a title="JavaScript API" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/community/jsapi">JavaScript API</a>.<p>
A noticeable change, was its continued evolution towards a more plug and play API environment.<p>
When you visit the <a title="LinkedIn Developer Area" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/index.jspa">LinkedIn developers area</a>, the first option on the menu is plug-ins, and the main page is totally dominated by embeddable profile tools.<p>
The RESTful API and Javascript API are only accessible off a single menu option, the community has a clear focus on courting non-developer LinkedIn users.<p>
With the rise in popularity of RESTful APIs and JavaScript, we are seeing a explosion in <a title="Widget, Embeds, Plug-In" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/06/allow-api-users-to-embed-content-with-oembed/">widgets, embeds, plug-ins</a> and other copy / paste code that any tech savvy user can deploy.<p>
Attracting the developer community to new APIs can be tough.  Programmers tend to be drawn to exciting, new, and shiny APIs that provide challenges and new opportunities.   The business and professional focus of LinkedIn doesn't quite put the "shiny" in API.<p>
LinkedIn shows an understanding of its user base, and the best way to provide API tools that these tech savvy users can copy and paste on their web site, social networks, and other applications.

Being the forward thinkers they are, they say:
<blockquote><em>If there's an app there's an API, so we've made ours available to everyone...</em></blockquote>
The <a title="GitHub Jobs API" href="https://jobs.github.com/api">GitHub Jobs API</a> allows you to search, view, and create jobs with JSON over HTTP.<p>
The APIalso provides support for JSONP, by appending ?callback=myFunction to any API request, it will wrap the response in a function call to myFunction. This is useful when making requests to the GitHub Jobs API using JavaScript.<p>
Nothing to revolutionary, or noteworthy about the API, except Github is just way cool, and I love their perspective that, if there is an app there is an API.

At API Evangelist I'm focused on the business of APIs, with a minor focus on the technology behind those APIs.  So when I publish a business review of an API, I will add it to my API database, then move on.<p>
That is, unless I identify a story -- an innovative approach, monetization strategy, or anything that I feel needs to be talked about in more detail.<p>
While reviewing the <a title="Freshbooks API" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks API</a> I found three notable building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a title="Application Billing" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/billing/">Application Billing</a></strong> - A built in billing and payment framework for Freshbook applications and beyond</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Webhooks" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/webhooks/">Webhooks</a></strong> - Framework for enabling application callbacks, URLs where the Freshbook system can send notifications to third party applications</li>
	<li><a title="Freshbooks Add-On Store" href="http://community.freshbooks.com/addons/"><strong>FreshBooks Add-on Stor</strong>e</a> - Application store and development platform for developers to build custom apps, showcase,  and sell to Freshbook customers.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Self-Service Application Frameworks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Frameworks</a> like the Freshbooks Add-On Store are growing more common.  I've talked about similar systems from <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.  The Freshbooks Add-On store is not 100% self-service, but it is close.
<a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/freshbooks-leaf.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
Webhooks are nothing new, but Freshbook offers a standardized approach to deploying web-hooks that makes them easy for developer to use.<p>
A built in payment system is definitely a notable <a title="API Building Block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">API building block</a>.  Providing developers with a baked-in payment system for handling application monetization is very innovative.<p>
Where do these three building blocks fit into the big picture?   I try to build profiles for common API building blocks, I don't have profiles for self-service application frameworks, webhooks, and payment systems, but as I evaluate more I will define these as more innovative building blocks for API owners to use.<p>
I will definitely be keeping an eye on the <a title="Freshbook" href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbook</a> approach to their API.

<img src="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buddies.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />There are many  approaches to building an API ecosystem.  Some approach it more like building an API community, and others as growing an API ecosystem.<p>
<a title="Howard Liptzin" href="https://twitter.com/howardliptzin#">Howard Liptzin</a>, at Avatar Industries prefers a more <a title="organic approach to growing an API community" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">organic approach growing an API community</a>.  In his own words:
<blockquote><em>What you'll want to do is to create the conditions for a community to form, thrive, produce and grow.</em></blockquote>
Liptzin emphasises gardening over engineering, not managing your community, more facilitate. Before you even start, Liptzin offers a little advice:
<blockquote><em>Make sure your API actually solves a problem that merits solving!</em></blockquote>
Then Liptzin identifies five areas to address when growing your API ecosystem:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Creation</li>
	<li>Activation</li>
	<li>Retention</li>
	<li>Productivity</li>
	<li>Growth</li>
</ul>
It is great to see other API owners and evangelists share their philosophies and approach to growing their community.<p>
I recommend reading Liptzin's full post, <a title="Rainmaking via Developer Communities" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">Rainmaking via Developer Communities</a>.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I keep stumbling across innovative approaches to using Web APIs, for non-developers.
<p>The other day I wrote about <a title="Quantifying your social media impact, using Google Docs and social media" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/apis-are-not-just-for-developers/">quantifying your social media impact,</a> using Google Docs and social media APIs, by<a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.
<p>Tonight I came across a example of <a title="archiving your daily tweets into a Google spreadsheet and the Twitter API" href="http://blogofmu.com/2011/04/05/bring-twitter-api-data-in-google-docs-to-quickly-viewmanipulate/">archiving your daily tweets</a> into a Google spreadsheet using the Twitter API.
<p><a title="Richard Orelup" href="https://twitter.com/#!/ripsup">Richard Orelup</a> came up with this little hack in response to this tweet:
<blockquote>
     <em>So in all of Twitter-dom, there is seriously no tool that archives a day's tweets in a sortable fashion?</em>
</blockquote>Using the <a title="importXML() function" href="https://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=75507">importXML() function</a> he pulls Twitter updates from the <a title="Twitter API" href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a> and stores in this <a title="Google Spreadsheet" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AncshzELR0ZHdDdoSWJKc0JtWjBYT0NpX0V6dlhzUUE&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJr2ztYJ#gid=0">Google Spreadsheet</a>.

<p>I just finished reading, <a title="Will 3-D Printing End Mass Manufacturing" href="https://mashable.com/2011/04/10/3d-printing-pics/">Will 3-D Printing End Mass Manufacturing</a>, on Mashable.
<p>I also had a link to an <a title="open source manufacturing" href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Manufacturing_Tools">open source manufacturing</a> site bookmarked from a couple months ago.
<p>And of course I live and breathe <a title="Web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/">Web APIs</a> on a daily basis.
<p>So after reading all this, my mind starts thinking about open source manufacturing processes bundled with open web APIs, and the future of 3-D printing and / or manufacturing.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Open Source Manufacturing" href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Manufacturing_Tools">Open Source Manufacturing</a></strong> - Open source manufacturing lets you download hardware, blue-prints, and instructions for any potential manufacturing process.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">Web-APIs</a></strong> - An interface that allows application developers to build on top of data or another application.</li>
<li><strong><a title="3-D Printing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3-D Printing</a></strong> -3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing technology where a three dimensional object is created by laying down successive layers of material.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you start thinking of this in terms of local, cottage style manufacturing, I can see lots ofpossibilities.
<p>Imagine, a group of people in a small town, research a need for a component or product. Buy a 3-D Printer, register it with a open API manufacturing network (say based on <a title="Google Cloud Print" href="https://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print</a>). Now they can take orders in real-time over the Internet.
<p>An open source manufacturing network that uses web APIs to receive jobs in real-time and builds products using 3-D printers.

Using <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, Rdio provides a RESTful API where you can do just about anything you can trough the web interface.<p>
Rdio provides a pretty significant incentive for their developers, in the form of revenue sharing.<p>
Developers of the <a title="Rdio API" href="http://developer.rdio.com/">Rdio API</a> can earn recurring revenue each month for every new subscriber recruited through their application.<p>
Also developers can earn revenue each time someone purchases and downloads an MP3 file from the service.<p>
Through the <a title="Rdio Affiliate Program" href="https://cli.linksynergy.com/cli/publisher/registration/registration.php?mid=36727">Rdio Affiliate Program</a> developers can earn from between 2% and 7% for purchases made within a 30-day cookie window.<p>
Having an API affiliate program seems like a logical way to incentivize developers to build applications.<p>
An API owner should have an established monetization strategy for their API, and it should outline how revenue will be generated.<p>
Having a way to track and attribute sales to your API developers makes a lot of sense, and sharing revenue with developers will ensure they will keep building new ways to attract users to a service via the API.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, <a title="Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.
<p>His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: <em>software and networking</em>.
<p>He identifies that software research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.</em>
</blockquote>While networking research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.</em>
</blockquote><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/parthenon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software. He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.
<p>The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.
<p>As Fielding states:
<blockquote>
     <em>REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</em>
</blockquote>As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/api-evangelism-vs-developer-evangelism/">API Evangelist</a>, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.
<p>When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like? Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software? When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?
<p>Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/social-impact-graph.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />One of the reasons I believe <a title="APIs Are Growing so Popular" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">APIs are growing so popular</a> is they are getting easier, and easier to use.<p>
The main reason they are getting easier to use is due to the adoption of RESTful approaches when delivering APIs.<p>
Many APIs that use REST can be easily hacked by just changing values in the URL query string, instantly making APIs accessible by a wider audience<p>
Once users get past the confusing acronyms and jargon us programmers use, and realize whats going on, they can start accessing the data and functionality that's behind the curtain.<p>
RESTful APIs open up data and functionality to anyone, and we are starting to see a new breed of hackers from many disciplines including journalism, social media marketing, and government, to name a few.<p>
As technology becomes increasingly important in our every day lives, people can't wait for IT or programmers to deliver, savvy users start hacking on their own.<p>
A very innovative example of this I saw lately was by Social Media Strategist, <a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.  Tom wrote a great post called, <a title="Using Tools &amp; APIs to Track Your Social Media Strategy" href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-track-your-social-media-strategy">Using Tools &amp; APIs To Track Your Social Media Strategy.</a>
<img src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/users/30546.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
Through a need to understand the impact of his social media efforts, he learned that he can query top social sites using their API to quantify the impact of his site(s).<p>
Then using Google Docs, along with with the power of <a title="Google App Scripts" href="https://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/">Google App Scripts</a> he pulls counts for shares, likes, etc for his site using Social Media APIs.<p>
Using RESTful Social Media APIs, and Google Docs, he is able to hack these APIs, get the data he is looking for, store it in a spreadsheet, and then visualize it.<p>
His efforts truly represent the power of APIs, and how important it is that we deliver simple, RESTful interfaces that developers and non-developers can use in our every day business.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-business.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I have found a voice through my blog, API Evangelism.<p>
I get asked why "API Evangelism" instead of "Developer Evangelism"?<p>
I see a significant difference:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer Evangelists</strong> spread awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer community.</li>
	<li><strong>API Evangelists</strong> spreads awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer and business community.</li>
</ul>
Developer evangelists are generally focused outwards, staying within the developer community and often times are, or have been developers themselves.  They understand the problems their developers face and provide resources, so they are successful using an API.<p>
As an API Evangelist I focus on everything a developer evangelist focuses on, but I also find myself selling the API and its benefits both externally and internally.<p>
If I see a potential use for an API, one that enhances the core business, I will build a prototype and get to work selling the appropriate department(s) on the benefits.<p>
In addition to selling internal business leaders on benefits of a specific API, I spend a lot of time educating external business leaders on the benefits of APIs in general.  Using a specific API (hopefully my own) for building the business case.<p>
We need more developer evangelists, but we also need armies of API evangelists who will teach the business masses of the benefits of APIs, and prepare them for the coming <a title="API Economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.

<a title="Google Apps" href="https://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> is an online email, document, and collaboration platform in the clouds.<p>
<a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="https://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a> provides a directory of custom third party applications in various categories for Google App users to add, to their available services.<p>
Google Apps Marketplace also provides a self-service platform for application developers to build applications and deliver for free, or for pay, via the Marketplace.<p>
Any developer can register for a vendor profile, and:<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Apps-Marketplace.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Create new application listing</li>
	<li>Provide details of application including category, name, and summary</li>
	<li>Set pricing of application</li>
	<li>Provide external links</li>
	<li>Add screenshot or logo</li>
	<li>Provide screencast or how to video</li>
	<li>Add version information</li>
</ul>
All applications must support Single Sign On (SSO) for Google Account integration.<p>
Developers can then build applications in the language and platform of their choice.<p>
Once the application is production ready, the Marketplace requires developers to submit applications for approval, providing quality control for the marketplace.<p>
Google Apps Marketplace provides a self-service application development platform where custom apps built using Google APIs, can be deployed to Google Apps Business, Government, Education and Non-Profit users.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Apps-Marketplace.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />APIs have been influential in ushering in a new era of business development, dubbed <a title="BizDev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">BizDev 2.0</a>.   APIs empower new types of relationship to be built between a business and its partners or openly by public developers.<p>
Self-Service application platforms move this business development forward and introduces a third player into the game, platform partners.<p>
Platforms like <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a>, and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> not only deliver APIs, they provide a <a title="Self-Service Application Development Environment" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environment</a>, a place where third party businesses can access their users, and add value to their platform.<p>
Forward thinking businesses can bring their own APIs, and communities development power to these environments and create applications tailored specifically for Box.net or Google Apps Business, Government, Education and Non-Profit users.
<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/box-net-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
In some cases businesses can even create white label applications that other service providers quickly deploy their own branded applications on Box.net OpenBox, or Google Apps Marketplace.   Adding a potentially new wholesale layer to these API communities.<p>
APIs with a<a title="Self-Service Application Platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Platform</a> introduces new forms of business development where businesses can leverage their own APIs, the APIs of others, even bundle them together to build applications that can reach entirely new audiences via platform partners.

In addition to the <a title="Growth in Number of APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">growth in number of APIs</a>, and the evolution of<a title="BizDev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">BizDev 2.0</a>, there is a rise in self-service application platforms accompanying APIs, within many cloud platforms.<p>
Platforms such as <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a> and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> are adding these self-service application development environments within their API ecosystem.<p>
Each platform has its own approach to this type of self-service architecture, but there are many similar characteristics:<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/self-service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Interface for defining new application characteristics.</li>
	<li><strong>OpenID / OAuth / User Resource Access</strong> - Secure and granular access to users profile and resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Development Environment</strong> - Controlled, secure environment for developers to build applications in.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Branding</strong> - Branding of application and its profile on a platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Approval Process</strong> - Approval process for bringing applications live.</li>
	<li><strong>Marketplace Environment </strong>- Public or private marketplaces for developers to publish applications and platform users to browse / add applications.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Salesforce" href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> is building in-roads into the enterprise using this model, and <a title="Facebook" href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> has found success with social gaming using a similar approach.<p>
APis have opened up new business development opportunities, self-service application platforms takes this development to a new level.

<img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Tag-Cloud-API-PDF.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I'm spending time evaluating different types of APIs in various categories.
<p>I want to see how each provider delivers their API in similar categories, and potentially look for opportunities within those categories for new API services.
<p>I'm starting with PDF APIs.
<p>There are quite a few web APIs providing services to generate and work with PDFs.
<p>The first main group of APIs I notice are HTML to PDF conversion APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocRaptor" href="http://docraptor.com/documentation" target="_blank">DocRaptor</a>
     </li>
     <li>

     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="html2PDF" href="http://webservice.htm2pdf.co.uk/htm2pdf.asm" target="_blank">htm2pdf</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Joliprint" href="http://joliprint.com/api/" target="_blank">Joliprint</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="HTM2PDF" href="http://www.html2pdf.biz/api.php" target="_blank">HTML2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Web2PDF" href="http://www.web2pdfconvert.com/pdf-api.aspx" target="_blank">Web2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF My URL" href="http://pdfmyurl.com/support/support.jsp" target="_blank">PDF My URL</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Crowd" href="https://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf-api/" target="_blank">PDF Crowd</a>
     </li>
</ul>Next there are a couple of other PDF conversion tools:<img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/PDF_red.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Anything to PDF" href="http://api.danielprocter.com/" target="_blank">Anything to PDF</a> - Convert base 64 encoded data to PDF
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Alchemy" href="http://www.pdfalchemy.com/" target="_blank">PDF Alchemy</a> - Word to PDF
     </li>
</ul>Beyond document conversion I found two APIs for commenting and annotating PDFs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Crocodoc" href="http://crocodoc.com/api/" target="_blank">Crocodoc</a> - PDF commenting and collaboration
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Annotate" href="http://a.nnotate.com/api-reference.html" target="_blank">A.nnotate</a> - PDF annotation
     </li>
</ul>Then there was a single provider of PDF document signatures:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocuSign" href="https://www.docusign.com/developers-center/developers-center-overview" target="_blank">DocuSign</a>
     </li>
</ul>There are two clear leaders that provide more advanced PDF document management services:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Doxument" href="http://doxument.com/en/developer" target="_blank">Doxument</a> - HTML to PDF, OCR, Split PDF pages in separate images

     </li>
</ul>With the ubiquitous nature of PDFs, and a wide range of desktop and web based PDF tools, I think there is a huge opportunity for new types of APIs in this area. <img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf-ocr.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> There are dozens of code libraries in various languages for manipulating PDFs. I would suggest some savvy developer:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Identify the most viable business uses for PDF APis
     </li>
     <li>Select the strong set of PDF language libraries
     </li>
     <li>Wrap in a RESTful wrapper
     </li>
     <li>Deploy on Amazon EC2 with PDF storage on Amazon S3
     </li>
</ul>PDF APis is one category of APIs that has huge opportunity for growth in the next couple of years.

When deploying an API, the interface is just the beginning. You need tools and resources to support the API. <img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/building_blocks.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> There are <a title="Common Building Blocks Used by APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks that are used by many existing APIs</a>, such as documentation, forums, code samples and other tools developers have come to expect from APIs.
<p>When selecting which <a title="Building Blocks to Use for an API Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks to use for an API area</a>, there are many things to consider. There are many opinions on which are essential, and this can vary from industry to industry.
<p>One thing everyone agrees is that <a title="Metrics and Analytics for an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">metrics and analytics for an API</a> are a must have.
<p>Beyond the common building blocks, many API owners are providing new innovative tools such as:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Application Showcase" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">Application Showcases</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Ideas" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=138">Idea Directories</a>
     </li>

          <a title="Contests and Hackathons" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=201">Contests and Hackathons</a>
     </li>

          <a title="API Explorers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API Explorers</a>
     </li>
</ul>If you are planning an API and do not have much experience with API technology, or what building blocks you will need, you should talk to experienced API service providers such as <a title="Apigee" href="https://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, or <a title="3Scale" href="https://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>. These providers have a lot of experience, tools and services you can access to plan, develop, deploy, and manage your API.
<p>Even with the growth in the number of available APIs, and the number of service providers I do not see much in the way of open-source API building blocks available on the market yet. <img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> We need more innovation around development of open API building blocks. Think what <a title="Wordpress" href="https://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> has done for blogging, and <a title="Heroku" href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> has done for cloud computing.
<p>The availablility of open API building blocks delivering the common, innovative and essential tools needed for APIs, would give a much needed boost to the entire industry.
<p>There is a lot of learning, exploration and trial and error to occur within the API space. Leaving this to occur within the hands of a few API service provider, or following the lead of major API players like Twitter and Google limits the opportunities for everybody involved.
<p>I would like to see more discussion and collaboration around building a community of open source API build blocks this year.

All of us programmers have a preferred programming language. It is the language that we identify with and prefer to build projects in.
<p>When it comes to delivering an API area, one of the most important <a title="building blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks</a> for getting programmers up and running are <a title="code language libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">language libraries</a>.

<p>As soon as I click on "Developers" off the main menu, I get all the top languages front and center.
<p>I can immediately click on my language of choice, fork or download the repository from <a title="Github" href="https://github.com">Github</a> and get to work.

<img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-social-coding-words.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.
<p>The site also provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and a network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.
<p>Github provides two main tools that can be used in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Github Repositories" href="https://help.github.com/create-a-repo/">Github Repositories</a></strong> - Git code repositories for various supporting areas of an API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Gists" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong> - Gist are a simple way to share snippets of code
     </li>
</ul>There are several ways to use Github repositories and Gists in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation</strong> - Display example calls, requests, and responses using Gists
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Samples</strong> - Display code samples using Gists, and package up entire sets of code samples using Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Package up official and community generated API code libraries as Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Prototypes</strong> - Publish API prototypes as Github repositories
     </li>
</ul><img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-round.png" alt="" width="160" align="right" /> Github provides a way for API owners to manage a large number of code samples, libraries and prototypes, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community.
<p>The social spects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github.
<p>Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.

<img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/php.gif" alt="" width="125" align="right" />An important tone of my blog is not to ever say any API owner should, or developers have to do anything. My role as API evangelist is to observe, discuss and explore the business of APIs.
<p>I was discussing best practices around API ecosystems with a prominent developer the other night an a O'Reilly Web 2.0 event. He had an interesting perspective on how to build community around an API. <img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/ruby-logo.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> Building your API community can start with your code libraries.
<p>His recommendation was that API owners should focus on building a simple and standardized API that provides true value, and do not build your own API code libraries.
<p>Let your community build, and contribute code libraries in their preferred programming language.
<p>His argument was that if an API owner releases an official set of libraries, the innovation stops there. Nobody will build any further code libraries and possibly improve on them. <img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/python.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> By allowing the community to build API libraries it gives you a chance to put the spotlight on developers, increases the chance for competition, spurs innovation and developers will rise to the occasion.
<p>In some cases an API owner may even contract with a developer to build the API code libraries, but do not endorse them as official. This way developers see opportunity to build upon them and improve them, if they feel so inclined.
<p>I found this a very innovative approach to empowering your developer community, encouraging innovation, and building community within your API ecosystem.

NPR announced their new <a title="NPR News Application for Android 2.0" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/04/01/134951191/android-2-0-rebuilt-redesigned?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">NPR News application for Android 2.0</a> today.

Normally I wouldn't cover just any new app or feature release, but there is more of a story here than just a new mobile app.  I am interested in the way they went about designing it.<p>
Last summer they submitted designs for the new Android application to the <a title="NPR open source community" href="https://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">open source community</a> to discuss how to best move forward with designing the mobile app.<p>
They gathered feedback from users and built in what the community said was most important, such as new player, universal navigation, as well as adding programs with live streams and the ability to favorite stations.<p>
They are working to <a title="publishing the source code back to the community repository" href="https://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">publishing the source code back to the community repository</a>, keeping the project open source.<p>
Of course this is NPR, a public entity, but their approach to mobile application design using their API is  a model that can be used by other API providers.

<a href="http://www.granatapet.de/">GranataPet</a>, a German dog food manufacturer, created a <a href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/03/31/api-highlight-a-special-for-our-four-legged-friends/">billboard that dispenses a treat for your dog when you check in to it using Foursquare</a>.<p>
Think about the possibilities when you have signs, billboards, and other types of display that either respond or dispense something when you interact via your mobile phone and an API.<p>
Opens up a whole lot of possibilities when you have devices that monitor APIs for specific triggers, respond accordingly, and then developers build software on top of those APIs.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/intents-summary.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Since the <a title="Twitter OAuth Apocalypse" href="https://twitter.com/#!/SNFLabs/status/16426051477">Twitter OAuth Apocalypse</a> integrating tweets into a web page requires writing an OAuth application for even the simplest of Twitter integrations, like replying, retweeting and favoriting.
<p>Twitter just released a new <a title="Simpler API Called Web Intents" href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents">simpler API called Web Intents</a> that makes Tweets more interactive when you display on the web.
<p>The Twitter Web Intents API provides a JavaScript interface for adding Reply, Retweet, and Favorite links to a specific Tweet:
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/896788.js?file=Twitter%20Web%20Intent%20API" type="text/javascript">

<p>You can access <a title="Detailed Documentation" href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents">detailed documentation</a>, <a title="Display Guidelines" href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/display_guidelines">display guidelines</a>, and <a title="Standard Icons" href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/image-resources">standard Reply, Retweet and Favorite icons</a> at the Twitter web site.
<p>Twitter Web Intents API is an example of a growing trend of simpler tools that make APIs accessible beyond the developer community.
<p>REST has simplified APIs making them hackable by journalists, data scientists, and any other tech savvy users that may not be able to program but can understand manipulating a URL query string to get the data they are looking for.
<p>More API providers are considering development of simpler APIs, snippets, widgets, and embeddable code that expand their API ecosystem to a wider audience.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google-analytics.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I document a lot of the <a title="Common Building Blocks Used By API Providers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks used by API providers</a>. These are common tools used across many industries and types of APIs to build their ecosystem.
<p>I hesitate to ever say any of these common building blocks are essential, because every API potentially has different requirements.
<p>However, one building block that is essential for <span class="c1">every</span> API, is metrics and analytics.
<p>API owners should me measuring every aspect of their API and its community, and be constantly reassessing their strategy based upon what is going on in real-time.
<p>API analytics is what service providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="https://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> and <a href="https://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> bring to the table. Mashery and Apigee proxy your API to deliver analytics, while 3Scale provides a plug to gather data for reporting on.
<p>All three of these providers charge you per transaction for this service. <img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Google-Analytics-Charts-Stack.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> To my knowledge there is no provider of an API analytics tool that is free, and plug and play.
<p>With the current explosion of APIs being deployed, there is a huge opportunity for someone to provide a free API analytics service that gathers and measures API usage.
<p>Think Google Analytics for APIs. A single line of server side code, with a variety of language kits, that will measure all requests on an API, its community, and provide a rich set of reports for API owners.
<p>This could probably be done with the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="https://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/home.html">Google Analytics API</a>, I will have to play with more.

title: 'A Sensible Approach to the Twitter API Ecosystem'

---

<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I just finished reading two more posts on the recent changes to the <a title="Twitter API Terms of Service" href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">Twitter API terms of service</a>.  There are a lot of opinions on whether Twitter was right or wrong in their approach to reign in their developer community.<p>
I understand Twitter wanting to take back some control over its ecosystem and monetize its world.<p>
I do not understand why people are demonizing Open APIs or the developer community.  Both made Twitter what it is today.<p>
I wanted to put some thoughts down on how I'd engineer a more sensible approach to the Twitter API ecosystem.<p>
<strong>Brand Control:</strong> Twitter needs to keep expanding its <a title="branding resource area" href="https://twitter.com/about/resources/logos">branding resource area</a> where users can come to get CSS, HTML, images, widgets, borders and many other higher quality assets that can be used by the community and maintain a quality level of brand control for Twitter.<p>
API access and usage.  Let's create some free and paid access levels:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer</strong> - A free low volume access level that allows developers to play with the API, but only allows a minimum number of API calls per day.</li>
	<li><strong>Professional</strong> - A slightly higher level of access meant for API consumer that may be building an application, but probably used just for professional purposes.</li>
	<li><strong>Business</strong> - API access for businesses that use Twitter for their own brand, and require a higher level of API requests, but are willing to pay for it.</li>
	<li><strong>Commercial</strong> - A pay-for-what-you-use model, in true cloud computing fashion, with the possibility of volume discounts.</li>
	<li><strong>Academic</strong> - A free research-based access account for scholars to use in their academic projects.</li>
</ul>
With clearly defined Twitter API access levels, Twitter can start making money and controlling usage of their API.<p>
<strong>Ad Network</strong>:  The next approach to monetization and control over the Twitter ecoystem could be a Twitter advertising network modeled after Google Adsense and Adwords.<p>
Let's call it the Dickbar Advertising Network.  Require all client and web interfaces to have some sort of advertising network deployment.  You could have Dickbars, Dickboxes, and Dickheaders in all shapes and sizes for developers to deploy.<p>
Twitter can still advertise, make money, and control their network.  Developers could make money too.  There would be added incentive for developers to build quality applications, and be able to be sustain their work through advertising revenue.<p>
With a sensible terms of service, branding guidelines, tiered API access levels, and an advertising network, Twitter could retain control over its network, protect its brand, monetize and ensure a higher quality user experience.<p>
This could all be done while still respecting and harnessing the passionate developer community of the Twitter ecosystem that made Twitter what it is today.

<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/apigee-api-console.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I am seeing more API owners and service providers launching REST API explorers lately:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a></li>
	<li><a title="Salesforce" href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003IjwLEAS">Salesforce</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google API Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google</a></li>
	<li><a title="Windows Live" href="http://rex.mslivelabs.com/">Windows Live</a></li>
	<li><a title="Infochimps Data Explorer" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">Infochimps</a></li>
</ul>
These REST API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a web interface.<p>
<a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a> even allows you to Authenticate with APIs using Basic Auth or OAuth.<p>
The simplicity of REST has contributed to the extreme growth in the number of Web APIs in the last year, and API explorers are going to fuel this growth in 2011 and beyond.<p>
API explorers put the power of Web APIs in the hands of non-developers, allowing journalists, students, politicians, and any tech savvy Internet user to access the data and functionality available via APIs.<p>
Once a couple of these providers adds an export JSON to Google Docs or download to Excel, its a whole new ballgame.<p>
With an API explorer any user will be able to pull data from one or many APIs, export to a Google Spreadsheet and build visualizations to extract their own meaning from the data they've gathered via any REST API.

<p>Some new API calls they've built are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Qwerly" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/qwerly-profile-search">Qwerly</a> -</strong> You know when you Google someone's name and through some SEO magic, you can find all of that person's social media profiles? Imagine being able to easily integrate these presences into your applications. Query a person's Twitter handle and the Qwerly API call will return any of his or her social media presences (Facebook, Friendfeed, Flickr, etc) that it can find.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter People Search" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/twpeoplesearch">Twitter People Search</a> -</strong> Let's face it. Finding new cool people on Twitter can be a bit taxing. Query any word using Twitter People Search and find any user who uses that word in their bio. Looking for other data lovers? Check. Looking for people who like the Green Bay Packers? Check. Looking for Bieber lovers on Twitter? You'll have no problem there. ;-)
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="British National Corpus" rel="wikipedia" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-frequencies-from-the-british-national-corpus">British National Corpus</a> -</strong> Word lists are very popular on our site and we couldn't pass this one up. This API call allows you to access the British National Corpus, a 100-million-word text corpus of samples of written and spoken English from a wide range of sources. The corpus covers British English the late twentieth century from a wide variety of genres with the intention that it be a representative sample of spoken and written British English of that time.
     </li>
</ul>Infochimps is not just liberating data via APIs, they are making it more accessible through their API explorer and data marketplace.
<p>You can search for data that is free or paid, available for download or through their API, alphabetically, or by upload date.

<img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />As such, there has been much discussion recently about Open APIs and whether or not third party developers are wise or foolish to build their businesses on someone else's platform. The concern stems from a number of reasons, least of which being Twitter's pronouncements about the <a title="&quot;Rules of the Road&quot; for Its Ecosystem" href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">"rules of the road" for its ecosystem</a>, and now <a title="Lendles announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API" href="http://lendle.me/">Lendle's announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API</a>.
<p>The reactions to both Twitter and Amazon have been pretty strong. And while I do think Twitter is making some serious mistakes with its approach to its API and developer ecosystem, we might be making some mistakes of our own if we lump the Lendle/Amazon issue in to concerns about Twitter. Is Amazon shutting down apps that are poaching on its ecosystem? That's not clear.
<p>As it stands, everyone seems to be stirring the pot and feeding the hysteria around the perils of using Open APIs, or rather, the dangers of relying on them for your businesses..
<p>But it seems to me that there is much more going on here. While APIs may be the focus -- the way in which apps and websites are connecting to a larger platform -- we're also looking at larger conflicts with new business models, whether those are publishing and DRM in the case of Amazon and Lendle or whether those conflicts are around a startup still struggling to monetize its core business. <img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> This isn't to say that there aren't precautions that people should take when building on an Open API. But when I hear some of the FUD lately, much of this echoes what we were hearing (and still hear, I suppose) about cloud computing.
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your server or storage could disappear at any moment, because its virtualized!</strong> Sure, as would any server or storage, that's why I have plan A and B, and in the clouds I have C &amp; D as well. I plan for failure no matter where my infrastructure is located.</em>

<p class="c2">
     <strong><em><strong>Your data is not secure in the clouds!</strong></em></strong> <em>Security is a concern everywhere, make sure and have thorough security plan that is revisited regularly.</em>

<p>The naysayers are now making their arguments about APIs
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your API access could be shut off at any time!</strong> I don't think this is any secret about APIs. This is why there are terms of service that you must read and follow. Your application needs to take this into consideration with ALL the APIs it uses -- whether they're from developer-friendly companies or not, and then operate accordingly.</em>

<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>An API owner could decide to poach business from its community at any time!</strong> Again I don't think its a secret. APIs are a form of R&amp;D for companies, this is open territory for everyone to innovate. In perfect world an API owner communicates openly with developers and partners about opportunities in the ecosystem, plans to monetize, and where partner opportunities exist.</em> I'm not saying these dangers aren't real. They are. What I'm saying is that none of this should come as a shock. You build and plan around these potential issues just as you would with any other technologies you invest in. What if Google Apps goes down? What if your supplier goes out of business? What if FedEx doesn't arrive on time?

<p>Open APIs aren't really the problem here. <img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/lendle-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /> If a company is built entirely around a single API ecosystem, maybe the owners should consider diversification into other areas, expanding their business. The fault is with the business strategy; it's not the fault of the API.
<p>If an API ecosystem grows large enough where business opportunities develop that are ripe for picking by companies or poaching by the APIs owners, then the responsibility is on the API owner to establish a partner strategy that considers and includes ecosystem developers. It's not the fault of the API.
<p>Technology is transforming a lot of industries right now. Open APIs are at the heart of this. <em>This is a good thing</em>.
<p>Open APIs drive developer and business innovation, and as this occurs there are going to challenges with monetization, business strategies, licensing, ownership, security, and privacy.
<p>Let's not blame the API or scare people off from using APIs by freaking out about the dangers. Let's identify the pitfalls, understand their value and establish healthy ways to integrate with APIs, to build healthy business and vibrant ecosystems around them.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/terms-legal.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I wanted to establish a base <a title="Terms of Service" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=150">Terms of Service</a> for my API area.
<p>So I went and read the API terms of service from 15 top APIs
<p>I found the opening paragraph says a lot about how a company approaches their API.
<p>Here are the opening paragraphs for the top 15 API terms of service I came across:
<p><strong><a title="Twitter Terms of Service" href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">Twitter</a></strong> Twitter maintains an open platform that supports the millions of people around the world who are sharing and discovering what's happening now. We want to empower our ecosystem partners to build valuable businesses around the information flowing through Twitter. At the same time, we aim to strike a balance between encouraging interesting development and protecting both Twitter's and users' rights.
<p>So, we've come up with a set of Developer Rules of the Road ("Rules") that describe the policies and philosophy around what type of innovation is permitted with the content and information shared on Twitter.

<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/idea-management.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />Silicon Valley is full of ideas.<p>
APIs provide the data and functionality that many of these ideas are built on.<p>
If you have an API, hopefully you have lots of ideas on what developers can do with it -- ideas that you can share with your API community in order to inspire them to create.<p>
Many innovative APIs are building tools for managing ideas within their communities.<p>
Google uses <a title="Google Moderator" href="https://www.google.com/moderator/#0">Google Moderator</a> for <a title="idea management in Google Apps Marketplace" href="https://productideas.appspot.com/#15/e=17fe36&amp;t=181990&amp;f=25f853">idea management in their Google Apps Marketplace</a>.<p>
Moderator is a a web application used for managing comment submission around topics, and enables users to submit ideas and vote up other ideas in the system.
<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-moderator.png" alt="" align="right" />
Moderator also has an API for deeper integration into other applications of these topics, submissions, and votes.<p>
<a title="Google Moderator" href="https://www.google.com/moderator/#0">Google Moderator</a> can be a low cost way for deploying an API idea management system and in turn help cultivate innovation within an API community.

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/npr-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Twitter has been working hard lately to <a title="define the rules of the road for the Twitter API" href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">define the rules of the road for the Twitter API</a> ecosystem.<p>
When it comes to monetizing content and media, there are many differing opinions and by extension there are many approaches to managing an API ecosystem.<p>
NPR's approach is innovative, <a title="making incremental changes in technology and business rules" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/03/17/134259537/the-npr-api-an-engine-rebuild?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">making incremental changes in technology and business rules</a>.<p>
<a title="National Public Radio" href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> is improving its API technology to be easier to use, run faster, and deliver all types of content better.<p>
NPR is also innovating around digital rights management, to support their <a title="Ingest System" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2010/04/22/126205655/building-the-ingest-system">Ingest System</a> which allows partners to publish content into the NPR system.<p>
Managing digital rights and content has its own challenges, but you throw in APIs -- the ability for partners to publish and developers to access this content -- it can't be easy.<p>
It's good to see NPR openly talking about the challenges they face, and their ideas on how they are going to keep improving the <a title="NPR API" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR API</a> ecosystem.

SSL will improve API security by encrypting all data communications between 3rd party applications and Google, protecting data from interception by a malicious third party.<p>
Google Web Search, Google Maps, Gmail and Google docs all currently support SSL for API access.<p>
They are working to introduce SSL support in other APis as well as update existing client libraries and code samples to support SSL.<p>
Beginning September 15, 2011, Google will require that all users of Google Documents List API, Google Spreadsheets API, and Google Sites API use SSL connections for all API requests.<p>
SSL will further legitimize the integration of Google APIs into third party applications.<p>
As applications become more distributed, SSL will become a must have layer to all APIs.

Even though the <a title="OAuth 2.0 Specification" href="http://wiki.oauth.net/w/page/25236487/OAuth-2">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> isn't 100% finalized, Google has overhauled all of their APIs in Google Code to support it.<p>
OAuth 2.0 is much easier for developers to implement, and simplifies OAuth consent for application users.<p>
Google's support for OAuth 2.0 is a big boost for developers integrating with their API, as well as big vote of support for the future of OAuth 2.0 as the standard for API authentication.<p>

This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>&nbsp;provides a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.
<p>Amazon S3 or Simple Storage Service was initially just an API. There was no Web interface or mobile app. It was just a RESTful API allowing PUT and GET requests with objects or files.
<p>Developers using the Amazon S3 API were charged $0.15 a gigabyte per month for storing files in the cloud.
<p>With this new type of API and billing model, Amazon ushered in a new type of computing we now know as cloud computing.
<p>This also meant that APIs were no longer just for data or simple functionality. Now they could be used to deliver computing infrastructure.

<p>Less than three months later, it had one million users.

<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application.
<p>In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and built his own&nbsp;<a title="Unofficial Instagram API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/">unofficial Instagram API.</a>
<p>By January&nbsp;<a title="Instagram shut down the rogue API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/">Instagram shut down the rogue API</a>&nbsp;and announced it was building one of its own.
<p>Then in February of 2011,&nbsp;<a title="Instagram released the official API" href="https://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api">Instagram released the official API</a>&nbsp;for the photo platform.
<p>Within days many&nbsp;<a title="Instagram Photo Applications" href="http://instagre.at/#/by/knorrstein/35938336">photo applications</a>, photo -sharing sites, and mashups built around the API started showing up.
<p>Instagram became a viral iPhone app sensation, but quickly needed an API to realize its full potential.

<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/brand-kitchen.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I have been thinking about<a title="Adam Kleinberg" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkleinberg">Adam Kleinbergs</a> recent posts,<a title="Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers" href="https://mashable.com/2011/01/04/brand-open-api-developers/">Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers</a> and<a title="Digging Deeper on Brand APIs" href="http://www.tractionco.com/blog/63-digging-deeper-on-brand-apis">Digging deeper on Brand APIs</a>.<p>
He's right.  The pace of <a title="API Development Skyrocketed in 2010" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/03/08/3000-web-apis/">API development skyrocketed in 2010</a>, and will continue in 2011.<p>
Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.<p>
When companies consider an API for their brand, they should start with the basics
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Product Information" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-apis-starter-product-data/"><strong>Product Informatio</strong>n</a> - Core information about your products.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Supporting Product Information" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-api-starter-supporting-product-data/">Supporting Product Information</a></strong> - Additional supporting information about your products like documents, videos, reviews, etc.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Location and Geo" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-apis-starter-location-geo/">Location and Geo</a></strong> - Location of where to get your products.</li>
</ul>
With proper API terms and conditions, brand guidelines, and requiring all developers to register a company can monitor and protect the quality of their brand.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/start.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
By starting small, companies can get familiar with having an API and supporting the community that goes with it.<p>
I recommend engaging with an API service provider like <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>, <a href="https://apigee.com/">Apigee</a> or <a href="https://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> when planning an API.<p>
If you have your own in-house developers and want to keep development internally I recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a>.<p>
Brands have to start somewhere.  By starting with an API that serves up your core product data, you can take control of what information is available for your brand, while also learning more about building an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Community</a>.<p>
Once you have a simple <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> API that provides product and location information, an API support area, and an awareness of what your developer community wants;  you can then start innovating more around your brand API.

With a functioning API and API area, a company can think about whats next?  More product data of course!<p>
There has to be more information about your products that you can make available?  Product documents, videos, reviews, testimonials, case studies and other news or information. What information do you provide on your web site?<p>
Provide any supporting product data you think might provide benefit to developers and their application users.<p>
The more information about your products you can provide, the more resources potential partners and developers will have to build rich web and mobile applications.

Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.<p>
Where does a company start?   Start with what you know.  Your products.<p>
Make your product data available via a <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> API.  Provide the basics:  Names, Descriptions, and Images.<p>
Allow developers to sign up, and register for a key.<p>
Provide simple documentation describing how to make calls against your API,  sample code in PHP, Ruby, and Python.<p>
Setup an <a title="FAQ" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=132">FAQ page</a>, <a title="Blog" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=123">blog</a>, <a title="Forum" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=131">forum</a>, and support contact form.<p>

Whats a good next move?   Location and Geographic Data.  Where can your products be found?  Retail and Wholesale.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/SimpleGeo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
Provide quality, up to date information about who sells your products.   Provide as much detail as you can, names, addresses, specific products and even geographic coordinates.<p>
There are plenty of <a title="Geo and Mapping API" href="http://simplegeo.com/">geo and mapping API</a> resources to provide additional data that enriches your retail and wholesale store information.<p>
Providing rich, real-time location data about products, retails, wholesalers, and partners through an API will enable web and mobile developers to build applications around your company and its products.

The <a title="Programmable Web API Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb API directory </a>has seen some amazing growth:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>1,000 APIs: over 3 years</li>
	<li>2,000 APIs: less than 2 years</li>
	<li>3,000 APIs: about 9 months</li>
</ul>
Three other noteworthy trends, the ProgrammableWeb team notices:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>API as a Company</strong> - More companies launching just as API.</li>
	<li><strong>REST and JSON</strong> - Simplification of APIs through REST and JSON.</li>
	<li><strong>Internal Usage</strong> - More companies consuming their own APIs.</li>
</ul>
Some might say the recent explosive growth is part of a "bubble", but if you look at the numbers its been a long 11 year road since <a title="Saleforce Launches API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce first launch their API in February of 2000</a>.<p>

The API Explorer interface provides public or private access to APIs, with the private access handling the necessary <a class="zem_slink" title="OAuth" rel="homepage" href="https://oauth.net">OAuth</a> authentication.<p>
By selecting an API you wish to explore, you can see all the available methods and parameters along with documentation. Just fill out the parameters for the method you want to try and click execute.  The Google Explorer composes the request, executes it, and displays the response.<p>
Google provides some real-life examples anyone can execute:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Expand a goog.gl URL" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/#_s=urlshortener&amp;_v=v1&amp;_m=url.get&amp;shortUrl=http://goo.gl/jN3IJ">Expand a goo.gl URL</a> using the URL Shortener API</li>

	<li><a title="List Personal Buzz Posts" href="List your personal Buzz posts">List your personal Buzz posts</a> using the Buzz API (requires private access)</li>
</ul>
The Google Explorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.<p>
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.

<p>Guided by a computer-aided design program, a laser fuses together several layers of finely powdered metal, nylon or plastic.
<p>The laser melts the powder, which solidifies according to a chosen pattern. Then more powder is added, melting and solidifying to add layer upon layer until the object is fully formed.
<p>Its just a prototype of whats possible with current <a title="3D Printing and Manufacturing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3D printing and manufacturing technology</a>.

<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://apigee.com/about/img/create_console_screen.png" alt="" align="right" />Apigee has <a title="API Console Release" href="http://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_to_go/">released its API Console as a free</a>, publicly available tool for use by any API provder.<p>
The <a title="API Console" href="https://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API Console</a> allows developers to view an API, authenticate with the API and begin making requests and seeing responses from an API.<p>
The new publicly available API console lets API owners create their own API console, skin it to match brand, and embed within any API area.<p>
The API console assists developers with authentication by handling <a class="zem_slink" title="OAuth" rel="homepage" href="https://oauth.net">OAuth</a> 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 access to APIs.<p>
Once authenticated, developers can begin exploring an API and making calls.  It allows developers to begin using an API and understanding how it works without any programming.<p>
This type of exploration is critical for API adoption.   If users can play with all aspects of an API, understand how it works, they can begin visualizing how they will integrate with the API.<p>
Apigee's API Console is a must-have building block for any API service provider.

I have spent time reviewing <a title="100+ Most Popular APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">100+ of the most popular APIs</a>.   I am trying to determine a common set of building blocks that are essential to API adoption.<p>
Here is a list of what I consider are the most common <a title="Building Blocks for API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks for API</a> areas:
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building blocks.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Overview</li>
	<li>Getting Started</li>
	<li>API Reference / Documentation</li>
	<li>Code Samples</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
	<li>Forum</li>
	<li>FAQ</li>
	<li>Pricing</li>
	<li>Terms and Conditions</li>
</ul>
The most successful APIs also provide self-service developer tools:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Registration</li>
	<li>Application Registration</li>
</ul>
API pioneers like <a title="Ebay" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">Ebay</a>, <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, <a title="Flickr" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>, and Google have established a common set of essential API building blocks through trial and error over the last decade.<p>
Other API providers can learn from this <a title="API History" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/10/history-of-apis-birth-through-social/">API history</a> and experience, and make sure they start with the essential API building blocks for sucess.

<img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/ClearCode-API-Design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In the last 20 years we've seen the how the Internet has altered the role of the developer from a desktop software developer to a<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">web application</a> developer.<p>
It started with web sites, the need for talented graphic designers who could also assemble some HTML to deliver static web sites.<p>
With languages like <a class="zem_slink" title="VBScript" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript">VBScript</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/javascript/">JavaScript</a>, and Coldfusion, websites began evolving into Web applications, requiring developers to master more dynamic Web programming lanugages.<p>
Then smart phones began making the Internet <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> and pushing developers to start programming for platforms like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/">IPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/android/">Android</a>.<p>
The next phase:<strong><em> the API developer</em></strong>.<p>
Companies like <a title="Clearcode API Design" href="http://clearcode.cc/offer/api/">Clearcode in the UK</a> are beginning to offer <a title="API Design and Development" href="http://clearcode.cc/offer/api/">API design and development</a> services in order to meet the increasing demand for well-designed <a class="zem_slink" title="Representational State Transfer" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a> Web APIs.<p>

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/gears-code-samples.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />API code samples and software development kits (SDK) are among the most important tools for getting developers up and running with any API.<p>
Providing complete sets of code samples for every area of an API and in as many programming languages as you can is important to a developer's (and an API's) success.  With complete sets of code samples in a wide variety of programming languages an API has a greater chance of success in getting adoption amongst the wider developer community.<p>
Using existing freelance developer communities for developing API SDK and code samples is a great way to build your code libraries with minimum use of internal resources.  And in turn, by using Elance developers to build code samples, you've made another move towards establishing a pool of high quality, dependable developers that have experience with an API.

Every API owner wants to ensure she or he has high quality, professional developers to refer to partners when building applications that use their API.  It can take years to cultivate an organic community of high quality developers for an API area.<p>
Freelance developer communities like Elance have existing developers and provide existing tools for:
<ul class="mainlist"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />&nbsp;
	<li><strong>Defining Skills -</strong> Establishing common development skillsets that are needed for API integration.</li>
	<li><strong>Skills Acreditation -</strong> Self assessment, skills testing, and acreditation around a specific API.</li>
	<li><strong>Rating System - </strong>Establishing a rating system for developers to set levels of expected quality around API development.</li>
	<li><strong>Job History - </strong>Show job history for API developer, establishing a professional history of API developoment.</li>
	<li><strong>Feedback System - </strong>Provide a feedback systems for API partners and other businesses to comment on developers API integration work.</li>
</ul>
As an API owner how you spend your time and resources is critical.  Time can be better spent in other areas, rather than building out developer profile systems and other developer tools.<p>
Companies like Elance have the existing communities of developers as well as tools for identifying the quality, professional and dependable API developer, and companies should leverage the power of these existing communities whenever possible.

One way to make sure your API has qualified and reputable developers from day one is to tap into an existing freelance developer community.<p>
Popular freelance sites like Elance provide existing communities of developers with the skills an API owner or partner is looking for.<p>
Elance provides access to their developer communities via a RESTful API.<p>
Using the Elance API, I have built a plug and play API developer community.<p>
My API Evangelist, <a title="Elance API Developer Community" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">API Developer Community </a>prototype provides an example of what is possible when tapping into existing developer communities to satisfy the development needs of a new API community.<p>
My API developer community provides the following tools:<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-api-developer-area-screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">

<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-tag-cloud.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />One of the goals of any API is to catch the attention of developers and become a tool they depend on and integrate regularly into their applications.<p>
If you build an API and release it into the wild -- even if it's high quality -- there are no guarantees the developers will immediately come.<p>
Even the big players like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> have to build awareness and resources around their APIs before they can hit a critical mass of developers and be on the road to success.<p>
Developer presence and activity is critical in attracting new developers and partners to an API.<p>
Partners want to see that there are qualified, highly skilled and reputable developers available who can work on a particular API before they'll consider integrating that API into their own systems.<p>
For their part, developers want to see there are others to learn from and others who are actively using an API before they'll commit to integrating their software with an API.<p>
So, how will you attract developers to your API?

Integrating with APIs requires a wide variety of skills.  Depending on the technology an API uses, integration may require knowledge of OAuth, REST, SOAP, XML, JSON, and mobile platforms.<p>
Each API has its own unique requirements for mastering it and efficiently integrating it with other systems.
<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/test-taking.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
Any company wants the best developers to work on their projects, but how do you verify that developers are reliable and truly understand an API and its intricacies?<p>
To ensure a developer understands an API, the API should establish a certification process for all developers to participate in.   Many enterprise organizations are looking for ways to have developers certified.<p>
<a title="Elance" href="https://www.elance.com">Elance</a> provides services for building <a title="Skills Tests" href="https://www.elance.com/p/skilltests/all.html">skills test and accreditation programs</a> around API communities.  <a title="Elance API" href="https://www.elance.com/p/api">Elance API</a> skills assessments can prove that a developer truly posseses the skills necessary to integrate with a specific API.<p>
API owners can build a custom set of questions that walks developers through any aspect of an API thatl are critical for integration
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
Developers can then take the self-assessment skills test to certify their knowledge and understanding of an API.<p>
API owners, partners and other businesses can use API developer certification to make decisions around which developers they will use on their projects.<p>
API developer accreditation will continue to grow in importance as APIs continue to become a ubiquitous presence in business.

Taking an API from area to community takes a lot of work.   It just doesn't happen overnight.  It takes a perfect balance of technology, developers, partners, resources and hard work.
<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ecosystem.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
APIs are a big part of the future of a distributed workforce, and developer communities like <a title="Elance" href="https://www.elance.com">Elance</a> are building the workforce to support the APIs.  You can leverage the Elance platform to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Providing High Quality, Professional Developers</li>
	<li>Develop API SDK and Code Samples</li>
	<li>Develop API skills test and accreditation</li>
</ul>
I have developed this prototype <a title="API developer area" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/">API developer area</a>, driven by the Elance community to show what is possible using the <a title="Elance API" href="https://www.elance.com/p/api">Elance API.</a><p>
Using the power of the existing API developer community at <a title="Elance" href="https://www.elance.com">Elance</a> you can quickly take your API beyond community and build a living <a title="API Ecosystem" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php">API ecosystem</a>.

<a href="http://www.superfeedr.com/" target="_blank">Superfeedr</a> is now supporting <a href=" http://disqus.com/forums/superfeedr-thoughts/superfeedr_pubsubhubbub_for_apis/trackback/" target="_blank">PubSubHubbub for data APIs</a>.  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a> was initially created for <a class="zem_slink" title="XML" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> to alleviate the number of times a feed is polled versus how many times it actually has an update.
<a href="http://www.superfeedr.com/" target="_blank">
<img style="paddng: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Superfeedr.png" alt="" align="right" /></a> The bandwidth consumption and server load of an API can be reduced greatly by adding a PubSubHubbub layer on a data API.<p>
Primary areas of a Superfeedr PubSubHubbub deployment are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Resource Identification </strong>- Identify what services your developers / applications are polling the most.  Identify how many requests are made against how many times information was returned.</li>
	<li><strong>Push Discovery -</strong> Indication to any applications polling your API that the content being polled is available in a push fashion by adding an HTTP header to the API responses which mentions the Superfeedr hub.</li>
	<li><strong>Secure Subscriptions - </strong>Define a subscription callback URL where Superfeedr will echo all subscriptions to the API content, including the <a class="zem_slink" title="List of HTTP header fields" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">HTTP headers</a> and any additional parameter provided by the subscriber.</li>
	<li><strong>Notifications -</strong> Superfeedr needs to know when content is updated so they can notify users.  This is done in two ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Fat pings -</strong> An API owner can push content to Superfeeder and they will parse the content and push it forward to subscribers.</li>
	<li><strong>Light pings -</strong> Provide URL that has been updated and Superfeedr will update poll and update users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Superfeedr PubSubHubbub is providing a layer to existing data APIs that will alleviate bandwidth and server load.<p>
We are seeing similar layers being built for functional APIs such as the XMPP print jobs notification for the <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html" target="_blank">Google Cloud Print (GCP) Services Interface</a>.

When OAuth is implemented for an API, it provides benefits for potentially three types of users involved:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>API Owners - </strong>Allows web application and API owners publish <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/data-20/">data</a> in a standardized and protected way.</li>
	<li><strong>Web Application Users - </strong>Allow users of web applications to open access to their data and resources in a secure way.</li>
	<li><strong>Developers </strong>- Provides developers with a standard method for building applications that integrate with APIs.</li>
</ol>
Virtually any application resource can be shared via an API, including photos, product, location or user information.   OAuth can issue access tokens for each individual resource area.  OAuth tokens can be unique per developer and for each API service they access, and provide granular security for all API services areas.<p>
<a href="https://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> is the current implementation and is not backward compatible with OAuth 1.0.   OAuth is widely considered the industry standard for API Authentication.

image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/basic-auth.png
---

<img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/basic-auth.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Basic Auth is a way for a web browser or application to provide credentials in the form of a username and password.<p>
Because Basic Auth is integrated into <a class="zem_slink" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP protocol</a> it is the easiest way for users to authenticate with a <a class="zem_slink" title="Representational State Transfer" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful API</a>.<p>
Basic Auth is easily integrated, however if <a class="zem_slink" title="Transport Layer Security" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL</a> is not used, the username and password are passed in plain text and can be easily intercepted on the open Internet.<p>
OAuth is a much better choice for RESTful API authentication, but Basic Auth is perfectly suited for APIs that are intended for a wider audience and do not give access to sensitive information.

<a href="https://www.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom</a> is a Software as a Service(SaaS) that provides <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">website monitoring and up-time reporting</a>.<p>
Recently they started <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/02/08/new-public-report-from-pingdom-enters-beta/" target="_blank">offering public report pages</a>.  These reports or status pages allows you to make some or all of your monitoring results public, promoting transparency with your users.<p>
These status pages can easily be converted to deliver an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> status page for your developer community.  Pingdom provides HTTP and Custom HTTP monitoring that gives you enough tools to monitor a RESTful API and provide reporting.<p>
<a href="https://www.pingdom.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pingdom-api-dashboard.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></a><p>
Since the public reports are hosted at Pingdom, they will be available even when your own website is down.<p>
In addition to a basic up and down status dashboard, Pingdom also provides visual charts and graphs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Uptime and response time charts.</li>
	<li>Response time global map.</li>

As mobile phone adoption and usage continues to grow we are seeing a parallel growth in APIs to support the mobile browsing market.<p>
Many API providers are seeing the majority of calls coming from mobile phones vs. web or desktop clients.<p>
Another unnoticed area of mobile API growth is from mobile carriers themselves.  Verizon, Sprint, and AT&amp;T all provide developer APIs.<p>
<a href="http://developer.verizon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/verizon-wireless.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>The <a href="http://developer.verizon.com/" target="_blank">Verizon Developer Community</a> provides documentation, tools, support, resources and two API services:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Location API</strong> - Allows developers to create applications that use the subscriber's location as part of the delivery of their service.</li>
	<li><strong>Messaging API</strong> - Provides developers with a network based Messaging API service to offer interactive services to our customers using Mobile Originated (MO) andMobile Terminated (MT) messaging.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://developer.sprint.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/sprint.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>The <a href="http://developer.sprint.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp" target="_blank">Sprint Application Developer Program</a> provides documentation, tools, support and go to market resources as well as six API services:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Geofence</strong> - Provides virtual perimeter services.</li>
	<li><strong>Location</strong> - Provides API for determining the location of a Sprint CDMA Device that is opted in to a developer's account.</li>
	<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - Provides a series of network messaging services.</li>
	<li><strong>Presence</strong> - A service to determine if a device is present on the Sprint cdma network.</li>
	<li><strong>UserManagement </strong>- A series of services to allow for dynamic user management.</li>
	<li><strong>iDen Content Uploader </strong>- A service meant to upload applications to iDen devices.</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/att-logo.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/att-logo.jpg" alt="" width="135" align="right" /></a>The <a href="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/att-logo.jpg" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Developer Program</a> provides documentation, tools, support, resources, developer sandbox and seven API services:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>SMS</strong> - A GSM protocols that allows the exchange of short text messages between mobile phone devices.</li>
	<li><strong>MMS</strong> - Extends SMS capabilities to include multimedia content.</li>
	<li><strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Wireless Application Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP Push</a></strong> - A standard for application-layer network connectivity.</li>
	<li><strong>Terminal Location</strong> - Set of <a class="zem_slink" title="Location-based service" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service">Location-based Services</a> (LBS).</li>
	<li><strong>Device Capabilities</strong> - Services to identify the capabilities of an AT&amp;T subscriber's mobile device.</li>
	<li><strong>Synaptic Storage as a Service</strong> - Storage based cloud computing.</li>
	<li><strong>Synaptic Compute as a Service </strong>- Server based cloud computing.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://developer.t-mobile.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp" target="_blank">T-Mobile has a partner network</a> with platform specific SDKs and resources, but no visible APIs for developers.<p>
Mobile carriers see first hand, the growth and potential of the mobile Internet, it is logical for them to also identify that value of providing their own APIs for developers to build upon.<p>
Primary the Mobile Provider APIs are all focused around services like location and messaging, however AT&amp;T is already pushing into the cloud computing and storage space.<p>
You will see more mobile providers launching APIs and more services from the existing Mobile Provider APIs in the near future.

The API provides full Instapaper account access, but can only access web page bookmarks from paid-subscriber accounts.<p>
Those who haven't paid the $1/month fee for an Instapaper account will still be able to submit to Instapaper using the <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/api/simple" target="_blank">Instapaper Simple API</a>.<p>
The API uses oAuth 2.0 for authentication and provide a set of helper libraries to get going.<p>
Instapaper API services and endpoints are:<p>
<strong>Account / Authentication</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>/api/1/oauth/access_token</li>
	<li>/api/1/account/verify_credentials</li>

Instapaper has provided some insight on its blog regarding <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/3208433429" target="_blank">why it chose to provide Full API access to data from paid accounts</a>.  It's a new and interesting perspective to the classic arguement of freemium versus paid accounts.<p>
The first application developed using the Full API is <a href="https://wp7wonders.wordpress.com/stacks-for-instapaper/" target="_blank">Stacks for Instapaper</a>, a Windows Phone 7 client. developed by Matthieu Guyonnet-Duluc.  More applications are sure to come.

title: 'History of APIs - Birth through Social'

---

<img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/ebay/ebay-developer-program-history.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />We hear a lot of talk about companies that were pioneers in the API space.  In an ongoing series we want to try to document the story behind these pioneers, and we are calling it History of APIs.<p>
So far we've covered what we consider the early innovators of the modern web API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/" target="_blank"><strong>Salesforce</strong></a> - February, 2000</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/" target="_blank">Ebay</a></strong> - November, 2000</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon E-Commerce</strong></a> - July, 2002</li>
</ul>
We call this the birth period of the modern API movement.  Salesforce, Ebay, and Amazon were the leaders of this movement and set the stage for the social period of the modern API movement.<p>
The social period had one clear pioneer:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/" target="_blank"><strong>Flickr</strong></a> - February, 2004</li>
</ul>
Flickr was the clear leader in redefining what APIs could be used for, and establishing the <a class="zem_slink" title="Representational State Transfer" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a> movement with their dead simple API.<p>
The next major players in the social period were:
<img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr/flickr-beta.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> - September, 2006</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> - August, 2006</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/history-of-apis-google-maps-api/" target="_blank"><strong>Google Maps</strong></a> - June, 2006</li>
</ul>
There are definitely other players in the social API period, but <a href="https://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> obviously have come out as the clear leaders.<p>
Google Maps definitely pushed the definition of what an API could do with their explosive mapping API that is the favorite of API mashups.<p>
We'll continue to define how API pioneers changed the way we see the web into the API period dominated by cloud computing.

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr/flickr-beta.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>In February 2004 the popular photo sharing site&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>&nbsp;launched. Six months later they launched their now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">infamous API</a>, and six months after that, they were acquired by&nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" title="Yahoo!" rel="homepage" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo.</a>
<p>Flickr was originally created as an online game, but quickly evolved into a social photo sharing sensation.
<p>The launch of the RESTful API helped Flickr quickly become the image platform of choice for the early blogging and social media movement by allowing users to easily embed their Flickr photos into their blogs and social network streams.
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/" target="_blank">Flickr API</a>&nbsp;is the driving inspiration behind the concept of&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/" target="_blank">BizDev 2.0</a>, a term coined by Flickr co-founder&nbsp;<a href="http://caterina.net/" target="_blank">Caterina Fake</a>.

<a href="https://instagr.am/" target="_blank"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>The mobile photo sharing site <a href="https://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api" target="_blank">Instagram officially launched an API this evening</a>.<p>
This comes just under a month after the c<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/" target="_blank">ompany asked developers to stop using a rogue API</a> that was reverse engineered by an outside developer.<p>
<a href="https://instagr.am/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> is accepting signups for access to their new API at:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="https://instagr.am/developer/" target="_blank">http://instagr.am/developer/</a></li>
</ul>
Developers will be notified when they open up access.<p>
<a class="zem_slink" title="Kevin Systrom" rel="crunchbase" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-systrom">Kevin Systrom</a>, Instagram CEO says, That the first step to creating a lasting company is to work with the many talented developers out there in the world.<p>
Instagram addreses image security and reassures that users will retain full ownership and privacy controls over all images.<p>
The Instagram API merely allows talented developers to create really neat and useful apps for you to get more out of your images.

image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/SOAP.png

<a href="https://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596000950"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/SOAP.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>SOAP, or <a class="zem_slink" title="SOAP" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">Simple Object Access Protocol</a>, is an XML-based protocol that allows applications to exchange information over the Internet using <a class="zem_slink" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> or <a class="zem_slink" title="Remote procedure call" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a>.<p>
SOAP uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) for its message format.  The SOAP Messaging Framework consists of:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Processing Model</strong> - Rules for processing a SOAP message</li>
	<li><strong>Extensibility Model</strong> - SOAP features and SOAP modules</li>
	<li><strong>Underlying Protocol Binding Framework</strong> - Rules for defining a binding to an underlying protocol that can be used for exchanging SOAP messages</li>
	<li><strong>Message Construct</strong> - Structure of a SOAP message</li>
</ul>
A SOAP message returning a users information might look like:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/817172.js?file=API%20-%20Tech%20-%20SOAP"></script>
SOAP was originally designed in 1998 as a Microsoft project and became a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/soap/" target="_blank">W3C Recommendation</a> in June 2003.<p>
Even though SOAP has a long history with enterprise development, it has not seen the same adoption with the web 2.0 developer community, in no small part due to its complex and verbose nature.<p>
SOAP is far from dead, but in the new generation of web-based APIs, RESTful interfaces returning JSON are fast replacing the bulky SOAP interfaces that returns XML.

<a href="https://www.meetup.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/meetup.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>Events are definitely one of the most important tools in an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist's</a> tool box.<p>
Making a regular showing at popular events both on and offline is critical to building the awareness and the trust of the development community.<p>
Speaking at major events is the best route to reach developers if you're targeting larger conferences, as exhibiting is not as rewarding as it once was.<p>
However, <a href="https://www.meetup.com" target="_blank">meetups</a> and hackathons are the future.<p>
Reaching the developer audience requires being able to step up to the bar with a pint of beer and being able to go the distance at hackathons.
<a href="http://razor.occams.info/blog/2009/12/14/gah09/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/hackathon.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
Traditional marketing techniques are often tuned out by the new development crowd and having a presence, building trust and mingling with the community are key.<p>
Stay in tune with your local meetup and hackathon calendars.  And make your own schedule known.  Broadcast events you will be attending and make sure an <a href="http://blog.twilio.com/2011/02/twilio-on-the-road-in-january-pennapps-and-philly-startup-weekend.html" target="_blank">provide quality recaps of where you've been</a>.<p>
A healthy part of any evangelism is a good roadshow, so make sure to produce yours in a way that truly connects with your audience.

title: 'Guide to Sharing Your Data'
image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/share-data.jpg
---

<div><p>
So you want to share some data-- perhaps out of the goodness of your heart, perhaps it makes you look good or perhaps you're required to do so.<p>
Whatever the case, sharing your data should be done in such a way so that the data is truly open and accessible.
<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/share-data.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
<strong>First:</strong><p>
Putting data in a PDF does not really constitute opening and sharing your data!
<ul class="mainlist"></ul>
I don't care how much we all love (or hate) the PDF. PDF has a lot of good uses, but sharing data is not one of them. PDF is a <a class="zem_slink" title="Portable Document Format" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">Portable Document Format</a> and is great for sharing documents, but it does'nt provide and structure for data. So if you take your data and publish it online in a PDF form you are not making your data open or accessible.<p>
<strong>Second:</strong><p>
Posting an Excel file to the Internet is a good step, if you speak Microsoftese, but it would be better to export it as CSV (<a class="zem_slink" title="Comma-separated values" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">Comma Separated Values</a>) or TSV (<a class="zem_slink" title="Delimiter-separated values" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values">Tab Separated Values</a>). This at least keeps your data structured and by putting it on the Internet your are opening it up.<p>
If you really want to think a little further ahead, you might consider importing your Excel spreadsheet as a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> Doc. This will make it public, and will accomplish the same goals as<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/publishing/">publishing</a> as Excel, CSV or TSV but you also have the added collaboration, sharing and <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> that comes with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-docs/">Google Docs</a>.<p>
<strong>Third:</strong><p>
If you truly care about the openness and accessibility of your data, you will publish it using a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/">Restful</a> API. Provide clear documentation on how use your API, and provide as many samples of code in as many different programming languages as you can.<p>
Take time to consider your goals in publishing your data to the web, and your intended audience. Make your data as open and accessible as you can.<p>
