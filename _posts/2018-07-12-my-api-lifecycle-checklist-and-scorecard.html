<p>This outline gets executed differently depending on the service stage and maintenance cycle being executed. It is meant to provide a master checklist to consider from day one, and every other time this service is being versioned, maintained, and considered as part of my overall operations. Providing a living checklist, and scorecard rubric for how well this service is doing, depending on stage and maintenance dimensions.

<p>Ultimately the API Discovery (APIs.json) document is the heartbeat for this service checklist, which resides in the root of the Github repository will provide the machine readable index for reporting and governance, while also driving the human readable interface that is accessible via the service portal, which is driven by Jekyll running in Github Pages. Which is something I will publish more about next, as part of a working portal for one of the first services coming off the assembly line.
