{% include JB/setup %}<p>APIs are quickly moving into the mainstream.In 2012, companies, organizations and government agencies all took notice of the need for deploying and consuming APIs.In 2013 there is still a lot of evangelism to be done, to make people aware of what an APIs is, and why their company should have one, but I think we are approaching the phase where APIs will be the default for any company.If you frequent the tech conferences like I do, youve heard folks like John Musser say that in 1995 we were asking, Do we need a website?, and by 2000 website was becoming the default.</p>
