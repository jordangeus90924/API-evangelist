2011 was an interesting year for APIs. I wasn't as good as I wanted to be at covering all major API events, but I got some traction with some posts I didn't anticipate.

Here are my top 10 traffic posts on API Evangelist for 2011:

  * **[Apple iCloud API**][1]
  * ****[Considerations When Planning Endpoints for your RESTful API][2]****
  * ******[Google Launches OAuth 2.0 Playground][3]******
  * ********[iCloud Storage APIs][4]********
  * **********[The Need for More Transit APIs][5]**********
  * ************[You Think There Are a Lot of APIs Now? Wait Until Evrythng Has An API!][6]************
  * **************[A Flood of APIs Just Waiting to Happen][7]**************
  * ************[Open Building Blocks for an API][8]
************
  * ****************[Providing Code Libraries is Not Enough for Your API][9]****************
  * ******************[RESTful Business Architecture][10]******************

I expected Apple related API stories to be big, but the other topics on here like endpoint planning, transit APIs, open building blocks, RESTful business architecture and a flood of APIs were a surprise.

Overall it shows me that applying APIs and RESTful concepts to business in specific industries can really get people talking.

A few of these posts were written while I was doing deep dives into government, water and transit industries and how APIs are changing the landscape.

I hope to do many of these deep industry dives in 2012.
