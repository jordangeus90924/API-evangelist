 WebSocket is a computer communications protocol standardized by the IETF in 2011 and providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSocket is distinct from HTTP but is designed to work over HTTP by using a handshake that uses an HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol using TCP.

 A WebSocket API provide an effective way for you to stand up a private, partner, or public API that handles a significant volume of specialized or ad hoc API traffic. But most WebSocket implementations lack schema normalization, management, and observability, making them  prime targets for standardization before they become a sprawling landscape of schema noise.
