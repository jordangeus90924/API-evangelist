<img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-url-shortner-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google launched a much anticipated API for the Google URL shortener today as part of the <a href="https://code.google.com/labs/">Google Code Labs</a>.<p>
The Google URL Shortener at goo.gl is a service that takes long URLs and squeezes them into fewer characters to make a link that is easier to share, tweet, or email to friends.<p>
The Google URL Shortener API allows you to interact with the service via a RESTful interface, and returns JSON data structures.  Here is the <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/overview.html">API Overview</a>, as well as the <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/v1/getting_started.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.<p>
Google has added to its new API console allowing developers to explore and get familiar with the API interface quickly.
