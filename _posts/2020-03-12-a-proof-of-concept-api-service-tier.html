As someone who is perpetually kicking the tires of API providers and service providers, not being able to on-board at all, on-board without my credit card, or one of the many other ways companies introduce friction, I find myself regularly pissed off. So anytime someone makes my world easier, and accommodates my need, desire, and obsession with playing with every damn API tool out there I have to say something. Today&rsquo;s example is from <a href="https://tyk.io/price-comparison/">my partner in crime Tyk</a>, with their proof of concept option<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p1">Tyk acknowledges that most of us might not be ready for pro status&mdash;we just need to kick the tires a bit. I love this approach. It&rsquo;s an evolution of the freemium model that I think is more honest and acknowledges the need to play around before entering in the credit card. This isn&rsquo;t all about getting something for free or always being ready to pay for a service. This is about me getting access to your service, be able to develop my proof af concept (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/01/08/dead-simple-real-world-api-management/">which I was able to do in &lt; 10 minutes with Tyk</a>), and then justify the cost of going pro with other stakeholders. Nice work Tyk&mdash;definitely what I like to see when playing with any API solution.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
