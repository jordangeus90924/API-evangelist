[Last May, Pearson Publishing began the roll-out of their new API platform][2], by doing initial tests using their DKâ€™s Eyewitness Travel Guide material, before moving on to a wider range of subjects. By the [end of the summer they had rolled out][3] a total of three APIs:

  * [Eyewitness Guides][4]
  * [FT Press][5]
  * [Longman Dictionary][6]

A year later, they now have APIs for the [Pearson Kitchen Manager][7] and most recently the [Nursing ][1]
