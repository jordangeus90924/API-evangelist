{% include JB/setup %}<p>I attended Masherys Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco last week.There were a lot of great API presentations, but I thought one really told a great story in-line with the focus of the event, which is the Business of APIs.Tyler Singletary(@harmophone), Developer Evangelist at Klout, told a story around how they are continuing to grow, control and monetize Klout, while also ensuring Klout continues to have meaning and deliver value.Klouts value lies in brand awareness, integrity and the meaning, usefulness and value of the Klout Score to consumers and businesses.To continue offering value and maintaing the integrity of the brand, they are creating a dynamic way to manage their API community, incentivize postive usage of the API, while controlling negative usage.</p>
