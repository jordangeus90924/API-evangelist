<p>I've been self funding API Evangelist for almost 4 years now, through various projects I've worked on and through the incredible support of my partners listed on this site.</p>

<p>I work very hard to remain an independent voice for the API space, not bound to any particular product, vendor or technology. I'm here to try and understand the space overall, and then in turn help the "normals" understand the fast growing world of APIs.</p>

<p>Currently I bring in revenue from consulting projects and my corporate partners. In 2014 I'm looking to expand this to bringing in individual and recurring contributions from individuals, companies and foundations for specific projects.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on over 50 projects, all which are openly licensed, machine readable--ready for remix and sharing. I need help funding my work and making sure these projects stay alive, and I'm able to take on new open data and API work in the future.</p>

<p>If you are in a position where you can help, I encourage you to pick a funding option below, and either fund my work in general or pick a project you'd like to see move forward, and of course you are welcome to suggest a project you'd like to fund as well.</p>

<p>I thank my partners and you for your support, and look forward to continue educateing the world about the importance of a healthy API strategy for years to come.</p>
