{% include JB/setup %}<p>The history of APIs is something I discuss a lot.Â The history of modern web APIs is something I include in all my talks, and Im always surprised by how little people understand some of the more popular APIs that got us to where we are at.To further support this area, Ive launched a History of APIs section where Ive hung the stories Ive already done in this area, and will be looking to dig up the history on other APIs that are shaking things up.When Im talking to people about APIs, the term APIs can mean many different things.Sometimes it means hardware APIs, or the Java API or various other technical incarnations.</p>
