        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-plan.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have some really amazing resources exposed as APIs. Everyone is doing it these days, and I have some good ones, now I just need a plan. You know, actually, I need several plans, that will help me expose these resources to the right people, while remain as much control as I need, and also generate revenue from these resources, tailored to whoever I am offering them to.</p>
<p><strong>Starting With The Essential API Building Blocks</strong><br />I want to allow anyone to access my valuable APIs, however I want to control exactly how much they can access, and even limit it to a free trial, and a small amount of calls upon the API. I am going to call this Plan A, also known as my freemium layer, meant to just wet the appetite of any potential API consumer. I ow have a basic level of access to my API resources, that anyone can sign up for 24/7, yet I get to dictate exactly how many hits on the API they can make, and who gets access.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Beyond Plan A For My API Strategy</strong><br />Plan A only gets me so far, I need to also be able to establish additional plans that help me cover the costs of my operations, and hopefully also generate some revenue from API access and usage. I need to be able to establish any number of plans that I will need to be successful. Each additional plan that I offer, lets call them plan B, C, and D, should have the ability to sign-up 24/7 without approval, possess a trial version option if necessary, and allow for charging of setup costs to get going--if I so choose.</p>
<p><strong>Defining Usage Metrics That Are Meaningful To Me</strong><br />All of my plans will start with these elements, but then should allow me to set any other metric I desire. I want to track on API call, by message, according to bandwidth consumed or stored, the time period in play, the scope of compute being applied, and much, much more. Any of my plans should be able to to measured in these units, or anything else I want to define. If an API plan provides access to a blog, product catalog, the requirements might be different than when I provide access to images, videos, podcasts or other heavy objects. I should be able to define the metrics, and set a price per metric that can be applied to each APIs I am making available.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Limitations For API Access</strong><br />Each of my plans should have well defined units of operations (metrics), cost per unit, and volume pricing, but also should possess limitations of what can be accessed. I need to restrict some plans to a daily amount, limit server loads by only allowing a certain amount of requests, bandwidth, per second, minute, hour, day, week, or month. If I want, I should be able to leave API access open ended. How I define the access for each of my API plans, should be tailored exactly for my intended audience for each plan, with an infinite number of plans possible.</p>
<p><strong>Which APIs Methods Are Available In Each Of My Plan(s)</strong><br />No plans are created equal. Which API resources, and methods, and verbs, are available in any given plan is again, tailored to the intended audience of each plan. My Plan A allows limited reading from just a handful of resources for everyone, while my Plan C allows for reading and writing from a variety of API resources, designed for a specific group of partners, defined by me. My public facing plans encourage consumption of specific resources that I have crafted, while my partner plans encourage two way usage, incentivizing my partners to add, update, and curate information available via the API resources I have made available.</p>
<p><strong>All The Variables I Need To Compose The Plans I Need</strong><br />I can create as many APIs, and individual methods, and package them up into plans, and measure their access by call, bandwidth, storage, time period, compute, and other critical metrics. It is within my control to set limitations, and volume levels of access across these metrics, charging exactly what I need to incentivize API usage, while also covering the costs of my operations, and bring in a healthy bit of revenue in the door as well--I have a full toolbox of what I need to orchestrate my API driven business model(s).</p>
<p><strong>Provide The Features My Consumers Will Need Along With Each Plan</strong><br />Along with the access of API resources within each plan, I need to also bundle other features, like support, service level agreement (SLA), and other resources that consumers will need to be successful with integrations. Again, each plan should be tailored for the intended audience, providing the API access they need, while also makes sure all their adjacent needs are met along the way as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conductor.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Providing Variable Unit(s) of Value For All API Transactions</strong><br />Whether its an API call, bandwidth transmitted, or duration of resource usage, you have measurable units of value, where a price can be set, in a way that lets it be adjusted by volume, or each plan level. An API call might be one cent (for sake of discussion), but if you access more than 10K per day, it goes down to half a cent per API call. For partner plans, each API call might be 1/10th of a cent by default, with 1/100th of a cent if you access more than 10K per day. Each API has its unit of value, with the price for this unit of value variable depending which plan you are in, and how much you consume.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Know What Price To Set For Each Unit Of Access?</strong><br />You have an API, but where do you even start understanding where to price this resource, which you feel is really cool and valuable, but might be completely meaningless to others. You can start by looking at competing API providers, and follow any precedent that has been set in the industry to date. Beyond following the lead of others, you can break down your own story, and dial in exactly what it costs to deliver an API, and set the price for the industry, and lead others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Did Cost To Acquire What Is Need For An API Resources?</strong><br />Every API starts somewhere. What did it take to discover the idea for an API, negotiate or license its usage, or maybe you had to purchase some content, data, or access to a programmatic resources. Before you get to work developing an API, there will be some investment to bring an API idea to production.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Has Gone Into Developing An API?</strong><br />Beyond the acquisition of an API, like the API usage itself, this might be a two way street, it might not just be costs associated, but also investment from other partners, investors, or otherwise. What has gone into normalizing resources, designing and developing the database, server, and the API itself. Consider the network too--what will it take when it comes to network bandwidth, and what are the DNS considerations to manage traffic. Thanks to cloud computing, there are many ways to meter areas like compute, storage, and bandwidth, make sure and put these tools to work for you.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What Are The Realities Of What It Will Cost To Operate An API?</strong><br />What are the costs associated with maintaining the central truth of an API, its definition? What are the hard compute, storage, and bandwidth costs associated with API operations? I'm sure you have a good handle on what these are. How much do you have invested in management, monitoring, security, and evangelism? There are a lot of costs to consider beyond the visible aspects of API operations, but there are also a lot of associated costs to operations that often get left behind like support, and the creation of additional resources.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Let's Discuss Who Will Be Access An API And Our Plan For Different Levels&nbsp;</strong><br />Now we have a better handle of what goes into acquiring, developing, and operating an API, but who actually be accessing the API, and who do we need to offer different plans to, tailored for their relationship with me, and their unique needs. We have discussed the opportunities around free, and free trial access plans, but what about other pro bono approaches like not-for-profit, and educational or research plans, to help eliminate costs for consumers, and encouraging meaningful access.</p>
<p class="p1">Once we have establish the entry levels of access we can begin crafting additional levels of retail, partner, or internal levels of API access. It doesn't need to stop there, you can craft as many plans for API access as needed to meet the needs of every potential group, inside or outside of a company. API providers should work to be as transparent as possible with available plans, and what is available within each plan level, all the way up to partner tiers and potentially reseller or private label tiers of access.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Now That We Have A Better Understand Of What Goes Into Our APIs, How Do We Set Pricing?</strong><br />Even though we know what went into an API, we don't always know how API consumers will perceive the value around an API, so we must be ready to adjust pricing based upon this perception. How we limit, and incentivize usage needs to reflect this value, and the relationship with each group of consumers. There should be paths that incentivize usage, encourage the purchase of resources in bulk, by the timeframe (monthly, quarterly), or maybe at specific times that benefit the provider, or the consumer. Remember, pricing is a two-way street, that can benefit the provider, as well as the consumer, but strike the balance that makes API platforms go round.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Let's Remember There Isn't Always Direct Value Generation From APIs</strong><br />Something that often gets overlooked in API operations is the indirect value they can generate. APIs are a potential marketing vehicle when done right, pushing forward the exposure of a brand, driving web or mobile traffic, or generating valuable data and content through network and application activity. Many of these activities can be measured, just like with direct API consumption, but should be treated different than commercial consumption, and potentially act as marketing, advertising, and word of mouth around the value an API brings to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Greasing The Wheels With Valued Partners</strong><br />Public APIs have dominated the conversation for some time now, but web APIs bring just as much, or more value to trusted partners. APIs make it so I can quickly share the valuable resources I possess with those I feel would benefit most. While I try to make all of my APIs publicly available, it is my partners who get preferred access, and if I do it right, they can generate value via my APIs, and benefit what I am doing. If I do this the right way, I should be able to generate revenue from my APIs, while also sharing that exhaust with my trusted partners, and if they are the right kind of partners, they kick exhaust back my way as well.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Realizing The Value Of APIs Internally</strong><br /><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">As we've learned from the Steve Yegges rant about APIs at Amazon</a>, and&nbsp;as the myth tell us, Bezos ordered everyone at Amazon to use APIs for the exchange of internal API resources. Amazon understood that APIs bring agility, and efficiency when done well, and can help internal groups work together, and like public API access, internal consumers can also have plans tailored specifically for their needs. This is where the true benefits of APIs are evident, and unfortunately is the aspect of APIs that is least discussed out in the open for everyone to learn from.</p>
<p><strong>Units of Value Can Go Both Ways, Depending On Who Is Access An API</strong><br />It is very common for APIs to charge for access, restricting access by some of the common units of value listed above. It is less common for APIs to pay consumers for access APIs, incentivizing the publishing of content, posting of images and videos, and other value generating ways of putting APIs to work. What is the value of the first image added to an API for a business location vs. the 10th photo added? What is the value of encouraging API consumers to add their own content to a a system, augmenting existing information. There are endless ways to encourage developers to contribute to a platform, the only limit is your own plan for defining the boundaries of this participation.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-transfer-cloud.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>We Should Be Making Value Transferrable Across API Providers</strong><br />All of this provides a standardized way for API providers to define the value of API resources, and incentivize usage, while also generating needed revenue. Money is spent accessing some resources, while money is generated for publishing or refining other resources. This two way value generation shouldn't be locked up within each API providers silo, and be transferrable between API providers. In 2015, developers are using not just one or two APIs, they putting many different APIs to work, and while API providers need to cover costs, and generate revenue, so do API consumers. It is two sides of the same coin--the API balance.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Compare The Value Of Value Across API Platforms?</strong><br />The first challenge we will face is transferring this value from one silo to another. Even when platforms have comparable API resources available, rarely will it be an apples to applies comparison. While this exercise gives us a better look into how resources can be defined, and have a price applied to their consumption across multiple plan levels, this is limited to discussion around each individual platform. Before we can compare the value across API platforms, we need to standardize the business model for each API, and establish a ranking system for each provider, that will act as a weight when comparing provider to provider, and across many providers within an industry.</p>
<p>This is just my way of exercising my views around the development of API business models. Next I will explore the concept of API rating in 2015 as I see it, and try to find the linkage to the unit price established as part of API management operations in this post. Everything I discussed above is not hypothetical. It is rooted in API infrastructure solutions provided by companies like 3Scale. To craft this story, I had my 3Scale administrative console open for my own APIs, and theoretically walked through some of the known approaches to API monetization.</p>
<p>Once I am done playing with my thoughts around rating APIs and the resources they provide, I think I'll revisit this post about plans, and craft a formal look at Amazon, Twilio, and other well known APIs, and help provide ready to go API business model blueprint that others can follow. While there is endless ways to experiment and play here, I think most of the API space is just looking for ready to go business models, that are proven and make sense, that they can plug into their operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rating.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>API rating is a conversation I have several times a year, with different groups, and is a conversation that seems to occurring with a little more frequency in recent months. How do we know which APIs are the good ones? What constitutes a good API? How do we measure whether a contract (the API) is being adhered to, by both API provider, and potentially the consumer as well. How will we establish the Standard &amp; Poors or Moodys for the API economy? These are the API rating conversations I am having with folks.</p>
<p>These are all great questions, and something many companies have approached me looking help in solving, with nobody moving forward with this in a meaningful, and sustainable way. So to help apply some CPR to the subject, I am going to explore API rating some more, from my own point of view, in hopes of guiding some existing conversation I'm already having on the subject, and also hopefully generate some new ones. I want to quantify where we are at with this problem, what work I've put into, and maybe establish an open blueprint that the community might be able help run with.</p>
<p><strong>Starts With API Discovery</strong><br />Before we will ever have a usable approach to API ratings, we are going to have to also work on our API discovery problems. We have one open format, designed to not just index the technical side of APIs, but also the business, and political side of operations--<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. The problem is we haven't reached a critical mass where a machine readable index of API operations is available for most of the public APIs available, as well as private indexes of the APIs that exist behind the firewall. It will take time, but soon, every actor in the API economy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/apis.json">from Fitbit</a>, up to&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.trade.gov/apis.json">the International Trade Administration</a>, will have&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json indexes</a>&nbsp;of their API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next, What Makes A Good API?</strong><br />There are many things that goes into making an API good, or bad, and unfortunately many of these characteristics are difficult to track on in any sort of automated way. I'd say that API design is the number one complaint against APIs, but until recently there were not really any good ways to measure API consistency across many disparate APIs. I'd say the number two complaint against an API is around the documentation--good, clean, intuitive, and up to date documentation is always telling. However we can talk about API design and API documentation until the cows come home, and will make no progress on solving the question of how to measure, and quantify what a good API is, and what a bad API is.</p>
<p>In reality, there are a number of criteria that could be used to help separate the good APIs from the bad APIs. I've worked to aggregate what I consider to be some of the common building blocks across API design, deployment, management, and almost 20 other stops along the API life-cycle. From this research, I can provide a pretty good starting point for establishing a baseline rating that can be applied against all types of APIs. Part of my motivation in crafting this post, is to organize these thoughts, and publish as a potential v1 open blueprint, to help move conversations forward. I'm not saying this is what should be, but just a list of things to consider as the community contributes something.</p>
<p><strong>The Technology of APIs</strong><br />This is where all API operations, good or bad begin, with the technical implementations of the API itself. When you are dealing with something as technical and abstract as an API, it can be hard separate the technology from everything else, but I feel it is an important exercise, even if I don't always get it right. Here are some of the technological aspects to consider when rating APIs from the technical view:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;- How is the API designed? Is it simple, web-focused, and follows moderns conventions, and leverage HTTP over language specific characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- What sort of authentication technology is employed? Are modern approaches from &nbsp;basic keys, too tokens, and OAuth employed?</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;- Is the API available? Our there significant outages involved in recent times, and what is the overall track record for a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>&nbsp;- Will the API scale technically, and meet the demand of its users. Does the underlying code, server, and database scale with the demand.</li>
<li><strong>Code Resources&nbsp;</strong>- What extra code resources area available around an API from CLI to SDKs, and starter kits. Code resources play big role in API success.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks -&nbsp;</strong>The presence of webhooks for me, tells me that a platform operates as a two way street, contributes to availability, and scalability, and a nod towards real-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To establish a true rating criteria, you would need to break many of these things down, and establish a way of actually validating in a programmatic way. You would need to be able to look for consistent API design patterns, usage of HTTP status codes, and how available and scalable a platform is. With most of the technology of an API hidden behind the facade, you are left with little to go on, but the design, authentication pattern, availability, scalability, and any other technical resources that are made available.</p>
<p><strong>The Business of APIs</strong><br />I have worked hard to understand the line between the tech, and the business of API operations. I feel this separation is critical to truly understanding why APIs work. Like the technology behind, the business approaches to API operations can be subjective, and vary from provider to provider. However, in my work I have found some ways of identifying the healthy business practices, as well as some unhealthy business practices that exist in the space.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation -&nbsp;</strong>The availability of simple, intuitive, up to date API documentation, usually of the interactive kind is standard operating procedure of good APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration -</strong>&nbsp;Self-service, 24/7 registration for API access is a hallmark of good APIs--leaving access considerations dealt with via multiple tiers of API plans.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model -</strong>&nbsp;A clear business model, and pricing is always present in the good APIs. It can be easy to spot the bad apples, because they tend to only be free.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What support resources area available? Are there multiple channels of self-service, or direct support that have regular person behind the scenes supporting?</li>
<li><strong>Communication -</strong>&nbsp;Does an API platform communicate? Are there multiple channels like a blog, Twitter, or other social accounts available?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Change -&nbsp;</strong>How often, and rapid is change on the platform, and are changes communicated through a road-map, and other available channels?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>An API platform reflects the core business values of the company that operates it. The business of an API sets the tone for their entire community, something API consumers can contribute to, but it is ultimately left to the platform provider to set overall. It is fairly easy to identify bad actors, because of significant gaps in the business model, support, and communication around platform operations. There are many other aspects of API business operations to consider, but this provides a good base to start.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-fist.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>The Politics of APIs</strong><br />In the last three years, another significant line has emerged when determining which APIs are good ones, and which are the bad ones. While much of this area depends on legal building blocks of API operations, I call it the politics of APIs, because it tends to reflect the politics of a company, or maybe the industry it resides in. Some of these areas will make or break APIs, and definitely put them in the good or bad bucket.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -&nbsp;</strong>What is in a terms of service? Are the heavily weighted towards the platform, or do they allow for innovation by consumers, within the ecosystem?</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Policy -</strong>&nbsp;What does privacy look like on a platform? What do official policies state, and what does actual practice look like on the platform, and among consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Platform Security -&nbsp;</strong>How is security handled across platform operations? How open is a platform about their security policies. This will be the number one criteria going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>How transparent is a company with platform operations, and the overall roadmap. Is there an adversarial relationship with community, or an open, collaborative one?</li>
<li><strong>Licensing -&nbsp;</strong>What software, content, and data license are in place? How is the API interface, server, and client code licensed, as well as the supporting content, and resources for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong>&nbsp;What rate limits are imposed by the provider, and are they consistent and fair across access plans? Do rate limits favor the platform or consumer?</li>
<li><strong>Investment -</strong>&nbsp;Who is invested in the company behind an API platform? Where in the investment cycle is a company, and how much money has been invested?</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just a handful of the political elements of API platform operations, but they are the usual suspects when it comes to determining the good APIs from the bad ones. This area tends to be the hardest to nail down area of how we would rate API providers in my eperience. This is where the most amount of smoke and mirrors is deployed, and nothing is ever what it seems, but this area makes or breaks many API operations, in more situations than the other technical and business elements listed.</p>
<p>The areas I provided across the technical, business, and political considerations for rating APIs as good or bad, can be broken down much further. I have specific questions that should be asked about API design, communication, and platform licensing, but for this discussion I just wanted to highlight the core groups of considerations. The separation between these areas, as well as the overlap is tough to see sometimes, but is something that is coming into focus, with the more APIs that I look at through this lens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Make One Such API Rating Model Work?</strong><br />With a rating definition in hand (theoretically) how do we move forward actually making this a reality. This is a huge problem, one very few people or companies truly grasp the scope of, and one that wave of new startups think they can solve, only to watch ALL of them fail. This is a problem that I feel will take four distinct groups to make happen, each bringing their own assets to the table, when it comes to making one such API rating model work.</p>
<p><strong>The Essential API Provider Signals</strong><br />What information can API providers share, and what signals are the sending, either consciously, or unconsciously, that can be included as part of a rating system? There are numerous aspects of API operations on the open Internet, that are ripe for discovery, monitoring, and ultimately rating how a provider approaches their operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog -</strong>&nbsp;An active blog is a great way to understand the viability, tone, and overall presence of an API provider, with a RSS bonus for monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter -</strong>&nbsp;An active Twitter account is second to a blog, when it comes to understanding&nbsp;the viability, tone, and overall presence of an API provider.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Github -</strong>&nbsp;The social coding platform is quickly surpassing Twitter and a blog as the most important signal an API can send about their viability as a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Press -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A regular PR drumbeat out of a company is a great to understand the investment into any platform, and the tone that it will take in the community.</li>
<li><strong>Road-map -</strong> The regular update, and sharing of the platforms road-map providing as much information as possible about what is coming down the road for the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may sound silly to track on such basic things, but when a platform is about to die, the blog and Twitter accounts go silent, and you see diminished activity on Github. These content and social signals are the heartbeat of modern API operations. If you aren't telling stories, being social, and pushing code on a regular basis, your overall rating in the space goes down.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-signals.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>The Signals From The Community, Industry, and Open Web</strong><br />What is the community saying about a platform? This is one of the benefits of being a public API operation is you can generate the right signals across the space that attract other developers, businesses, analysts, and generally open you up for inclusion in any potential API rating systems. What are some of the common signals the community sends, that could be gathered as part of an open API rating system?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Sharing -</strong>&nbsp;Which blogs posts were shared across the community, and at large on social networks, and bookmarking sites?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Followers -&nbsp;</strong>How many Twitter followers does a platform have? Did they buy them?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Retweets -&nbsp;</strong>What gets retweeted by the Twitter community? What is the echo from platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Favorites -&nbsp;</strong>How many tweets have been favorited? Even if this is just for bookmarking, it acknowledges people are paying attention.</li>
<li><strong>Github Followers -</strong>&nbsp;How many Github followers does a platform have?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Stars -</strong>&nbsp;How many stars has been received across a platforms repositories?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Forks -</strong>&nbsp;How many repositories have been forked, and how many times?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Watchers -&nbsp;</strong>Are they watchers of a platforms Github repository? How many?</li>
<li><strong>Platform Stories -</strong>&nbsp;What other stories are told about an API provider, via popular tech blogs, and other industry news.</li>
<li><strong>QA &amp; Forum Discussions -&nbsp;</strong>What is the presence, and conversation on sites like Stack Exchange and Quora, and what is the overall sentiment?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the signals I tune into, when it comes to monitoring what API providers are up to across the sector. While there are no absolutes when it comes to these data points, they provide me a buffet of information to make my own decisions around, when it comes to what the community is thinking regarding any particular platform.</p>
<p><strong>What The Almighty Analysts Gods Think About An API Platform</strong></p>
<p>The third area that has a significant influence on the API space, is the analyst perspective. I put myself in this category, as I make a living analyzing the API sector. If we are going to strike a balance across the internal provider, and the public view of any single company, and its API offerings, we will need an informed analyst community to weigh in. Here are just a handful of the data points I include in my own analyst ranking variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My Notes -</strong>&nbsp;How many occurrences of a company are there in my notebook?</li>
<li><strong>My Curation -&nbsp;</strong>How many times have I bookmarked and curated a post from, or about a platform?</li>
<li><strong>My Posts -&nbsp;</strong>Have I written stories about a company? How many?</li>
<li><strong>My White Papers -&nbsp;</strong>Has a platform being referenced, or featured in one of my white papers or guides?</li>
<li><strong>My Tweets -</strong>&nbsp;Have I tweeted anything from a platforms Twitter account? Or a mention about them?</li>
<li><strong>My Gut -</strong>&nbsp;What is my general feeling, and gut reaction to an API platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>This reflects my own criteria that goes into my analyst ranking for a company, and yes, I have a tool that helps me calculate this across the companies, and individuals I track on. Other analysts are probably going to have their own formula, but is something I'd love to start seeing shared by the community--how do experts in the space, feel about existing APIs, and their technical, business, and political approach to API operations.</p>
<p><strong>There Is Always A Role For Government To Play In All Of This</strong><br />Whether you believe in the power of government or not, there will always be a role, both positive and potentially negative, for government of all shapes and sizes to play in this API rating system. Like other data points considered as part of this rating system, the following data points should be considered, but will mean different things to different folks, and APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filings -&nbsp;</strong>What are the SEC, IRS, and other government filings by companies who operate API platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Investigations -</strong>&nbsp;What are ongoing investigations by government agencies into companies who operate API platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Stories -</strong>&nbsp;What are some of the leaks, and other stories being told in media and government circles about how companies are viewed.</li>
<li><strong>Patents -&nbsp;</strong>Are there patent filings by specific platforms that impact the overall API space, down to specific industries.</li>
<li><strong>Legal -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;What court battles are being waged, at any level of our legal system, that impact specific platforms, and the industries they operate in.</li>
<li><strong>Legislation -&nbsp;</strong>What legislation is being planned, or is on the books that impact any specific sector an API provider operates in.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of government induced influences that could impact the rating any particular API platform may receive. Patents could be seen as strengths or even weaknesses, and existing court battles, filings, investigations, and other government influenced decisions may weigh into rating decisions as well. The involvement by the government of all sizes is only going to increase in the API economy.</p>
<p><strong>It Will Take Everyone Working Together To Make This Work</strong><br />A realistic API rating system or systems, will take work between all the groups listed above. API providers will have to step up and be more transparent, and share the data they possess. The developer community, API service providers, and the public at large will have to share information, and knowledge they accumulate from across the space. Analysts are going to have to step up, providing leadership and analysis across all industries, as well as within specific industries. The government will play a role in not just regulating industries, but also being API providers, and consumers themselves, providing valuable data, and aggregate resources, as well as informed analysis from the vital public sector perspective.</p>

<p><strong>How Do We Make Sure An Share An Open Blueprint For Rating Algorithm(s) Exists?</strong><br />This post is just an executive summary of the summary data points I'd like to see in a potential open API rating algorithm. Ultimately I'd like to see an API-Rating outline published to Github, outlining all of the areas I track on. I'm happy to be caretaker of these open blueprints, and use Github to store the algorithm, and public or proprietary data that goes into the end rating. Ultimately it should be an open, and transparent blueprint that anyone can follow, or contribute to.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Models For Incentivizing The Investing Of Open And Proprietary Data In Rating Algorithm(s)</strong><br />In establishing an open blueprint, and house the algorithm for an open API rating blueprint, I have ideas about how we can store open, and even proprietary datasets that goes into different areas of the API rating system. Using a Github organization, a series of public, and private repositories, it is easy enough to provide a central place for everything to live. I've seen evidence of strong currents in the space that will swoop in and snatch up tooling and specification that gains adoption in the space, and know there will be many groups who seek to influence the rating system disproportionately--it has to be an open blueprint, and have the ability to support public and private data, from a variety of players, that will drive the rating results.</p>
<p><strong>This Will All Take Time, But We Need To Start Somewhere</strong><br />As with the <a href="http://apisjson.org">API discovery work I'm doing with APIs.json</a>, I know this is a long game, and will not happen overnight. APIs are the driving force behind the growth in online commerce, social, cloud, mobile, and devices, touching almost every industry in 2015, the need for not just discovery of high quality APIs, but also being able to rate them, is only going to increase. We have to begin somewhere, and while some of what I propose seems far-fetched, it represents my efforts to define a rating algorithm, and I am the only person to put anything forward, beyond thinking it should be a startup.</p>
<p>I have most of the v1 algorithm available, it would just take some work to hammer into a coherent road-map. I have some of the data needed to get a v1 rating off the ground, going back to 2011 and 2012. With some work we could pull together other missing data. However to make this work, it would require API providers to step up and share data, and API service providers to do the same. Many leading API providers will be unwilling to participate, because they are rated highly without a rating system. It will be new APIs that will be willing to contribute to such as system, in hopes they can compete with the existing leaders.</p>
<p>I see, what I'm calling API Rating, as something that needs to evolve alongside my API discovery, and API monetization research. I will setup a project, and help me tune into the bigger picture. i will also formalize my look into crafting API plans, that are driven by the business model, and monetization goals of companies playing in the API game. Alright, moving on to crafting some blueprints for Twilio, SendGrid, and other common messaging APIs for their API plans, and API rating...then we'll do some comparison, and see how any of this will actually make sense in the wild.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p>After writing&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/i-have-a-bunch-of-api-resources-now-i-need-a-plan-or-potentially-several-plans/">I Have A Bunch Of API Resources, Now I Need A Plan, Or Potentially Several Plans</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">How Are We Going To Create The Standard And Poors And Moodys For The API Economy</a>, I wanted to combine what I had learned while crafting these stories, and try to look at how these two areas could work together. The API plan and pricing research is derived from <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm&quot;,">existing approaches to API service composition introduced by providers like 3Scale,</a> however the rating portion is fresh territory for me, with very few precedents to follow.</p>
<p>What I see when I start wading through a structured approach for API providers to craft meaningful API plans to serve up their API resources through, and how developers will be paying for API usage, via the apps they build, I begin to see the potential of a structured approach to API plans, and pricing. When you start thinking of the implications across providers, and consider the opportunities for developers to manage API consumption across API providers, and exchange the credits they purchased, or generated via API usage--a potential blueprint for an economic engine for the API space begins to emerge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this concept, by crafting a visualization, and ponder how common approaches to API plans, and pricing, could be complimented by a standardized API industry rating system.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/API-plans-API-pricing-API-rating.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The only thing really original in this diagram, is the introduction of an API rating system, and the potential for developers being able to exchange credits between the API service providers they depend on. The rest of this standard API management approaches, that are defined by API providers like 3Scale. If you aren't familiar with modern approaches to API service composition, API providers can have many different API resources, as well as many different plans for subscribing to these API services, which provide a wealth of dimension for API providers to define, price, and limit how developers put API resources to use in applications.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>T Circle</strong>&nbsp;in the above diagram is where the current magic happens, when you put modern API management solutions to work for API operations. This allows you to mix and match access to your API resources, charging different prices, to different developer groups, introduce volume usage levels, and measure as many dimensions of consumption as you desire. Rarely do successful APIs have just one rate of access to them, this approach to API management allows providers to maximize access to resources, while also maximizing potential revenue around subscriptions, and usage consumption.</p>
<p>When you start putting API providers into standard API plans, and pricing framework like this, you start seeing intra-provider opportunities, industry wide benefits, as well as potential to really make API consumers lives much easier. If there were standardized ways to understand how API providers were pricing their resources, and how they tiered access, and adjusted pricing between these tiers, the API industry competition would heat up significantly. The problem comes in when you start allowing developers to transfer credits from provider to provider, while it may seem like you are transferring common units of value, but in many cases there are big differences between each API provider and what the value of one transaction may be.</p>
<p>Once you introduce an API rating system to the equation, it provides one possible way for rating each provider, and setting a benchmark that can be used to exchange credits between each platform. If each provider operated in a credit format, that could be cashed out using an exchange rate, or possible transferred from one platform to another, you'd start to see some potentially interesting market effects. I think you'd quickly see some negative, as well as positive effects, but I think some balance could be struck between some of the common API resources being served, and consumed across the API space. Newer resources, with fewer precedent would be very volatile for a period of time.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>R Circle</strong>&nbsp;in the above diagram is mean to reflect the potential of an industry wide API rating system, when you have standardized information on API pricing, across API providers. This pricing would vary across the plans each provider offers, but you could still come up with a median pricing for individual providers, and even entire industries. When you apply the rating system you could provide a potential exchange rate that could be applied when moving credits bought, and earned via each API platform, between API providers. Developers could explore which platforms allow them generate credits by engaging with API resources, exchange to other providers, where they could then spend the credits for other services they need, in lieu of cash. This also opens up the possibilities for markets for API credits exchanged across business sectors being impacted by APIs.</p>
<p>I'm just exploring concepts involved with common approaches to API plans and pricing, and brainstorming a potential API rating system, then using my imagination to understand the developer, and industry implications of this one possible future. Only one part of this equation exists, and it would take some significant work to bring such a thing into reality, but it is fun to explore, and consider one possible design for an economic engine, that could possibly scale, and drive the API industry.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/10/29/api-visualization-exploration-using-api-definitions/">API Visualization Exploration Using API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apihandyman.io/swagger/swagger-specification-visual-documentation/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/swagger-specification-visual-documentation.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are number of areas across the API life-cycle that are being expanded upon in the current space, thanks to the evolution of API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML. One area I haven't seen as much growth as I'd like, is in the area of <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">visualizations driven by API definitions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two distinct pools of API definition driven visualization: 1) Letting you visualize the surface area of an API 2) Letting you visualize the resource made available via an API. One area my friend the <a href="https://twitter.com/apihandyman">@APIHandyman</a> has been exploring is around the surface area of API.</p>
<p>@APIHandyman has a nice prototype created that he is calling "<a href="http://apihandyman.io/swagger/swagger-specification-visual-documentation/">Swagger Specification Visual Documentation</a>". The API Definition driven visualization uses A <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js visualization</a> to help you explore the surface area of any API that is defined using Swagger. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/06/my-wish-has-been-granted-swagger-driven-api-visualizations-from-ardoq/">I have written about API definition driven visualizations before</a>, so I am happy to see the concept being pushed forward, as we have a lot of iterations to cycle through before we find a visualization format(s) that works for different API designers, architects, and developers.</p>
<p>The visual documentation that @APIHandyman created runs on Github, and he is looking for feedback on the micro tool, and where he should take it next. He recently added a bigger information display area, but could use the communities ideas on how to make it more useful. This type of work is a time drain. Every time I started playing with Swagger + D3.js I would lose an entire evening, and have very little to show for work, so I know how valuable feedback can be.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/30/swagger-visualization-layer-using-d3js/">API definition driven D3.js visualizations </a>will be the future of API design, management, and orchestration. APIs are going to continue to grow in number, and scope, and we will need simple, visual ways we can quickly traverse the landscape, and makes sense of things. If you are working on an API definition driven visualization tool, either for the surface area of an API, or helping visualize the actual resources being served up, please let me know so I can showcase.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/10/29/an-api-idea-http-status-code-clinic/">An API Idea: HTTP Status Code Clinic</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-clinic.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is one of my ideas for an API service provider, that I will never get time to do, but would love to see exist in the space, so I am happy to put out there for someone else to do. I'm calling this one an HTTP Status Code Clinic, which would be an API definition driven API service provider (why would you do it any other way in 2015), that would help API providers tailor more useful, and meaningful HTTP status codes.</p>
<p>HTTP Status Code Clinic would be a simple software as a service, complete with its own API (why would you do it any other way in 2015), and CLI for operating as well. You would pass it a Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or any other API definition format, and it would return a bunch of feedback on HTTP status codes returned (or not). The process could anchor the feedback in the current API design, while also providing HTTP status code education along the way.</p>
<p>The service would have to get crafty around how it walked through an API, requesting sample data, or requiring default values for query parameters, headers, body, etc. If it was done well it could be done as a kind of wizard that walked the user through each endpoint, what was returned, and might be better solutions, as well as additional status codes that could be used. You could also include examples from popular APIs like Twilio, Twitter, and others, to show what is possible.</p>
<p>I recommend you do this as a standalone service. While it might be nice to have as part of an existing service provider stack, I think it makes more sense to offer as a standalone clinic / service that API providers could use when they are ready. API designers and architects could make it part of the API design and definition portion of their life-cycle, as well as integrate into their existing systems using the&nbsp;HTTP Status Code Clinic API--other API service providers could also integrate the features into their tooling using the API</p>
<p>This is an open API idea, yours for the taking, it you want more detail from me on how I'd approach, I would be willing to do some tech investment for a piece of the action. Good luck!</p>

<p>One of the discussions we are having <a href="http://apiware.io/">behind the scenes at APIWare.io</a>, is whether we should be hand-crafting, or auto-generating SDKs for the clients we are working with on the design, deployment, and management of their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is easy--we do both!&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many situations where I would push for the <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">API SDKs</a> to be hand-crafted, and designed for a specific API, as well as specific language or platform. However, with the increase in the number of APIs, and simplicity of some of the APIs I work with, crafting an API definition, and <a href="https://apimatic.io/">auto-generating your SDKs using a service like APIMATIC</a>, makes sense.</p>
<p>I've cracked open the APIMATIC SDKs, and only being fluent in JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and C#, I can only speak to these realms of operation, but I'm happy with what the APIMATIC team is producing. For me, this isn't a black and white game, it isn't hand-crafted vs. autogenerated--it is how you employ both approaches across your API operations.</p>
<p><a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC provides high quality SDKs in 10 languages</a>, some languages I do not speak. The APIWare.io team has a wealth of programming talent on the team, and while we could hand code libraries across these areas, for all of our clients, for many of the more straightforward APIs, it just makes sense to generate. We are already an API-definition first shop, where we craft Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or other required API definition format, so using this to generate SDKs makes sense in many situations.</p>
<p>Are you trying to figure out the best path forward for providing high quality SDKs for your API?Llet me know how my APIWare team can help. They are willing to help you figure out the best route for providing the SDKs you need, but also help maintain them as part of the versioning, and overall roadmap for your API operatins. Even if you just need someone to talk through the pros and cons, I am here to help--let me know.</p>

<p>I have been writing some fictional stories on a project site I have called <a href="http://alternate.kinlane.com/blog/">Alternate Kin Lane</a> for some time now. Writing fictional stories in the tech space has provided a sort of pressure release valve for me, giving me a quick creative outlet throughout the week. Honestly, there are more stories in my notebook, than there are on the actual blog, but this is a sign for me that I need to spend more time working in this area.</p>
<p>I am making several shifts in my work lately, in response to kind of hitting the wall recently, a process that includes rethinking how I work on projects, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/10/27/striking-the-right-balance-with-api-evangelist-partners/">partner with folks in the API space</a>, as well as an increased focus on the fictional side of my writing. I do not just want to write fiction that is derived from the tech space. I want to write fiction that helps me formulate my own view of the space, and who knows, maybe influence the space in similar ways my regular tech blogging has over the last five years.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with the concept of design fiction, it "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_fiction">is a method of critical design that uses fictional and narrative scenarios to envision, explain and raise questions about possible futures for design and the society</a>." Up until now I was just dumping some random, crazy ideas into my fiction notebook, and taking the time to publish a few of these on Alternate Kin Lane. Now I'd like to try and bring a little closer to my daily API monitoring and research, and see if I can use to explore concepts around the tech, business, and politics of the API space--which is touching pretty much every aspect of our personal and business lives in 2015, leaving a pretty wide playing field.</p>
<p>I think some of my writing on <a href="http://alternate.apievangelist.com/blog/">Alternate API Evangelist</a> will be just as dark as some of the stuff I've written on Alternate Kin Lane, but hoping my voice will evolve, and become more nuanced with time. The medium allows me to work through some potentially volatile concepts in a hopefully safer space--meaning, it gives me a quick out with people who disagree. It is fiction! ;-) I'm hoping this helps me work through unlimited number of scenarios that apply to the API space, but also gives me a place to vent, when the tech space gets me down--which seems to be quite often lately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I want this fictional layer of my research to be tightly woven to my regular API industry research, I also want the separation between fact and fiction to be very clear. I will put the hashtag <em><strong>#apidesignfiction</strong></em> in each story title, as well has clearly stating that it is fiction on the page, like I do with Alternate Kin Lane. This way any tweets, or social shares set expectations right away, clearly showing this is a different way of exploring the API space for me--not the API space we have, but the one we might have, or maybe should have, or maybe will have if we don't get our shit together!</p>

When you think about it, if a company is selling a product or service to API providers, encouraging an API focus--they should probably have APIs. :-)</p>
<p>As I was updating some of the news, companies, and reviewing the common building blocks I have aggregated across the 20 areas of research, I just poked my head around to see if I could find an API for each service provider. There are many things that look like a language specific API, but I am looking for a clear developer / API area, with a coherent web API available, as we'd expect from API providers in 2015.</p>
<p>After spending a couple hours looking through my core research, I found the following service providers, in the follow areas, actually had web APIs available:</p>

<p>This was my first pass through all of my core research looking for APIs, so I am sure I missed some--let me know which ones I missed. My design, hypermedia, performance, monetization, evangelism, embeddable, client, SDK, visualization, and virtualization didn't have any clear leaders who had easy to find APIs. I will update as I find them--which smells like an opportunity to me.</p>
<p>Eventually I'd like to see some common definitions to be established across all these areas of the API space, but as you can see, like the rest of the API space, there is a lot of work to be done. Now that I have a list of API service providers who have APIs, I can start crafting, and aggregating API definitions for all the APIs. Once i've done this I can start looking for the overlap across them, and see if I can highlight the common patterns, and establish some bridges for the differences between them.</p>
<p>Every potential stage of the API life-cycle will have to be automated in the future, and ironically APIs will be how we do that.</p>

        <p><a href="https://securedb.co"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/secure-db-on-premise.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was talking through the features, and roadmap for <a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB</a> with their team the other day, and one of the conversations that came up was around <a href="https://securedb.co/encryption-features/">on-premise opporutnities for deploying encrypted user, data, and file APIs</a>. In my opinion, on-premise is something that has morphed from meaning "in our data center", to where wherever we store data and run our compute power--which could be spread across multiple cloud vendors.</p>
<p><a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB offers an extremely valuable API commodity in 2015, encrypted user, data, and file stores</a>--something EVERY website and mobile application should have as part of their back-end. When you have something this valuable, and potentnially ubiquitous, it needs to run wherever it is needed. With this in mind SecureDB is available on demand, as a retail API solution, but they will also deploy it for you "on-premise" on AWS or Heroku, with "more platforms in the roadmap".</p>
<p>While a wholesale, on-premise, deploy anywhere API will not be required for all APIs, as some SaaS solutions won't benefit from this type of distribution, if you are a core architectural building block, or utility APIs like SecureDB, to compete in the API economy, your API will have to deployable to anywhere it is needed. With the explosion of Docker and Kubernetes, your API should technically be able to able to be deployed in any containerized environment, with a business model, licensing, and legal framework to support the different use cases.</p>
<p>The ability to deploy your API on Heroku is just a gateway drug to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/">the wholesale, white lable, containerized, API economy</a> that is coming, where the most agile, flexible, and interoperable APIs will dominate.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRYw8VY7mFUg78AEuIbtyg"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/in-the-mood-for-http.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As you probably know, I'm always up for learning about APIs, so when <a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@Darrel_Miller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gblock">@GBlock</a> started doing their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRYw8VY7mFUg78AEuIbtyg">In the Mood for HTTP podcast</a>, I was all in. Both Darrel and Glenn are API experts, and respected leaders in the space, but more importantly both of them are super nice guys, and reflect a tone I love to experience and support across the API space.</p>
<p>The format for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRYw8VY7mFUg78AEuIbtyg">In The Mood For HTTP</a> is simple. The audience asks questions, and Darrel and Glenn discuss. They are both very graceful in how they answer questions, extremely knowledgeable on the subjects at hand, but they are also very opinionated, and they don't always agree--the exchange between them is educational, and very benefitial to the wider API community.</p>
<p>The API duo has quickly produced three episodes. I am listening to episode three as I write this post. My only critique of the podcast is I'd like to see better indexing of the episodes, with easy text version of the questions, and a link to that specific time in the Youtube videos. I'd love to have a library of these organized in a sort of API FAQ, that I can share with my readers, and reference throughout my storytelling.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore how I can get more involved, and provide some questions, and help drive their conversations. I've enjoyed doing this with <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>, and other API related podcasts that have emerged. On this note, I encourage anyone to create their own podcast in the space, and explore finding your voice when it comes to conversations in the API space. I know many voices across the space, who I hear at API conferences like <a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/APIDaysGlobal">@APIDaysGlobal</a>, which I'd like to hear in more real-time, as Darrel and Glenn are doing--if you do, I'll help support!</p>
<p>Keep up the good work you guys!</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/11/some-potentially-very-powerful-api-orchestration-with-the-amazon-api-gateway/">As I've written several posts on the recent Amazon API Gateway release</a>, one of the side things I noted about the API solution from AWS, was that API monitoring is baked in by default. As stated on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway page</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>After your API is deployed, Amazon API Gateway provides you with a dashboard to visually monitor calls to your services using Amazon CloudWatch, so you see performance metrics and information on API calls, data latency, and error rates.</em></p>
<p>This may seem like common sense to many people who have been in the API space for a while now, but for many API designers, architects, developers, and business folk who are just getting going, API monitoring may not be default for all implementations.</p>
<p>To me, AWS baking in <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a> by default, demonstrates that the world of API monitoring has matured, marking an important milestone that all API providers should pay attention to. I've been watching this space grow over the last couple years, and similar to the API management space, the AWS release reflects the overall health of the API sector.</p>
<p>If you are operating any API In 2015, monitoring should be standard operating procedure, alongside your API documentation.</p>

<p>It can be difficult to know where to start when it comes storytelling around an API. Many of us who have been in the space, have followed the lead of Twitter, Twilio, Amazon, and others, but when you are new to the space, knowing where to start can often be paralyzing. This is something I am regularly helping clients and partners think through, and while&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/">I'm thinking through the topic with SecureDB</a>, I figured I'd share the details with you my readers.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">If you are unfamiliar with how the API Evangelist network operates, I have common building blocks available for almost 20 core stops along the API lifecycle</a>. However, when many of my partners and clients are just getting going, they are often overwhelmed by the volume of data I provide, so I regularly find myself tailoring, and distilling down a specific strategy for each conversation I engage in. I wanted to help SecureDB understand where they can start with evangelism from day one, by providing a 101 list for API evangelism, but before I could do this, I needed to make sure they had a few API building blocks in place first.</p>
<p>Wait...before we got going with a 101 API evangelism list, let's make sure the most essential element is present?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong>&nbsp;- Check! Encryption for all your data in this climate is critical.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Now, let's make sure the minimum viable&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>&nbsp;are in place to support evangelism efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-boarding</strong>

<li><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- I didn't find an official org account for SecureDB, but see their developers are actively working on Github.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list personalized for SecureDB, from the numerous building blocks I've aggregated across API management and evangelism strategies I've helped craft, and gathered by watching the approach of leading API providers. This is why I partner with companies like SecureDB, so that I can move forward, and ultimately share the information I've gathered, personalized in different ways, as a regular drumbeat on my blog(aka storytelling). It helps me evolve my ideas, share them with partners and clients, as well as with you my readers.</p>
<p>This is just an example of what I do behind the scenes for my partners, and an&nbsp;<a href="http://apiware.io">example of the approach brought to the table by my APIWare partner</a>.

<p><a href="https://lockr.io/">An API key management service targeting Drupal developers came across my radar this week</a>. The service is very focused, in that it is a Drupal module, and is focused on helping Drupal developers manage the keys they use across a single app or installation, but I think it represents a potentially larger trend.</p>
<p>I think this particular solutions is just a symptom of a growing problem for developers of any type--how do you manage the number of keys you are depending on for you application(s). API consumers are in need of a plug and play way of to store, access, and manage the increasing number of API keys they put in use, otherwise we will be looking at a pretty serious security problem, adding to the existing security issues API providers and consumers face.</p>
<p>If you need evidence of the viability of API Key management solutions, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS has one</a>. Ok, why don't developer just use AWS? Well they should if it makes sense, but we also need other competing, and complimentary key management solutions, to ensure a healthy API space. Not all users are going to need full-blown IAM solutions, they just need a simple, encrypted place to put all their keys, and some utilities to help them manage them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I store my keys in a JSON config file stored in the private Github repo for any application I develop, and for each org, I have some crude API key management utilities to help me manage turnover. My server apps can cache the config file locally, and my client side apps run on Github Pages, using SSL, and Github OAuth to open up API key access they need.</p>
<p>I will be keeping an eye out for more API key management solutions, and begin the process of documenting the building blocks of these product and services, like I do with other areas. If you are looking to develop an API key management solution, feel free to reach out, as I have some feedback for your road-map along the way, and existing tools you could use to make it easier.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2015</span>
        <p>I had a follower tweet out an interesting question about successful patterns for multi-linguarl APIs, which I thought was interesting enough to share as a story, adding to my research, and helping me tune into the topic better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the API economy unfolds, and APIs make their way into more countries around the globe, the need to standardize how we internationalize different layers of our API operations is only going to increase--making these types of conversation starters very important.</p>

<p>I see two key building block that I can extract from this conversation. One being&nbsp;Accept-Language for dictating which language your API should be speaking, and two, using a query string lang= to tell your documentation what language it should be speaking. I've added both as <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API design building blocks</a>, and the documentation reference to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>I love questions like this, because it puts these topics on my radar, and after writing a post about it, and adding as some common building blocks, the chances I will explore further dramatically increases. This is the side of my research that keeps me getting up and sitting down at the pooter each day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/7/2538031/zypr-launches-voice-control-for-every-device">Shortly after the Zypr voice API came on to the scene in 2011</a>, I launched <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">my research into voice APIs</a>. Like many other areas of the API universe, voice has come in and out of focus for me, something I think will take much longer to unfold, than any of us could have ever imagined. Zypr quickly ran out of steam, and other similar solutions have come and gone over the last couple years as well, leaving my research pretty scattered across many different concepts of how voice and APIs are colliding--lacking any real coherency.</p>
<p>I took a moment last week to take a fresh look at my <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice API research</a>, because of a comment by Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), the CEO of <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. Its not an exact quote, but Steve spoke about how voice is the future of API consumption, after he had attended the AWS:Reinvent in Las Vegas. I agree with him. Voice APIs is a topic that has been significantly stimulated with the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/echo">introduction of the Amazon Echo platform</a>, but I also feel also coincides with a critical mass of available API driven resources that will deliver some of the value these platforms are promising users.</p>
<p>Voice recognition has always been something that leaves a lot to be desired--think Siri. Even with these challenges there are many dimensions to the voice API discussion, and with the amount of resources now available via simple APIs in 2015, I feel we are reaching a more fertile, and friendly time for voice solutions to return the value end-users desire. We now have a rich playing field of weather, news, stocks, image, video, podcast, and other data, content, rich media, and programmatic resources, which can be linked to specific voice commands--something we didn't have before.</p>
<p>While there is still so much work to be done, but I agree with Steve's vision, that voice will play an increasingly significant role as an API client. I would add that like mobile, or the recent wave of wearables, voice will have special constraints when it comes to API design, further requiring API providers keep their APIs simple, and reflect how users will experience them, not just being a SELECT * FROM table WHERE q = 'search', with a URL bound to it.</p>
<p>I think the API providers who are further along in their journey, will get a boost as voice evolves as an API client, and voice enabled app developers are able to easily integrate valuable API driven resources into their solutions. Even with my new found optimism about voice APIs, I still think we are years away from voice solutions actually living up to, even a small portion of the hype they seem to get over the years. Regardless, I'll be working to keep a closer eye on things, and will be sharing via <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">my voice API research</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzle-round.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been tagging companies that I come across in my research, and stories that I find with the term "orchestration" for some time now. Some of this overlaps with what we know as cloud-centric orchestration using Puppet or Chef, but I am specifically looking for how we orchestrate across the API lifecycle which I feel overlaps with cloud orchestration, but pushes into some new realms.</p>
<p>As I'm carving off my orchestration research, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/06/some-thoughts-for-the-coming-wave-of-api-hubs-garages-and-workbenches/">I am also spending time reviewing a newer breed of what I'm calling API hubs, workspaces, or garages</a>. Over the last year, I've broken out <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE research</a> from my overall <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API Discovery</a> research, and <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK</a> from my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API Management</a> research, and <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client</a> from my API Integration research. In parallel with an API-centric way of life, I want all my research to be as modular as possible, allowing me to link it together into meaningful ways that help me better understand how the space works, or could work.</p>
<p>Now that I'm thinking terms of orchestration, something that seems to be a core characteristic of these new&nbsp;API hubs, work spaces, or garages--I'm seeing a possibly new vision of the API life-cycle. I'm going to organize these new hubs, work spaces, and garages under my <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE research</a>. I am starting to believe that these new work spaces are just the next generation IDE meant to span the entire API life-cycle--we will see how this thought evolves.</p>
<p>This new approach to API IDEs gives us design, and development capabilities, but also allows us to mock and deploy APIs. You can generate API documentation, and SDKs, and I'm seeing hints of orchestration using Github and Docker. I'm seeing popular clients like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> evolve to be more like a API life-cycle IDE, and I'm also seeing API design tooling like <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a> invest in HTTP clients to expand beyond just design, adding live client interaction, testing, and other vital life-cycle elements.</p>
<p>None of my research is absolute. It is meant to help me make sense of the space, and give me a way to put news I curate, companies I discover, and open source tooling into meaningful buckets that might also help you define a meaningful version of your own API life-cycle. I apologize if this post is a little incoherent, but it is how I work through my thoughts around the API space, how things are expanding and evolving in real-time--something I hope will come into better focus in coming weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">I am keynoting APIStrat in Austin next month</a>, and it is a big deal for me. Ok, its my event, and I probably shouldn't be that excited, but it is the first time I've ever keynoted it. ;-) It is the sixth edition of APIStrat, and Steve asked if I wanted to keynote, which I dismissed because it seemed too ego, but when he pushed back, I realized that I would be stoked to keynote.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the preparation for the talk, and trying to think about how I can incorporate my research, and working API operations into it. <a href="http://defragcon.com/">I'm also keynoting Defrag the week before</a>, so both my keynotes will march in lockstep. They won't be the same keynote, but they will reflect what I'm seeing across the API space right now, allowing me to use both venues as vehhicle to move my research forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apistrat-austin-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My Defrag talk is titled, "<em>The 17 Stops Along The Modern API Lifecycle"</em>, which I'm guessing will grow as I prepare both these talks, but it will also be the same core theme of my APIStrat keynote. Over the last five years, the API space has been slowly coming into focus for me, and in 2015 I feel like I'm really starting to see some coherency in how things are working together, making for a clearer API life-cycle for me to reference.</p>
<p>Storytelling on my blog helps me work through my ideas, and doing it on stage at Defrag and APIStrat will help me organize them in a way that can benefit the entire API community. I haven't been this excited about two talks in a while, and I'm looking forward to sharing where my research has gone in 2015, on stage at two conferences I really enjoy supporting.</p>
<p>See you in Broomfield and Austin folks!</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">I started playing with the possibilities when it comes to API deployment using virtual containers like Docker early this year</a>, exploring the constraints this approach to API deployment introduced, on my own infrastructure. The process got my gears turning, when it comes to deploying very simple data, content, and algorithmic APIs into any environment that runs Docker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As 2015 has progressed, I'm seeing containers emerge as part of more stops along the API life-cycle, specifically in <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a> and <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>. A new one that just came across my radar is <a href="https://apiplug.com/">API PLUG</a>. I haven't played with the containerized API deployment solution yet, but after watching video, and looking through site it seems in line with what I'd expect to see from a next generation, containerized, API deployment solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/23/reconciling-my-api-orchestration-research-with-the-evolution-of-ide-sdk-and-http-clients/">Overlapping with my previous post on reconciling API orchestration</a>, I'm seeing several stops along API lifecycle present in API PLUG, beyond just API deployment, it allows you to design, deploy, and document your API which moves well into the world of API management. As I'm seeing with other emerging solutions like <a href="http://apistudio.io/">API Studio from Apigee</a>, I predict we will see <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">monitoring</a>, and other critical layers of the API life-cycle emerge as orchestration layers of API PLUG.</p>
<p>I've added API PLUG to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment research</a>, and I am still considering the best way to include them in other areas of my API research. I'm increasingly finding that modern API management solutions are spanning multiple areas of the API life-cycle, which further encourages me to modularize my research, but also tells me I'm going to need to create some sort of Venn Diagram visualization to help me better understand the reach of emerging API products and services.</p>
<p>Anyways, more to come on API PLUG as I play with, and listen to the stories they tell via their blog, <a href="https://twitter.com/apiplug">Twitter</a>, and Github accounts (I can only find a Twitter account, but I'm sure they are working on that! ;-).</p>

<p>Marketing your products and services in the API sector can often look very different than marketing of products and services in other sectors. Developers are a very different target audience, and to make things even more complicated, not all developers are created equal! Open developer are not like the enterprise developer, and healthcare developers won't have much in common with device-based, Internet of Things developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to market your API has been a session at every APIStrat since we did the first conference in New York City back in February of 2013, and <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">we just announced the latest edition of marketing for APIs at @APIStrat in Austin in November</a>.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">It has been a year or two since I've given any deep thought to the Twitter ecosystem</a>. There has been such little meaningful action to come out of the social platform over the last couple years, I had all but given up on it being a platform with any sort of future for developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/656885664525357056">When Jack Dorsey apologized and solicited feedback from the community this week</a>, I honestly felt I didn't have much to offer when it comes to advice--I just wasn't prepared. Twitter does almost everything right when it comes to their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">developer ecosystem</a>...well on the surface, where they do fail, is within the most critical areas of API operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>&nbsp;- Twitter communicates about the usual mundane API platform stuff, but really lacks a tone and substance that really cuts through the BS for developers. In my opinion it will take years to recover from the tone set by Dick Costolo &amp; Ryan Sarver--they just did not respect developers at all, and it showed. This isn't something you recover from quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Access &amp; Rate Limits -</strong>&nbsp;While communications around access level and rate limits have gotten much more clearer, with a dedicated area in dev portal, and available inline within documentation, it will take going the extra mile before developers feel like there is truly a level playing field. It will require more API access to account level usage, notifications, dashboards, etc. to heal these wounds--real-time communication.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model -&nbsp;</strong>There is just no clear business model evident from the developer ecosystem--something that showcases how Twitter is making money, where the API fits into this, and the opportunity for developers to play in this game. I've broken down the pricing confusion involved with using the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/06/twitter-api-integration-math-rest-api/">REST API</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/21/twitter-api-integration-math-streaming-api/">Streaming API</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/22/twitter-api-integration-math-reconciling-data-with-rest-and-streaming-apis/">tried to understand across the different levels of access</a>--even though my research is dated, the confusion still exists. There is no clarity when it comes to how I can grow my usage of Twitter (as a startup), therefore many resort to very bad behavior to make ends meet.</li>
<li><strong>Personality</strong> - There is no personality or face to the Twitter platform, thus it always defaults up the chain to current CEO. Maybe a new director of platform came on after Ryan Sarver left, but I couldn't tell you who it was. The platform needs a leader who will set the same tone Jack Dorsey is trying to set by returning to the CEO Position--Twitter needs a Jack who is specifically in charge of the platform vision, message, and will be the friendly face of the platform turnaround.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of communication, overall tone, and lack of transparency and clarity around access, rate limits, and the business model has just left a bad taste in the mouths of Twitter developers. I use the Twitter API actively as part of my business, but I would never consider building a new product that depends on the Twitter API--never, and I know many other developers feel the same.</p>
<p>I've long moved on from my utopian views of what the Twitter API could have been, there are too many powerful actors who are investors, and partners&nbsp; now for this ever to be a reality. I do not think Twitter should entertain and do business with ALL 3rd party developers, and eliminate rate limits--I am more experienced in API operations than this. However Twitter has to provide a clear ladder that developers can climb when it comes to accessing the API, ascending all the way up to partner levels, with transparency all along the way.</p>
<p>Twitter has to be communicating with the community at every step, and honestly the community needs to get better at communicating with Twitter as well. I respect the challenge that Twitter has when it comes to managing a million developers, and know these things are not easy, and it makes me happy to see Jack taking a clear stance, and reach out to the community for feedback.</p>
<p>As Jack Dorsey said, transparency is the key. Transparency around API access, rate limits, the road-map, business model, partner and developer revenue opportunities, will be critical going forward. It makes me happy to see language like "Developer Rules of the Road" finally gone from the legal side of platform operations--it was language like this that set a really bad tone for developers. I really hope Twitter can turn this corner, and&nbsp; reboot its ecosystem, as the platform plays a critical role in almost every industry, and in my opinion <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the most important API out there today</span>. i would really like to be able to showcase Twitter as a platform that all API providers should emulate once again.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just had a call with one of my newer API partners, working with them on crafting version 1.0 of their <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API evangelism strategy</a>, and the subject of what content to generate, and which channels to use, when building up their brand arose. In my work, about 90% of the approaches I see implemented by API providers is a traditional PR strategy, where you create content, and push to popular channels to do the work of syndicating the message. While this approach works, and is something I recommend you do, I have a different way of building up my brand, and the partner or community brands that I invest in.</p>
<p>All of this begins with something that truly brings value to the table for everyone involved, without this, my approach will not work. Once you have something of value, you start working directly with this value, building things, experimenting and playing, while telling the story all along the way. If it isn't something you'd use yourself, and be able to innovate with, why would you expect anyone else to. If value truly exists around products, services, and tooling associated with a brand, you will build momentum with each story you tell, eventually encouraging others to do the same.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is with the fast growing API definition Swagger. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">I started paying attention to Swagger closely in 2011</a>, and by <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/09/19/forget-being-neutral-and-objective-anymore-with-apis/">mid 2014 I had gone all in with Swagger</a>, and integrated into my own platform, and tooling, resulting in 265 stories that reference swagger over the last four years. Let me show the value driven by this type of storytelling--here are the plotting of my stories over the last four years:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-evangelist-story-swagger.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Here is a plotting of growth of the <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=swagger%20api">Swagger according to Google Trends</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/google-trends-swagger.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>This is how you build brand awareness organically. I'm not saying I'm solely responsible for Swagger's success--it all started with the value brought to the table by Tony Tam. Secondarily it was the community who ultimately <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/platform-integrations.html">integrated Swagger into their platforms</a>, <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/swagger-ui.html">used Swagger UI for displaying their API documentation</a>, and innovated in the <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">numerous other areas of API operations where the API definition format has been applied</a>. Most importantly, it has taken the storytelling of the community, about what they have done, that got us to where we are at in 2015 with the Swagger brand.</p>
<p>Along with the value brought to the table by Tony, and the community, I do feel I played a significant role in where the Swagger brand is today. I did this through building tooling with Swagger, searching out what others were doing, and telling the story all along the way. I wrote 160 stories in 2015 alone, and I did this all via my own blog. I beat this drum so loud, and so consistently, others wrote about what I was doing in top tier blogs like <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/05/kin-lane-api-commons">InfoQ</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/3scale-discounts-cost-of-managing-apis-through-nginx-open-source-server-gives-developers-access-services-quality/">TechCrunch</a>, as well as on other company and developer blogs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the power of storytelling. This isn't marketing, and isn't about products or services--it is about generating valuable exhaust around something API related, and telling the story along the way. This is something I enjoy helping API providers, and service providers understand as they try to differentiate themselves in 2015, and for a select few partners, I will be doing this around the value they bring to the table, across the API Evangelist network.</p>

<p>One layer I am working to add to my API research, are machine readable API definitions that I find, or generate from the APIs of the API service providers I keep an eye on. Within this new layer I'm aggregating these API the specs of the companies who are offering services within the emerging areas of the API sector.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/specs.html">The first area I've started aggregating is within API management</a>. 3Scale was very forward leaning with their willingness to open up their API definitions for <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">their own API management infrastructure APIs</a>. These are API specs that describe all of the features of the 3Scale API management platform, and represent one possible blueprint that API management service providers could emulate.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/specs.html">I have four separate API definitions included from 3Scale on my new page</a>, something that could be broken down further if it makes sense. I also just added a suggested API definition for API portals--crafted by the <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. They thought my idea for defining a common set of definitions across the 17+ areas I monitor was an interesting cenough oncept, and was something they wanted to explore further with me.</p>
<p>Zeeshan Ejaz Bhatti of <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> pulled together this spec:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--  .gist {width:100%; height: 200px; overflow:auto}  .gist .file-data {max-height: 200px; max-width: 500px;}  -->
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/c1b0bf18ed7f67362a78.js"></script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just one potential starting point for providing a common interface for managing your API portal. Zeeshan feels that , if "API-Portals-as-a-Service", and other API management providers agreed on a common publish API format, it would benefit other API service providers like APIMATIC who are providing services to their customers via these API portals.</p>
<p>I agree with Zeeshan, and might&nbsp;<a href="/admin/blog/api-portal.apievangelist.com">play around adding an API facade for managing your API portal using Github + Jekyll, like I do with my standard API Portal template</a>. This is all work in progress. Right now I am just aggregating the API definitions for API service providers that have APIs. In my opinion this layer of the API space will differentiate API service providers from each other, demonstrating which ones will actually scale in the fast growing the API economy.</p>
<p>Next I'm taking <a href="http://monitor.apievangelist.com">API monitoring services like Runscope and API Science</a>, and aggregate their API definitions as part of my research.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2015</span>

<p>I have used the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/usagov/Federal-Agency-Directory-API-Documentation">Federal Agency Directory API</a>&nbsp;for quite some time to lookup federal government agencies. <a href="https://www.usa.gov/developer">USA.gov has some highly valuable, and simple APIs</a> including the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/usagov/Social-Media-Registry-API-Documentation">Social Media Registry API</a>, which I find extremely useful. They recently added a new one for<a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/govt-urls.html"> searching government websites that do not end in .gov</a>.</p>
<p>The Non-.gov URLs APIs allows you to search for all websites that end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal, state, local,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usa.gov/tribes">tribal</a>, commonwealth, and territorial government agency websites</li>
<li><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/otherfrb.htm">Federal reserve banks and branches</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fhlbanks.com/">Federal home loan banks</a></li>
<li>Libraries, archives, and museums, including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/">Presidential libraries</a></li>
<li>Department of Defense websites for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defense.gov/Sites/DOD-Websites?category=Recruiting">recruiting</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defense.gov/Sites/DOD-Websites?category=Academy">service academies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.usa.gov/recreation-and-travel">Travel and tourism</a>&nbsp;websites for states and U.S. territories</li>

<li><a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21663.pdf">Government sponsored enterprises</a>&nbsp;(such as Fannie Mae) [PDF]</li>
<li>Federal and state retirement systems</li>
<li>Task forces (such as the Preventative Services Task Force) and commissions (such as the 9/11 Commission)</li>
<li>A few select, non government organizations (such as the Red Cross) and public-private partnerships</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I find the APIs coming out of USA.gov to be excellent examples of what ALL government agencies should be doing. The APIs don't have to be complicated, just provide simple read, and sometimes write access to valuable government data that should be public.</p>
<p>I am going to prioritize the creation of an API definition for USA.gov, and wrap their APIs in an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json file</a>, and add to my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/stack.html">federal API stack</a>. The more of these APIs I have at my disposal, the more efficient I am at when it comes to opening up government data, and making existing API resources available across my research.</p>

<p>I've been working on expand upon <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">my API security research</a>, but it can be difficult to find API focused security solutions. Exactly what is security when it comes to APIs can vary. Are you looking to secure your APIs? Are you looking to secure your data or content using an API? This is why I started a research projects so that I can turn on my keyword monitoring, and begin scouring the landscape in real-time--the more I conduct research in an area, the better I get at it.</p>
<p>The best part of my research is that sometimes when I write about things, companies just come to me. This happened the other week, with an encrypted database API provider called <a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB</a>. What this brand new API driven platform provides is default security for your&nbsp;accounts, data, files, and settings--exactly what we need in this cyber-insecure world we have created for ourselves.</p>
<p>I do not store any sensitive data, but if I did, I would not want to be in the business of storing it. Period! <a href="https://securedb.co/apidocs/">SecureDB gives you everything you need to manage your users account and identity, create the data stores you need, and store your appilcations files and settings in a secure environment</a>. All identity data is encrypted by default, and you get to set the encryption levels for all your data stores, allowing you to make sure everything sensitive is not readable on the server, even if it is compromised.</p>
<p>SecureDB is just getting started, but they have a lot of things in the works, including on-premise, containerized implementations, version that run on Heroku, white label solutions, and much more. I will be working with them to help them craft a marketing and storyteling strategy around their encrypted database solution, and establishing a deeper partnership between them and API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I'm pretty stoked on my ability to attract these types of API service providers just by publishing my research regularly, and talking about the areas these companies are providing solutions in. I'm just telling the first story about SecureDB to let you know they are out there, and get them established in my monitoring system, and overall research--stay tuned for much more on SecureDB, and the security solutions they provide--I couldn't think of a better time for an API like this, we are so going to need it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-lifecycle.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is up to API providers to establish a coherent approach regarding how they rollout and manage their APIs, something that historically has just involved deploying and managing, but in the last couple of years we have seen more formal approaches emerge, something we are all calling the API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, after we started standardizing our API development and management thinking using API definitions, the expansion of the API lifecycle was set into motion with the introduction of an API design-first way of thinking from the Apiary team. API definitions allowed us to get our development and management house in order, but also begin collaborating, mocking, and having a conversation around our API designs, way before we began the costly process of writing code.</p>
<p>In 2015, I am tracking on API definitions driving over 17 separate stops along this fast evolving API lifecycle. While some API providers who are further along in their API journey are incorporating all of these stops, many API providers who are just getting going, are still learning about all the stops along this modern API lifecycle. Part of this evolution is establishing just exactly what is your companies API lifecycle, something that can be a very personal thing, and we'll need more of our tooling to help us quantify this.</p>
<p>This is why I was happy to see evidence of API lifecycle management built into the tooling with the new AWS API Gateway. In my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/11/some-potentially-very-powerful-api-orchestration-with-the-amazon-api-gateway/">earlier post on the&nbsp;potentially very powerful API orchestration with the Amazon API Gateway</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Going beyond the types of integration you can employ when crafting, and deploying APIs using the Amazon API Gateway, the platform also provides a way to define stages that APIs will exist in from design, development, QA, production, or any other stage you wish. I like the concept of having a stage defined for each API, designating where it exists on the API life-cycle. I tend to just have dev and prod, but this might make me consider this a little more deeply, as it seems to be a big part of defining the API journey.</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, this is a sign of things to come. Right now it is just basically a way to tag your APIs, and define which stage of the API lifecycle they are in, but I can see see these stages being used to organize various stops along the API lifecycle, in a meaningful way for your API team. You could put testing and performance as part of your QA stage, and you can setup monitoring and security for your APIs that are in production, and much more.</p>
<p>While it is still coming into focus for me, I see the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">17+ stops along the API lifecycle</a> as something that could be organized into these various API lifecycle stages. I do not think there will be one API lifecycle blueprint to rule them all, but this new approach would allow API teams to craft their own vision, and allow them to share these blueprints for other teams to follow, either internally, or even publicly.</p>
<p>I hope we'll see more API service providers consider where they fit into the overall API lifecycle of their consumers, and provide features that helps users define what this means to their team. Maybe eventually we'll end up with a common language and tooling for helping API providers discuss and operate within a more coherent, flowing, and meaningful API lifecycle.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/13/bringing-api-building-blocks-to-life-as-the-apis-of-service-providers/">I mentioned the concept of what I call API building blocks coming to life by API service providers yesterday</a>. These are the features provided from API service providers that are made accessible via APIs. Mind blowing right? API service providers having APIs? Which then allows API providers to programmatically manage the operations of their own APIs? Who would have ever thought!! Actually it is a pretty clear example of API service providers who are kind of full of it, when they do not offer their own APIs--meaning they are telling you about the importance of APIs, but not actually practicing what they preach. It is kind of like API providers who do not use their own APIs in their applications (dogfooding).</p>
<p class="p1">Anyhoo. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">I have done a lot of work to define the common building blocks across API service providers, spanning over 17 stops along the API lifecycle</a>, and part of the next phase of my research is to connect these building blocks to actual API definitions that can help automate these vital API features. First up, <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">I took the 3Scale API, and generated this list of common building blocks represented in the API for their API infrastructure</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/adding-four-new-building-building-blocks-providing-an-api-management-api-blueprint/">I've been using a subset of the 3Scale API management API definition as my standard blueprint for other API providers should follow, for a while now</a>. All API providers should have an API for base API account management--meaning your API consumers should be able to manage their accounts, services, apps, and billing via an API. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">This will be a differentiation between API providers in the near future, and if you aren't up to speed, developers will be looking elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/24/how-open-source-api-proxies-and-other-api-services-and-tooling-can-strategically-partner/">This portion of my work is in response to a group of open source API management providers looking to encourage interoperability between their platforms, and what better way to do this than a common API management definition</a>. While not all API management solutions will have exactly the same features, if they can speak a common, API defined language, the better off the entire API space will be.</p>
<p>This is something I want to encourage across all 17+ of the API service areas I track on. I'm going to take a look at <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">API monitoring</a>, and also try to generate a common outline from definition across some of the service providers I track on. I'm using API definitions to generate these outlines, and potentially merging across multiple API service providers. If you are one of the API service providers I track on, and have an API definition, make sure I have link so I can include in thi sportion of my research.</p>

<p>Maybe I've looked at too many APIs, but I feel that APIs are very telling of the overall culture of a company. APIs that are trusting, tend to open up a full stack of APIs, including POST, PUT (or PATCH), and DELETE functionality, giving developers access to all, or nearly all functionality available via a platform.</p>
<p>I do not feel that platforms are required to open up everything, but the amount of what they open up, does tells a lot about how a company is thinking. While I find many companies are not fully up to speed on the benefits a modern API management strategy, and the control it gives you over resources and API consumers, I think many just do not trust anyone outside the firewall, and think they know best when it comes to everything.</p>
<p>APIs are not for every company, and I do not think everybody should have any API, but I do want API providers to be aware of how telling their approach will be about their motives behind having an API. You should not see this as a negative lesson, it will help you think about your company from the outside-in, this is one of the most important aspects of the API journey in my opinion.</p>
<p>A journey you should begin as soon as possible, if you think you can make it work in a positive way.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/mars-rover-photo.JPG" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>NASA just launched two new APIs, <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/">as part of their open data efforts</a>. I find the APIs they offer to be simple, and very inspirational examples of what an API can be. Maybe I just love space, but seeing these well designed, very fun APIs out of our countries space agency is just cool.</p>
<p>They added a <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS">Near Earth Asteroids API</a>, and a <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos">Mars Rover Photos API</a>, <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/blog/mars-photos-and-asteroids-are-just-get-request-away/">and they also understand the value of telling the story of the release on their blog</a>. Remember API providers, if you launch an API in the woods and don't blog about, nobody will know about it--storytelling is one of the most important tools in your toolbox.</p>
<p>Also, your APIs don't have to be complicated, and overthought. Just providing GET access to interesting images and other content like NASA is doing can really go a long ways in generating attention (it got me to write a blog post). You can see this in action with both their APIs, and their approach to their API portal--I look forward to seeing what APIs they release next!</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/22/converting-between-the-popular-api-definition-formats-using-api-transformer/">I wrote about the ability to convert between multiple API definition formats using API Transformer</a>&nbsp;the other day, a solution being developed by the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> team, and shortly after posting, the <a href="https://lucybot.com/">LucyBot</a> team pointed out they are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/22/converting-between-the-popular-api-definition-formats-using-api-transformer/">working on a similar tool</a>. This is one of the reason I try to write these posts, it always brings folks out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>It is good to see multiple efforts out there. Converting of API definition formats is a fast growing need for both API providers and consumers, something that is only going to grow with the adoption of popular API definition formats. I feel it is a healthy sign that standard tooling for converting common API has emerged, and an even better sign that there will be a diverse selection in this tooling.</p>
<p>It looks like the <a href="https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter">Lucybot converter</a> is a little behind <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>, but I'm sure they will get caught up soon. I'm eager to see how these API definition conversion service providers keep up with each version of API definitions as they evolve, as well as new players who enter the game. If they can do successfully they will possess some very valuable data around which API definitions are being put to use by API providers and consumers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you have followed my work since 2010, you know <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I pull out what I call the common building blocks of originally just API management</a>, but over the last five years <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">this has grown to 17 areas of the API life-cycle</a>. My goal is to better understand the common features offered by API service providers, but only the ones that will also matter to API consumers at the same time.</p>
<p>In the last couple months I started tracking on how these API building blocks match to actual APIs offered by the API service providers I monitor. What do I mean? Well, when you consider <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">the common building blocks offered offered by API management providers</a>, these building blocks come to life when you look at<a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs"> the API offered by 3Scale</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api">Moving down the lifecylce, you can see this in action with the Runscope API in the area of API monitoring</a>. The RunScope API allows API providers and consumers to realize <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a> and testing in a programmatic way, going beyond the web interface they provide to their users. While the features available via RunScope, and via the APIs are not a one to one match, they represent a very important start.</p>
<p>This is where API providers become API consumers, accessing common building blocks they will need to operate their platform. This is also where API providers practice what they preach, and also become API providers, in addition to just selling services to API providers--an important distinction that separate the API service providers who are further along in their journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/03/api-service-providers-need-to-decouple-the-services-they-offer-to-api-providers/">If you are an API service provider, and do not offer an API to your customers, matching as many of the features available in your interface</a>, my prediction is you won't last long in the current fast moving landscape.</p>

<p>One of the things that really bothers me in the API space is when API service providers are too competitive, establish silos, don't use APIs themselves, and refuse to provide interoperability with other service providers. It is the API space y'all, this shit needs to work together, if we expect anyone to buy into what we are selling--if you aren't confident of the product you are selling, you probably shouldn't be in business.</p>
<p>This is why it makes me happy to see the work 3Scale has done in integrating their own API infrastructure with AWS API infrastructure. <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/10/new-aws-api-gateway-integration-with-3scale-api-management/">You can find the details of the integration opportunity over at 3Scale</a>, but I want to focus on the subject of API service providers working together, even if it is externally augmented like 3Scale did, as opposed to formal partnership.</p>
<p>Within weeks of AWS launching their API Gateway, the 3Scale team was not only unfazed by the potential competition from the cloud giant, they immediately got to work understanding how their own infrastructure could compliment the offering. There is an overlap between the AWS API Gateway, and 3Scale infrastructure, but both platforms bring an immense amount of value to the table, and it is very forward thinking of their team to see this, rather than just sit around worrying about what AWS would do to their business.</p>
<p>3Scale has an eight year head start when it comes to API management, and AWS brings some serious API deployment power to the table with their new Lambda platform. What 3Scale has done, represents how API service providers should behave in the industry. I have lots of experience in trying to get API service providers to work together, and participate in a conversation on stage at events, something that can like getting a group of toddlers to play together.</p>
<p>To me, what 3Scale is doing demonstrate their confidence in the infrastructure they are selling. I saw a number of folks on Twitter highlight what a bad omen it was for API deployment and management service providers, when AWS released their API gateway solution. While it does have significant implications when it comes to the industry, I think the negative impact will be felt by the API service providers who really don't have something of value to offer, and companies like 3Scale who do, will be just fine.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-defensive-tactics.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I add each <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">API to my stack</a>, I consider security along the way. I require an API key to access all of my APIs using my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API management infrastructure</a>, and I also have different tiers of access, and while defining this management layer my first impulse is always put POST, PUT, and DELETE methods into the most trusted tiers.</p>
<p>The service composition layer in API management is where I feel the heart of API is--the thing that makes it different than SOA, and other approaches. This is where you can loosen things up, trust your 3rd party developers, and allow serendipity to occur. If you always default to locking things down, and only allowing the updating of resources by internal, or just trusted external sources, you are limiting the possibilities.</p>
<p>With this in mind I'm carefully evaluating a couple of defensive API management tactics I can employ:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notifications -</strong> Make sure and send out an email or push notification to myself when POST, PUT, and DELETE are executed on certain APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Key Locking -</strong> Allow for a certain amount of POST, PUT, and DELETE, but when you go over a certain volume, it locks your API key.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these tactics won't prevent all bad situations, it can help me quickly identify them, and take action. My goal is to encourage people to develop on top of my APIs, and I'd rather focus on letting things flow, over locking everything down. There are certain security realities surrounding publicly available APIs, but honestly most people will never take the time to register for key, and learn a system just so they can do malicious things, and for the ones that will, I have some defensive things in place to trip them up.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools built into my 3Scale API infrastructure that do this for me, what I am considering are some additional measures I can build into my own API, that employ <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">the 3Scale API</a> to better automate some of these defensive tactics. What are you doing to keep things safe, but also open? I'd love to hear other ideas for operating an API on the open Internet, in the safest, most sensible way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-vice.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been getting demos of some pretty interesting new work spaces meant for API architects, and designers. Examples of this are <a href="http://apigarage.com/">API Garage</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reprezen.com/">RepreZen API Studio</a>, and the recent <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a>. These are just some of the API life-cycle solutions I'm seeing emerge recently, where companies are trying to provide API design, development, and deployment solutions in a single, tidy, work space.</p>
<p>Now that the API life-cycle has expanded beyond just API management, deployment, and design, into testing, monitoring, security, and beyond, I predict these types of API work-spaces that span multiple stops along the API life-cycle will become common place. To help prime the pump, and ensure there will be more viable products launched, I wanted to share a few thoughts on what these solution providers should consider as part of their offerings.</p>
<p>Here are some of my scribbles while drinking an IPA at my local bar:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions -</strong> Speak Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other common API definition formats, and allow for the importing and exporting of them at every step.</li>
<li><strong>Provide APIs -</strong> Make sure you provide APIs to all the functionality available within the workspace -- paying the whole API thing forward.</li>
<li><strong>Consume APIs -</strong> Make sure you allow the consumption of APIs, from within the interface, either as part of http client, or add-ons.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-in Framework -</strong> Allow some sort of extensibility of the work space, allowing 3rd parties to augment the platform via plugins.</li>
<li><strong>Play Well With Others -</strong> Please play nice with other service providers, all of this works because of interoperability, and I should be able to use the services I need via my work space.</li>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> Provide a comprehensive search, allowing me to discovery across everything I do within a work space, via a comprehensive history</li>
<li><strong>Notebook -</strong> Give me a notebook for storing my work, draft APIs, and other items I gather through my work, allowing me to come back and re-use work from the past.</li>
<li><strong>Use Github -</strong> Make sure Github is a first class citizen within the workspace, allowing me to import, and publish all my work to Github -- think orchestration, not just import and publish.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Developer Friendly </strong>- Make sure tht the work space isn't just for developers, and anyone can come in and participate throughout the API life-cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a HTTP Client -</strong> Make sure there is a built-in, or embeddable HTTP client, so get building one, partner with existing, or acquire one you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of my thoughts as I received a demo of one API work space, and was reading about a couple of other new products. After scribbling these thoughts, I sat back, drank a another pint of IPA, and contemplated the role of these types of work spaces in the future of the API industry. I predict there will be a wave of these API work spaces emerge in coming months, providing their own take on exactly what the API life-cycle looks like, and want to help developers standardize and be successful.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to playing with all the new work space, and hoping there will be at least one to emerge that suits my unique needs as the API Evangelist. I will need all of the elements listed above, or I probably won't be working in there full-time. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tony-kin-swaggerhub.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I received a personal demo of the new <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a> from Mr. Swagger himself -- Tony Tam, this last week. SwaggerHub is a new API life-cycle hub, centered around the API definition format, developed by the SmartBear Swagger team. The new hub brings together all of the Swagger tooling into a single, collaborative web application, that allows you to manage API definitions through varioius stages of the API life-cycle.</p>
<p>SwaggerHub lets you import and export your JSON or YAML Swagger definitions, giving you an environment for storing, searching, versioning, and collaborating around the definitions. Using the platform, you can edit Swagger definitions using Swagger Editor, generate server and client side code with Swagger CodeGen, and play with the API using Swagger UI--all wrapped in this new versioned and collaborative API design environment.</p>
<p>After importing a handful of my APIs into SwaggerHub, it feels like a solution to help me manage the central truth that are my API definitions, allowing me to bring other people into the process, and generate the code and docs that will be needed at other stops along the API life-cycle. I'm assuming that other stops like testing, monitoring, and virtualization will emerge in future iterations of SwaggerHub.</p>
<p>SwaggerHub works well for API definition centralization, collaboration, and management, but some of the publishing of docs, server and client code didn't work as I'd expect them. There is Github integration for logging into SwaggerHub, and a "Github Push" feature, which I couldn't get to work, so I'm assuming the publishing and orchestration around APIs will only improve -- something I'm really interested in, because I use Github to manage all aspects of APIs life-cycle.</p>
<p>I like what I see so far in the <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a>, and see hints of the future with Docker image references, an API behind the platform, and I know there is APIs.json goodness right behind the surface. For now, I will just keep importing my designs into SwaggerHub, keep playing with, and seeing where Tony and the team takes the new API collaboration destination.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/09/29/a-review-of-the-callfire-communication-platform/">A Review of The CallFire Communication Platform</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-logo.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This is a review of the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">communication API platform CallFire</a>, crafting a snapshot of platform operations, from an external viewpoint, providing the CallFire platform team with a fresh take on their API from the outside-in. The criteria applied in this review is gathered from looking at the API operations across thousands of API providers, and aggregating best practices, into a single, distilled review process.</p>
<p>This review has been commissioned by CallFire, but as anyone who's paid me for a review knows, money doesn't equal a favorable review&mdash;I tell it like I see it. My objective is to help CallFire see their platform through a different sense, as developers might see their platform. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees, and I find the API review is a great way to help API providers see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I prefer to share my API reviews in a narrative format, walking through each of the important aspect of API management, telling the story of what I see, and what I don't see. Here is the story of what I found while reviewing the communication API platform for CallFire.</p>
<p><strong>Overview<br /></strong>CallFire makes for an easier review than some API operations, because the API is the product. As soon as you land on the homepage of the website, you begin your API journey as a potential API consumer. The first thing you read is "Over 2 Billion Messages Delivered&rdquo;, so you immediately understand what CallFire does, and the next thing that grabs your eye is &ldquo;Signup For Free&rdquo;&mdash;way to not miss a beat, CallFire.</p>
<p>Next you see five simple icons, with simple text, breaking what CallFire does down: Text Messaging, Call Tracking, Video Broadcast, Cloud Call Center, IVR. Within the first five seconds you fully understand what is being offered, and given the opportunity to sign up. If that is not enough, you are also told the reasons why: Engage Your Customers, Save Valuable Time, Increase Revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-home-page.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>After you look at thousands of APIs, nothing is more frustrating than to have to figure out what an API does. CallFire gives me what I need, in five seconds or less, without clicking or scrolling. This is the way all APIs should be, if not the homepage of website, then the landing page of the API developer portal. The main page of the CallFire website is well designed, and organized in a simple, and robust way, giving you one-click access to everything you need to get going with the platform--no other feedback required.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoints</strong><br />This is the part of the review I dive into the actual design of the API, and provide some feedback on the technical endpoints of the APIs themselves. CallFire is unique because it has a REST and a SOAP version of the API available, which I think is important in today's business climate, where APIs are targeting open developers, as well as those within the enterprise.</p>
<p>The CallFire API is very robust, with wide range of endpoints / methods for the most basic text and call features, all the way up to campaign, subscription, and contact management. You can tell the system is well thought out, providing a full suite of communication resources for all types of developers.</p>
<p>On you dig into the REST API you begin to see quite a bit of SOAP residue, and while the API has a well thought out list of endpoints, many elements of the parameters, requests, and responses feel SOAPy, including the XML responses. There is also a lack of consistent response codes, and defined data model, giving the REST API an unfinished, empty bottom feeling.</p>
<p>Overall I give the API a solid B in that it is a very robust stack, but I'd say it needs some hard use, and integrations before some of the rough edges are hammered off, parameters become more intuitive, and request and response structures normalize. Much of this just comes with usage, and requires getting closer to real world use cases, end users, before it becomes more of an experience based design vs. the resource based design it currently is.</p>
<p>I could easily go through the entire Swagger definition for CallFire and make recommendations on naming conventions, and help craft the resource definitions for the underlying data models, but this is best worked out with the community, iterating, and communicating with developers, and learning more about truly what they need. Think of it as kiln firing of the API, through developer execution, and robust platform feedback loops.</p>
<p><strong>On-Boarding</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API was frictionless. I went one click from home page, authenticated with my Google Account, and immediately I was dropped into my account dashboard, with a helpful intro screen showing me where things are. I easily found the area in my account to add an application, and get my API keys, then stumbled into the overview of how to activate your account as well&mdash;account management was intuitive.</p>
<p>The intuitive and informative CallFire home page made the API easy to find, and with frictionless account signup, and a standard API app management, I was ready to make my first call on the API within 10 minutes. The only thing I would consider adding as part of the process, is an option for signup and login using my Github credentials, in addition to Facebook, and Google.</p>
<p>On-boarding with an API is often the most frustrating part of API integration, and it wasn't something I worried about at all with CallFire. The process was intuitive, smooth, and didn't leave me trying to understand what the API does, and how I am supposed to make it work. Solid A on the on-boarding process for the CallFire API.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/api-documentation/rest/version/1.1"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-api-documentation.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br />Documentation is one of the most critical aspects of API integration, making or breaking many integration efforts by developers. CallFire has double duty, in that it needs to provide documentation for the REST and SOAP version. Somethig CallFire manages to deliver with no problem, providing clean, easy to follow documentation for both APIs they offer.</p>
<p>The SOAP API document provides a simple breakdown of operations and methods, with easy to follow descriptions for everything. Ultimately the SDKs do most of the heavy lifting here, but the SOAP docs provide a nice overview of the CallFire platform.</p>
<p>The REST API for CallFire is defined using the machine readable API definition format Swagger, and uses Swagger UI to generate documentation, making learning about the API more interactive. Swagger provides a machine readable overview of the CallFire API, and is an approach to delivering API documentation that keeps pace with modern approaches.</p>
<p>I do not have much feedback for the documentation side of CallFire, I'd like to see more information about the underlying data model described in the Swagger definition, as well more detail about the response codes, but I give the platform documentation a solid B for being simple, clean, and complete--the API just needs some hardening, and the documentation will improve.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API is frictionless, and adding an app, and finding your API keys are intuitive enough. The platform also provides a nice overview on how to enable the API on your CallFire account, but ultimately the topic of authentication is neglected.</p>
<p>Authentication for SOAP interactions, and REST for that matter, are abstracted away by each of the SDKs. However one of the elements of RESTful APIs is that authentication should be clearly defined as part of the documentation. I suggest adding a page, or section on an existing page that is dedicated authentication, explaining the BasicAuth used to secure the CallFire API. For any experienced API consumer it isn't difficult navigate, but the app manager with login and password, has appearance that it may be app key via a header or parameter, not BasicAuth--a dedicated authentication overview page would help clear up.</p>
<p>As part of authentication review I do not usually advocate for a specific authentication approach, when the choices are BasicAuth, or using the app id and keys in the header or parameters. The best option is to pick one, be consistent, and explain it clearly, on a page that stands out. Overall the authentication for CallFire is intuitive, it just needs a little bit of information to makes things 100% clear when you first find yourself making that first API call.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Since I wrote this review, and the time of publishing, <a href="https://answers.callfire.com/hc/en-us/articles/205407787-Authentication">CallFire has updated their portal to include a well formed authentication overview for the platform</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Code</strong><br />After documentation, code samples, libraries, and SDKs are key to a painless API integration. For the CallFire API, there are only two SDKs available currently, for the PHP, and .NET platforms. It is common that platforms who are just getting going, only have a handful of SDKs in specific language, and is forgivable, but is also a sign of platform immaturity (aka lots of work still to be done).</p>
<p>Another aspect of SDK design for CallFire, that I'd like to bring up, is the cohabitation of REST and SOAP in a single SDK. I'm not sure this type of cross pollination is ideal for all integrations. Maybe it is just my architectural style, but I like seeing each SDK be as smallest possible footprint as possible, and meet the needs of developers without any extraneous bloat.</p>
<p>CallFire needs to have Python, Ruby, Java, Node.Js, Go, and JavaScript language SDKs to be able to serve as wide as possible audience as we possibly can. To help achieve this I recommend soliciting the help of platform users, or even paying a 3rd party developer to build SDKs, if needed.</p>
<p>Moving beyond SDKs, into what I call Platform Development Kits (PDK), CallFire does well in providing two distinct platform plugins for WordPress and Drupal. I recommend bringing these PDKs to the surface, and showcase them in a full SDK and PDK showcase page&mdash;showing what is possible. &nbsp;Maybe even considering the next step, of what is the 3rd PDK that could be developed? SalesForce? Heroku?</p>
<p>The usage of Github by CallFire is another important signal, showing the platform is progressive, and something that developers can depend on. I recommend further bringing Github into the site, linking to accounts, providing direct links to SDK and PDK repositories from an official page, and add Github authentication for developers to be able to create and manage their accounts. Github isn't just about code, it is a potentially important social layer to the CallFire API ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong><br />There really is no evidence of any mobile SDKs, or information for mobile developers available on the CallFire platform. It is common to find entire sections dedicated to mobile developers, or at least links to mobile platform specific code libraries. I recommend establishing a mobile focused section of the platform, and invest the resources necessary to help developers build iOS, Android, and Windows mobile applications using CallFire.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br />CallFire is doing well on the support front, providing building blocks for both direct, and self-service support. I like to see a mix of support services that developers can find on their own, getting the help they need 24/7, but they also need to be able to get direct support when they get stuck.</p>
<p>When it comes to direct support, CallFire is rocking it, with a support email, live chat, phone number, contact form, and ticketing system tied to your account messaging area. The only additional things I could recommend CallFire offering is paid support plans, allowing developers to pay for one-on-one support via chat, online hangout, or other means.</p>
<p>With self-service support, there is the CallFire FAQ, which I'd call more a knowledgeable than a simple FAQ, providing a wealth of knowledge about the platform. The only common element I see missing is more of a community element with a forum, or usage of Stack Overflow to engage with the wider developer community. &nbsp;The current FAQ is very robust, and with the integrated ticketing system, the potential is great, but it is all missing that community piece.</p>
<p>Overall, CallFire support is as robust as you'd expect from any API platform. When you combine with the social media presence the platform has, that I'll cover as part of the communication strategy, the platform has all of its bases covered. A+ on support effort.</p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong><br />When it comes to my review criteria for communications, other than a newsletter, CallFire nailed everyone of them. The platform has all of the expected social media platforms, has an active blog with RSS feed, and is very accessible with email, phone, and chat. All of this sends the right signals to the community, and potential API consumers, that someone is home. I have nothing to contribute when it comes to communications, as long as all channels are kept active, CallFire is doing everything it can in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Change Practices</strong><br />As platform providers, we are asking developers to depend on us, and integrate our resources into their applications, and businesses. That is asking a lot, and we need to provide as much information as possible about what the future hold, to hlep build trust with developers. There a handful of proven ways for doing this, established by leading API platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - API roadmaps are usually a simple, bulleted list, derived from the APIs own internal roadmap, showing what the future holds for the platform. Transparency around an APIs roadmap is a tough balance, since you don't want to give away too much, alerting your competitors, but your developer ecosystem needs to know what is next.</li>
<li><strong>Status Dashboard -</strong> Status dashboards are a common way for API platforms to communicate the availability of an API, but also show the track record of a platform, helping developers understand the track record for an API they are to integrate with. There are several simple services, that help API providers do this, without investment in new tools and systems.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log - </strong>Knowing the past is a big part of understanding where things are in store for the future. A change log should work in sync with the API roadmap building block, but provide much more detailed information about changes that have occurred with an API. Developers will not always pay attention to announced updates, but can use a change log as a guide for deciding what changes they need to make in their applications and how they will use an API.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Sharing the change history of a platform, a roadmap to the future, and a status of API operations at the moment go a long way in help build trust with developers. Transparency in the development of any platform, is essential in helping developers feel comfortable that a platform will be around to support their needs, and is worthy of their time.</p>

<p><strong>Business Model</strong><br />When reviewing APIs, the overall business model is usually one of the most incomplete aspects of operations, in my experience. This is ok, as many platforms are still figuring this out, however this is not the case with CallFire. The business model for the platform isn't just well defined, it provides me with an example to use when helping other API providers visualize what is possible.</p>
<p>The pricing page for CallFire is clean, well thought out, and provides sensibles tiers of operation, with clear units of measurement, letting me know what I get for each level. I can easily upgrade the access tier directly from my account settings, and I can get volume pricing if needed. This is how APIs should work, allowing me to easily calculate what I'll need, and figure out which tier I will be operating within, complete with a self-service option for scaling as I need, paying for what I use, as I go.</p>
<p>The billing management and credit system for CallFire is superior to most of even the most thought out API billing and pricing models. It is clean, well thought out, and makes sense from a user perspective&mdash;which is the most important aspect. I'll be using CallFire credit system as a reference when I talk about how the platforms should build tooling that supports the underlying API business model.</p>
<p>I can't articulate enough, how well done the business model, pricing, supporting billing and the other business elements of the CallFire API.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong><br />When it comes to available support resources, it is another area CallFire does very well. The platform has heavily invested in case studies, videos, webinars, and a tour of the platform. They even have a communications and marketing glossary developers can use to get up to speed. CallFire does a good job of providing valuable resources to get developers quickly understand all aspects of platform operations..</p>
<p>A couple of areas I could provide suggestions for improvement, in is when it comes to more industry level white papers, and when the evangelism side of things kicks in maybe consider posting slide decks from events CallFire presents at, as well as a calendar of interesting events. These things will happen I'm sure once an API evangelism strategy is kicked into full gear, but for now just keep doing more of the same--providing lots of rich resources for devs.</p>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br />I'd file R&amp;D in the same category as mobile, non-existent. API ecosystem are essentially external R&amp;D labels for companies, and general operations are about exploring ideas of what can be build with an API, but it helps to have some element available to stimulate overall R&amp;D via the platform.</p>
<p>Some of these elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea Showcase - A place the community can share ideas of what could be built with the CallFire platform.</li>
<li>Labs Environment - A workbench showing what CallFire is working on when it comes to their own integration.</li>
<li>Opportunities - Available opportunities to build things like SDKs, PDKs, or specific projects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>These are just three things that help stimulate the innovation around an API. Sometimes developers just need something to spark the imagination, or possibly see an existing labs project to help them see something in their own work. These rich R&amp;D environments can provide a great opportunity to help meet the needs of CallFire, and its partners.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department</strong><br />CallFire has the requisite Terms of Service (TOS), and privacy policy. I'm not a lawyer, so i'm not going to parse all of the details of each. There was nothing that raised my TOS alarms too significantly, the TOS were pretty standard, and the privacy policy didn't raise any huge privacy concerns as well I wouldn't have any problems integrating my own platform and business into CallFire.</p>
<p>A couple of items I'd recommend also considering, based upon what I seen on other platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code License - </strong>The PHP SDK has an MIT license, but the .NET didn't have anything. A centralized code licensing page could help as well.</li>
<li><strong>API License -</strong> A license for the API itself, applied to the REST API interface that is defined by Swagger, using API Commons format.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA) - </strong>Provide a service level agreement for API consumers to take advantage of, and understand service level commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Branding -</strong> There are no branding or style guidelines with support resources like logos, etc&mdash;missed opportunity for spreading word, and steering developers in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Just a couple of things to think about. All of these would go a long way in building trust with developers, and the branding thing is a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. When you bundle these with the TOS, privacy, and compliance information already provided by the platform, it would round off the legal department of the CallFire API nicely.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong><br />Embeddable tooling is another area that is non-existent for the CallFire API. There are no embeddable tools like widgets, buttons, etc that allow the average end-user, and developer to put the API to use in web pages, and applications. I'm not sure what an embeddable suite of tools would look like for CallFire, that would need to be a separate brainstorming process.</p>
<p>When it comes to communication platforms, especially ones involving media, and deep social interactions, embeddable tools are a proven way to grow platform, expand the network effect, and potentially bring in new developers. I recommend including an embeddable section to the site, with a handful of embeddable tooling to compliment the SDK and PDK resources already available.</p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong><br />One area I consider when looking through API operations, is the environment itself. By default many APIs are live, ready for production use, but increasingly platforms are employing alternate environments for development, QA, and potentially variant product environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - With the sensitive information available via many APIs, providing developers a sandbox environment to develop and test their code might be wise idea. Sandboxes environments will increase the overall cost of an API deployment, but can reduce headaches for developers and can significantly reduce support overhead. Consider the value of a sandbox when planning an API.</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - When planning an API, consider if all deployments need to have access to live data in real-time or there is the need to require developers to request for separate production access for their API applications. In line with the sandbox building block, a separate API production environment can make for a much healthier API ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Simulator</strong> - Providing an environment where developers can find existing profiles, templates or other collections of data, as well as sequence for simulating a particular experience via an API platform. While this is emerging as critical building block for Internet of Thing APIs, it is something other API providers have been doing to help onboard new users.</li>
<li><strong>Templates</strong> - Predefined templates of operation, when a new environment is setup, either sandbox, production, or simulator, it can be pre-populated with data, and other configuration, making it more useful to developers. These templates can be used throughout the API lifecycle from development, QA, all the way to simulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>This approach to delivering an environment for the CallFire API is not essential, but I could see it providing some interesting scenarios for communication campaigns, and the deployment of messaging infrastructure in a containerized, Internet of Things rich environment. Deployment CallFire communication infrastructure should be as flexible as possible to support the next generation of Internet enabled communication, both in the cloud and on-premise.</p>
<p><strong>Developers</strong><br />An often overlooked aspect of API operations is the tools provided to API consumers. CallFire is in a fortunate position as the API is core to their product, and the API integration is an extension of a primary CallFire user account. The account area for CallFire is well done, clean, and gives users, and those who choose to be API consumers, quite a bit of control over their communication infrastructure.</p>
<p>CallFire nailed almost every API account area I like to see in any API platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Dashboard - </strong>The dashboard for CallFire account is well done, and information.</li>
<li><strong>Account Settings - </strong>CallFire provides a high level of control over account settings.</li>
<li><strong>Reset Password -</strong> Resetting password is important, and I like to highlight separately.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - The app management for CallFire is on par with rest of industry.</li>
<li><strong>Service Tiers -</strong> The ability to change service tier, and scale is pretty significant.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - An import part of the communication and support strategy of platform.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> &nbsp;- Essential to the economy portion of platform operations, well executed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of areas I'd like to see, to round off developer account operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Authentication -</strong> It would fit nicely with Facebook, and Google Auth--I prefer authenticating for APIs with my Github.</li>
<li><strong>Delete Account - </strong>Maybe it is in there, but I couldn't find it. The ability to delete an account is important in my book.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Logs &amp; Analytics -</strong> I'd like to see application specific analytics like on the dashboard, showing usage per app.</li>
<li><strong>Account API -</strong> Allow API access to all account operations, allowing access to account settings, usage limits, billing, messaging and other areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The CallFire account management for users and developers is much more robust than I see in many of the APIs I review. Like I said before the monetization portion is something to be showcased, and all the most important aspects of account management for API operations are present. It wouldn't take much to round off with a couple more features, some more analytics, and an account management API would really take things to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong><br />I always enjoy when I come find consistent design, and function across API operations. This is what I found with CallFire. The API isn't an afterthought like other platforms, it is their product, and the site design, messaging, and content are consistent across the platform.</p>
<p>The API design is consistent, and the supporting documentation is as well. The only thing I'd add is design patterns across the SOAP and REST API should be less consistent, and stay true to their own design constraints. The details of the REST could be tightened, to be more consistent in how parameters are formed, and response formats, and error code are commonly presented.</p>
<p>Usually when reviewing APIs, I look for fractures between API operations, like clunky UI between website sections, or incomplete documentation, often created by disparate teams. This doesn't exist with CallFire, and while there are many details that could be cleaned up, the consistency is all there.</p>
<p><strong>Openness</strong><br />This is a term thrown around a lot in the space, and very seldom do sites live up to it. There are many things that contribute to whether or not an API is truly open. CallFire delivers on all of the important areas, making open a word I'd apply to CallFire.</p>
<p>First on-boarding for the platform frictionless, and everything is self-service, even scaling your account when you need more credits. You have control over your account, and the terms of service and privacy policy are liberal. These are all hallmarks of an open API. Add the ability to delete my account, I'm 100% on board.</p>
<p>One of the things I think heavily contribute to the openness of the CallFire platform is the business model. The monetization strategy is well formed, with pricing and service tiers well defined. You know what things cost, and how to get what you need. This type of approach eliminates the need for other extraneous rate list, or restrictions&mdash;this type of balance is important to truly achieving openness.</p>
<p>After this review I'd call CallFire an open API, but only time will tell, if the platform is also stable, support channels are truly supportive, and other aspects of open that only CallFire can deliver on. For right now I consider them open for business, and open for developers, but ultimately whether or not CallFire is willing to share this review, will put the exclamation on the platform openness definition, won't it! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Evangelism</strong><br />The usual footprint you'd see when an API platform has an active evangelism program doesn't exist for CallFire, but that is part of the motivation of this review. We are looking to take a snapshot of where &nbsp;the platform is at, in hopes of providing much needed input for the roadmap, as well as establish a version 1.0 evangelism strategy--we will revisit the evangelism portion of this review in a couple months.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In short, the CallFire passes my review. There are several key areas like mobile, and roadmap communication, that are missing from the platform entirely, but then there are other areas CallFire nails almost every one of my review criteria. The API is robust, the documentation is complete, and they provide all the essential support building blocks.</p>
<p>One of the things that really stand out for me is the CallFire business model, something that I think really cuts through the BS of many APIs I look at. CallFire has a clear business model, and the tools to manage your API usage. There is no grey area with the business of model for CallFire, which is something I just don't see a lot of.</p>
<p>I'd say my biggest concern with the platform is the lack of diverse code resources. I can't tell if they are just getting going, or maybe the lack of developer skills is slowing the diversity of available coding resources--I am just not sure. My guess is their is a lack of diverse developer skills on staff, which explains the lack of mobile SDKs, and the SOAP residue on the REST API. My advice is to invest in the developer resources necessary to load the platform up with a wide variety of coding resources that developers can put to work in their projects.</p>
<p>Beyond the code resources, it is really just a bunch smaller items that would bring the platform into better form. CallFire definitely reflects everything I'm looking for in an API platform, and is something I've included in the top APIs I track on as part of my API Stack. Additionally, I've gathered a couple of other stories while doing this review, including the overall monetization strategy, the notification system under account settings, and their usage of Swagger&mdash;which is always another good sign of a healthy platform, and a positive review.</p>
<p>Lots going on with the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">CallFire platform</a>, I recommend taking a look at what they are up to.</p>
<p><em>This was a paid review of the CallFire platform, if you'd like to schedule a review of your platform, <a href="mailto: info@apievangelist.com">please contact me</a>, and we'll see if I can make time. &nbsp;A paid review does not equal a good review. it is my goal to give as critical, and constructive feedback as I can to help API providers enhance their roadmap and better serve their consumers.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/four-new-apis.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a whole bunch of APIs I want to deploy. There is a queue of APIs that I will never get to, but I can't help myself, and when I am tired of watching what everyone else is doing, and want to get busy actually building things, I crack open my queue of ideas. This weekend I launched four new APIs, that will be in the service of some very different objectives that I have.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">Low Hanging Fruit</a></strong> - Identifying the potential CSV, XLS, XML, and table resources that exist in any domain, and publish them to Github as a list for deploying as APIs - aka the low hanging fruit.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.tsa.report/">TSA.Report</a></strong> - A simple form for submitting your thoughts as you are going through the airport line.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.apis.how/">APIs.How</a></strong> - The URL shoretner for the API Evangelist and Kin Lane network--getting off Bitly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.magnetic.jargon.kinlane.com/">Magnetic Jargon</a></strong> - A dictionary creation API, allowing the building of word lists to use for a magnetic fridge web and mobile app I am building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these APIs have a specific purpose. Low Hanging Fruit, and APIs.how are both very back-end system tools, where TSA.Report and Magnetic Jargon are meant to drive simple web and mobile applications. The purpose of these applications are not the point of this story, the minimum viable existence of these four new APis is what I want to talk about.</p>
<p>These four APIs are far from complete. I anticipate that TSA.Report and Magnetic.Jargon will evolve based upon the apps that are developed on them, but Low Hanging Fruit and APIs.How are core to how I do business, and will continue to evolve as far as I can afford to scale them (ie how many sites and links I can index).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal this weekend, is to just get the APIs up and running. Their overall relevance and productivity in my world will be decided by their roadmap. I just needed to establish them as a real project, and get a mimum viable definition up and running. Here is what defines a minimum viable API in my world right now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API</strong> - One or many endpoints that serve data, content, or other resources via one of my domains.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - A JSON definition of the surface area, and underlying data model for any API I provide.</li>
<li><strong>API Blueprint -</strong> A markdown&nbsp;definition of the surface area, and underlying data model for any API I provide.</li>
<li><strong>Postman </strong>- A Postman Collection allowing anyone to quickly deploy an API in a Postman Client.</li>
<li><strong>API Science Monitor </strong>- At least one monitor of one of the endpoints, acknowledging it is up and running.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json -</strong> Providing an index of each project, giving me machine readable access to each API, as well as its operations.</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo -</strong> A repository to house the server code (privately), but also publish a developer portal with API definitions available via a known location.</li>
</ul>
<p>This the current minimum viable definition of an API in my world currently. I will be adding more endpoints to each of these APIs, as well as other building blocks to support their operations, but this represents the start for each of these projects for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly I do not know if each of these APIs will survive. They will each have their own road-maps, one that is driven based upon how much I evangelize, and ultimately attract interest from consumers. Each API will have its own monetization strategy, something I will work on sharing via the API definitions that I've published in their API portals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of these APIs are core to my operations as API Evangelist, while two of them are just really for fun, and are in support of simple micro apps I wish to deploy. Low Hanging Fruit will depend on how much funding I can get for each domain indexes, and APIs.How will thrive based upon the growth of my own writing and storytelling. The other two will be driven by advertising revenue, and I do not expect anyone to actually build anything else on the APIs, they only exist because I am API-first in everything I do.</p>
<p>Now that I have a minimum viable existence for all four of these APIs I can move into the next next steps for each project, while also addressing other items on my task list, but at least I know these projects are up and running, and discoverable when I get time to get back to them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzle-strategic.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/issues/159">I was gathering my thoughts today around API management solutions can better work together, in response to an industry discussion going on between several creators of open source tooling</a>. The Github thread is focused on proxies, and how they can work more closely together to facilitate interoperability in this potentially federated layer of the API economy, but as I do, I wanted to step back and look at bigger picture before I responded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was gathering my thoughts, <a href="http://apigarage.com/">I also had an interesting conversation with the creator of API Garage</a>, in which one of the topics was around how we encourage API service providers to want to work closer, but this time from the perspective of a <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">API client workspace</a>. This made me think, that the thoughts I was gathering about how open source proxies can better work together, should be universally applied to every step along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Open APIs</strong><br />It should be a no-brainer for API service providers--have an API! <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">One of the best examples of this, is with 3Scale API management--they have a very robust API, that represents every aspect of the API management layer</a>. Other service providers like <a href="https://developer.apiscience.com/">API Science</a>, and <a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io/">APIMATIC</a>, who server other stops along the API life-cycle, also have their own APIs. If you want your API tooling to work with other API tooling, have an API--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/20/swagger-20-for-the-docker-api/">think about Docker, and their API interface, and make your tools behave this way</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong><br />Provide openly licensed tooling around any service you provide. Make your tooling as modular as you can, and apply open source licenses wherever it makes sense. Open licenses, facilitate people working together, and breaks down silos. This is obvious to the folks on the API proxy thread I'm referencing, but will not be as obvious to other service providers looking to break into the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Definitions</strong><br />Speak common API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and in Postman Collections, and provide indexes using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. If consumers can import and export in their preferred definition format they will be able to get up and running much quicker, share patterns between the various proprietary services, and the open tooling they are putting to work. There are a lot of opportunities to partner around common API definitions for API deployment, and management, which would open up a potentially new world of API services that aggregate, integrate, and sync between common API platforms throughout the life-cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Open Plugins</strong><br />Developers never want their tooling to be a silo. Allow the extensibility of any tooling or services, from design, to management, or client, using common approaches to connectors, plugins, etc. Make plugins be API first, so that other API service providers can easily take their own APIs, craft a plugin, and quickly bring their value to another platform's ecosystem. Plugins are the doorway to the interoperability that open APIs, source code, and definitions bring to the table for platform providers.</p>
<p><strong>Open Partnerships</strong><br />Open APIs, source code, definitions, and plugins all set the stage for ever deeper levels of partnership. APIs are the pipes, with open source code and definitions providing the grease, and if all API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com">testing</a>, <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">security</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, and <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> providers allow for plugins, strategic partners can occur organically.</p>
<p>All of this really sounds familiar? It really sounds like what the API space is telling the rest of the business world, so I can't help but see the irony in giving API service and tooling providers this same advice. If you want more partnerships to happen, expose all your resources as APIs, providing open tooling and definitions, allow other companies to plug their features into your solutions, and a whole new world of business development will emerge.</p>
<p>With the mainstream growth we are seeing in the API space in 2015, there are some pretty significant opportunities for partnership between API service providers right now--that is, if we follow the same API-first approach, currently being recommended to API providers.</p>

<p>My own API management system allows me to import Postman collections, HAR files, Charles Proxy XML files, and Swagger version 1.2, but when it comes to output, it only speaks Swagger 2.0. I've been wanting to create a tool for outputting my definitions as API Blueprint for some time now, but just haven't had the time to do the work.</p>
<p>I have been secretly hoping someone would build a good quality, so I wouldn't have to do this work myself. Now I have <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>, an API definition translation platform, developed by the <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. Using API Transformer you can upload or pull API definitions in the following formats:</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/"><img style="margin-top: 60px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-with-blueprint.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>API Blueprint</li>
<li>Swagger 1.0 - 1.2</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 JSON</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 YAML</li>
<li>WADL - W3C 2009</li>
<li>Google Discovery</li>
<li>RAML 0.8</li>
<li>I/O Docs - Mashery</li>
<li>APIMATIC Format</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you can output API definitions in the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Blueprint</li>
<li>Swagger 1.2</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 JSON</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 YAML</li>
<li>WADL - W3C 2009</li>
<li>APIMATIC Format</li>
</ul>
<p>With API Transformer, they are offering a pretty valuable service, that any API service provider, and API consumer can put to work right away. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I quickly generated four API Blueprints, for my API, audio, blog, and building block APIs, which I also indexed as part of each APIs.json file</a>.</p>
<p>As any good API service provider should, The API Transformer has an API. You can build in API transformations between definition into any service or tooling. In my opinion, every API service provider in 2015 should speak as many API definitions as possible, always allowing customers to import, and export in all of the formats offered above.</p>
<p>API Transformer reflects how API service providers should work, it is doing one thing, and doing it well, and it provides a simple web interface, as well as a dead simple API. There is no way I will be building out my own service now that <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">APIMATC has launched API Transformer</a>.</p>

<p>I just sat in on an <a href="http://apiware.io">APIWare</a> call with a fast growing startup, developing a better understanding of how we can assist their team. They have a pretty solid development team behind their API, so providing core API development resources is not in the cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where&nbsp; this startup is needing the most help, is where the APIWare team shines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Operations Review -</strong> Taking a look at how an API platform works from the inside out, preferably starting with an outside perspective, so we can bring that fresh perspective to the table, and immediately begin adding value to the road-map.</li>
<li><strong>Crafting API Strategy -</strong> With a better understanding of how an API works, inside and out, we can take a walk through our massive list of best practices, and see what we can apply when it comes to bringing together a strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing companies with a comprehensive review of their API operations from an outside perspective, but also walking through their architecture, team, and other internal resources, is a valuable process on its own. Having a team of experience API professionals listening, and walking through the current makeup of your API operations helps you better articulate your vision while also helping us define how things work, so a coherent API strategy can be crafted by our team.</p>
<p>This is the stage we are in with this particular startup conversation--kicking off a formal review, so we can help them craft a coherent API strategy. Once this is done, we can re-assess how we can help them, and probably begin telling more public stories about the project. This conversation reflects other conversations the APIWare team is having with other startups, SMB and enterprise groups. However one thing that did present itself on this call, is how APIWare is also becoming a burst-able development team that can act as a backup when small startups are faced with potentially large enterprise relationships that come with API success.</p>
<p>This particular startup&nbsp; just had a new enterprise customer come in through their API, the dream of any small API, until you actually have to scramble to meet the demands. I have seen the interest of the enterprise be both a blessing and a curse in the past for small teams, something that has the potential to derail a startup, taking them away from the daily work that matters. The enterprise has the resources to throw at these projects, but small startup teams do not always have what it takes to keep day to day operations running smoothly, while also meeting the needs of a large project or partnership.</p>
<p>This is APIWare. In addition to helping this startup review their current API operations, and craft a coherent API strategy, the APIWare team is here to help their core API developer team expand and contract as necessary. We are getting to know know the company's existing infrastructure and operations, primarily to be able to help craft the overall API strategy, but this awareness also puts us in a good position to step in and help either to help with a larger project, or augment the core team, while they address the needs of larger, temporary projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability for APIWare to be there for a company in this capacity always starts with an API operations review. We can't be waiting in the wings, ready to work, if we aren't up to speed on how things are currently operating, and in tune with the road-map. It is nice to be starting these conversations early, so we are up to speed when we are needed most. I am happy to see that staying specialized in the areas of API design, deployment, and management is proving to be a valuable approach to the startups we are talking with so far.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-engine-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Sometimes I have ideas, that are sticky, meaning they won't leave my brain, but are not always concepts I personally enjoy exploring. This is just a little insight into the madness that is my brain, focus Kin...FOCUS! So, I found myself thinking last week about API monetization, while I was also updating my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> and <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a> research--then, during this Reese's peanut butter cup moment, I came up with an idea for a suggested or sponsored link relation engine for hypermedia APIs.</p>
<p>First, I'd prefer to start with what I'd consider to be a hypermedia suggestion engine, that could provide external suggestions for related links to any structured data that is being returned via an API. It is a suggestion engine that an API provider, who has followed hypermedia principles as part of their API design, could use to augment the resources they are serving up. Such a suggestion engine would have to be pretty smart, and work from an existing index that API providers could train via an external API.</p>
<p>One possible example of this from my existing work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/15/can-we-keep-important-scientific-research-projects-alive-through-revenue-generated-from-api-access/">is present in a scientific research API</a>, that might be serving up research papers, and with each API call you could potentially get some native related links for annotating, tagging, and other opportunities that are dictated by the API providers. But, what if the institution, where the research occurred could provide related links to other research going on at the institution, or maybe a governing scientific organization could suggest other related research or resources, and it was up to the API provider to whitelist or blacklist link relations that were included.</p>
<p>Taking this to the next level, which is inevitable, and I might as well be the asshole who suggest it, but what if API providers could approve a paid index of links to suggest as a link relation, for any product in the catalog. Sure you can add this product to your wishlist, or shopping cart, but you could also donate it to a non-profit organization, or buy it through a partner who will modify it for me, and deliver it to me in a way that improves on the original product experience. Such a link relation engine could inject valuable links into the API stream, and the API provider, and potentially developers could tap into this as a potential revenue stream. Of course, all links included would be fully vetted, and <a href="https://metacert.com/">certified secure using a service like Metacert</a>.</p>
<p>If you are still reading this, this link relation engine does not exist. This is just a random idea derived from the collision of several of my active projects, with a little forward thought of what could be one possible dystopian post-advertising world, API monetization world might look like. I'm sure, like current advertising, 90% of the links in a link relation engine would be total shit, but who knows, they might also add value to the increasing number of structured objects being served up via APIs, and maybe active as a next generation financial engine that is tailored specifically for the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-dev-code.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If  you are in an industry being impacted by technology, you have probably  become very aware of the term Application Programming Interfaces, more  widely known as APIs, and how they are driving web applications, mobile  applications, and increasingly everyday  objects in our homes, cars, businesses, and across the public  landscape. If you are finding yourself part of this growing  conversations, you have most likely have also heard talk of a new breed  of API definition formats that are becoming ubiquitous like Swagger  and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>API definitions are a way to describe what an API does, providing a  machine readable blueprint of how to put the digital resource to work.  API definitions are not new, but this latest round of available formats  are taking the API conversation out of just  IT and developer groups, and enabling business units, and other key  stakeholders to participate throughout the API life-cycle. Much like the  latest wave of web APIs has made data, content, and other digital  resources like video and images more accessible,  API definitions are making APIs more accessible across the rapidly  expanding digital business landscape.</p>
<p>The first widely available API definition format was the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl"> Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</a>, which is an XML format  established in 2001 that described web services. Much like web services  (an API predecessor), WSDL was a very technical vision of APIs,  something dictated by IT, and developer groups, with  heavy top down governance from business and industry leadership. While  web services, and WSDL are still ubiquitous across the enterprise, they  are rapidly being replaced with much lighter weight, simpler web APIs  that use the Internet as a way of delivering  the digital data, content, and resources web, mobile, and devices are  demanding in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round-certified.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Along the way, newer, more web friendly API definition formats emerged, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language"> Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, but ultimately WADL was  something that never took root, suffering from many of the same illness  of its predecessor WSDL. It wasn't until a new format called <a href="http://swagger.io"> Swagger</a> was born, that we started to see the conversation around how  we define, communicate and develop standardized tooling around APIs  evolve, providing an open specification for defining all the details  that go into an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger provided developers a way to describe an API that was more in  sync with everything else modern API developers were used to, including  using JSON, rather than the XML of previous web services, WSDL and  WADL. Swagger gave us something more than just  way to define APIs, it gave us swagger UI, which is a interactive  version of API documentation that made learning about what an API does,  and how to integrate with it, a hands on, interactive experience. This  new approach to documentation gave us a solution  to the number one problem plaguing API providers, which was out of date  documentation that confused consumers.</p>
<p>Shortly after Swagger began seeing wide adoption because of the  interactive documentation it provided for APIs, a new API definition  format also emerged called API Blueprint, which provided interactive  documentation, but rather than using JSON, it used Markdown,  making the process of defining APIs a little less intimidating for  non-developers. Apiary, the makers of API Blueprint did another thing  that would move the conversation forward again, making the reasons for  defining APIs in these formats, more about API design,  than just about delivering up-to-date documentation.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-blueprint-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Using API Blueprint, API designers could define an API, before any  code was actually written. Developers could craft an API using Apiary's  tooling, then a mock version of an API could be generated, which could  be shared with other project stakeholders, from  business users, to potential web or mobile developers. This process  saves considerable time, money, and other resources in ensuring than API  would be something web, mobile, and device developers could actually  put to use. With two new API definition formats  Swagger, and now API Blueprint, the processing of defining, designing  APIs in a machine readable way, was accessible to everyone, across a  rapidly expanding API life-cycle.</p>
<p>This evolution has all occurred over the last 4 years, a period which  has also produced other API definition formats like RSDL, RADL, RAML,  I/O Docs, and MSON--just to name a few. All of these API definition  formats are quickly becoming the preferred format  for not just defining, and designing APIs, as well as delivering  documentation. Another positive by-product has been that a new breed of  API service providers are also using it as the central definition for  quickly putting their services to work on any API,  for documentation, mocking and virtualizing APIs, generating server  code, producing software development kits (SDK), and setting up  essential testing and monitoring to keep APIs stable and reliable for  consumers--the API definition driven life-cycle continues  to expand.</p>
<p>In 15 years, like APIs, the API definition formats have moved out of  the real of the technical, and are providing vital business interactions  that ensure APIs meet critical internal, partner, and public needs.  They are also being applied to bring much needed  balance to the political side of API operations, from making sure APIs  are stable, and available, to defining pricing, rate limits, terms of  service, and even helping secure APIs that operate on the open Internet.</p>
<p>API definitions have become a machine readable contract that defines  the boundaries of a relationship between API provider, and its  consumers. Acting as a central truth, that is crafted by developers and  API architects to govern how an API operates, from  mocking to client integration, but in a way that is also setting the  technical, business, and legal expectations of consumers. This API  definition-driven contact is transcending the often proprietary, black  box algorithms that make an API function behind the  scenes, providing a portable, shareable, machine readable contract that  can be shared internally, and externally with partners or the general  public.</p>
<p>The importance of this new layer, and its role in the future of software development can be seen playing out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc."> Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>, where Oracle (using the courts)  has set the precedent that the naming, and ordering of your interface is  separate from the code, and falls under copyright protection. Beyond  the core legal case, the questions, and understanding  of exactly what is code has been even more interesting. Many API  architects do not see APIs as anything but code, having not seen impacts  of the modern API definition movement within their architecture yet.</p>
<p>API definitions aren't just about defining the URLs, parameters,  headers, and other aspects of API operations that developers need to  know, it is also bringing much needed clarity and awareness of value  generated by APIs among business users, and the end-users  of the applications that APIs are powering. API definitions provide a  common format in markdown, YAML, or JSON, that describe the technical  surface of an API, but then also take this technical specification, and  allow it to be applied across every stop along  the API life-cycle, from idea to deployment, to resulting integration  with web, mobile, and device applications.</p>
<p>As APIs make their way into almost every aspect of our business and  personal lives, driving our social relationships with family and  friends, meter our connections to our utility companies, connect us to  educational and healthcare opportunities, this touch-point  between platform, and the web, mobile, and device applications it  powers, is becoming increasingly critical. To businesses this layer  represents critical supply chains, but to each individual this touch  point is where all of our life bits flow--further emphasizing  the importance of, but also the sensitivity required in defining APIs  in a meaningful way, that makes sense to EVERYONE involved.</p>
<p>In 2001, a WSDL definition was very much about communicating what a  service did between platform and an the system that was integrated,  something that only involved IT, and developers. In 2015, a modern API  definition format provides the same benefits that  WSDL has historically delivered, but it is also addressing the  business, and political elements of how Internet enabled software works.  &nbsp;A modern API definition provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>a medium for API designs, architects, and business stakeholders to  craft exactly the API that is needed, before any production code is  written. </li>
<li>a necessary set of instructions needed for a quality assurance (QA) team to make sure an API meets business requirements </li>
<li>a definition of sandbox, mocking, simulation, and virtualization environments that developers may need to be successful </li>
<li>what a developer needs to integrate with another system, or  build an application through interactive documentation, and even  complete Software Development Kits (SDK) </li>
<li>what the API testing, monitoring, and performance groups will need to ensure service level agreements are met or exceeded </li>
<li>the known surface area that security auditor will need to  properly secure the infrastructure web, mobile, devices, and ultimately  users will depend on </li>
<li>a map that government regulators can use to understand the  industry landscape, and help keep all players in alignment with the  nations priorities </li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a sampling of how API definitions are being used as a  driver for what is widely being called the API economy, which is the  heart of cloud, mobile, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and almost  every other technical trend of the last ten years.  While API definitions provide the much needed machine readable  instructions for computers to understand what occurs at these vital API  touch-points, they also provide the much needed human readable  instructions, that people can use to interpret business agreements,  individual relationships, that are playing out across our increasingly  digital lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2015</span>

<p>When it comes to the API space, it always takes numerous conversations with API providers and practitioners, before something comes into focus for me. I've spent five years having <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> conversations, an area that is very much in focus for me when it comes to my own infrastructure, as well as using as a metric for reviewing the other public and private APIs that I review regularly.</p>
<p>While I have been paying attention to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a> for a couple years now (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), in 2015 I find myself involved in 20+ conversations, forcing the topic to slowly come into focus for me, whether I like it or not. When talking to companies and organizations about how they can generate revenue from their APIs, I generally find the conversation going in one of two directions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource</strong> - We will be directly monetizing whatever resource we are making available via the API. Charging for access to the resource, and composing of multiple access tiers depending on volume, and partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - We believe the technology behind the API platform is where the money is, and will be charging for others to use this technology. Resulting in a growing wholesale / private label layer to the API economy.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>90% of the conversation I engage in are focused in the first area, and how to make money off API access to a resource. The discussion is almost always about what someone will pay for a resource, something that is more art than science--even in 2015. The answer is, we don't know until there is a precedent, resulting in an imbalance where developers expect things for free, and providers freak the fuck out--then call me. ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/08/catching-my-breath-on-my-api-monetization-ramblings-before-i-enter-into-some-new-conversations/">As more of my thoughts around API monetization solidfy</a>, a third dimension is slowly coming into focus, one that won't exist for all API providers (especially those without consumers), but is something I think should be considered as part of a long term roadmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exhaust</strong> - Capture, and make accessible the logs, usage, tooling, and other resources that are developed and captured through the course of API operations, and make available in a self-service, pay as you go approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways you can capture the exhaust around API operations, and sell access to it. This is where the ethics of APIs come into play--you either do this right, or you do it in a way that exploits everything along the way. This could be as simple as providing an API endpoint for accessing search terms executed against an API, all the way to providing a franchise model around the underlying technology behind an API, with all the resources someone needs to get up and running with their own version of an API. If you are very short-sighted this could be just about selling all your exhaust, behind the scenes to your partners and investors.</p>
<p>To me this is all about stepping back, and looking at the big picture. If you can't figure out a theoretical, 3rd dimension strategy for making money off the exhaust generated by the resource you are making available via an API, and the underlying technology used to do so---there probably isn't a thing there to begin with. Well, if you can't do this in an ethical way, that you will want to talk about publicly, and with your grandmother, you probably shouldn't be doing it in the first place. I'm not saying there isn't money to be made, I'm say there isn't real value, and money to be made that also lets you also sleep at night.</p>
<p>This opens up a number of ethical benchmarks for me. If you are looking at selling the exhaust from everything to your VC partners, and never open it up via your public APIs, you probably are going to do very well in the current venture capital (VC) driven climate. What I'm talking about, is how do you generate a new layer of revenue based upon the legitimate exhaust, that is generate from the valuable resource you are making available, and the solid technological approach that is behind it. If there is really something there, and you are willing to talk about it, and share publicly, the chances I'm going to care and talk about on my blog increases dramatically.</p>
<p>If you do not have a clue what I'm talking about, you probably aren't that far along in your API journey. That is fine. This isn't a negative. Just get going as soon as you can. If you are further along, and have people and companies actually using your API, there is ap robably a lot of value already being generated. If you partner with your ecosystem, and educate, as well as communicate with end-users properly--I am just highlight that there is a lot of opportunity to be captured in this 3rd dimension.</p>

<p>Amazon did a good job, providing a GUI interface for crafting the methods, resources, and underlying data models for APIs you are deploying using the gateway. However when you <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">compare to some of the GUI API design editors I mentioned in my last post on this subject, from Restlet, APIMATIC, and Gelato</a>, the Amazon interface clearly needs evolve a little more.</p>
<p>AWS is just getting started with their solution, so I'm not knocking what they have done. I just wanted to keep comparing of all of the solutions as they emerge, and highlight the opportunity for some standardization in this layer of API tooling. I see a pretty big opportunity for some player to step up and provide an open source API design editor that provides a seamless experience across API service providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This post is nothing new. I am just trumpeting the call for open API design tooling each time I see another new interface introduced for crafting APIs, their paths, resources, parameters, headers, authentication, and underlying data models. At some point, a new player will emerge with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">the open source API design editor I am looking for</a>, or one of the existing players open sources their current offering, and evolve it in context of the wider API design space, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/we-need-an-open-abstraction-layer-to-help-us-better-define-and-design-our-apis/">providing an abstracted layer that supports all API definition formats</a>.</p>
<p>With the growth in the number of service providers I see stepping up to server the API space, the need for common, open tooling when it comes to API design is only going to grow. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">It took almost four years of waiting for the API management space to figure this out</a>, I'm hoping I don't have to wait as long in the API design side of things.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-monetization-strategy.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of my readers recently reached out to me, in response <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/08/catching-my-breath-on-my-api-monetization-ramblings-before-i-enter-into-some-new-conversations/">to some of my recent stories of monetization opportunities around government and scientific open data and APIs</a>. I'm not going to publish his full email, but he brought&nbsp;up a couple of key, and very important realities of open data and APIs that I don't think get discussed enough, so I wanted to craft a story around them, to bring front and center in my work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most open data published from government is crap, and requires extra work before you can do anything with it</li>
<li>There currently are very few healthy models for developers to follow when it comes to building a business around open data</li>
<li>Business people and developers have zero imagination when it comes to monetization -- aka ads, ads, ads, and more ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>My reader sums it all up well with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I don't dispute that with some pieces of government data, they can be  integrated into existing businesses, like real estate, allowing a  company to value add. But the startup space levering RAW open, or paid  government data is a lot harder. Part of my business does use paid  government data, accessible via an API, but these opportunities the  world over are few and far between in my mind.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think his statement reflects the often unrealized challenges around working with open data, but in my opinion it also the opportunity when it comes to the API journey, when applied to this world of open data.</p>
<p>APIs do not equal good, and if you build a simple API on top of open government data, it does not equal instant monetization  opportunity as an API provider. It will take domain experts (or aspiring ones) to really get to know  the data, make it accessible via simple web APIs, and begin iterating  on new approaches to using the open data to enrich web and mobile applications in ways that someone is willing to pay for.</p>
<p>The reality of taking an open data set, cleaning it up, and then  being able to monetize access to it directly via an API is simply not a reality,  and is something that will only work in probably less than 5% of the  scenarios where it is applied. However this doesn't mean that there aren't opportunities out there when it comes to monetizing adjacent to, and in relationship to the open data.</p>
<p>Before you can develop any APIs that any business or organization would want to pay for you have to add value. You do this by adding more meaningful endpoints that do not just reflect the original data or database resources, and provide actual value to end users of the web and mobile devices that being built--this is the API journey you hear me speak of so soften.</p>
<p>You can also do this by connecting the dots between disparate data-sets, in the form of crosswalks, and the establishing common data formats that can be applied across local, and regional governments, or possibly an industry. Once common data formats and interface models are established, and a critical mass of high value open data, common tooling can begin to evolve, creating opportunities for further software, service, and partnership revenue models.</p>
<p>The illness that exists when it comes to the current state of open data is something partly shared between early open data advocates when it came to over-promising the potential of open data, and their own under-delivery, as well as the governments under-delivery when it came to the actual roll-out and execution around their open data efforts. Most of the data published cannot be readily put to work, requiring several additional steps before the API journey even begins--making more work for anyone looking to develop around it, putting up obstacles, instead of removing them.</p>
<p>There is opportunity to generate revenue from open data published by government, but it isn't easy, and it definitely isn't VC scale opportunity, <a href="http://hdscores.com/">but for companies like HDSCore, when it comes selling aggregate restaurant inspection data to companies like Yelp, there is a viable business model</a>. Companies that are looking to build business models around open data need to tamper down their expectations of being the next Twitter, and open data advocates need to stop trumpeting that open data and APIs will fix all that is wrong with government. We need to lower the bar, and just get to work doing the dirty work of exposing, cleaning up, and evolving how open data is put to work.</p>
<p>It will take a lot of work to find more of the profitable scenarios, and it will take years and years of hard work to get government open data to where it is default, and the cleanliness and uselessness levels are high enough, before we see the real potential of open data and APIs. All this hard work, and shortage of successful models, doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. For example, just because we can't make money providing direct access to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">Recreational Information Database (RIDB),</a> doesn't mean there isn't potentially valuable APIs when it comes to understanding how people plan their summer vacations at our national parks--it will just take time to get there.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> project is purely about the next steps in this evolution, and making valuable government "open data" that has been published as CSVs and Excel, more accessible and usable, by cleaning them up and publishing them as JSON and / or APIs. I am just &nbsp;acknowledging how much work there is ahead of us when it comes to making the currently available open data accessible and usable, so we can just begin the conversation about how we make them better, as well as how we generate revenue to fund this journey.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-loader/">Element Loader from API service provider Cloud Elements</a> came across my monitoring this week, providing a configurable JavaScript application that help simplify data migration, allowing you to move content and data between cloud platforms, by putting their APIs to work.</p>
<p>The Element Loader is interesting to me as an evolution to the concept of what I&rsquo;ve long called <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">API reciprocity</a>, where companies like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> allows you to migrate your bits and bytes between the platforms we are all increasingly finding ourselves dependent on.</p>
<p>I think Cloud Elements is moving the needle forward just a bit, by formalizing a tool that is dedicated to real-time sync, between the platforms you depend on. You can accomplish similar things with Zapier, but I think looking at it purely about sync of specific life bits (objects) can be a very valuable exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been calling this reclaim your domain for a couple years now, where I think the process of identifying the services we depend on is extremely valuable, and one where establishing a plan for how your bits and bytes work in concert, really pushes things into the realm of actually healthy IT operations--for both individuals and businesses.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-loader/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ElementLoaderWorkflow.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I do not have my world synced. My contacts on Google, LinkedIn, and other platforms are totally out of sync, and my documents are spread between Google, Amazon, and Dropbox, without any coherency at all. Don&rsquo;t get me started on my images. This is a real problem, that is only growing, and a segment where I'd like to see more solutions like Element Loader emerge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start tracking on reciprocity providers like Cloud Elements who are doing specific things like sync, which will become one of the common building blocks I&rsquo;ll add to my research when I get the time to update. Hopefully I will find some more time soon to take a deeper look at my my <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API automation and interoperability research</a>--it has been a while.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://learn-more.idxbroker.com/developer-summit/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/idx-summit-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://learn-more.idxbroker.com/developer-summit/">I preparing a talk this week in Portland, OR, at the IDX Developer Summit</a>. IDX serves the real estate industry, providing real estate professionals access to hundreds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service">multiple listing services (MLS)</a> groups, from around the United States. If you are a real estate broker or agent, and you need real estate listings on your site, IDX is how you do this--they are leading player in the space.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with the world of real estate data, it has been long controlled by a network of MLS groups, totaling almost 2000 (I think), spread around the nation. These MLS organizations tightly control their data, deciding exactly who has access to it, and exactly how it can be used, and how it MUST be displayed in print and across the web. This is a process that has long existed, prior to the existence of the web, but since 1995, it is mechanism that has gotten even more strict, and litigious, seeking to maintain their control over a very valuable, and increasingly digital layer of our physical worlds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, the real estate industry is the OG API provider, making data available via FTP locations as soon as the web was a thing. However, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">when it comes to the core principles of what makes APIs work</a>, the real estate industry is the anti-API. MLS hoard facts, something that cannot have copyright applied, but if you are litigious enough, it is something you can defend. The address, and details of residential and commercial property is data that should be accessible to everyone, but MLS groups, and National Association of Realtor (NAR) have created a cartel, that prevents this from ever being a reality. Think what the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and record labels have done to music--the MLS and NAR do this to real estate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/idx-real-estate.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>IDX has struck a balance between hundreds of these MLS organizations, allowing them to process their prized data, and enable real estate agents and brokers to publish this data on their websites using seamless and often embeddable tooling, that adheres to the distribution, and branding guidelines set by the MLS. IDX provides a bridge between the online digital world, and this legacy world of data control, potentially providing the real estate industry with the online tooling they will need to be successful.</p>
<p>Ok, if the MLS, NAR, and real estate industry is the anti-API, what the hell am I doing speaking at a real estate industry developer conference? Well, I was the original tech founder of IDX. ;-) I build the original system for pulling real estate data, targeting the first handful of MLS organizations. I exited the company sometime around 2005, and my technology is long gone (thank god), and my two co-founders have gone on to do some very interesting things, building a thriving company in a very difficult space.</p>
<p>I won't be going to the&nbsp;IDX Developer Summit to talk shit on the MLS and NAR, I will be helping to inspire the developers, about how much opportunity is available out there right now, even in the real estate industry. There are a lot of open data, and Internet of Things related opportunities emerging when it comes to residential, and commercial buildings, as well as neighborhood, and city level development possibilities. My objective is to help them understand the realities of the space they exist in, and still build value within, and around an industry that is so entrenched when it comes to data sharing--it can be done!</p>
<p>I also hope to get them to use my nationwide MLS API, and bypass the MLS and NAR system. Just kidding!! If you have ever worked in the industry, this is the question every newbie asks, "can't I just get access to the nationwide MLS?". ;-)</p>
<p>I am actually really honored to be speaking at the&nbsp;IDX Developer Summit this week. My buddies Chad and Jeff have done some good work, in a very difficult industry--I am proud of them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aws-api-gateway-icon.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I sat down for a second, more in-depth look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a>. When it first released <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/09/the-new-aws-api-gateway-anyone-who-does-not-do-this-will-be-fired-thank-you-have-a-nice-day--jeff-bezos/">I took a stroll through the interface, and documentation</a>, but this time, I got my hands dirty playing with the moving parts, and considering how the solution fits into the overall API deployment picture.</p>
<p><strong>API Design Tools</strong><br /><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home">As soon as you land on the Amazon API Gateway dashboard page</a>, you can get to work adding APIs by defining endpoints, crafting specific methods (paths), the crafting the details of your HTTP resources (verbs), and round off your resources with parameters, headers, and underlying data models. You can even map the custom sub-domain of your choosing to your Amazon API Gateway generated API, giving it exactly the base URL you need.</p>
<p><strong>API Mapping Templates</strong><br />One feature provided by the&nbsp;Amazon API Gateway that I find intriguing is the mapping templates. Using the data&nbsp;models and the mapping template tool, you can transform data from one schema to another. This is very interested when you are thinking about evolving your own legacy APIs, but I'm also thinking it could come in real handy for mapping to public APIs, and demonstrating to clients what is possible with a next version--designed from the outside-in-<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/04/swagger-api-definition-mapper/">mapping is something I've wanted to see for some time now</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Integration Types</strong><br />Up until now, in this review, we are just talking about designing APIs, and possibly mapping our data models together. There are many other ways you can gateway existing systems, databases, and other resources using Amazon API Gateway, but the one that seems to be getting the lions share of the discussion, is deploying APIs with Lambda functions as the back-end.</p>
<p><strong>API Integration Using Lambda Functions</strong><br />Lambda functions give you the ability to create, store, and manage Node.js and Java code snippets, and wire up these resources using the Amazon API Gateway. When you create your first Lambda function, you are given a small selection of blueprints, like a microservice, or db connection, which also allows you to edit your code inline, upload a .zip file, and pull a .zip file from Amazon S3 (where is the Github love).</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM)</strong><br />The Amazon API Gateway gives you some pretty simple ways to secure your APIs using API keys, but then also gives you the whole <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS IAM platform,</a> and resources to put to leverage as well. I think most of the IAM will be more than many API providers will need, but for those that need this, I can see this part of their gateway solution sealing the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling Lambda Functions Behind</strong><br />Being scalable is one of the promises of a Lambda backed API deployed using Amazon API Gateway, which I can see being pretty alluring for devops focused teams. You can allocate each Lambda function to posses the memory it needs, and individually monitor and scale as needed. While I see the recent containerization movement taking care of 50% of the API back-end needs, I can also see that being able to quickly scale individual functions as you need using the cloud, taking care of the other 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Events For Lambda Functions</strong><br />Another powerful aspects of a Lambda function, is you can engineer them to response to events. Using the interface, command line, or API, you can define one or many event sources for each Lambda function. Amazon provides some pretty interesting sources for triggering each Lambda function.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Amazon Kinesis</a></strong> - Real-time data processing</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa Skills Kit</a></strong> -&nbsp;Voice interaction with devices</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a></strong> - Storing mobile user data</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a></strong> - A NoSQL database&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></strong> - Secure object storage</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns">Amazon SNS</a></strong> - Push notification service</li>
</ul>
<p>Those six event sources provide some pretty potent event sources for triggering specific functions in your vast Lambda code library. &nbsp;You can rely on running code stored as Lambda functions using the API you deploy using Amazon API Gateway and / or you can have your code run in response to a variety of these events you define.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Lambda</strong><br />When it comes to defining a back-end for the APIs you deploy using Amazon API Gateway, Lambda is just the beginning. Amazon provides three other really interesting ways to power APIs. I see a lot of potential in managing code using Lambda, and using it to scale the back-end of many APIs pretty quickly, but these areas provide some pretty interesting potential as well.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Proxy</strong><br />A quick way to put Amazon API Gateway to use is as a proxy for an existing API. When you think about the potential in this area, when put mapping templates to work, transforming the methods, resources, and models. I haven't mapped it to any existing APIs yet, but will make sure and do so soon, to better understand the HTTP proxy potential.</p>
<p><strong>Mock Integration</strong><br />Another way to quickly deploy an API is mock your integration, providing a quick API that can be used to hack on, making sure an API will meet developer's needs. You may even want to mock an existing public API, rather than use a live resoure as you are developing an application. There are many uses for mock integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AWS Service Proxy</strong><br />The final way Amazon gives provides for you to power your API(s), is by proxying an existing AWS service. This opens up the entire AWS cloud stack for exposing as API resources, using the Amazon API Gateway. This reminds me of other existing API gateway solutions, except instead of your on-premise, legacy infrastructure, this is your in the cloud, more recent infrastructure. I'm guessing this will incentivize many companies to migrate their legacy infrastructure into the cloud, or at least make it cloud friendly, so you can put the AWS service proxy to use--lots of possibilities here.</p>
<p><strong>Defining The Stages Of Your Lifecycle</strong><br />Going beyond the types of integration you can employ when crafting, and deploying APIs using the Amazon API Gateway, the platform also provides a way to define stages that APIs will exist in from design, development, QA, production, or any other stage you wish. I like the concept of having a stage defined for each API, designating where it exists on the API life-cycle. I tend to just have dev and prod, but this might make me consider this a little more deeply, as it seems to be a big part of defining the API journey.</p>
<p><strong>API Monitoring By Default</strong><br />Amazon has built in monitoring by default into the API Gateway, and Lambda functions. You can connect APIs, and their designated integration back-end to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/">CloudTrail</a>, and monitor everything about your operations. CloudTrail is very much a cloud infrastructure logging solution over API analytics solutions, but I could see it evolve into something more than just monitoring and logging, providing an overall awareness of API consumption. Maybe an opportunity for the ecosystem to step in via the API(s).</p>
<p><strong>CLI An API For The API Gateway</strong><br />You have to admit, Amazon gets interfaces, making sure every service on the platform has a command line interface as well as an API. This is where a lot of the API orchestration magic will come into play in my opinion. The ability to automate every aspect of API design, deployment, management, and monitoring, across your whole stack, using an API is the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There Are Some Limitations</strong><br />There are some <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/limits.html">current limitations of the Amazon API Gateway</a>. They limit things to 60 APIs maximum per AWS account, 300 resources maximum per API, 10 stages maximum per API, and 10-second timeout for both AWS Lambda and HTTP back-end integration. They are just getting going, so I'm sure they are just learning how people will be using the API deployment and management infrastructure in the cloud, and we'll see this evolve considerably.</p>
<p><strong>What Will This Cost?</strong><br />Lambda is providing the first 1 million requests per month for &nbsp;free, and $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter, or $0.0000002 per request. The Amazon&nbsp;API Gateway costs&nbsp;$3.50 per million API calls received, plus the cost of data transfer out, in gigabytes. It will be interesting to see what this costs at scale, but I'm sure overall, it will be very inexpensive to operate like other AWS services, and with time the cost will come down even further as they dial it all in.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/amazon-api-gateway-screen.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>AWS API Gateway Has Me Thinking</strong><br />I won't be adopting AWS right away, I'd prefer to watch it evolve some more, but overall I like where they are taking things. The ability to quickly deploy code with Lambda, and use blueprints to clone, and deploy the code-behind APIs, has a lot of potential. Most of my APIs are just simple code that either returns data from a database, and conducts some sort of programmatic function, making Lambda pretty attractive, especially when it comes to helping you scale and monitor everything by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">My original criticism of the platform still stands</a>. Amazon is courting the enterprise with this, providing the next generation of API gateway for the legacy resources we have all accumulated in the cloud. Something that really doesn't help large companies sort through their technical debt, allowing them to just grow it, and manage it in the cloud. Win for AWS, so honestly it makes sense, even though it doesn't deliver critical API life-cycle lessons the enterprise will need along way to actually make change.</p>
<p>This is a reason I won't be getting hooked on Lambda + Amazon API Gateway anytime soon, because I really don't want to be locked into their services. I'm a big fan of my platform employing common, open server tooling (Linux, Apache, NGINX, MySQL, PHP), and not relying on specialty solutions to make things efficient--I rely on my skills, and experience and knowledge of the resources I'm deploying, to deliver efficiency at scale. My farm to table approach to deploying APIs, keeps me in tune with my supply chain, something that may not work for everyone.</p>
<p>While the tooling I use may not be the most exciting, it is something I can move from AWS, and run anywhere. All of my APIs can easily be recreated on any hosting environment, and I can find skills to help me with this work almost anywhere in the world. After 25 years of managing infrastructure, I'm hyper-aware of lock-in, even the subtle moves that happen over time. However, my infrastructure is much smaller than many of the companies who will be attracted to AWS Lambda + API Gateway, which actually for me, is another big part of the API lesson and journey, but if you don't know this already, I'll keep it to myself.</p>
<p>I'd say AWS gives a healthy nod to the type of platform portability I'm looking for, with the ability to import and export your back-end code using Lambda, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/07/introducing-swagger-importer-easily-import-swagger-api-definitions-into-amazon-api-gateway/">and the ability to use API definitions like Swagger as part of Amazon API Gateway emerge</a>. These two things will play a positive role in the overall portability, and interoperability of the platform, but doing this for the deeper connections made with other AWS services, will be a lot harder to evolve from if you ever have to migrate from AWS.</p>
<p>For now, I'll keep playing with Amazon API Gateway, because it definitely holds a lot of potential for some very powerful API orchestration, add while the platform may not work for me 100%, AWS is putting some really interesting concepts into play.</p>

<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/call-for-papers/">There is a little more than 24 hours left for you to submit your talk for APIStrat in Austin, TX, this November 18th, 19th, and 20th</a>. With this sixth edition of APIStrat, we are taking things back to our roots, and not choosing a theme, but making it a conversation about the most important topics in the space facing API providers and consumers in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From looking at the talks that have been submitted so far, API definitions, design, and Internet of Things seems to be leading the pack. We've also seen a couple session talk submissions that we think are probably more worthy of being keynotes, because they are just that good.</p>
<p>The APIStrat team feels like 400 people is the sweet spot when it comes to having a productive API discussion, so we chose a venue that fits this vision, which will most definitely sell out. Check out the sponsors who have already lined up, and we have only announced two keynotes (more coming this next week).</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/call-for-papers/">Make sure and submit your talk before tomorrow night, so that you are part of the conversation</a>. Also, make sure you jump in and &nbsp;sponsor the event, as we are already looking at closing off one tier of sponsorship--<a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/contact/">contact us today if you want to get in on the action.</a></p>
<p>We'll see you in Austin!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My last rant of the evening, I promise. Then I will shut up and move back to actual work instead of telling stories. I'm working on my <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> project, processing&nbsp;<a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/geographic-distribution-of-va-expenditures-fy2013">a pretty robust spreadsheet of Department of Veterans Affairs expenditures by state</a>. As I'm working to convert yet another spreadsheet to CSV, and then to JSON, and publish to Github, I can't help but think, "where is the save as JSON" in Microsoft or Google Spreadsheets?</p>
<p>I can easily write scripts to help me do this, but I'm trying to keep the process as close to what the average person, who will be adopting a government agency data set, will experience. I could build a tool that they could also use, but I really want to keep the tools required for the work as minimal as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would just be easier if Microsoft and Google would get with the program, and give us a built in feature for saving our spreadsheets as JSON.</p>
