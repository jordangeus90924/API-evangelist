{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was happy to see Google launch an API for Google + this week. I’m not chomping at the bit to build anything social on it, but I’m glad they made it public.  I wanted to take some time to review the API from a technology standpoint, and look at what possibilities it opens up for developers.The Google + API provides a RESTful interface for the newly launched Google social network, Google +,  and provides access to profile data and activity streams. The API uses OAuth for authentication and JSON for its request and response formats.</p>
