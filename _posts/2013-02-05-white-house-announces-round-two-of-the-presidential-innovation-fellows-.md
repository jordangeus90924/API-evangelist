{% include JB/setup %}<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program, launched last year, bringing in talented individuals from the private sector, to Washington DC for 6-12 month “tours of duty” in the Federal Government, to develop innovative solutions to our governments most difficult problems.Today the United States CTO Todd Park and CIO Steve VanRoekel announced round two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program.The first round of PIF projects included MyUSA (formerly known as MyGov), RFP-EZ, Blue Button, Better Than Cash, and Open Data Initiatives started in August 2012 with 18 inaugural Fellows.I had the pleasure to be invited in October to spend half a day talking to a group of the fellows, and help make sure they had an awareness of the API space, empowering the group to make the biggest impact possible.Last week when I was in DC, I also got to speak with a couple of the fellows as they were finishing up their tour of duty, and beginning to think about what is next.</p>
