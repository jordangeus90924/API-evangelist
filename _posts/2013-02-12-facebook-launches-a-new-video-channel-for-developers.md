{% include JB/setup %}<p>Facebook launched a new video channel last week, dedicated to keeping developers up to date on the latest news, tutorials, speaking sessions from the Facebook developer ecosystem.Facebook is going to provide content for web and mobile developers, with attention in other specialty areas like gaming and information for publishers.The first edition of the channel will be recorded live on February 19th, with Director of Product Doug Purdy, with the top 3 things every mobile developer needs to know.Im adding a video channel to my list of API building blocks.I dont think you have to be a Facebook before you have your own channel.</p>
