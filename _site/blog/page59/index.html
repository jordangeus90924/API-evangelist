<p>I look at a lot of APIs, the first page you land on makes a big impression, and I can always tell when someone cares enough about developers to craft a simple, quality API Area landing page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about <a title="what it takes to qualify for the API stack" href="/2012/03/15/qualifying-for-the-api-stack/">what it takes to qualify for my API stack</a>, and today&rsquo;s winner for simply and elegantly qualifying for the API stack is <a title="iContact" href="http://developer.icontact.com/">iContact</a>.</p>
<p><a title="iContact Developers Area" href="http://developer.icontact.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iContact/iContact-Developer-Portal.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Upon landing on the iContact Developers Area main page I visually see what I need to get going:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Get Started</li>
<li>Self-Service Registration</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Code Samples</li>
<li>Resources</li>
<li>Blog</li>
</ul>
<p>Then in the footer you can immediately connect with other areas of the company:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Legal</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a title="iContact Developers Area" href="http://developer.icontact.com/">iContact Developers Area</a> landing page is well crafted and as a developer, makes you feel like someone considered you while designing.  You can quickly get at what you need to start integrating and you feel like someone is there to support you as well as keep the API up and running.</p>
<p>What impression does your API area landing page say about your API?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/06/03/rise-of-mobile-backend-as-a-service-mbaas-api-stacks/">Rise of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) API Stacks</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile-backend-as-a-service/kinvey/kinvey-logo-300.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Mobile is fueling a lot of API growth right now.   Or is it APIs fueling a lot of Mobile growth right now?  Either way, APIs and Mobile go together like chocolate and peanut butter (or Nutella as my girlfriend would say).</p>
<p>With this growth in mobile, we are seeing a rise of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers, delivering a basic stack of storage, messaging, notifications, user management and other essential components for mobile developers.</p>
<p>The goal of MBaaS providers is to make it very easy for developers to setup and operate a backend for any application.  After delivering the essentials like storage, messaging access, push notifications, etc., it makes sense that now developers will need easier integration with the data and resources available in web APIs.</p>
<p>MBaaS provider <a title="Kinvey" href="http://www.kinvey.com/">Kinvey</a> is doing just that.  Using <a title="ql.io" href="http://www.ebaytechblog.com/2011/11/30/announcing-ql-io/">ql.io</a>, a declarative, evented, data-retrieval and aggregation gateway for HTTP APIs, they are bringing web APIs to developers, like GeoPlaces data using Google Places, product data from Ebay&rsquo;s Product API and social data using Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://ql.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-tools/qlio-logo-300.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Kinvey is baking in the most popular and valuable web APIs right into the Kinvey SDK, making data from APIs as easy to access, as data in your local Kinvey data store.  Kinvey will deliver an abstracted layer on top of each API, storing data into tables, making them accessible using common queries like SELECT, FROM and WHERE.  They will even let you do JOINS on multiple data sources, allowing you to mashup and improve API data performance.</p>
<p>Kinvey will take on the heavy lifting associated with the differences between APIs and maintain access between different API versions.  I&rsquo;m assuming with the amount of work involved, Kinvey will be only delivering the most valuable of web APIs or at least the most stable.</p>
<p>Sounds like API owners need to start building relationships with Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers, as this might be the doorway to the next round of growth in your API adoption.  Especially if MBaaS providers can truly make APIs a more local, native experience for mobile developers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Federal Agency API Deployment Tracker" href="/federal_government.php"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/Track-Federal-Agency-API.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about <a title="Barack Obama directing all federal agencies to have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama directing all federal agencies to have an API</a>.   The President has given federal agencies 90 days to create a page on its website, located at www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy, to publicly report progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format, and implement the requirements of the Strategy within 12 months.</p>
<p>As I said in my post, I wanted to setup a <a title="page to monitor this activity" href="/federal_government.php">page to monitor this activity</a>.  I found a <a href="https://explore.data.gov/Federal-Government-Finances-and-Employment/Federal-Executive-Branch-Internet-Domains/k9h8-e98h">dataset of federal executive branch Internet domains</a>, thanks to Anthony Sutardja, one of my readers. In the dataset there are 1467 domains, with 106 distinct agencies running those domains.  The President states "executive department and agencies" in his directive. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine we are going to see digital strategies in 90 days for all 1467 domains?  I&rsquo;m assuming it will occur within the top level agencies first.  But I&rsquo;m very curious see which agency domains follow, so I&rsquo;m going to leave all of them up.</p>
<p>I created a script that will poll www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy for each agency.  I will run this every night this year.  The script checks the HTTP status code for the page, records it with a time stamp, and the we&rsquo;ll see who returns HTTP status code 200(OK) first.  Quick note:  It&rsquo;s interesting to see which agency doesn&rsquo;t properly use status codes, but that is another issue.</p>
<p>Anyone want to wager on who is first, and how many of the 1467 meet the requirements for posting their strategy and ultimately implementing APIs?  Personally I&rsquo;m hoping for CIA and the NSF.  Think of the mashups you could make!!!</p>
<p>I all seriousness, this is extremely important.  If agencies meet these requirements, we can see a radically different federal government in the coming years.  As one of my readers and friend said on the post yesterday, "It looks like the Jeff Bezos mandate that he did 10 years ago!". If you don&rsquo;t known what I&rsquo;m talking about, read "<a title="The Secret to Amazons Success, APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret to Amazons Success Internal APIs</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You can visit the <a title="Federal Agency API Deployment Tracker" href="/federal_government.php">Federal Agency API Deployment Tracker</a> page for more detail, I will keep the link prominent in the right hand feature area of this site, for the rest of the year.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to publish some thoughts, on what Federal Agencies responding to the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a> issued on April 27, 2011, and the White House CIO&rsquo;s, "<a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>" strategy should be considering.</p>
<p>These thoughts are in the business and marketing aspects web API deployment, with light thoughts in the technical areas.  My speciality is not with technical deployment of APIs, I recommend agency leaders visit <a title="API-Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API-Craft</a>, an industry forum with some seriously smart API industry leaders discussing the finer, technical points of web API deployment.</p>
<p>Where I would like to share some thoughts is in the business of deploying and managing Federal Agency APIs.  Insights evolved over 20+ years in the technology field, but exclusively spending the last 2 years studying the business of popular APIs like Twitter and Facebook, and larger API providers like Google and Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing my thoughts, not to benefit any company, but because I strongly believe in the transformative powers of Web APIs.   Web APIs have the power to change the way our Government operates both internally, and with the public.  Barack Obama&rsquo;s mandate, &ldquo;requiring agencies to establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt new standards for making applicable Government information open and machine-readable by default&rdquo;, marks an important point in history.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t screw this up!</p>
<p>While much of the discussion around this announcement on <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.apievangelist.com%2F2012%2F06%2F01%2Fbarak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api%2F">Twitter</a>, <a title="Reddit" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ughx0/barack_obama_directs_all_federal_agencies_to_have/">Reddit</a> and <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4056310">Hacker News</a> is positive, there is a lot of skepticism around whether the government can succeed.  With this post, I wanted to share some thoughts on the essential building blocks we&rsquo;ll need to make this work.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Building Blocks<br /></strong>I will only speak lightly on essential technical building blocks that need go into Federal Agencies Web APIs, but there are a couple I consider essential:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Access</strong> - Idenitying proper access levels for web APIs, leaving open when possible, requiring keys when needed and implementing oAuth when it makes sense give users control over which applications access their data</li>
<li><strong>REST</strong> - The dominant approach to deploying web APIs, building on top of the existing structure of the World Wide Web.  REST has proven to robust enough for most any web API while keeping it simple and intuitive for access by a  wide audience</li>
<li><strong>JSON</strong> - I&rsquo;m not advocating for getting rid of XML, but JSON is the accepted standard for API communication.  JSON needs to be adopted as the default for federal agency web APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of other technical considerations, but I&rsquo;ll leave that for other experts to deliver on. &nbsp;Next lets get users, onboarded and using each agencies APis.</p>
<p><strong>User Onboarding<br /></strong>There are a lot of challenges for the average web API developer faces when trying to integrate, initial onboarding has to be quick and painless.  There are a couple of essential building blocks that assists in user onboarding:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Landing Page </strong>- A single landing page for everyone to access federal agency APIs, providing single click access to everything you need to get up and running with the API</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service </strong>- API access needs to be self-service, enabling anyone to discover and integrate 24 / 7 without assistance from any agency staff</li>
<li><strong>Account Management - </strong>Allow users to quickly register using common single sign-on using my Twitter, Facebook or Google accounts, and provide users with easy to understand account, key, application and API usage management tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Next for a developer to successfully go from onboarding to, API integration, it will require an essential set of resource building blocks providing everything they need to understand the API interface, and begin using:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Authentication </strong>- Give users a quick introduction to API access including which endpoints are open, keyed or require oAuth for usage.  Also provide links to support technical information about authentication</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Provide simple, complete and up to date documentation for every Web API endpoint. &nbsp;Also consider deploying interactive, smart documention using a technology like Swagger</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples</strong> - Provide sample code for each API endpoint in all the common languages including PHP, Python, Ruby, .NET, Perl, Java, Objective-C, all provided as Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Starter Kits -</strong> Provide as many ready to code sample applications and starter kits to show developers what is possible, all provided as Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Provide mobile specific code samples, SDKs and other resources supporting mobile specific development</li>
</ul>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve provided the essential technical, onboarding and resource building blocks, you need to make sure your your agencies API area has the necessary communication building blocks, allowing you to effectively communicate with users about your API, but also give your users a voice in API operations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - A blog is an essential communication tool in API ecosystems.  Make sure the blog is active, and provides an RSS feed</li>
<li><strong>Forum</strong> - A forum will provide a platform for you to communicate back and forth with API users, providing a rich knowledge for future users, and also opening up the possibility of users helping other users</li>
<li><strong>FAQ</strong> - Provide a simple, realistic and complete list of the most frequently asked questions.  Also keep it a living list, truly reflecting which questions get asked every month</li>
<li><strong>Contact</strong> - Establish some way users can directly contact the agency for support</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active Twitter account is a required communication tool</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - A presence on the top business social network is important</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - An active page on Facebook helps with communication</li>
<li><strong>Google+</strong> - Google's social network can help with developer interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>With proper communication building blocks in place, next make sure and address the legal considerations around the web API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Terms of Use </strong>- Clearly let users know what is expected when they access the agencies web APIs</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Establish clear privacy policies for all people and companies involved</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong> - Provide data, API interface and code licensing for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>With legal expectations set, make sure and think about branding for the agency.  While these web APIs are the federal government, for them to be successful, the word needs to get out that our government does such a find job making data available.  There are some common API branding building blocks emerging to accomplish this:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Requirements</strong> - Establish a base understanding of how to properly attribute the agency in compliance with overall usage requirements</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - Provide a single place to find a selection of approved graphical logos and HTML or JavaScript code snippets users can use when adhering to branding requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>After baking in some user implemented marketing for the agency, with API branding, make sure and provide some operational building blocks that help API users understand what is going on with the agencies APIs and where they are going:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Give users a clear roadmap of where the agency is going with it&rsquo;s digital strategy, providing insight as far in the future as possible</li>
<li><strong>Changelog</strong> - Provide a real-time list of changes made to the API and its supporting building blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing real-time communication on your API operations is important to establishing trust with developers.  If you just make it part of your daily operations, it isn't that much more work.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Developers</strong><br />While planning the digital strategy for your agencies web API make sure and consider non-developers.  One reason for the success of web APIs is that it uses REST, which uses the technology driving the existing World Wide Web, making RESTful APIs potentially familiar to non-developers.  With the right building blocks, web APIs become accessible to a wide variety of users:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Buttons, widgets and badges that are provided on top of a web API provide a copy and paste method for non-developers to quicky make use of the data and information available via an API</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Provide a section dedicated to media, helping media on two fronts 1) to understand what an API does in plain english 2)  to put a web API to potential use in their data journalism efforts</li>
<li><strong>Educational</strong> - Provide information and resources that facilitates API usage by any level of academic research and projects</li>
<li><strong>Platforms&nbsp;</strong> - With introduction of Google Docs, Google Big Query and other big data processing solutions, the opportunity for API integration on these platforms is growing.  Provide templates for using agency APIs within these platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything suggested up until now, truly supports a digital approach, to each agencies digital strategy, but in these environments, the need for face to face and human interaction can be critical to building understanding, awareness and ultimatley a community around a web API.</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong><br />Events are a great way to build awareness around an API, there are several common event building blocks that are used in the industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Annual Conference</strong> - Establish an annual event where each API stake holder and any user can rub elbows and share their thoughts about web APIs</li>
<li><strong>Road Show -</strong> Develop a road show that goes from city-to-city, providing a town hall format for understanding each agencies digital strategy</li>
<li><strong>Meetups</strong> - Attend existing developer meetups and gathers that are already occuring in cities around the country</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Sponsors, attend and put on hackathons that encourage hacking around federal agency APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that represents my thoughts on the essential API building blocks federal agencies should consider while formulating their digital strategy.  The only other area I would offer more details on, is around API evangelism and developer advocacy.  Who will be in charge of getting the word out about an API?  Will this be a single person or shared responsibility?  An API Evanglism strategy is critical to the success of an API, but I think I will cover that in another post.</p>
<p>Scrolling back up the page, this seems like a lot, and potentially counter to my wishes that we start simple and make sure this is a success.  My goal with these thoughts is to provide a potential business framework that could be adopted across all agency deployments.</p>
<p>These building blocks are derived from reviewing the API operations of hundreds of existing public APIs, including industry heavyweights like Google and Amazon.   While some APIs like Twitter deal with API management at massive scale, Google and Amazon provide models for managing large numbers of web APIs.</p>
<p>Make sure and spend some time and look at how Google or Amazon is organizing their developer community. &nbsp;If any developer could go to any of the over 100 agencies, or the over 1000 domains, and find a consistent experience shared across <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> agency web API areas, like they do at Google or Amazon APIs, the chances for success of this iniative is much greater.</p>
<p>I hope someone in one of the agencies reads this, and understands the importance of this moment, and that an API is more than just a CSV or XML dump at a web address.  That, with the right business approach to deploying and managing we can truly transform how government interacts both internally, inter-agency and with the public.  Opening up the federal government to a whole new era of democratic participation, government transparency and interoperability.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/gnip/gnip-logo.jpg" alt="" width="160" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing some big data work.  Ok it isn&rsquo;t really, but feels like I should use that label.   What I&rsquo;m actually doing is analyzing the Twitter activity of top APIs.</p>
<p>I have the twitter handles of 100 of the popular web APIs.  I have been pulling and analyzing the Tweets from each of these accounts via the Twitter API for some time now.</p>
<p>It is time that I scale this to about 500 API twitter accounts, and also start monitoring mentions of each of these APIs on Twitte, while also performing searches for some keywords associated with each API or a group of APIs.</p>
<p>At this stage of growth, it was clear I was outgrowing the regular Twitter API and since what I&rsquo;m doing is more big data, than twitter client app, I am looking at the two approved Twitter resellers <a title="Gnip" href="http://gnip.com/">Gnip</a> and <a title="Datasift" href="http://datasift.com/">Datasift</a>.</p>
<p>First I went to Gnip,  looked at their product and it looked like what I needed.  I saw at the bottom of the page, &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;.  I recognize that language, clicked on it and filled out their form and I get a &ldquo;Thank You, Someone Will Be In Touch&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ok...so I move on to Datasift.  I look at their product and it too, looks like what I need.  I see on the page, &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;.  I recognize that language, clicked on it, logged on with Twitter, added my email and password, and boom--I&rsquo;m dropped into a dashboard.  I am able to build streams from Twitter using different keywords, Twitter users, etc.  I get freemium access, with the ability to put in my credit card and be billed for more.</p>
<p>Next, I got a quick email from a nice fellow at Gnip asking what I was looking to do, and if I had time in the next couple days to talk on the phone. &nbsp;I will definitely talk with them, but by the time I get on the phone with them I will be 2-3 days into developing my solution around Datasift.  Unless Gnip has some secret pricing or some magic features Datasift doesn&rsquo;t have, I probably won&rsquo;t switch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between self service and sales oriented web APIs.  Which one are you?</p>

<p>Many "<a title="public APIs" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/30/public-api-vs-open-api/">public APIs</a>" are launched with well, very "public" intent--to extend the reach of the brand and platform. Many of these APIs are setup to pull data, enabling developers to use it in their applications for free or paid, with the understanding they&rsquo;ll properly attribute the source.</p>
<p>Many of these APIs like Amazon E-Commerce, eBay, Google Places and Foursquare are engineered to publicly extend the central platform, all feeding back back to the &ldquo;mother ship&rdquo;, either through linking or other type of attribution.</p>
<p>As the Internet evolves, and the era of "big data" takes hold, and as the need for processing data and deriving meaning out of the flood of data available to us online grows--so does the demand for API access that isn&rsquo;t marketing centric.</p>
<p>As a big data developer I may be comparing product pricing from Amazon to auctions on eBay, and I may need to use Google Places data to identify best places to sell my products, and Foursquare to identify local demand.  The needs of big data API developers are going to be radically different than maybe your originally intended developer audience.</p>
<p>Hopefully you are already carefully targeting your developers and grouping them by their usage patterns.  Have you identified any users that are actively using your APIs, but not necessarily following regular patterns? &nbsp;Have you reached out to them?</p>
<p>It might be the case that your API won&rsquo;t be of interest to big data developers or quite possibly that this isn&rsquo;t a market you're interested in.  However it is a question every API owner should ask--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">is my API big data ready</span>?</p>

<p>Ok, can I call 2012, the year of the API now?  Of course this announcement makes me extremely excited!  This is something I didn't think I'd see in the next 5 years, but of course I'm super skeptical too.  Is this something that these agencies are capable of?  Is there enough political will to make happen?  I sure hope so.</p>
<p>I've seen some <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/05/open-government-reboot-focuses-on-apis-instead-of-data/">good coverage of this news on popular tech blogs</a>, but we'll have to wait 90 days and see ho many agencies have publicly reported on "progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format", and ultimately how much momentum this actually gets--or if it gets forgotten.</p>
<p>As soon as I can find an API with all government agencies and their websites, I will make a monitoring dashboard showing how many agencies have published anything, and what it contains, and report on my findings in 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>&nbsp;I added the tracking page I talked about above, I will be checking the availability of a digital strategy at each government agency website on a daily basis, and posting the status on my <a title="Federal Agency API Tracking" href="/federal_government.php">Federal Agency API Tracking</a> Page.</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/teapot-steaming.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my effort to better understand API access, I&rsquo;m studying how API owners control access to their APIs, with most recently being around Rate Limiting. The other day I asked,&nbsp;<a title="why do we limit API access for developers" href="/2012/05/29/why-do-we-limit-api-access-for-developers/">why do we limit API access for developers</a>, and even&nbsp;<a title="explored rewarding developers for heavy usage" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">explored rewarding developers for heavy usage</a>.</p>
<p>As I continue to understand the impact of rate limits on developers it&rsquo;s becoming clearer that for an API to successfully impose rate limits, you should also be offering rate limit release valves in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Increase Request Form</strong>&nbsp;- There should be a formal, self-service way to request rate limits either for valid uses that you hadn&rsquo;t considered bumping up against rate limit ceiling, or quite possibly for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Utility Pricing</strong>&nbsp;- Providing a pay as you go model, where users meet the "courtesy limit", they can put in their credit card and pay for what they use above and beyond the default rate limit.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-Rate-Limits.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are many points of friction for developers trying to integrate with an API. In my research, one of the ongoing complaints of developers regarding an API is around rate limits. Many of these complaints are directed at APIs who impose rate limits without any clear path beyond the default limits.</p>
<p>Google seems to be offering opportunities for developers to pay for use beyond their "courtesy limits", providing a form of release valve for developers concerns about API rate limits. &nbsp;Google is providing these release valves for API services via their&nbsp;<a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API Console</a>, but only appear to available for a handful of services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m still unsure about API rate limits in general, it seems clear that if you are going to limit, make sure and provide a release valve in some way, so developers understand what the options are when they hit the ceiling, and that there are opportunities to grow.</p>

<p>I hear a lot of good ones, and bad ones. Even the good ones face an uphill battle to get noticed in an extremely crowded and noisy landscape. The one piece of advice I leave with all startups about how to get their web or mobile app noticed?</p>
<p><strong>Develop an API!!</strong></p>
<p>The one thing an API can do for your startup is allow your product to become a feature in other platforms. If you deliver only as a mobile or web app, you are leaving out numerous opportunities to become the next killer Facebook or Salesforce feature, or something smaller like a Wordpress add-on, but ultimately something that could make enough of a mark, that your startup could survive.</p>
<p>So when you are planning the feature list for your killer startup, make sure you consider an API, and the potential of becoming the next killer feature in an existing platform.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-affiliate-network.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my quest to understand the monetization opportunities via APIs, I&rsquo;m studying the possibilites around tracking, and now monetization of content and URL&rsquo;s served up via APIs.</p>
<p>The other day I considered <a title="wrapping URLs for another layer of metrics in your API" href="/2012/05/26/wrapping-content-urls-for-another-layer-of-metrics-in-your-api/">wrapping URLs for another layer of metrics in your API</a>, and today I&rsquo;m thinking about how to evolve API monetization beyond advertising, defining entirely new API driven conversion events where both API owners and consumers, can realistically make money.</p>
<p>I first talked about an <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs and developers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/">advertising network dedicated to APIs and developers</a> last year, and everytime I come back to it in my Evernote list, I can&rsquo;t help but consider using the <a title="Google Affiliate Network" href="http://www.google.com/ads/affiliatenetwork/">Google Affiliate Network</a> as an engine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any access to Google Affiliate Network (I submitted request), so all of this is speculative.  But after looking through the <a href="https://developers.google.com/affiliate-network/">Google Afffiliate Network API interface</a>, it looks like I can pull both advertisers, publishers and events through the API-- so I&rsquo;m envisioning two scenarios:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Owners</strong> - As an API owner I could use the Google Affiliate network to define &ldquo;events&rdquo; that could occur via my APIs, and setup my API developers as &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>API Consumers</strong> - As an API consumer I could setup various APIs I use as &ldquo;advertisers&rdquo;, creating specific events for these APIs, and setup my own applications or sites as &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-url-shortener.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In either case, API owners or API consumers could replace any URLs in content or URLs directly served up via APIs with a Google Affiliate Network generated URL with specific conversion events defined, then shortened using <a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a>.</p>
<p>This would create a layer of not just metrics, but conversion events that could be monetized.  API consumers could choose from affiliate opportunities available on the Google Affiliate Network, and API owners could do the same, or define their own conversion events that were meaningful to their business goals.</p>
<p>These are just some original thoughts on API monetization using <a href="https://developers.google.com/affiliate-network/">Google Afffiliate Network API</a> and the <a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a>.  Seems like there is a lot of opportunity monetize the data and resources flowing through API pipes, whether you&rsquo;re an API owner or avid API consumer.</p>

Fast forward 5 months, <a href="http://www.thefancy.com/help/mobile">The Fancy has just launched an update to their iOS</a> which includes the ability to purchase products from the mobile app with just one click.</p>
<p>Nice move!  The Fancy is definitely an easier and cleaner looking site than  Pinterest, and with a monetization move, The Fancy could gain even more market share against Pinterest.</p>
<p>Now if The Fancy wanted to seal the deal and put a death nail in Pinterest's coffin, they should launch an API, and make The Fancy a platform.  Don't just open up API access to your content--open up API access to your new commerce layer as well.</p>
<p>Once you have this mapped out, deploy a well crafted suite of embeddable objects, like share and buy buttons, along with essential widgets--all with the commerce layer built in.</p>

<p>Developers and non-developers will make sure The Fancy becomes ubiquitous across the web, and because you chose to consider monetization, while making your platform play, and included developers in this model, the entire platform will be sustainable and outlast anything Pinterest can come up with.</p>

<p>I stumbled across UW APIs via a <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> update of 7 web services from the University.  I started looking around further, and discovered there were 29 total APIs available at UW Web Services.  I&rsquo;m not sure why only 7 are listed at PW, but right there you start seeing slippage in the current API directory model.</p>
<p>Quickly invdividual schools are going to face the same <a title="problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs</a> and need to standardize their management platform with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Access</strong> - Usage of a healthy balance of keys and OAuth for accessing school and student data&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Establish some sort of WADL or other discovery service that can feed not just a human directory but IDEs and other programmatic discovery.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Explorer</strong> - Provide an API explorer so developers and even non-programmers can make calls against any API without writing code&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> - Establish some sort of billing layer, if only for making high volume users pay for access and pay for infrastructure--but also possibly opening up new revenue streams for universities</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/universities/univeristy-info-systems.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In addition to these areas, Universities will have to establish a common set of API building blocks that they will use across all departments, creating a consistent API area for developers to use while learning about and integrating with University Web Services.</p>
<p>With some proper planning and a little work, each University could setup a highly functional API strateg and management framework allowing them to efficiently manage not just dozens of APIs, but thousands across all areas of the University.</p>
<p>Think of the opportunities for students to build out much needed mobile and web applications around school information as part of class projects.  The benefits of having self-service interfaces that individual departments can use to get the information they need, as well as for 3rd party vendors who need access to vital school data.</p>
<p>Next, would be to create a state and federal discovery layer on top of each University, allowing better oversight and interaction between government and Universities--but that will have to come later, we have a lot of work to do at each University before we get there.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/05/29/why-do-we-limit-api-access-for-developers/">Why Do We Limit API Access for Developers?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Rate-Limiting.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am putting a lot of thought into why we limit API access for developers. &nbsp;I understand requiring keys to access APIs, and tracking who has access to your API, so you can understand how they are using it. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why you&rsquo;d want to limit API access.</p>
<p>By limit, I mean...here is an API, you get 100 calls, then no more! No option for paying, begging or pleading for more access. There are some APIs (I will evaluate specific APIs in the future), that have this approach, and it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Last year I touched on this subject with a post in ProgrammableWeb called,&nbsp;<a title="Should We Be Limiting Developers&rsquo; API Usage" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">Should We Be Limiting Developers&rsquo; API Usage</a>? Where I flip this model on its head and showcase two API providers, YellowAPI and ironically enough Qwerly (another story by itself), and how they were actually rewarding developers for more API usage.</p>
<p>I understand that in the early days, limiting access was a way to keep people from using their APIs too much, but I think in the era of cloud computing, that throttling as opposed to limiting is a better option. Let price control a developers API usage, and set that price at a level that is logical for this equation.</p>
<p>If your limiting developers from using your API, why even have one? It seems like you should sit down and re-evaluate your business model. I hope you don&rsquo;t have other products that your customers can access, that at some point you cut them off and say, you can&rsquo;t have anymore.</p>

<p>APIs are making information more accessible across many industries and sectors, but one area I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of movement, until recently, is at Universities.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/04/27/the-new-harvard-library-open-metadata-policy/">Harvard openly licensed their library meta data</a> and through a partnership with the <a title="Digital Public Library of America" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/dpla">Digital Public Library of America</a>, made it <a href="http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/content/digital-access-scholarship-harvard-dash-dataset">available via APIs</a>.

<p>Its grest to see that the University is trying to create a single directory of all University web services, and even has an API suggestion service where students and faculty can submit and vote on ideas for new, useful campus APIs.</p>

<p>With the volatility of school funding, online learning and just overall competition in higher ed, Universities need to start noticing of the transformative powers of APIs, and how it can make University operations more transparent, accessible and nimble, and potentially even save money when it comes to empowering the students themselves to build interfaces for accessing vital University information.</p>

<p>Twitter just <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/05/improving-performance-on-twittercom.html">rolled back their architectural approach for Twitter.com</a> back to a server side implementation.</p>
<p>If you remember back in September of 2010, <a href="/admin/blog/twitter+eats+own+dogfood+api+evangelist">Twitter rebuilt Twitter.com to use a web application architecture</a> that pushed all of the UI rendering and logic to Javascript running in the browser and consumed the Twitter API directly.</p>
<p>Now they are "taking back control" of their front-end performance by moving the rendering back to the server.  They don't say whether they don't use the APIs at all, but I am working under the assumption that they abandoned them.</p>
<p>Twitter felt the API driven web application architecture broke new ground, offered a number of advantages, but it lacked support for various optimization techniques available only on the server.</p>
<p>I was excited to see Twitter go with the API driven approach, along other sites, like <a title="FCC Website" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">the FCC</a>. &nbsp;I hate to see them abandon it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What does this say about an API oriented architecture?</strong></em></p>
<p>Are we not ready?  Are there are not enough tools for optimization, or the talent to deliver the performance necessary for Internet at scale via API driven architecture? &nbsp;Or maybe there are other business reasons for stopping eating their own dog food and going back to a server side architecture?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m documenting Twitter&rsquo;s process of wrapping the URLs contained within tweets, using a shorter URL like t.co.  I&rsquo;m interested in understanding the opportunities around URL wrapping (aka URL shortening) as an API business strategy.</p>
<p>From an API business perspective, the reasoning for implementing URL wrapping as part of your API would be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Saving Space </strong>- By shortening URLs you are reducing the length of any string that contains URLs, and in cases like Twitters, every character counts</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Twitter is actively combating URLs that carry malicious intent</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Each shortened URL provides a mechanism for tracking clicks on URL within content</li>
</ul>
<p>Shold URL wrapping be something API owners adopt for all content served up via an API?  Could every URL within content served up via an API be wrapped, allowing tracking of clicks through that URL--no matter where that content ended up living after it left the API?</p>
<p>Just some initial thoughts, but it seems that a comprehensive linking strategy could be established, bundled with a URL shortening service like <a href="https://bitly.com/">Bit.ly</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/">Google URL Shortener</a> or a custom service--and provide a new layer of metrics that could be used to tell how your developers and their application users are interacting with the content you serve up via your API.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to explain what APIs are to someone sitting next to me on the plane is to find something the user does every day, that is driven by an API, and explain how an API drives the functionality they take for granted.</p>
<p>I tend to look for industry specific examples if they are an accountant or stock broker, but the most common example I use, is Facebook.  Facebook is technology everyone I meet has exposure with.</p>
<p>My story always starts with Facebook.com, and how the social networking website was built for people.  People go to www.facebook.com and they see HTML web pages, that allow them to interact with the community.</p>
<p>Next I move to the Facebook application on their mobile phone.  While the application is built for people to use, the application needs a way to talk with Facebook--in comes APIs.  APIs are a way for other programs to interact with Facebook, providing a interface for developers to build applications that use Facebook.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iPhone-Facebook-Login.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you first login to Facebook on your mobile phone, the applications makes a request to the Facebook Authentication API, and gives your mobile application rights to interact with your Facebook account on your behalf.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iPHone-Facebook-Auth.png" alt="" width="325" align="left" /></p>
<p>After your logged into the Facebook application on your mobile app, every action you take will make an API call.  When you click on your news feed, update your status, look at photos or check-in to a place, they each represent a different call to the <a title="Facebook Open Graph API" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Open Graph API</a>.   The Open Graph API exposes almost every aspect of Facebook as a programmatic interface that applications can use, hence the name Application Programming Interface (API).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most online technologies that you use everyday have APIs.  Amazon, EBay, Facebook, Twitter and Google all have APIs, allowing developers to build applications on top of their businesses, turning their websites into web services.</p>
<p>With the grwoth of the smart phone and tablet markets, the number of, and usage of APIs are exploding, silently driving the mobile applications like Facebook that are part of your everyday lives.</p>

<p>Here we are going into June, and I still don&rsquo;t see a publicly available <a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> API.  Jay Yarow wrote in Business Insider back in February, "<a title="Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-26/tech/31238519_1_mobile-apps-twitterrific-hootsuite">Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited</a>" and Adam Duvander wrote in ProgrammableWeb, "<a title="Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/09/pinterest-api-coming-soon-or-already-here/">Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here</a>?".</p>
<p>There is also a <a title="reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati" href="http://www.quora.com/Pinterest/Is-there-an-API-for-Pinterest-that-allows-users-to-display-a-set-of-pins-photos-on-your-own-website">reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati</a>, Lead Engineer at Pinterest from May 2011, saying the API is 2-3 weeks away.  It&rsquo;s now a year later and there is no official API (<a title="rogue api" href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">there is a Rogue API</a>).</p>
<p><a title="Business Insider" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/">Business Insider</a> says, Pinterest fears having a <strong><em>"<a title="Twitter Problem" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-26/tech/31238519_1_mobile-apps-twitterrific-hootsuite">Twitter problem</a>&rdquo;</em></strong>.  Meaning that when Twitter released its API, it was still an immature company, allowing developers to build applications with features that it was missing--then Twitter matured, and it wanted to control its platform, it began adding building its own features and poaching from the Twitter API ecosystem.</p>
<p>So why not learn from Twitter and other APIs, and use the appropriate API building blocks to address this:</p>
<p><a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinterest/Pinterest-Home-Page.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong> - Establish branding guidelines that clearly lays out what apps that use Pinterest API should look like</li>
<li><strong>UI / UX Toolkit</strong> - Provide a UI / UX toolkit like Twitter Bootstrap that sets the tone for applications built on the API</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Provide a real-time and transparent roadmap that developers can use to help keep their development efforts in line with Pinterest</li>
<li><strong>Developer Framework</strong> - Establish a developer framework outlining opportunities for developers to become stronger members of API community, also introducing possible investment and incubation of most success or important features</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong> - Establish a fair and equitable terms of use that protects Pinterests but acknowledges the commercial aspirations of developers</li>
<li><strong>Events / Meetups</strong> - Establish a roadshow or network of meetups that brings developers together and makes them part of the Pinterest API community</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the ways Pinterest could establish a solid business strategy for their API that would not only protect developer interests, it would establish the Pinterest API as an external research &amp; development department, with a built in incubation component.</p>
<p>Pinterest has already missed out on a year of developers innovating on their platform.  Why continue holding back innovation?  Establish a flexible API business strategy that allows for you to learn from the mistakes made by Twitter, and become the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pinterests-api-is-coming-soon-and-vcs-are-super-excited-2012-2">platform VC&rsquo;s are looking for you to become</a>.</p>

When asked about the vision of their API program Dan Raju CIO of TradeKing says:</p>

<blockquote><em>We are one of the top-ranked online brokerages in the country, growing very rapidly. We manage people's assets, give them a set of capabilities to trade, and offer an extremely transparent pricing structure. However, we recognized that our customers&rsquo; demands for next-generation interfaces are rapidly changing, and our API helps us stay in front of that. We anticipate that in the next phase, the API will be a meaningful revenue driver for us. It is already opening us up to new markets.  We will continue to develop our own platforms on the API and incentivize and engage our development partners.  At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about delivering value to our customers, and the API will continue to help us drive increased value at an accelerated pace.</em></blockquote>

<p>Raju hits on all the best of the API buzzwords including transparency, rapid change, meaningful revenue, open to new markets, and delivering value to end-customers.</p>
<p>I feel TradeKings vision of their API program, speak to larger visions of the API driven economy we are now immersed in, and provide a great example we can reference when helping other companies not just understand what an API is, but the imperative for their companies to embrace APIs and actively join the API economy.</p>

<p>While the number of users clicking, viewing on stories is very cool, I&rsquo;m interested in their stats regarding the authorization dialog.  Insights provides data on how many times people access your dialog authorization, with the number of acceptances, while also breaking down the number of views, acceptances into a corresponding conversion rate.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook-insights-auth.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>If your authorization dialog prompts users for different permission sets, you&rsquo;ll also see a breakdown of the impressions, accepts and CTR for each one, showing you the rates at which people accept and reject different permission sets--helping you to identify the most optimal permission set for your authorization dialog, which will directly help increase user installs for your app.</p>
<p>This kind of insights for developers is critical, helping them understand the level of engagement with users and build a more effective Auth Dialog flow, which could make or break an applications Facebook Open Graph integration and adoption.</p>
<p>Providing developers with analytics to evaluate their users API usage is so valuable, I wonder if I can find any other examples of this granular type of OAuth reporting with other APIs or from API service providers like Apigee?</p>

<p>Nike is working on a new API as part of their <a title="Nike Better World initative" href="http://www.nikebetterworld.com/">Nike Better World initative</a>.  The <a title="API provides access to a materials sustainability index" href="http://nikemsiapi.nikebetterworld.com/">API provides access to a materials sustainability index</a>, which evaluates the environmental impact of materials used by manufacturers.</p>
<p>The scoring system evaluates the environmental impacts of materials used in products using a combination of materials-specific data, covering areas such as Chemistry, Energy and Greenhouse Gas Intensity, Water and Land Use Intensity, and Waste.</p>
<p>The <a title="Nike Materials Sustainability Index API" href="http://nikemsiapi.nikebetterworld.com/">Nike Materials Sustainability Index API</a> is only in alpha stage right now, and is undergoing for a peer review process with Duke University.  You can follow their <a title="Nike Makers Blog" href="http://nikemakers.tumblr.com/">Nike Maker&rsquo;s Blog</a> to get more information on the initiative and get notified when the API will be available to the public.</p>

<p>Adam Duvander (<a href="/admin/blog/Adam Duvander">@adamd</a>)&nbsp;<a title="reported at ProgrammableWeb today that they rolled over 6,000 public APIs in the directory" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">reported at ProgrammableWeb today that they rolled over 6,000 public APIs in the directory</a>.  The pace at which companies are launching public APIs is accelerating, with the last 1,000 added in just 3 months.</p>
<p>Any of us in the space knows that this is just the <a title="tip of the iceberg" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/11/03/private-api/">tip of the iceberg</a>, and Adam acknowledges that internal API usage is a major factor in API growth.  While public APIs get all the major press, there are many private API initiatives that won&rsquo;t see the light of day.</p>
<p>So my question is, how are we going to track on the growth of private APIs along with public APIs?  Since mobile app development is such an important piece, can we count mobile apps produced by a company?  Can we count on API service providers to start reporting on this data?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answer.  It is something I think we need to figure out, not just so ProgrammableWeb can have its finger on the pulse, but there is an ever increasing amount of business and personal resources flowing through these API pipes, we need to have an understanding of where these API pipes are laid, which industries, etc.</p>
<p>Much like the rollout of fiber in the late 90&rsquo;s, we are going to see massive API rollouts, without much oversight and map of where these virtual pipes are.  I&rsquo;d like to hear more about how we can work together to build a map of the back-end of the new API driven economy.</p>

<p>One service that was a catalyst for the event occuring, was assistance from <a title="EventUp" href="http://eventup.com/">EventUp</a>.  EventUp is a service that assists event venue owners in finding people to rent their space, and in turn can help you find the ideal location for your hackathon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tony Adam (<a title="@tonyadam" href="https://twitter.com/#!/tonyadam">@tonyadam</a>) the owner of EventUp emailed me one day after I had submitted a request via eventup.com for more information on venues for my Hackathon in the Los Angeles area.

<p>After a couple days he helped me secure <a href="http://www.coloft.com/">CoLoft</a> which was the best location for the hackathon imaginable.  It was accessible, had great layout with tables, good wifi and the staff was extremely helpful.</p>
<p><a title="EventUp" href="http://eventup.com/">EventUp</a> isn&rsquo;t in all markets yet, but if you&rsquo;re planning a hackathon I recommend talking with Tony at Eventup, and seeing if they have the right location for your event.</p>

In my mind I see an interconnected world of products and commerce, where every business has an API.</p>
<p>APIs finally seem to be maturing, reaching a point where they can deliver at the scale and reliability we need, to really make this happen.  Three good examples of this are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="The StructuredRetailProducts.com API" href="http://www.structuredretailproducts.com/tab/api.html">The StructuredRetailProducts.com API</a></strong> - Providing to access to over 3 million individual product listings from 1700+ companies, representing total sales of over &pound;3,382 billion and counting. Access 15+ years of product and market data across 72 different countries at the click of a button and get the latest data on sales volumes, activity levels, and market share.</li>
<li><strong><a title="The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API</a></strong> - A Digital Commerce Engine&trade; for driving any e-commerce experience, on any device or platform, allowing companies to build compelling product experiences, leverage new business models, and extend their reach to emerging end points.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Stripe API" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe API</a></strong> - A complete payment platform, that handles everything, including storing cards, subscriptions, and direct payouts to your bank account, without a merchant account or gateway.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you look through those three APIs, you see the simplicity of REST + JSON, plus the essential building blocks to support developers, and the power and scalability you need to drive commerce in the API driven economy.</p>

<p>Last week Facebook <a title="announced a new App Center" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/05/09/introducing-the-app-center/">announced a new App Center</a> where developers can submit applications they've built. &nbsp;Like any API owner, Facebook is looking for high quality applications to list in its directory and has published a list of App Center Best Practices:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Websites must provide a personalized experienc</strong>e - All websites and mobile web apps need to immediately present authenticated users with a logged-in experience. Specifically, we&rsquo;re looking for personalization, such as name and profile picture, so users know that their Facebook information is being used to create an account. </li>
<li><strong>Review your app settings </strong>- App detail pages are dynamic based on the integrations you&rsquo;ve specified on the basic settings page of the Developer App. Be sure to review this and remove any old or non-functional integrations. </li>
<li><strong>Provide high-quality images -</strong> Your images should match the quality of your app. As specified in the guidelines, images shouldn&rsquo;t have buttons, excessive text, borders, dropshadows, URLs, promotions, pricing, or third-party logos. </li>
<li><strong>Input accurate names &amp; thoughtful descriptions -</strong> Don&rsquo;t add any additional keywords to the name of your app. Proofread your app description for spelling and grammar and remove unnecessary symbols, like stars, hearts and multiple exclamation points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some food for thought. Every app center will be different and have different requirements. I think I will add App Center Best Practices as a <a title="building block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">building block</a>, after I look at a wide selection of other API app showcases, and identify some common best practices.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 May 2012</span>
        <p><a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/kr_pb_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Explaining to developers, what an API does, can be hard.  How you describe your API, the underlying endpoints, can make or break user adoption.  You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to evolve, and keep trying to find the sweet spot in both the language and branding that you use in your API area.</p>
<p>I saw an example of this today, with the restructuring of <a href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr's APis</a>.  When I first starting playing with PeopleBrowsr's APIs, they were broken into 3 separate APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>PeopleBrowsr API</li>
<li>Kredentials API</li>
<li>Kred API</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface its really hard to know what each of these APIs does, but after I dove in I saw lots of value within individual methods, but I really had to spend time, getting to know each method, one by one.  I saw the value, but the structure and presentation of the PeopleBrowsr API area, and the way the interfaces were assembled, didn&rsquo;t immediately speak to this value.</p>
<p>Today they&rsquo;ve restructured their three APis into a single API, dubbed the <a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr Kred API</a>, and grouped all the API methods into four logical groups:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/kred-dashboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Find Influencers" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/find">Find Influencers</a></strong> -  Pinpoints influential people on any subject or within communities connected by shared interests or affinities.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Deep Analytics" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/deep">Deep Analytics</a></strong> -  Author-based analytics which includes Kredentials (a single-screen summary of anyone&rsquo;s social presence), historical Kred scores, reach, and friends &amp; followers. </li>
<li><strong><a title="Action Analytics" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/action">Action Analytics</a></strong> - Aggregated social data metrics for any keyword, hashtag or @name, including mention counts, word clouds and hashtag clouds.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Global Kred Score" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/kred">Global Kred Score</a></strong> - Appends global Kred scores to @names or twitter IDs in web-based applications. </li>
</ul>
<p>This new presentation immediately helps me understand which methods I should use based upon my goals.  PeopleBrowsr took the time to understand how developers were using their API, and worked to present the API in a way that best speaks to this.</p>
<p>PeopleBrowsr also took the time to understand the value delivered via their API in each of these new areas and restructure pricing to reflect this value:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Find Influencers -  $1.00 per call</li>
<li>Deep Analytics -  .10 cents per call</li>
<li>Action Analytics  - .01 cent per call</li>
<li>Global Kred Score  - Free</li>
</ul>
<p>Only time will tell if the new structure of the <a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr Kred API</a> will truly speak to developers that are looking to harvest insights from social media, but I like what they did to understand the needs of their developers, and work to better deliver the API presentation, documentation and pricing to reflect this need.</p>
<p>Make sure you are tuned into what your API developers are looking for and aren&rsquo;t afraid to evolve and better serve your developer community.</p>

<p>API metrics are an essential, but what should we measure?  There are two metrics that seems to dominate discussions about success of the API industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Number of New API Registration</li>
<li>Number of Daily and Monthly API Calls</li>
</ul>
<p>Every API I&rsquo;ve consulted with, use the same two metrics, if they have any at all.  The tech blogosphere (driven by <a title="API service proviers" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a>) have created a so call <a title="billionaires club" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/">billionaires club</a>, showcasing APIs that have over a billion API calls within a day or month.</p>
<p>Investors are even using the number of API calls as a<a title="considered a metric you can use to consider the valuation of a company by investors" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/kleiner-klout-30-million/">&nbsp;metric to consider the valuation of a company</a>, and seen as a good indicator of the demand for a company&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>I agree that new registrations and number of API calls are a start, but we should be able to identify many other metrics to truly measure the activity and success of an API and the sentiment of it's API developer community.</p>

<p>While over the last two years I&rsquo;ve worked for clients like <a title="Mimeo" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> and <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid</a>, my ultimate goal is to focus on studying the Business of APIs.  So whenever I get the time, I study how popular APIs operate, and how they are transforming industries.</p>
<p>This month, I&rsquo;m getting the opportunity to dive deeper into my research around different API business models, with the chance to look at the politics within specific API ecosystems.</p>
<p>While my research will always span the entire API sector, this round I&rsquo;m going to study the approach of some of the most successful APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Deep understanding of the largest, and most important API ecosystem</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Better understanding of the largest API driven social platform</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> - Document the 100 or so APIs offered by Google, and the platform that connects them</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Better picture of the leading business social network platform</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> - Document the history of this API pioneer</li>
<li><strong>Twilio</strong> - Understand how Twilio continues to deliver their API, and woo developers</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to begin by&nbsp;<a title="analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/06/the-business-and-politics-of-twitters-api/">analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem</a>, and as more funding comes through I&rsquo;ll focus on the other APis.  While studying each API I look at:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Historical company blog posts, tweets and press releases</li>
<li>Historical blog posts and tweets from the blogosphere and developers</li>
</ul>
<p>I organize all my research into a curation framework I&rsquo;ve developed and will be generating:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Timeline</strong> - A easy to navigate, timeline of the APIs history through curated blog posts, tweets and company announcments.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Posts</strong>&nbsp;- Single and series of blog posts documenting the business and politics of each API provider.</li>
<li><strong>Final Paper(s)</strong> - Each project will have at least one final white-paper with findings from the research.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Research</strong> - A searchable repository of curated research and notes from my work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then making this work available across both <a title="apievangelist.com" href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> and my new blog <a title="apivoice.com" href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>, which tends to focus on the politics of APIs including legal and other issues affecting developer ecosystems.</p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that this new round of research will help me better understand the business and politics of APIs, produce rich research, stories and industry reports that I can make available--helping us all better understand this ever changing API economy.</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-legal.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I attended a great webinar put on by the folks at <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> last week, where they discussed <a title="APIs &amp; Copyright" href="http://www.slideshare.net/apigee/apis-copyrights">APIs &amp; Copyright</a>.  A very timely discussion with the recent API copyright decision in the EU, and from the ongoing <a title="Oracle vs. Google" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/07/us-precedent-for-api-copyright-hinges-on-oracle-v-google/">Oracle vs. Google case</a>.</p>
<p>As I process all discussions around API copyright, I&rsquo;m going to publish relevant pieces here at <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com/">API Voice</a>, for everyone else to process along with me.  One interesting piece of the Apigee discussion is that APIs have been copyrightable for the last 22 years--specifically referencing the <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19892059886F2d1173_11869.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006">JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC. v. PHOENIX CONTROL SYSTEMS, INC.</a> from October 3rd, 1989.  On <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=3&amp;xmldoc=19892059886F2d1173_11869.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006&amp;SizeDisp=7">page three</a>, it states:</p>
<blockquote><em>"A computer program is made up of several different components, including the source and object code, the structure, sequence and/or organization of the program, the user interface, and the function, or purpose, of the program. Whether a particular component of a program is protected by a copyright depends on whether it qualifies as an "expression" of an idea, rather than the idea itself."</em></blockquote>
<p>Beyond Johnson Controls, Inc v. Phoenix Control Systems, it appears there is further precedent to apply copyright to APIs.  The filing also references:</p>
<blockquote><em>See Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.,<a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlcontentlinks.aspx?gfile=471%20U.S.%20539">471 U.S. 539</a>, 547, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2223, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985); Data East USA, Inc. v.

<p>I think the questions API owners and developers should be asking themselves is not, whether or not they might have to think about API copyright protection in the future, but that it is something they should be discussing now, when it comes to their other legal API&nbsp;building blocks like&nbsp;<a title="terms of use" href="/buildingblocks/terms_of_use__conditions.php">terms of use</a>,&nbsp;<a title="privacy" href="/buildingblocks/privacy.php">privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="branding" href="/buildingblocks/branding.php">branding</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/05/14/api-innovation-at-the-edinburgh-festivals/">API Innovation at the Edinburgh Festivals</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 May 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for API stories that capture the power of APIs, showcasing how they are transforming industries and businesses around the globe. Today, my global API monitoring platform picked up one such story in Edinburg, Scotland.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, the summer-based <a title="Edinburgh Festivals" href="http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/">Edinburgh Festivals</a> made their event listings data publicly available for digital developers and technologists, via web APIs.  There are seven events participating in the API:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/edinburgh-photo1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Edinburgh Jazz &amp; Blues Festival" href="http://www.edinburghjazzfestival.com/">Edinburgh Jazz &amp; Blues Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Art Festival" href="http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/">Edinburgh Art Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo" href="http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/">Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Mela" href="http://www.edinburgh-mela.co.uk/">Edinburgh Mela</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh International Festival" href="http://www.eif.co.uk/">Edinburgh International Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh International Book Festival" href="http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/">Edinburgh International Book Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Festival Fringe" href="http://www.edfringe.com/">Edinburgh Festival Fringe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all the printed brochures and media coverage, with 44,000 performances in 3,000 separate venues, discovery, planning and finding what you want to see at the Edinburgh festivals is a near impossible task.  Event organizers needed a way to provide the most up to date event information for the media and press, while also delivering the most enhanced experience possible for festival goers.</p>
<p>So, upholding their commitment to openness and innovation, the <a href="http://festivalslab.com/">Edinburgh Festival organizers decided to release their data via API</a>.  With an API they hoped to challenge developers to build things that extended the reach of the festival, beyond what the event could do themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://festivalslab.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/Edinburgh-Festivals-Innovation-Lab.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
</ul>
<p>Immediately festival organizers started seeing innovation around the API, and further encouraged developers with the <a href="http://ideas.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/">Edinburgh Festivals Idea Challenge</a>, offering prizes to the top 25 of 291 ideas submitted. &nbsp;The Edinburgh Festival API has spawned many projects including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Festipods</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; a fun and engrossing way of visualizing the Edinburgh festival events that you have attended</li>
<li><strong>Festivalclock.com</strong>&nbsp;- a beautiful visualisation of the summer festivals listings information</li>
<li><strong>FakeFringe</strong>&nbsp;- a fun game where players have to guess which Fringe show description is real and which is the fake</li>
<li><strong>Festafriend</strong>&nbsp;- a website that uses the festivals as a way for people to date and make new friends</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/acoulton">Andrew Coulton (@acoulton)</a>, of the Ediburgh International Book Festival was very excited about APIs from the beginning, realizing there was a lot that they wanted to accomplish, but didn't have the resources internally to make happen, and had hopes that the API could help deliver.  Coulton states that when you focus on providing the best quality data possible, building a developer community--that is when the most exciting things happen can happen around your API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/Andrew-Coulton.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>Looking back, Coulton says they had to focus on three key areas, to make the API happen:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Business</strong> - Making the business case for deploying an API</li>
<li><strong>Technical</strong> - Overcoming technical challenges with deploying an API</li>
<li><strong>Emotional</strong> - Overcoming historically proprietary attitudes of event organizers regarding their data</li>
</ul>
<p>The Edinburgh Festival's innovation around their API is a great case-study for any business, arts, tourism or sporting event organizer, who wants to take their event to the next level.  While there are definitely some major challenges to deploying a festival API, the potential for strengthening the event's brand, showcasing performers, keeping media up-to-date and creating the best possible experience for festival goers is massive.</p>

<p>There are a lot of high value APIs emerging these days,  APIs with access to essential business data, resources and intelligence.</p>
<p>When designing your API you want to make the interface as intuitive as possible, and ensure&nbsp;as wide as access to it as you possibly can.&nbsp;To quote Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO regarding Java APIs:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We wanted to build the biggest tent and invite as many people as possible,&rdquo; Schwartz said. &ldquo;You have open APIs and compete on implementations."</em></blockquote>
<p>To do this, I encourage building tools and widgets that non-developers can use when working with your API.  A great example of this is at Google, with their <a title="Google Analytics Dashboard" href="http://analytics-api-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/reporting/javascript/ez-ga-dash/docs/user-documentation.html">Google Analytics Dashboard Library</a>.  Google wanted to make it <a title="easier for users to deploy a dashboard" href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/05/new-google-analytics-easy-dashboard.html">easier for users to deploy a dashboard</a> that was tailored specifically for their business, so using a team of University of California Irvine students, they set out to simplify it down to 3 steps:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Register with Google APIs Console.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the JavaScript code.</li>
<li>Configure this code to query your data and choose a chart type to visualize it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you still have to be JavaScript savvy to work with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library, understand how to edit your site, and be fluent in Google Analytics--but it&rsquo;s a step closer to providing wider access to the power of the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics API</a>, beyond just the development community.</p>
<p>LinkedIn also has some great examples of taking concept this to the next level with their <a title="plugin builders" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins/member-profile-plugin-generator">&ldquo;plugin&rdquo; builders</a> which essentially generates the widgets for users, using the API. Since Google is going to keep working with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library over the next 3 quarters, so I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see their library evolve as well.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Widget-Builder.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep exploring other great examples of API embeddable strategies that can potentially bring in a much wider audience, opening up your API for access beyond developers, potentially bringing in other more business oriented groups.</p>

<p>Twitter has an innovative approach to presenting the objects that make up the Twitter Platform.  They have built a&nbsp;<a title="field guide to Twitter Platform objects" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects">field guide to Twitter Platform objects</a>, designed like an <a title="Audubon Society" href="http://www.audubon.org/">Audubon Society</a> field guide, describing the four primaty Twitter objects:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Tweets</strong> -&nbsp;Also known as a&nbsp;Status Update, Tweets are the basic atomic unit of all things Twitter. Users&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">create Tweets</a>. Tweets can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets">embedded</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">replied to</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/favorites/create/%3Aid">favorited</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/favorites/destroy/%3Aid">unfavorited</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/retweet/%3Aid">retweeted</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/destroy/%3Aid">unretweeted</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/destroy/%3Aid">deleted</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> -&nbsp;Users can be anyone or anything. They&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">tweet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/friendships/create">follow</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/lists/create">create lists</a>, have a&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/home_timeline">home_timeline</a>, can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/mentions">mentioned</a>, and can be<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/users/lookup">looked up</a>&nbsp;in bulk.</li>
<li><strong>Entities</strong> -&nbsp;Entities provide metadata and additional contextual information about content posted on Twitter. Entities are never divorced from the content they describe. After May 14th, 2012&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-entities">Tweet Entities</a>&nbsp;will be returned wherever&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets">Tweets</a>&nbsp;are found in the API. Entities are instrumental in&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tco-url-wrapper">resolving URLs</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Places</strong> -&nbsp;Places are specific, named locations with corresponding geo coordinates. They can be attached to&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets">Tweets</a>&nbsp;by specifying a&nbsp;<tt>place_id</tt>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">tweeting</a>. Tweets associated with places are not necessarily issued from that location but could also potentially be&nbsp;<em>about</em>&nbsp;that location.&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/geo/id/%3Aplace_id">Places</a>&nbsp;can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/geo/place">created</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/geo/search">searched for</a>. Tweets can also be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/places/finding-tweets-about-places">found</a>&nbsp;by place_id.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is a creative way to educate users about the Twitter API, making it more visually appealing. Beyond that, I'm not sure it helps developers get up and running using the API, but who knows...it might make it more accessible to some users.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you seen any other creative wasy of displaying API documentaton?</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">03 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/internet-commerce.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As my professional career moved online during the years between 1995 and 2000, I had numerous visions about what the World Wide Web could do for businesses.  I think I shared these visions with millions of other individuals, fueling what we now know as the first Internet bubble.</p>
<p>I saw e-commerce driving entirely new businesses that could operate entirely online, and strengthen existing brick and mortar businesses allowing anyone to buy and sell goods and services from anywhere, instantly.</p>
<p>What we ended up with was still important, but the web 1.0 world was not quite as grand as I think some of us had envisioned.   <a title="E-Bay History of APIs" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">E-Bay</a>, <a title="Amazon History of APIs" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> and Paypal definitely went further than many e-commerce platforms and service providers, and I firmly believe their embrace of web APIs was the reason for this.</p>
<p>While e-commerce has undeniably grown and evolved, other new concepts like social and cloud computing took center stage in creating an entirely new vision of the Internet, concepts we didn&rsquo;t even conceive in the early days of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Years later, driven by APIs, I think we are just now beginning to deliver on the early visions of commerce on the Internet.  <a title="E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath</a> are delivering on this vision by offering up a mature and robust <a title="e-commerce engine" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/products/features">e-commerce engine</a> completely accessible by a truly RESTful API.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elasticpath-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using ElasticPath you can define and execute against any vision of commerce whether it involves physical or virtual goods, with any type of pricing, offers or subscriptions that enable purchasing of these products on truly any platform or any device, in a myriad of ways only limited by your imagination.</p>
<p>ElasticPath delivers by starting with a hardened and complete e-commerce engine that drives clients like Google and Sony, and proven by driving extreme online and offline commerce scenarios like the <a title="Vancouver Winter Olympics" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/company/news/2007/vancouver-2010-olympics">Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics</a>.  Next ElasticPath bundles a robust Level 3 REST API with the their e-commerce engine, providing not just programmatic access to every aspect of the e-commerce engine, but a hypermedia driven experience ensuring developers can deliver on the business logic and user experience defined by any company that deploys their e-commerce platform using ElasticPath.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elasticpath-api.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Level 3 REST also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State</a> (HATEOAS), it is an enhancement to REST, that enables a client to have no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.  So in the context of e-commerce, when a developer requests a product the API, you get back the usual JSON describing the product, but you also get supporting media types for these &ldquo;products&rdquo;, and supporting link relations.  So if purchasing the product means streaming in media player you will get media types as well as link to load into player, where if it is a product that you can add to shopping cart, you will get the link to add to cart, and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about the technical details and benefits of HATEOAS REST, but i can see the benefits when bundled with ElasticPath&rsquo;s very mature e-commerce engine.  It allows you to not only build robust product catalogs that drive your website, but an e-commerce engine that can drive digital commerce across multiple platforms and devices, without developers having to fully understand the business rules and logic set forth by your company, leaving them to do what they do best, while ensuring your products, information and brand are reflected wherever your conducting e-commerce.</p>
<p>I guess e-commerce isn&rsquo;t the only vision of the Internet, but it definitely is a large part of it, and I think APIs have been fueling the growth of e-commerce since the first part of the last decade, and now with platforms like <a title="ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">ElasticPath</a> we will truly see this vision mature and allow us to sell physical and digital goods anywhere in the world, in real-time.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/reaching_out.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>The best thing about owning <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> is I get to write about whatever I want.  I have full editorial control, and because of my unique view on the API space I tend to write about APIs from three separate perspectives:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Owner</li>
<li>API Service Provider</li>
<li>Developer</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the three main actors in the API game.  There are others, but these are the three viewpoints I write about the most.  I tend to rail on API owners a lot, and today I think I will rail on API developers.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m doing a lot of reaching out to my developers.  I personally email everyone who registers for CityGrid APIs.  Sure I use template emails, but I customize them and send the email one by one so I can <a title="profile my API developers" href="/2012/04/17/profiling-api-developers/index.php">profile my API developers</a> and understand what they are doing.</p>
<p>So far, my findings are that many developers don&rsquo;t have any sort of verifiable online persona, and even more don&rsquo;t bother responding when I email or tweet at them.  Its not my business to police the <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/">CityGrid APIs</a>, but I definitely apply a grade to every developer I look at, and make recommendations based upon this grade, where online persona and responsiveness are two big factors.</p>
<p>We hear a lot of developers (me included) complain about API owners not being responsive, but remember there is another side to the coin.  If you're using someone&rsquo;s API for FREE, and they take time out of their day to email you or tweet at you, it might be cool if you took 10 seconds to respond and say hello, and let them know you're an actual person.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a title="deploying and managing APIs" href="http://www.3scale.net"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At most <a title="Hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>, the end goal is building a web or mobile application, using various platforms and APIs.  Even though I&rsquo;ve seen this evolve to data visualization, or mashing up SaaS platforms at some events, the app really tends to be the primary deliverable at hackathons.</p>
<p>So this week I&rsquo;m spending time thinking of unique and interesting ways to present my sponsors for the <a title="CityGrid hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica" href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica</a> at <a title="CoLoft" href="http://www.coloft.com/">CoLoft</a>.  One of our sponsors is <a title="3Scale API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, one of my favorite API service providers, and while we see many of the API service providers including <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> and <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> involved in many of the hackathons you really don't see anything built using their platform. (I know they&rsquo;ll ping me and say they do, but really your building using their clients.)</p>
<p>So for the <a title="CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon" href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles hackathon</a>, I want to encourage developers to come up with ideas for APIs, develop the API and using 3Scale, deploy the building block that are essential that enable other developers to build on top of the API.</p>
<p>Not only do we need more, high value APIs, we need developers to be fluent in not just developing and deploying mobile and web apps, developers need to be fluent in designing, developing, <a title="deploying and managing APIs" href="http://www.3scale.net">deploying and managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have a great API idea and are in the Los Angeles area this weekend, come down to the CoLoft in Santa Monica and form a team and build your API, and deploy it using 3Scale, and you just might have a chance at winning $5,000.00 for your API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Developer-Blog-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of my self-appointed roles in the API industry is to shed light on, and discuss the business of APIs when many other API owners and evangelists tend to keep their strategy and business closer to their chest.</p>
<p>Many API owners don&rsquo;t discuss their roadmaps, either because they feel they will be giving away their secret sauce, or quite possibly because they don&rsquo;t have a clue where they are going with it.  I think it&rsquo;s more the latter, as we are all making this shit up as we go along.</p>
<p>One subject you don&rsquo;t hear API owners discuss often, is when their API will be deprecated or shuttered, leaving developers and tech bloggers to speculate on the subject.  Because of this you tend to hear just the extreme views on the subject.  Popular perspectives on API life-span tends to be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are Forever - Once you put an API, you have to support it forever</li>
<li>APIs Can Go Away Anytime - There is no stability whatsoever when it comes to APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written on this subject several times including <a href="/2012/04/09/what-happens-to-instagram-api-developers-after-facebook-acquisition/">What Happens to Instagram API Developers After Facebook Acquisition</a> and <a href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Building Your Business Around Google or Any Other APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Even with my stance on the subject I fall prey to the hype sometimes.  I saw the post from Google today called <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/04/changes-to-deprecation-policies-and-api.html">Changes to deprecation policies and API spring cleaning</a>, and I immediately thought oh no, here we go again.  After reading deeper I realized they are updating their API deprecation policy for many popular APIs.  As they state:</p>
<blockquote><em>The new policy simply states that we will strive to provide one year notice before making breaking changes.</em></blockquote>
<p>Google is setting a clear window, for which they will make sure and give developers a heads up before deprecating an API.  This allows you to know that you can count on an API being around, until you hear otherwise, and then, you still have a year to figure out what you are going to do.</p>
<p>I know this is something other API owners do, but it rarely is something you hear any news about, giving the API extremists free range to use page view grabbing headlines about <a href="/2012/03/30/why-tech-bloggers-suck-and-not-apis/">APIs owners being no better than satan, and eat their developers for dinner</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to work on a more formal post about API deprecation policies, and how API owners can put them to use, setting better expectations around API life cycles.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Customer-Self-Service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the essential ingredients of a successful API, is a self-service area to support your API developers.  In my opinion this is a no-brainer.  You have to have registration, documentation, code samples, forum and other <a title="essential building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a> available to developers in a self-service way--so they can engage with your API 24/7 without asking for access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked hard to make sure the CityGrid API area has a logical navigation, taking developers to the essential information they will need to learn about and integrate with the APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

<p>I keep a regular flow of information going through the blog to make sure there is excellent SEO content, so developers can search for anything at Google, and the blog will support linking to whats relevant in the <a title="CityGrid Developer Center" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid Developer Center</a>.</p>
<p>Even with all of this, I still get some pretty basic questions like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>I need PHP code samples?</strong> - Immediately available on the code samples page.</li>
<li><strong>What does the API cost?</strong> -  Says that it is FREE on Getting Started and FAQ.</li>
<li><strong>Can I save your data in my database? </strong>- Says it on the Usage Requirements</li>
<li><strong>Do I have to show your logo?</strong> - Says it on the Usage Requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building%20blocks.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>That is just the tip of the iceberg.   I&rsquo;ve posed this question before...<a title="Are there enough doers to make this whole API vision work?" href="/2012/02/13/are-there-enough-doers-for-this-api-vision-to-work/">are there enough doers in the world to make this whole API vision work?</a> It&rsquo;s hard to tell if its just my view, while in the pit of despair, or if it is just the way it is.</p>
<p>It seems like there will always be some users who need hand holding, and they refuse to read the self-service material available in the API area.  When I&rsquo;m hacking on an API, I always make sure I search exhaustively before I ask a question, but I&rsquo;m discovering a new breed of developers who won&rsquo;t search, won&rsquo;t ask questions--then when you reach out to them they&rsquo;ll ask for what they need, no matter how basic.</p>
<p>It seems, that self-service API resources are essential, but there will always be a segment of our audience who aren&rsquo;t quite doers, they need more hand-holding and information presented to them before they get what they need.</p>

<p>For the last couple weeks I&rsquo;m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the <a title="CityGrid Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>.  I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.</p>
<p>To find this out I start out profiling them socially using <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>&nbsp;(which I plan on automating using the&nbsp;<a title="Full Contact API" href="http://www.fullcontact.com/">Full Contact API</a> as soon as I have more time) for the following information:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter Profile</li>
<li>LinkedIn Account</li>
<li>Facebook Profile</li>
<li>Google + Profile</li>
<li>Github Profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don&rsquo;t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me. I visit each developer&rsquo;s site and look for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog w/ RSS Feed</li>
<li>Business Contact Email </li>
<li>Business Contact Form</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do.  I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.</p>
<p>Before I&rsquo;m done looking around their site I take a picture of their home page, so I have a visual reference to go with the developer profile. The home page image can go further than just a logo sometimes.</p>

<p>I take all of this information, put it into a database, and connected it to a JQuery Carousel that allows me to watch a slideshow that walks me through the world of my developers, and watch like a TV channel.</p>
<p>This process not only gives me a 100K understanding my developer ecosystem, but helps me remember as much as I can about each developer.  From this I hope to better engage them on a daily basis as well as provide feedback to the CityGrid API roadmap based upon quality API developer segmentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/citygrid-la-hackathon/citygrid-los-angeles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently planning a 9 city hackathon tour, starting with the <a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon</a>, and following up with Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Austin.</p>
<p>The CityGrid Hackathon tour is meant to bring together commercial and civic hackers to build the next generation of apps we use in our everyday "local" lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find a blend of developers, business, marketing and advertising folks that will come together and develop commercially viable ideas that can also make our cities better places to live.</p>
<p>So I'm looking for sponsors that really enhance the local theme of the event, so I started with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Local API Stack" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/tag/stack/">Local API Stack</a></strong> - These are APIs that I track on for CityGrid, providing direct value to local mobile and web app developers.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mobile Back-end as a Service Providers" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup/">Mobile Back-end as a Service</a></strong> - Service providers that exclusively provide back-end platforms and tools for mobile developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy if all of these companies could provide the sponsorships that I need to support the event, but it probably won&rsquo;t be enough.  So I&rsquo;m looking elsewhere with some of the usual suspects like Amazon Web Services, Rackspace and Twilio.</p>
<p>Regardless of what my sponsor line-up looks like I think I will still provide a directory of local APIs for developers to use, so that they have a robust listing of high quality APIs to choose from when building their local web and mobile apps.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2012</span>
        <p>When I was a tech blogger for <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> and API-related news broke, we writers would often shudder. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t use API in the headline,&rdquo; the argument in the newsroom went. It&rsquo;s the page-view-kiss-of-death. That&rsquo;s not because APIs aren&rsquo;t super-important or super-ubiquitous on the Web (they are both). It&rsquo;s because most &ldquo;<a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/22/techies-and-normals/">normals</a>&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know what they are or why they matter. They&rsquo;d rather click on a story that says &ldquo;101 Ways to Use Pinterest to Plan Your Wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision to cover APIs regularly on ReadWriteWeb and eschew stories that fall into the &ldquo;[Number] Ways to Use [Hot New Social Media Tool] to [Conduct a Seasonally-Relevant Activity]&rdquo; goes a long way to explain the popularity of RWW versus that of Mashable, incidentally.</p>
<p>Also incidentally: Pinterest <a href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">has an API</a>.</p>
<p>This all presents a bit of a challenge, of course, if I want to make an argument for my readers here about why APIs really matter in education. Do I frame the argument for &ldquo;normals&rdquo;? (Wait! HA! &ldquo;Normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t read Hack Education!) Do I frame it for educators? Entrepreneurs? Technologists? The answer: hopefully all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="whatisanapi">What is an API?</h2>
<p>API stands for &ldquo;Application Programming Interface.&rdquo; At its most basic level, an API allows one app to talk to another app. It&rsquo;s the way in which Web and mobile technologies can open up their data and their software&rsquo;s functionality to others. It&rsquo;s how Zynga integrates its games with your Facebook profile. It&rsquo;s how websites handle accepting payments via Paypal and play YouTube videos. It&rsquo;s how Instagram can share your photos to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr.</p>
<p>Rather than having to export a file from one system, then import it into another, APIs allow programs to &ldquo;make calls,&rdquo; sending and receiving just the information they need just when they need it. Web APIs (also known as REST APIs) do this &ndash; well obviously &ndash; via the Web using the protocols of the Web (HTTP). But instead of returning HTML like a website does when you &ldquo;call&rdquo; it, Web APIs return XML or JSON &ndash; that is, machine-readable data that other apps and websites can make us of.</p>
<p>But enough with the tech&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="whydoesthismatterineducation">Why does this matter in education?</h2>
<p>Educational data is <a href="/2012/04/11/download-all-your-education-data-with-the-click-of-one-button/">stuck in silos</a>, something fostered by educational software &ndash; administrative and instructional &ndash; that makes it cumbersome at best and impossible at worst to move data in and out of systems. As a result, there&rsquo;s lots of extra clerical work that educators and administrators have to do &ndash; recreating rosters, copying grades, downloading CSVs, copying-and-pasting, and so on. All because educational apps and software do not, as a rule, talk to one another.</p>
<p>Student Information Systems don&rsquo;t know which level of Angry Birds students are on. (Um hello, don&rsquo;t laugh: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/another-gravitational-experiment-in-angry-birds-space/">Angry Birds is science</a>!) A better example, perhaps: a school&rsquo;s SIS might not talk to the district&rsquo;s database or the state&rsquo;s records system. Parents probably don&rsquo;t get an automatic SMS when there&rsquo;s an attendance issue or library book due. Learning management systems don&rsquo;t automatically capture what or how far students have read in their e-readers or what they&rsquo;ve annotated.</p>
<p>These functionalities (and lots more) are possible when there are APIs, opening the door to all sorts of <em>real-time</em> connections between products, services, and systems that are currently impossible due to time constraints, burdensome download and data entry processes, and vendors who&rsquo;d prefer to maintain data lock-in.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/darcy_modified.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="wherearetheeduapis">Where are the EDU APIs?</h2>
<p>The absence of APIs from a lot of education applications, I&rsquo;d argue, is a good indication that we&rsquo;re still dealing in many cases with pre-Web era technologies (or at least a pre-Web era mindframe). Student information systems. Learning management systems. Educational software for your desktop computer. All pre-Web. And even newer versions of these older systems often carry forward this legacy of a world without Web (or hell, even Internet) connectivity.</p>
<p>APIs played a crucial part in the explosion of Web technologies. E-commerce. Social networking. Cloud computing. Now mobile computing. All facilitated by APIs. APIs have enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Twitter to become <em>platforms</em>, allowing other developers to build on top of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Platforms&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t necessarily something we talk about in education, although they do exist and are being developed <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/10/13/the-race-to-platform-education/">with increasing frequency</a>. Google Apps for Education is certainly an example of one. <a href="http://edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> is attempting to carve a similar path, and with the release its API last month, I described the startup as making the move &ldquo;<a href="/2012/03/06/edmodo-makes-the-move-from-social-network-to-education-platform/">from social network to education platform</a>.&rdquo; Edmodo&rsquo;s and Google&rsquo;s APIs allows other companies &ndash; <a href="http://mathalicious.com">Mathalicious</a>, <a href="http://desmos.com">Desmos</a>, <a href="http://aviary.com">Aviary</a>, for example &ndash; to connect their apps to these platforms, tapping into rosters, roles, feeds, assignments, calendars, documents and so on.</p>
<p>The LMS could be a platform too, I suppose &ndash; <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/">and with APIs, that&rsquo;s the direction it could go</a>. But what&rsquo;s interesting to me is that, with their origins in a pre Web 2.0 world, LMSes have devised a separate standard to offer connections to external modules &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/">LTI</a>,&rdquo; not API. Is there widespread interest among third-party developers to integrate with LMSes via LTI? (To make the process simpler, <a href="https://lti-examples.heroku.com/index.html">Instructure co-founder Brian Whitmer has created a site</a> with examples and code samples.) Or will the pervasiveness of Web APIs mean that developers' interest goes elsewhere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m veering dangerously back into the technical realm here &ndash; the type of discussions that, as I started this post, tend to make &ldquo;normals&rdquo; not read and not care about APIs.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re incredibly important, why we should pay attention to them in education, and why I recommend having an API is something you should look for in the tools you adopt: APIs make data accessible. APIs foster interoperability. APIs extend functionality. And APIs create an ecosystem -- of technology, of developers, of users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want that for ed-tech, don't we?</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was going to write this story when I got an email from <a title="Qwerly" href="http://qwerly.com/letter.html">Qwerly after they got acquired by Fliptop</a>, then after <a href="http://urbanairship.com/blog/2012/01/12/update-on-our-plan-to-integrate-location-and-context-services-into-our-push-messaging-platform/">SimpleGeo was acquired by Urban Airship</a>, then when I got the email from <a href="http://blog.indextank.com/1221/indextank-linkedin-acquires-indextank/">LinkedIn announcing they were shutting down IndexTank</a>.  Four acquisitions later, I&rsquo;m finally making time today after the announcement of <a title="Facebook Acquiring Instagram" href="http://tmblr.co/ZMPd3xJMuYI9">Facebook acquiring Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>So, what will happen to Instagram API developers, now that Instagram is owned by Facebook?  We don&rsquo;t know.  It <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/04/09/facebook-probably-wont-kill-the-instagram-api/">sounds like Facebook will keep Instagram in tact</a>, but who knows where it will go from here, where founder Kevin Systrom will take it, or Facebook will step in and make changes.</p>
<p>If your like <a title="Postagram" href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a>, you&rsquo;ve already diversified beyond the Instagram API and acknowledged that you need to offer more than what you can build off a single API provider.  We&rsquo;ve hear the cry of many developers when Twitter poaches from its ecosystem, <a title="Google decide to shutter Google Translate" href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Google decided to shutter Google Translate</a>, then quickly <a href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/">decided to offer paid version</a>--it doesn&rsquo;t matter who your API provider is, nobody is immune from acquisition or their API service being shuttered.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask the question about Instagram API developers before the API haters, jump in and blame the API.  Its not about the API, its about the API owners acknowledging their API ecosystem exists, and its developers, and whether or not they have a solid business strategy that includes having multiple suppliers for their content and products.</p>
<p>Hopefully you are a developer that understands the APIs you use to power your web or mobile application are potential vendors that could stay around for the next 10 years, or they could go away tomorrow with the next billion dollar acquisition--and with the right business strategy, maybe you could walk away with $400 Million, with your 40% equity, when your killer app is acquired.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/ada-the-enchantress-of-numbers.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/ada-the-enchantress-of-numbers.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A big part of API evangelism, is storytelling.  Storytelling about the API, the value it delivers, and the solutions it provides.  Through my own hacking on an API, engaging with developers via email, a forum and social media, I gather ideas for projects that would help evangelize an API, while also educating users of how it works.</p>
<p>One example is a recurring question I get from <a title="CityGrid API Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API developers</a>--how does CityGrid compare with other places APIs like Google Places and Yelp?</p>
<p>I set out to answer this question, quickly realizing it was easier said than done.  I found 11 places APIs that fit my criteria, and they had many differences, so I started by writing a quick <a title="overview of the 11 places apis" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/overview-of-11-places-data-apis/">overview of the 11 places APIs</a>.  This helped me identify and quickly understand what each places API delivered.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I needed to actually hack on each API to truly understand how they work, and develop enough of an understanding where I could compare them in detail.  To do this, I needed a project, to use as a anchor for my storytelling.  Not just one blog post, but many, with code samples and starter kits to help support the project.</p>
<p>I chose to build an <a title="Interactive Places API Comparison Tool" href="http://places-comparison-v1.hyp3rl0cal.com/index.php">Interactive Places API Comparison Tool.</a></p>
<p><a title="Interactive Places API Comparison Tool" href="http://places-comparison-v1.hyp3rl0cal.com/index.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CityGrid-Google-Yelp-1024x189.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>As a start, I chose 3 places APIs to compare:  <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a>, <a title="Google" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/">Google</a> and <a title="Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview">Yelp</a>.  The Interactive Places API Comparison Tool provides a what and where textual search as well as a latitude and longitude search, simultaneously across the 3 APIs.</p>
<p>Once I built the first prototype I <a href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/interactive-places-api-comparison-for-citygrid-google-and-yelp/">blogged about the comparison tool for the first time</a>, as well as some of the research that went into it, like <a title="places api comparison" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/interactive-places-api-comparison-for-citygrid-google-and-yelp/">Places API request format comparison</a>--talking about how CityGrid, Google and Yelp each tailored their API requests.</p>
<p>Today I finished a report to support the what and where search and one for the latitude and longitude search.  The report shows what was searched for, how many listings were pulled from each API and number of images, offers, reviews and tips for each place returned.  I will be adding other reporting items in the future.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve produced a lot of quality content from this hacker storytelling project:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>5 Blog Posts</li>
<li>Interactive API Comparison Web Application</li>
<li>Code Samples for Searching and Pulling Places Detail for 3 APIs</li>
<li>Code Libraries for Each of the 3 APIs</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/Hyp3rL0cal-Interactive-Places-API-Comparison-Tool-Listing.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>All blog posts are syndicated out to Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook as well as bookmarked at Reddit, StumbleUpon and Hacker News.  All code samples live as Github Gists so I can embed in blog posts and other places, while code libraries live as Github repositories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to post a bew blog post about the Interactive Places API Comparison reports I just finished, and will be adding Factual and Foursquare to the list of APIs that are compared as part of the tool.  This will give me probably four or five more blog stories in the next couple days.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell where the project will go after that.  The good hacker storytelling projects just keep living and producing blog posts, code samples, code libraries and starter kits.  But there will always be new ideas for projects and stories when I engage with developers within the API community and on the open Internet.</p>

<p>While assembling the building blocks for a successful API ecosystem, one of the requests I get from developers is for tools to help them build successful integrations with existing platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, Facebook and Salesforce.</p>
<p>Some of the requests I get are from non-developers who just want a plug and play tool, they can deploy without needing to write code--but many of the requests are for white label, starter kits that developers can use to quickly deploy API driven applications on popular platforms like:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in any of these platforms, but I find the more I dive into developing on these platforms, the more I learn and the more I discover other experts who really understand the ins and outs of building plugins and add-ons for 3rd party systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to building code samples, code libraries and generic start kits for your API, you may want to take a look at building white label, 3rd party platform plugins and add-ons your developers can use to quickly integrate your API into existing networks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very least, you will learn a lot.</p>
