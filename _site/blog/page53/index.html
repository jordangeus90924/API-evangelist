<p><a title="I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet" href="http://tosdr.org/">I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet</a>.  We agree to terms of service for each and every service we use online, without ever reading and understanding exactly what we are agreeing to.</p>
<p>This is one of the most damaging aspects of online life, as through this process we are giving away our rights, ownership of our data and allowing for our privacy to be compromised each and every day.  While not all services are abusing this, there are many online services that use this to their advantage, in an effort to maximize the amount of value they extract from their platform and end users.</p>
<p>Service providers have to go further in educating users about the terms of service they are agreeing to.  There is a great example of this in action, via an article in NextWeb called &ldquo;<a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/29/now-this-is-how-to-write-a-terms-of-service-document/">now THIS is how to write your startup&rsquo;s Terms of Service</a>&rdquo;.  The post showcases how <a href="http://heello.com/" target="_blank">real-time sharing platform Heello</a> has provided <a href="https://heello.com/terms" target="_blank">plain english descriptions, next to each &ldquo;legaleze&rdquo; paragraph in their terms of service</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://heello.com/terms" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heello/heello-terms-of-service.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is nothing new. <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms_of_service">You see it with other providers like Tumblr</a>.  But I think it is a very simple enhancement to API terms of service that can have a huge effect, and begin leading us in a more healthy direction when it comes to educating end-users about the TOS they are bound to.  While companies need the protection of a legal terms of service, there is no reason you can't provide your end users with a translated, plain english version. &nbsp;It doesn't take much work, and really sets you apart from other API service providers.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other examples of online services going above and beyond to help educate end users about terms of service?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/28/the-noun-project-api/">The Noun Project API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> is <a href="http://thenounproject.com/developers/">soliciting feedback on their upcoming API</a>.  If you aren&rsquo;t familar with The Noun Project, it is a innovative visual language project, that is creating a library of icons that will enable people to visually communicate and interact around the globe. Direct from <a href="http://thenounproject.com/about/">The Noun Project about page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Humans have been using symbols to communicate for over 17,000 years because they are the one language everyone can understand. Symbols can transcend cultural and language barriers and deliver concise information effortlessly and instantaneously. They allow people to communicate quickly, effectively, and intuitively. And for the first time ever, this language is being combined with technology to create a social language that unites the world.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Noun Project wants <a href="http://thenounproject.com/developers/">our feedback on what a Noun Project API might look like</a> and what we would use it for. &nbsp;So, I wanted to take a moment and share my thoughts, about what I would use The Noun Project API for, and some thoughts about what the endpoints might look like.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong> <br />Normally an embeddable strategy for an API is in the background, relinquished to just one of the tools in the toolbox.  With the Noun Project I think a healthy embeddable strategy would be front and center, providing a wide array of buttons, badges, widgets and other items users could syndicate across the web.  The library of embeddable tools should be open for submission, much like the core of the Noun Project.  Designers could generate custom button sets, badges and other embeddables for users to choose from.  The Noun Project's embeddable strategy would make the Noun Project API accessible to everyone, even non-developers.</p>
<p><strong>Builders and IDE </strong><br />A Noun Project API would enable a next generation of mobile and web application apps, as well as other visualization and big data analysis tools to integrate consistent imagery.  Makers of integrated development environments (IDE) could provide button, icon and other UI components with a wealth of meaningful icons, that could become the new default in modern apps.  Think how Twitter bootstrap is raising the bar in overall app user interface quality?  Love it or not, Twitter Bootstrap has made things look better, and consistent use of the Noun Project images could go even further.</p>
<p><strong>Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words </strong><br />The Noun Project API would enable a wealth of text to image visualization possibilities, allowing developers to accompany and represent everyday text in much more impactful ways.  Imagine if in addition to titles and summaries, you always had a Noun Project icon to reference when reading on the web and via your favorite applications.  A couple examples might be:</p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project-idea.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog &amp; News Listings</strong> - Often times our blogging platforms have a way to upload an image to represent a post or story.  The Noun Project could be used as visual cues for stories in certain categories or programmable determined by the text content of a story, dynamically pulled from the Noun Project API</li>
<li><strong>Link Representations</strong> - When faced with a link, all you have to reference is the title and possibly a description.  The addition of a Noun Project icon, pulled from the API after indexing the content of links page would help users make a determination of a site&rsquo;s content before clicking</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - The Noun Project could be used to provide visual references for emails, SMS, Tweets, Facebook Wall posts and other common forms of digital communication. &nbsp;Icons could be suggested based upon message content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ways The Noun Project API could be used to dynamically offer visual representations for common textual objects we encounter in our every day lives.  I&rsquo;m sure a developer community would come up with many more examples, once the API is available.</p>
<p><strong>Network Graph</strong><br />Built into The Noun Project API would be a representation of the social and network graph of an image.  You could see how popular a particular image or set of images is.  You could apply this into the filtering and retrieval of images via the API, as well as have as part of the image meta data to use in your own application logic. To achieve the level of meaning the project intends to, a graph will be needed to show the use, reach and impact of each image and sets of images.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Network </strong><br />Also built into The Noun Project API should be a partner layer, that reflects the core mission of the project.  Every image returned by the API would be complete with all meta data regarding its creator and how the image can, and is being used across the network.  The Noun Project Partner Network would give more control and insight for designers to see how their images are being used as well as commercial, volume and other monetization opportunities for designers--a layer that could be part of the overall Noun Project revenue strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution</strong> <br />Without an API, the usage of Noun Project images is a manual process, leaving attribution up to the user.  With an API and a healthy branding and attribution framework, The Noun Project attribution would be built into the embeddable strategy as well as bundled into each and every Noun Project API response.  This would provide The Noun Project network with easy attribution, which doesn't just credit designers, it will be the basis of The Noun Project marketing. Imagine being able to visualize the entire syndication for a single icon! Without an API this is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging the Digital to Physical </strong><br />The Noun Project API would allow innovative new ways to use Noun Project icons in the physical world as well as the digital.  An API could allow for the printing on demand of icon templates in various sizes, and ship them to users for creating signs and other real-world uses that could be permanent or possibly even ephemeral, with the use of temporary paints or spray on chalks.  This process wouldn't be a one-way street either.  With a Noun Project API, developers could build icon recognition applications that could snap a picture of an icon printed (permanently or temporary) and immediately connect users back to the virtual world around the icon, either based upon its meaning, designer or some new represenation that has emerged as part of the Noun Project network graph.</p>
<p>That are just some of my initial thoughts around how a Noun Project API could be put to use in meaningful ways.  Regarding what The Noun Project API would look like. I'd like to see some of the following endpoints:</p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project-clicking-heels.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Designers</strong> - Endpoint for icon designers, with access to their profile, collections and icons&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - Enpoint for Noun Project user accounts with access to account and billing settings as well as favorite, saved, purchased icons and collections</li>
<li><strong>Icons</strong> - Endpoint for all icons, allowing to to search and filter individual icons as well as add and update existing icons for my designer profile</li>
<li><strong>Collections</strong> - Collection endpoints allowing me to search, filter and pull individual icon collections</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> - Endpoint for all words used for icons, allowing a dictionary that developed can reference while developing providing a reverse search for icons</li>
<li><strong>Graph</strong> - API access to all graph related events like popular icons, collections and designers as well as trending icons collections and reverse searches on popular keywords or phrases</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are more endpoints that could be identified in the future.  I think the most important aspect is to just get an API launched, and have a healthy strategy for engaging users to find out what should be put on the roadmap. Just starting simple and making sure to expose all aspects of the core Noun Project is an important beginning--the rest will come.</p>
<p>What a fascinating project the Noun Project is.  I strongly believe that it order to fulfill its full vision, the Noun Project has to have an API.  The Noun Project API will be essential to syndicating the icons across both our physical and virtual worlds, provide a way for users and designers to interact around the icons, while also providing the most meaningful licensing framework possible that would even include much needed revenue for both designers and the Noun Project, and keep this very important project alive.</p>

<p>I depend on <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> to move data around the cloud. &nbsp;I syndicate blog posts from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> to Blogger and Tumblr. &nbsp;This isn't just blind syndication, it is SEO and also plan B scenarios to make sure my content exists in multiple areas.</p>
<p>When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use. &nbsp;If I begin to depend on an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS). &nbsp;This is how I roll.</p>
<p>Not all platorms allow for this. &nbsp;In my opinion, all FREE platforms should have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">relief valves for users</a> like me, who want to move to some sort of paid account, assuring me some sort of service level agreement (SLA) or I'll move away.</p>
<p>For example: Once I started using Evernote regularly, I moved to the premium level. &nbsp;I bought into Pinboard at an early rate, once I was hooked. &nbsp;Inversely, I can't pay for Twitter, Facebook and some Google services. &nbsp;Today it is about IFTT.</p>
<p>In light of me losing Google Reader I'm taking a hard look at all my services. &nbsp;IFTT is on the chopping block.</p>
<p>I have about 20-30 jobs running at IFTTT, moving data around between my cloud services, in a way I depend on. &nbsp;I need to move this into the realm of premium or paid services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? &nbsp;Sell me on your service.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/iris-media/iris-media-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent some time drinking IPAs and talking education technology with Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and a friend of ours Adam Wendt (<a href="https://twitter.com/skinnyblimp">@skinnyblimp</a>), the COO of&nbsp;<a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank">Iris Educational Media</a> last week.  IRIS Educational Media is a behavioral research and development company that provides educational resources for parents, parent educators, K-12 school staff, including teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, and direct support employees.</p>
<p>During our discussion, Adam was describing how he wanted to make Iris Media resources available for people to use on any platform, by providing valuable embeddable tools and resources for organizations and professionals to use on their own sites and portals.</p>
<p><a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/iris-media/iris-media-video.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As Adam was talking, of course I&rsquo;m thinking API.  An API would not just a way to drive their own line of embeddable tools, but would also allow for other 3rd party developers to build specialized tools and widgets for other platforms that Iris Media might not have awareness, time or resources to focus on.  Wanting to be available on numerous platforms is easy, but actually delivering on them can be costly and time consuming--APIs are a way to share this load with a 3rd party community.</p>
<p>An API could power Iris Media&rsquo;s syndication similar to Youtube. The Youtube API, plus a robust embeddable tool strategy is behind the massive syndication and growth of the popular video platform. Iris Media could go further with its own API, by integrating a partner layer within their API platform, and provide developers, organizations and educational professionals the ability to earn revenue by syndicating or developing widgets and applications on top of the Iris Media API.  This revenue could go a long way in ensuring some of these essential educational professionals organizations stay in operation and continue making an impact.</p>
<p>Engaging with people like Adam, who are truly making a difference in priority areas like education, is why I continue doing API Evangelist.  APIs can help Iris Media be more successful in reaching its audience, but also empower the huge number of important individuals and organizations on the ground in communities around the globe, who deliver essential education where they are needed most.</p>

<p>A <a href="/buildingblocks/roadmap.php">roadmap is an essential part of a healthy API ecosystem</a>.  The transparency and communication that come with providing a roadmap for your API and open data initiative will go a long way in building trust with your community.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2013/03/26/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-release-schedule/">City of Philadelphia is sharing its roadmap of data sets</a> that it intends to open in the coming months, by providing a <a href="https://trello.com/board/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline/51487d15bb68f5de3b0099b0">release calendar using cloud project management service Trello</a>. In addition to seeing the datasets the city intends to release, you can also see any data sets that have already been published.</p>
<p>According to the open data roadmap, Philadelphia is releasing data on street closures, energy consumption, evacuation routes, campaign finance, bike racks, budgets, expenditures and city employee salaries to name just a few.</p>
<p><a title="tecnically philly" href="http://technical.ly/philly/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/city/philadelphia/city-of-philly-open-data-roadmap.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>This type of transparency doesn&rsquo;t just build trust with citizens and developers, it provides an incentive for the city government to deliver high quality public data, in a meaningful and timely manner.    There is still a lot of work to be done once this data is available, in order to develop quality analysis, visualizations, other APIs and tools that can be used in mobile and web applications. But what Philly is doing is a great start.</p>
<p>The City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s approach to its open data roadmap is good to see.  It is something all cities should have, as well as all API owners.  Your roadmap will set expectations within your community, guide your own initiatives and provide a healthy blueprint for moving your efforts forward.</p>

<blockquote><em>access to imagery by time and position or searching by specific asteroid or other moving object. The time dimension, unique to SkyMorph, allows users to discover changes in the intensities of stars, e.g. supernovae, or to discover moving objects, e.g. comets</em></blockquote>
<p>NASA is challenging us to help build a RESTful interface that would enable developers and citizen scientist to access SkyMorph imagery, lowering the barrier of access to the data and encouraging innovation around the program.</p>
<p>Ok, how cool is that!  APIs that enable everyone to help track on and understand objects in the sky, along with NASA.  It is projects like the <a title="SkyMorph API Challenge" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/skymorph-imagery-api/">SkyMorph API Challenge</a> that keep me excited about APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/21/interactive-api-documentation-with-swagger/">Interactive API Documentation With Swagger</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Swagger " href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/reverb-for-developers-swagger.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is becoming more common for API providers to deliver documentation using what's known as <a title="interactive API documentation" href="/buildingblocks/interactive_documentation.php">interactive API documentation</a>, instead of the usual static API documentation.   Understanding how to use an API can be tough sometimes, and rather than just reading about it how it works, interactive API documentation allows you make real calls against an API, while learning about the interface.</p>
<p>While there are several approaches to delivering interactive API documentation, my personal favorite is using <a title="Swagger " href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>.  Swagger comes built in with <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, which is the API management platform I use for the <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist API</a>, but Swagger is available for anyone to use as an <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">open source project</a>.</p>
<p>Interactive API documentation using Swagger starts with a Swagger definition, which is a JSON representation of an API endpoint. In this case, the endpoint is for accessing my blog posts:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5216806.js"></script>
<p>This JSON describes everything about my very basic endpoint, which allows users to query almost 3 years of API Evangelist blog posts. Using this definition, Swagger generates the following API documentation automatically:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-documentation-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>As someone learning about the API Evangelist Analysis API, this describes the endpoint, which fields are required to make an API call, but it doesn&rsquo;t just describe this with text, it provides an interactive interface in which I can enter my API keys, provide a query value and actually make a request against the API:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-documentation-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t just learn about the API endpoint.  I learn about what keys are needed and fields are present that allow me to request different information of the API endpoint. It allows me to actually see the request to the API, the resulting body of my API request.</p>
<p>This type of hands on learning is essential to onboarding new users with your API. I can read your API documentation and not see the value, but when I am walked through how to build a request, and actually see the value returned in real-time, it changes the game.  As a developer I&rsquo;m more likely to understand and integrate with an API when I am given interactive API documentation over static pages.</p>
<p>The benefits of describing your API using Swagger don&rsquo;t stop with just providing <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui">interactive API documentation</a>. Swagger can also help deliver <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">code samples</a> in multiple programming languages for developers to put to use, <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">generate server side code</a> for new APIs and <a href="/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">provide potential benefits for API discovery</a>.</p>
<p>It is well known that <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">API documentation is the number one pain point for developers</a>. Make sure your API documentation is hands-on, and interactive, so developers will understand the value your API delivers immediately, and go from learning, to integration, in as short of period as possible.</p>

<p>Way to go brogrammers. &nbsp;You made sure a bright light in evangelism was partially dimmed tday. &nbsp;Really? With all the shaming that goes on targeted at women, you don't have balls to take a little shaming when you arer being a sexist pig? &nbsp; C'mon...ummm have some balls?</p>
<p>As I've <a href="http://kinlane.com/2012/12/30/sexism-in-the-tech-space/">said it before, us guys are going to have to eat shit with a side of humble pie for many years</a> to come to balance this whole sexism thing out. &nbsp;Let's own it.</p>
<p>All it would have taken is a humble apology from those gentleman in response to the Tweet, then some healthy discussion about why what they said was wrong, and move on kids. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I sure hope the hacker news crowd steps up and defends every woman that is shamed by guys now, as they seem to be a defender of this now. So if you Tweet out shaming a woman in a career changing way, know hacker news will be all over you...right? &nbsp;Right?</p>
<p>I just want to make sure you know I support you Adria. You are not unemployed, you've been promoted to new levels of evangelism. Let me know how I can help.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/seabourne-logo-2013.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm tracking on a new wave of application frameworks and API centric architecture patterns, that are not just helping deliver the next wave of web &amp; mobile apps, but also bridging, aggregating and providing interoperability and transformations between APIs platforms.</p>
<p>One company I've been watching closely is <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>.  The Seabourne team has an approach to application development that follows a very interesting set of principles:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Flows Instead of Pipelines - </strong>Information operates in &lsquo;flows&rsquo; where inputs and outputs are flexible and happen at any point. Flows are fluid and flexible, unlike structured, point-to-point pipelines</li>
<li><strong>Data has Multiple Owners -</strong> Information flows are composed of multiple streams of data owned by different partners and vendors. Any process must accommodate multiple canonical sources for different information</li>
<li><strong>Use APIs to Move Information -</strong> By using APIs to move information around, we decouple the data from the underlying technology and vendor, and make it possible to combine information from different technologies. APIs provide a flexible, low cost base to grow the system and meet changing needs</li>
<li><strong>Integrate Data Across Systems - </strong>Information lives on multiple systems inside and outside the organization. There is tremendous value to be had from combining multiple data sources together into a single information stream</li>
<li><strong>Translation Rather Than Standardization -</strong> Information is stored in multiple structures and formats. Any effort to manage information should focus on translating between structures rather than trying to develop a common schema</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that pretty much describes the challenges we face building web and mobile apps today, and Seabourne's approach isn&rsquo;t just about building apps, it is about organizing resources from multiple providers to build the best app you can. To see it in action you have to check out the project they just implemented using their approach called <a href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.</p>
<p>Using GovInfo, anyone can sign up to receive alerts from more than 100 different federal agency websites. GovInfo gets its information from a large number of sources ranging from RSS, APIs or scraped from HTML sources. Once acquired, the framework de-dupes, cleanses and normalizes the data as needed, then makes available for publishing or pushing out via email, SMS or other means.</p>
<p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/govinfo_diagram.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The Seabourne approach is not just <a href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking extract, transform and load (ETL)</a>, but also makes your app platform centered around acquire, process and publish, in a way that improves flexibility, centralizes processing rules for all incoming information and reduces the amount of time it takes to add new sources of data, all while providing scalability, in a very granular way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Seabourne evolve and constantly refine their approach to distributed application design ranging from their <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">deployment of the FCC web site</a>, to the <a title="launching of MyFCC" href="/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">launching of MyFCC</a>, and now the next iteration of their platform driving GovInfo.  I&rsquo;ll keep following what they are doing with their<a href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/"> AP2 approach</a> and watch the <a href="http://seabourneinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/case-studies/Seabourne-Information-Management.pdf">tools</a> and best practices that are a result of their innovative approach to application development using APIs.</p>

<p>It was inevitable.  <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist now has its own API</a>.  I had a couple partners ask for more sophisticated access than provided by RSS or JSON dumps out of my platform. &nbsp;So I launched a handful of API endpoints, allowing you to get at information from my world.</p>
<p>I currently have 13 endpoints providing access to the core of my platform, in 8 key areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Name, logo and description of the 2K APIs I'm activtely monitoring</li>
<li><strong>API Stack</strong> - Access to my weekly and monthly API stacks</li>
<li><strong>Analysis (Blog) - </strong>Access to my entire blog catalog</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers -</strong> Access to all API service providers I track</li>
<li><strong>Tools -</strong> A full catalog of all the API tools I've found</li>
<li><strong>Curated News - </strong>Title and links of news that I personally curate from my 2K+ feeds</li>
<li><strong>Notes -</strong> Notes I make during my daily and weekly curation</li>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -</strong> The common building blocks I've identified after looking at 2K top APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more data behind my firewall that I want to open up.  I do a lot of research on top APIs like Twitter and Google as well as trending areas like <a href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/trends/baas.php">backend</a>, <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity</a> and <a href="/trends/realtime.php">real-time</a> service providers.</p>
<p>I will also be opening up API endpoints into the site traffic for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>, <a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a> and my other properties.  And toying with opening up some collections of my personal data like calendar, projects, checkins and other aspects of my world.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m only issuing keys to API Evangelist subscribers and partners, but let me know if you are interested in getting at any of my data.  Eventually I&rsquo;ll make much of it openly available, but I&rsquo;m still formulating my approach, and playing with different service compositions--so things will change.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/import-io/import-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had a demo of a new <a href="http://import.io">data extraction service</a> today called <a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io">Import.io</a>.   The service allows you to harvest or scrape data from websites and then output in machine readable formats like JSON.  This is very similar to Needlebase, a popular scraping tool that was acquired and then shut down by Google early in 2012.   Except I&rsquo;d say Import.io represents a simpler, yet at the same time a more sophisticated approach to harvesting of web data and publishing than Needlebase.</p>
<p><strong>Extract</strong><br />Using Import.io you can target web pages, where the content resides that you wish to harvest, define the rows of data, label and associate them with columns in table you where the system will ultimately put your data, then extract the data complete with querying, filtering, pagination and other aspects of browsing the web you will need to get at all the data you desire.</p>
<p><strong>Connect</strong><br />After defining the data that will be extracted, and how it will be store you can stop and use the data as is, or you can setup a more ongoing, real-time connection with the data you are harvesting.  Using Import.io connectors you pull the data regularly, identify when it changes, merge from multiple sources and remix data as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Put The Data To Work</strong><br />Using Import.io you can immediately extract the data you need and get to work, or establish an ongoing connection with your sources of data and use via the Import.io web app or you can manage and access via the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.import.io/">Import.io API</a>--giving you full control over your web harvesting connections, and the resulting data.</p>
<p><a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/import-io/import-io-connectors.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When getting to work using Import.io, you have the option to build your own connectors or explore a marketplace of existing data connectors, tailored to pull from some common sources like the Guardian or ESPN.  The Import.io marketplace of connectors is a huge opportunity for data consumers as well as data scraping junkies (like me) to put their talents to use building unique and desireable data harvesting scripts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about database to API services like <a title="database to api with EmergentOne" href="/2013/03/01/mysql,-postgresql,-rds-to-api-with-emergent-one/">EmergentOne</a> and <a title="database to api with slashdb" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/18/database-to-api-with-slashdb/">SlashDB</a>, I would put Import.io into the Harvest to API or ScrAPI category--allowing you to deploy APIs and machine readable datasets from any publicly available data, even if you aren&rsquo;t a programmer.</p>
<p>I think ScrAPI services and tools will play an important role in the API economy.  While data will almost always originate from a database, often times you can&rsquo;t navigate existing IT bottlenecks to properly connect and deploy an API from that data source.  Sometimes problem owners will have to circumvent existing IT infrastructure and harvest where the data is published on the open web. &nbsp;Taking it upon themselves to generate the necessary API or machine readable formats that will be needed for the last mile of mobile and big data apps that will ultimately consume and depend on this data.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="/2013/03/19/web-harvesting-to-api-with-import.io/">web to API service Import.io</a>&nbsp;earlier today, and before I close the Evernote for this story, I wanted to highlight something else I thought they did interesting, on their <a href="http://import.io/pricing">pricing page</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought they provide a very honest peak into how they are pricing their services. &nbsp;First off, they admit that they are a young company, which is cool, but they also lay out some pretty interesting points around their business philosophy::</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>We are a free service. We will always provide a free-to-use tool</li>
<li>We will introduce premium features. Some of these you may have to pay for</li>
<li>We will always provide you with a tool to export your connectors</li>
<li>We will let you know if we are going to change anything that may impact your usage of import.io</li>
<li>We are currently in Developer Preview. Some things might not work as expected</li>
<li>Free accounts may be volume-limited as we move from Developer Preview to production</li>
<li>We will never spam you or share your details with any third parties</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these points are something I feel ALL startups should commit to as part of their services to their users. One thing I'd also like to see from startups, is some mention of their exit strategy. &nbsp;What is the end goal? &nbsp;I think this is a relevant question for all startups, as is also good one for Import.io after the Google acquisition and shut-down of a similar service called Needlebase, back in 2012. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal isn't to pick on <a href="http://import.io/">Import.io</a>, but along with the other items they outline, I think all API startups should be openly discussing everything listed above.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="http://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/45364274104/introducing-open-badges-1-0">Mozilla launched their new Open Badges platform</a>, as an open standard to recognize and verify learning.  I immediately started thinking about how it could be applied to APIs for incentivizing developer participation and success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come across other badge programs, but Mozilla is the first open approach I&rsquo;ve seen, providing free software and an open technical standard, that any organization can use to create, issue and verify digital badges.</p>
<p>So I was thinking, as an API owner, you could use Open Badges to structure a series of rewards for developers who reach important milestones integrating with your API, and engaging with your ecosystem.</p>
<p>Some examples badge-worthy milestones might be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Achieve X amount of API calls</li>
<li>Published application to showcase</li>
<li>Published open source code library</li>
<li>Developed more than one application</li>
<li>Revenue generated from application</li>
<li>Supporting the forum and conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take a bit of planning to developer the right approach to badging for each API, as goals would be different for each provider. But, providing badges could provide an incentive for developers to work towards meaningful goals you have tied to important KPIs for your API strategy, While also providing an easy way to track your most knowledgable and potentially trusted developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://openbadges.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mozilla-open-badges/mozilla-open-badges-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>If API providers start issuing sensible and consistent badges for API knowledge it would also provide additional ways to measure the size and overall health of the API developer community.  I could envision badges that would serve specific business sectors or even around city, state and federal government APIs and civic efforts.</p>
<p>I will add Mozilla Open Badges to my list of <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> and explore other ideas about how an API provider can establish badge programs to incentivize and reward healthy API developer activity.</p>

<p>Google launched a <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/03/build-collaborative-apps-with-google.html">Realtime API for the Google Drive Platform</a> today.  It is the API version of the same functionality available on Google Drive, that allows for you and other collaborators to type, edit, annote and chat with each other within a Google Doc.</p>
<p>To use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/" target="_blank">Google Drive Realtime API</a> you add the Google Realtime Javascript library, then you can give any local object on an HTML page realtime behavior.  The JavaScript library and Realtime API handle network communication, storage, presence, conflict resolution and sync changes using what they call a CollaborativeString object.</p>
<p>The Realtime API isn&rsquo;t just for documents, it can be used for productivity apps, games, entertainment and much more.  The only limitation is a developers imagination within their own applications.</p>
<p>Google gives a <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/realtime-quickstart">quick start</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/reference/">documentation</a> and other resources to get you going, and they provide a pretty cool <a href="https://realtimeplayground.appspot.com/">realtime playground</a> for building stuff with the API in a hands-on, interactive environment.</p>
<p>There are other players in the realtime space already, like <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> and <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.  Google&rsquo;s entry into the arena is a signal that there is developer demand for realtime tools and provides validation for the other startups.   I&rsquo;ll play with Google Drive Realtime API some more and talk with the folks at Pusher and Firebase and see what their thoughts are and how it compares.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2013</span>
        <p>Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt">@audreywatters</a>) forwarded a very interesting series of tweets to me yesterday from software artist, writer, and educator Jer Thorp (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt" target="_blank">@blprnt</a>):</p>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

<p>What a fascinating thought. It is so close to how I see APIs in my minds eye.  A single API design can hold so much beauty, information, expression and emotion.  Imagine if you hung the API design for each iteration of the Twitter API on a wall.  There is so much to interpret.  It expresses the vision of Twitter founders and employees, it is in direct response to a million developers and the needs of 500 million users around the globe. &nbsp;What an impression!!!</p>
<p>While JSON might be the only way we have to visually describe an API, each web, mobile app and data visualization could also be considered an artistic representation of the Twitter API.  You could fill an entire gallery with JSON representations of each endpoint and each of its versions, applications, and visualizations.  Creating interactive art exhibition of the Twitter ecosystem.</p>
<p>I remember back in 8th grade(1984) I was in my social studies class with Ms. Schuler.  She brought in some fractal prints, she said were created by her mathematician boyfriend.  She walked us through how each visual was actually a math problem.  This was the same year my math teacher Mr. Hathaway got around 20 Commodore Vic 20s, which he didn&rsquo;t know how to setup and run, so a handful of us stayed after school and helped setup the lab.  At this point in my education I hated math, and without seeing the beauty of the fractal, I may never have developed a passion (obsession) for computing.  My counselors told me I&rsquo;d never have a career in computers, because I was so poor at math. Ha! Eat it middle school counselors!</p>

<p>Jer Thorp&rsquo;s tweets really resonate with me.  APIs are a technical, business and political representation that can interpreted in so many different ways.  When I read a <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">swagger definition of an API</a>, images begin to form in my mind around the intent of the APIs author (think girl in red dress from the Matrix).</p>
<p>Sometimes an API will invoke kindergarten images in my mind telling me the designer didn&rsquo;t have the experience it took to represent their information and resources properly.  Other times they invoke very precise images, almost too precise, alerting me to the fact this API was designed by another application and not a human.</p>
<p>On a very rare ocasion I will see an API design that you can tell was hand crafted, with the love and care of a individual or group of individuals who considered the needs of many end users, developers, and other consumers.  After several iterations an artful API representation will also begin to bear the technical, business and political imprints of its time.  Much like a painting will have certain styles, approaches, shapes, sizes, colors and materials going into the ink and canvas, or maybe markings of war, its owners or poor care.</p>
<p>In my opinion APs are a very artful representation of sometimes very complex data or programmatic resources, that have the possibility to evoke very emotional responses from the developers that build on them or the from the end-users who are the intended audience.</p>
<p>Thanks for planting this seed in my head Jer.  It is a topic I will visit often, as I&rsquo;m no doubt going to stumble across patterns and approaches that are more art than tech, as I&rsquo;m navigating this amazing API driven world I'm obsessed with.</p>
<p>And remember you heard it from Jer Thorp (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt" target="_blank">@blprnt</a>) first!</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.slashdb.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/slashdb/slashdb-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I would say the most common path to an API is from your company's database.  This makes database to API connectors, tools and services a pretty valuable area of the API space.  While there will always be high profile APIs dominating the tech blogosphere, most APIs will be launched quietly from small companies, by connecting them to various internal data sources.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, I met a new API service provider, called <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/" target="_blank">SlashDB</a>, that focuses on just delivering APIs from your database.  Once installed on any web server, SlashDB connects your internal databases and constructs a REST/HTTP web service, easily making database content accessible by URLs for getting, updating, inserting and deleting in a secure way.</p>
<p>SlashDB provides connectors for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, IBM DB2 and Sybase--covering the top 5 databases you will find in the enterprise or small to medium businesses.</p>
<p>I notice that SlashDB also has Microsoft Excel connectors.  I will have to investigate this further and do another story on API deployment from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  I know this will sound insane to the RESTafarians, but I think much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, on individual computers, throughout companies around the globe.</p>
<p>I've added SlashDB to my list of next generation API service providers like <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">EmergentOne</a>, <a href="http://apispark.com/" target="_blank">API Spark</a> and <a href="https://apiengine.io/" target="_blank">API Engine</a>. &nbsp;Check it out, and let me know what you think.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2013</span>
        <p>This post is more rant, and about me working through my thoughts on this subject, which is why its on <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> and not <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> or <a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>. &nbsp;This post is an aggregation of ongoing thoughts I'm having around my role in the API space, a diagram I drew the other day while enjoying an IPA, and inescapable thoughts fueled up by a post by&nbsp;Patrick Meir over at iRevolution, called <a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/03/17/neogeography-and-democratization/">Crisis Mapping, Neogeography and the Delusion of Democratization</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meir kicks up a bunch of thoughts related to how I perceive my role in the API space, which I believe is to help keep a certain amount of oxygen (aka open) present in the space, which I believe is the key ingredient in why the expirement we know as APIs is working. &nbsp;At first glance, API Evangelist looks like just a blog, but in reality it is a pretty complex system of data stores, API connectors, jobs and curation that I'm using to help draw a map of the API space that I can follow. Currently it looks something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>The way I see the space, is there are a shitload of resources, awaiting to be exposed via APIs that are both public and private resources. The stewards of these resources have the ability to select from tools and resources to deploy their API resources, using various building blocks for accomplishing this.</p>
<p><strong>API as a Service</strong><br />Additional to standing up your own API, there is the phenonmenon known as BaaS, PaaS and SaaS. &nbsp;Many of these platforms can actually help you deploy API resources, while also consuming and deploying resources of their own. &nbsp;For example, Kinvey allows you to deploy generic APIs from data stores you setup on their BaaS platform, bt they also consume API resources and makes available to you from eBay, and other places, while also providing you with their own API resources that you can use to rapidly deploy mobile apps. This layer is complex, lots to think aobut here.</p>
<p><strong>Top APIs</strong><br />There is a breed of API resources that are changing the landscape, both in whats available and how you do it. &nbsp;Leaders like Twilio, SendGrid, Amazon Web Services, Google and others are providing API resources and approaches to delivering API resources in ways that are influencing the API economy in big ways. &nbsp;These players stand out, and are worthy of identifying as separate group.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong><br />API consumers have to be able to find API resources. &nbsp;Historically we've only had ProgrammableWeb for this, but we are seeing growth in number of directories, IDE integrations and other evolutions in how we describe, share and discover APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enablers</strong><br />There are several evolving approaches to using APIs that deliver entirely new use cases for APIs, enabling new value that API providers and consumers can tap into. &nbsp;API aggregation from providers like Singly are bringing together existing API resources into easier to use, aggregated interfaces. &nbsp;Reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT allow resources and value to transfer between API platforms in the clouds and behind the firewall. &nbsp;Application frameworks like <a href="http://ql.io/">ql.io</a>, are changing how we bridge APIs and rapidly build API driven web and mobile applications. &nbsp;Real-time providers like Firebase and Pusher are connecting and providing APIs that make the exchange of API driven resources real-time. &nbsp;These are just a of the few of the new areas of API enablement I'm seeing emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Reseller</strong><br />Platform providers like BaaS, PaaS and Saas, plus the enablers, discovery services and top APIs all represent reseller and partnership opportunities for individual companies deploying API resources. &nbsp;This is the wholesale world of getting your API found as well as being baked into an existing consumer base. &nbsp;Without a reseller or partner layer to your API, you are just a single API in a ever growing flood of API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Last Mile</strong><br />However, this is all just the piping or tubes of this fascinating new API driven economy. &nbsp;The entire purpose of having these API pipes is to deliver the "last mile". &nbsp;APIs began by delivering resources to distributed web sites, and enabling sharing and embeddable widgets and buttons. &nbsp;With the birth of the cloud, APIs began delivering wholesale infrastructure resources for use indistributed cloud environments. Then with mobile we saw the demand for APIs skyrocket--what will it do with big data, sensors, devices, cars, home and building and beyond?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my role as API Evangelist. &nbsp;I feel compelled to keep the discussion of the pipes occuring within all the "last mile" conversations. &nbsp;I understand the VC's and companies under their control want to monetize the last mile. &nbsp;This is fine. &nbsp;But I want to prevent the API pipes from getting paved over in the process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want ANYONE to be able to get at the pipes behind the tablet applications their children use. &nbsp;I want ANYONE to be able to get at the data that went into any infographic, visualzation or report. &nbsp;I want ANYONE to understand the pipes that connect our physical worlds via sensors, devices to our online worlds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want the pipes to stay open, accessible, transparent and part of ALL "last mile" conversations. &nbsp;Which brings me back to&nbsp;Patrick Meir article. &nbsp;There were several key quotes I'm processing in regards to how I view API resources, API pipes and the last mile API Products that are derived from them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Feenberg&rsquo;s own view is constructivist, &ldquo;emphasizing that technology development is humanly controlled and encapsulates values and politics; it should thus be open to democratic control and intervention.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;technology can and should be seen as a result of political negotiations that lead to its production and use. In too many cases, the complexities of technological systems are used to concentrate power within small groups of technological, financial, and political elites and to prevent the wider body of citizens from meaningful participation in shaping it and deciding what role it should have in the everyday.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Meaning Hacking" is often hijacked by "Deep Technical Hackers"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Democratizing information flows and access; promoting Open Data and Do it Yourself (DIY) </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Innovation with free, highly hackable (i.e., open source) technology; letting go of control.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"the artful alteration of technology beyond the goals of its original design or intent,&rdquo; enables &ldquo;Deep Democratization"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Freely pro-viding the hackable building blocks for DIY Innovation is one way to let go of control and democratize"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The control over the information is kept, by and large, by major corporations and the participant&rsquo;s labor is enrolled in the service of these corporations, leaving the issue of payback for this effort a moot point. Significantly, the primary intention of the providers of the tools is not to empower communities or to include marginalized groups, as they do not re-present a major source of revenue."</em></p>
<p>There are so many lessons to be absorbed from CrisisMapping and Neogeography, when it comes to the API economy. &nbsp;Sorry for just posting these quotes as just a list, but I'm still absorbing and just needed them published in single place, so I can reference and re-read while thinking on this subject. &nbsp;(Thats right, I read my own blog!)</p>
<p>I don't think there are any easy answers here. &nbsp;I just want to make sure we keep the conversation including the pipes and not just about the resources and last mile products delivered on top of the pipes. &nbsp;So we don't cutoff the oxygen needed for the API economy to work for EVERYONE!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform/">BeyondGET or OtherVerbs, an Augmented API Platform </a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-post.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a idea for a new API platform.  Since I do not have any startup aspirations, I prefer setting my ideas free, for anyone to use, instead of acting on them myself.</p>
<p>This idea is an evolution from an earlier one, which I had while working with the CityGrid API, called &ldquo;augmented places&rdquo;. &nbsp;While at CityGrid I constantly had people asking if they could submit data back to the API.  Stating they had a better list of pizza places in Brooklyn or vegan restaurants in Santa Cruz.  I had to always turn these folks away, and one morning I sketched out  &ldquo;augmented places&rdquo;.  It would be a service where anyone could submit their own meta data about a place, either adding an entirely new place, updating an existing one, or even remove a listing. It would provide an external service that could augment all places APIs, not just CityGrid.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the other night, I did some data journalism for my girlfriend Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), which included <a href="/2013/03/16/using-the-crunchbase-api/">pulling data from the Crunchbase API</a>.  I pulled 3000 education startups from around the world, then after delivering to her in a JSON object and Google Spreadsheet, I immediately used the script to pull any API related startup, for my own needs.  I quickly compared a handful of results with my existing API database and in many cases, I have much better information on some of these companies than CrunchBase.  Yet I have no way to submit this data back to CrunchBase, to correct or add to what they have.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-put.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is common in the open API space.  Most data APIs only allow you to /GET.   Allowing for the other verbs /POST, /PUT, and /DELETE, usually require not just more resources to deploy and manage, but also a certain mindset that is open to receiving information from your API consumers, which could range from internal and partner users, to the general public.  Some places I&rsquo;ve worked, are just scared shitless of repercussions of doing something like this.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my idea for a new API service.  Let&rsquo;s call it <strong>BeyondGET</strong> or <strong>OtherVerbs</strong>.  A service that would allow people to add API resources they&rsquo;d like to augment with the ability to POST, PUT and GET.  So I could add an entry for Crunchbase using api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/.  I would define each entry with a Swagger definition, and the system would create a basic data store for the entry.   You could now submit changes to existing records, as well as entirely new records or mark a record for deletion--providing an augmented, external, crowdsourced layer on top of potentially distributed API resources.</p>
<p>Developers could use a primary API resource as well as the augmented version of the API if they choose.   You would have to add some sort of trusted user layer, so developers could only show data submitted by trusted sources. &nbsp;Seems like some sort of Git layer for versioning would be needed as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-delete.png" alt="" width="330" align="right" /></p>
<p>API owners could also choose to use an augmented layer as a sort of crowdsource queue for their API.  The API owner could decide which users they trust and what data was relevant enough to let back in.  It could act as a DMZ for your API.</p>
<p>There would also need to be a data licensing layer to all of this, that if well crafted, could open up the potential for revenue sharing or at least virtual credits to use against other API services.  I know CityGrid was discussing how they could reward API consumers for their contributions, and I could see this being a way to deliver on that across the API space.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;d love to hear thoughts on this.  Or run with building a version of it yourself.  It would be awesome to see a whole breed of augmented API service providers pop up, allowing me to add a new section about it at API Evangelist. :)</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/16/using-the-crunchbase-api/">Using The Crunchbase API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Audrey</a> came to me last night and said she had a project that she wanted to tackle, using the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase API</a>.  She wanted to pull a list of education startups that were founded in 2010-2012, showing their investments, CEO, founders and other related company information.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, I helped Audrey download a PHP Twitter bot, reverse engineer and make it work for an objective she had around Tweeting random responses to a certain type of tweet.  I figured she was ready to see what it took to hack on an API and get the research data she needed.</p>
<p>Audrey wanted to pull a list of startups that were educated related.  We started with the /search endpoint, using the query keyword &ldquo;education&rdquo;.   The query parameter appears to search the title, tags and overview of each Crunchbase entry, pulling way more than what we needed, 5700 in total.  Each search returned 10 startups, with a handful of fields for each company, not nearly enough information.</p>
<p>To prove we could get what we needed, we took the first startup returned, grabbed the name and used it to perform a company /entity search, returning a wealth of information.  We had what we were looking for including date founded, amount raised, CEO, founders as well as description, logos, addresses and other vital company information.</p>
<p>Back to the /search endpoint.  Each search only returned 10 results, when there were actually 5,700.  I looked at the documentation and the only parameter listed, was &ldquo;query&rdquo;.  No way to control how many results returned, paginate or otherwise.  So I start guessing, appending page=, and max=, maxrows=, anything to get more results.  Eventually I was able to change the page, so I was able to write logic to loop through each page, getting at all the results required.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-search-endpoint.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>For each returned result from the /search endpoint, I would take the company name and perform a company search on the /entity endpoint.  However each call to the endpoint would yield a 301, redirecting me to another URL.  So the search for:</p>
<blockquote><em>http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/Noodle+Education.js?api_key=[key]</em></blockquote>
<p>Get a 301 returned, with the following redirect URL:</p>
<blockquote><em>http://ec2-107-21-104-179.compute-1.amazonaws.com/v/1/company/noodle-education.js</em></blockquote>
<p>So for each /entity endpoint I would have to make two separate cURL calls to get a single record for a company.  An approach that is guarantee to get CrunchBase into the API billionaires club (as chatty APIs do), or at the very least generate a nice bill with their API management provider.</p>
<p>Next, I needed to create a table to store the data in, I looped through the JSON object and spit out a list of fields, so I could generate a SQL script to create the table.  There were a few duplicate fields, but quickly got a table up and the data inserted.  The data is decent.  There are a lot of issues with absence of default values, empty objects with available images, addresses, etc.  But nothing I&rsquo;m not used to wading through, to get what I need from an API.</p>
<p>With the /search endpoint based upon a single keyword search, that spans title, overview and tags, the search returned a lot of companies that didn&rsquo;t fit our search.  As we prepared to enter each record into a database, we would apply further filters, making sure there companies founded in 2010 or greater, and met other criteria, before actually inserting.</p>
<p>Now we had a MySQL table filled with 772 education startups.  I exported as CSV, uploaded as a Google Spreadsheet, and shared it with Audrey.  Game over.  She had what she needed.  Overall it took about 3 hours start to finish, which she felt was tedious, and feeling there was a lack of clarity regarding the whole process--something she couldn&rsquo;t have done with me and my API programming skills.  This is a problem CrunchBase.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/startup-ecosystem-visualization.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audrey is your target audience</span>.  This needs to be dead simple.  She shouldn&rsquo;t have to blindly navigate the API endpoints, documentation, data structures and holes in the data.  These are things I&rsquo;m used to having to cobble together, but an analyst like herself, won&rsquo;t have the time and patience.</p>
<p>I can tell the CrunchBase API was created by someone who didn&rsquo;t give a shit about the data, let alone use the API to build anything.  I saw a job posting from CrunchBase, so I know they are looking for someone to own the API.  I hope this person can become a steward for this great set of data, and make it into a meaningful API--there is a lot of potential there.</p>
<p>Quick feedback for whoever takes the job, regarding some building blocks to focus on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong> - Establish more meaningful names for the existing endpoints, while establishing some new ones</li>

</ul>
<p>CrunchBase is a goldmine of data.  As it is, I can make use of the data and generate value.  But the API won&rsquo;t remain at the center of that, I will extract the value I need and not return much to the platform, because well...it sucks ass.  I can&rsquo;t write back, and I do so much work to get the value I do, I feel like its mine after I&rsquo;m done. Especially if the platform has no person or personality that I consider an owner or steward. &nbsp;I don't feel beholden to give anything back. &nbsp;Just take...not good for your business.</p>
<p>You guys have a lot of potential within the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/io-docs">CrunchBase API</a>, I hope you dedicate the resources to make it work, and find a steward for the API that will actually care about what you have, and interact with your API consumers in a meaningful way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/braintree/braintree-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Next generation payment provider <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank">Braintree</a> just launched a new JavaScript library that helps  merchants reduce their PCI scope in a flexible and testable way, which they are calling appropriately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/braintrust/braintree-js" target="_blank">Braintree.js</a>.  According to Braintree, the library:</p>
<blockquote><em>...uses asymmetric encryption to prevent raw credit card data from passing through merchants' servers. It intercepts a form submit in the browser that contains sensitive data, encrypts that data with a public key provided to merchants by Braintree and then submits the form with the encrypted data to the server. Braintree retains the private key of the key pair so that merchants are unable to decrypt the encrypted fields server-side. Any string field in Braintree's API can be encrypted and encrypted values can be transparently dropped into any API call</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what I call a <a title="embeddable API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Embeddable">healthy embeddable strategy</a>, which includes buttons, badges, widgets and other tools you can build on top of an API or to support API integration.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/languages">rise in populartiy of JavaScript</a>, and the growth of platforms like Node.js, I predict that providing your API developers with standardized JS libraries that extend the value of your API will become commonplace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add a section to my <a title="embeddable building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">embeddable building blocks</a>, for JavaScript libraries. I&rsquo;m seeing more API providers doing cool stuff in this area.  I will try and record as much of it as I can during my industry monitoring each week and provide resources for you to follow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the <a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">potential of markup APIs and scripting platforms</a>&nbsp;in the past, which I think is a related example to what Braintree is doing--in which you can build JS libraries for your API users and extend not just the reach of the value generated by your APIs, but the expertise of your team.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pusher/cisimple-plus-pusher.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.pusher.com/using-pusher-to-power-cisimples-real-time-api/">This story comes</a> from Phil Leggetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) over at <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.  Its about a client of theirs, <a href="https://www.cisimple.com/">cisimple</a>, which provides continuous delivery services for mobile developers.  <a href="http://blog.cisimple.com/2013/03/06/check-out-our-shiny-new-api-and-pusher-integration/">cisimple just released a new API</a>, which gives mobile developers more control over the build processes for their mobile applications.</p>
<p>Using the cisimple API you can kick off new builds and download artifacts from your mobile dev process.  cisimple is a very interesting API resource, that I will definitely be watching, and I&rsquo;m sure I will be writing about in the near future.  But what I really think is interesting is that cisimple is allowing clients to register for real-time updates via Pusher channels, using API tokens.</p>
<p>This means that when you use cisimple to manage your mobile development, you now have a real-time push system that will send notifications when builds start, pass, fail, etc.  This opens up a whole world of human integration with the build process via desktop and mobile notifications, but also can be used in other systems that play a role in your dev cycles.</p>
<p>The weaving of a Pusher real-time notification layer into the cisimple API is pretty innovative. Something I&rsquo;m sure will deliver huge value to their customers.   But think of the potential as a standard approach for all API owners?  You could offer developers real-time notifications about their own usage of your API, providing them with an intimate view of how their application(s) are using an API.  Addiitionally it seems like you could set up a pretty interesting system wide notification layer that would let you, as the API owner, establish notification channels regarding overall API usage, thresholds and other important signals from your platform.</p>
<p>As I continue to dive into the <a title="real-time" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/realtime.php" target="_blank">world of real-time APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m surprised at the multiple ways in which we can truly deliver real-time value using APIs.  cisimple API + Pusher is in interesting addition.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/15/pinboard-api-tax-proposal/">Pinboard API Tax Proposal</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://pinboard.in" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard_in_blue.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Maciej Ceglowskiis, the founder of popular social bookmarking platform <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>,made an <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pinboard-dev/PidYOmyBaxI/mLDKIzC6olgJ" target="_blank">interesting proposal over on the Pinboard Google Group</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I've been thinking about imposing an API tax, the proceeds of which  would go into improving API infrastructure and offsetting operating costs, structured along these lines:</em></p>
<ul class="mainlist" style="padding-left: 30px; list-style: none;">
<li> 
<ul>
<li><em>API free to use for your own Pinboard account</em></li>
<li><em>Every API client making requests on behalf of someone else must register an app identifier</em></li>
<li><em>$20/year tax if your app makes requests for over 100 Pinboard accounts</em></li>
<li><em>$100/year tax if your app makes requests for over 1000 Pinboard accounts</em></li>
<li><em>Possibly additional price levels to waive certain rate limits</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Think of it as a road tax that then pays for further construction, repair, and  people in orange vests.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that Maciej has a lot of experience to back his proposal, watching how developers use Pinboard for their own purposes, or on behalf of a user via a client.  I heavily depend on Pinboard for my curation at API Evangelist, so API access would remain free for me.  I&rsquo;m not sure how I would feel if I was building a client.</p>
<p>On the forum, there is very interesting feedback from Matt Schmidt, developer of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pindroid">PinDroid</a>, the leading Pinboard client for Android:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I'm very much against this.  Why would you tax the makers of the apps that help drive use of your product, rather than the users themselves?  To extend your road use tax analogy, this is like taxing the car companies for their customer's use of the roads.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I offer PinDroid as a free, open source app and have no interest in making money off it, but I also have no interest in losing money on it.  Why not offer api access as a premium account feature (like archiving) for an extra buck instead?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To be clear, if such a "tax" were to be implemented, I will have to stop developing and supporting PinDroid and take it off the market.</em></p>
<p>Matt provides some real life feedback, that I can&rsquo;t.  PindDroid is a vital player in the PinBoard ecosystem, that could be hurt by such a tax.  Free and open source code and clients are a vital aspect of any API ecosystem, you definitely want to understand how this layer will be affected by such a tax.</p>

<p>Maciej just made this proposal today, so the conversation is fresh.  Head over to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pinboard-dev/PidYOmyBaxI/mLDKIzC6olgJ" target="_parent">Pinboard Google Group</a> to weigh in.  I&rsquo;ll post another story after the conversation dies down, providing more thoughts about API taxes.</p>

<p>In May 2011 I released a book called the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Business-APIs-1-Kin-Lane/dp/1461113881/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304210432&amp;sr=1-5">Business of APIs</a>. The book was intended to be an introductory walkthrough for non-technical people, to the world of APIs. I wanted to educate business, organizational and governmental leaders about the space, and the important role of APIs in having a healthy digital strategy.</p>
<p>Its coming up on two years later, and I'm finally getting around to updating the Business of APIs. After a nice long walk on the strand with <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>, we have the outline for the next version:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>What are APIs used for?</li>
<li>The history of APIs</li>
<li>What goes into an API?</li>
<li>Do you need an API?</li>
<li>How do you get an API??</li>
<li>What are the common building blocks of an API?</li>
<li>What are possible business models for an API?</li>
<li>How do you evangelize and support an API?</li>
<li>Where have some APIs stumbled?</li>
<li>APIs, a new way of doing business</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the Business of APIs is the same. Help anyone, from any company, organization or the government understand what an API is, and why they are important. &nbsp;You don't have to be a developer to put APIs to use, this book is for everyone.</p>
<p>Look for an updated version of the Business of APIs by June. I'll still keep it a simple guide to the space, but provide a whole lot more information that will help you understand the Business of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://punchfork.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-vertical.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I ended up at the Punfork API today for some reason. Full disclosure: "Punchfork has been acquired by Pinterest! <a href="http://punchfork.com/pinterest" target="_blank">Read the announcement</a>. Site shutdown: March 31st, 2013".  Just getting that out of the way. While at the site, I ended up at the <a href="http://punchfork.com/goodies/badges">Goodies page</a>, which I think represents a nice set of basic embeddable tools for an API.</p>
<p>First using Punchfork Badges, you can customize a badge, then copy and paste the embed code onto your blog's sidebar, or anywhere else you want it to appear:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-badges.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Then you can download a Punchfork logo (ok, its just one, but it gets point across):</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-logos.png" alt="" width="250" /></p>
<p>Last, you can enter your address and request a Punchfork sticker to be sent to you:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-stickers.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>These are all three, simple examples of a good approach to providing embeddable tools for users.  Badges are pretty straightforward, and it is sensible to provide logos and other images as part of a healthy branding strategy.  But the request for a sticker is something I haven't added to my listing of embeddable building blocks. After thinking about it, stickers are the OG embeddable tool.  Something your users can take offline, and embed anywhere.</p>
<p>At some point I will do a roundup of all the embeddable building blocks, since I've been adding some new ones like sticker request form.</p>

<p>I see a lot of new API platforms emerge, and often times you see them deploying their own solutions to problems that are actively solved by top API platforms, and are already adopted by common mobile and web app users.</p>
<p>The best example of this is with authentication.  Its growing more and more common that you don&rsquo;t build your own login, you use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google or Github oAuth.</p>
<p>It seems to me that when it comes to other common resources, the same could be applied.  So I&rsquo;m exploring what my essential stack of API driven resources might look like:</p>

<p>I could do quite a bit with this assembled as a single backend stack, if it included a regular datastore, key-value store, user management and other essentials for building apps.</p>
<p>It seems to me that new platforms shouldn&rsquo;t always create new silos, but bridge the existing ones that we depend on already.</p>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, the server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications in JavaScript, seems to be getting more attention lately from top API providers because of its event-driven, asynchronous I/O that can minimizeoverhead and maximize scalability.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/#readme">Google released an official Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs </a>that supports authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0.  Then earlier this week, Amazon Web Services announced that <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/aws-elastic-beanstalk-for-nodejs.html">AWS Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS solution now supports Node.js applications</a>.</p>
<p>While Google&rsquo;s deployment is a client, and AWS&rsquo;s is an application platform, they both have the same objective--enabling developers to build highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective applications using APIs.</p>
<p>Both Google and AWS recognize the potential for selling developers their valuable API driven resources, by providing them with Node.js solutions.  <a href="https://github.com/languages/JavaScript">JavaScript is the number one language on Github</a>, with Node dominating most starred and most forked overall categories, according to Github trends.</p>
<p>I think that AWS and Github both send a good signal to other API owners, that they need to step up the availablity of Node.js resources for their API developer communities.</p>

<p>One of the best aspects of being the API Evangelist, is I get to hang out with smart folks, doing gaming changing things across all business sectors.  Last week I was able to make it to the API Social, an event held in Berkeley by a group of API savvy faculty members.  This is my third one, and the group is up to some very interesting things.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with one UC Berkeley analyst about a problem that isn&rsquo;t just unique to a university, but they are working on an innovative solution for.</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<blockquote><em>UCB Developers are creating Web Services that provide access to sensitive data (e.g. grades, transcripts, current enrollments) but only trusted applications are typically allowed to access these Web Services to prevent misuse of the sensitive data.   Expanding access to these services, while preserving the confidentiality of the data, could provide student and third party developers with opportunities to create new applications that provide UCB students with enhanced services.</em></blockquote>
<p>The solution:</p>
<blockquote><em>Wrapping untrusted applications in a "Proxied Facade Service" framework that passes anonymous tickets through the &ldquo;untrusted&rdquo; application to underlying services that can independently extract the necessary personal information provides a secure way of allowing an application to retrieve a Web User&rsquo;s Business data (e.g. their current course enrollments) WITHOUT exposing any identifying information about the user to the untrusted application.</em></blockquote>
<p>I find their problem and solution fascinating, I also think it is something that could have huge potential.  When data leaves any school, healthcare provider, financial services or government office, the presence of sensitive data is always a concern.  More data will be leaving these trusted systems, for use in not just apps, but also for analysis and visualizations, and the need to scrub personally identifiable information will only grow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still processing everything the team at UC Berkeley is doing, but want to write about as I&rsquo;m wrapping my head around it.  If you know of any other services out there that do similar things, let me know.  I&rsquo;m curious to hear about other approaches to scrubbing personally identifiable information as it leaves systems via APIs.</p>

The are being very transparent about the process (which I like), and putting out the word looking for some new team members to help them get the job one.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks they want build an API that is simple and easy to use, but also capable of handling tens of millions of document conversations a month.  To help get the job done they are looking for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Sales Engineers</strong> - Boots on the ground to let them know what people want and to help us engage the developer community</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Engineers </strong>- Help them open source the demos we build and design our client-side libraries</li>
<li><strong>DevOps Engineers </strong>- Help them build the infrastructure we use to convert millions of documents each month</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5358861">Crocodoc posting on Hacker News</a>, but I&rsquo;m writing about because I appreciate API owner sending out signals that they are planning the next version of their API.  This type of transparancy is not just important in helping you find talent to make it happen, it sends a signal to the community that you are beginning a planning cycle and can encourage community feedback and involvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-square.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Netflix has <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Changes_to_the_Public_API_Program" target="_blank">entered the final stages of shuttering its public API last week</a>.  Its been coming for a while now, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Upcoming_Changes_to_the_Netflix_API_Program" target="_blank">starting in June of 2012</a>, and now is official with the platform no longer accepting new API registrations.</p>
<p>After reading about the changes to the Netflix Public API program on their blog, and hearing much of the news in response, <a href="http://www.rethink-wireless.com/2013/03/11/netflix-public-api-program-retired.htm" target="_blank">everyone seems to file this away, along with the Twitter API</a>--just another API platform screwing over its developers.</p>
<p>As I do, I wanted to take a step back, look at the bigger picture and try understand what happened. &nbsp;On <a href="http://readwrite.com/2008/09/30/netflix_api_launches_tomorrow" target="_blank">October 1st 2008, Netflix launched their public API</a>, and they appear to have done everything right.  They had a blog, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Let_Us_Know_About_your_Libraries" target="_blank">solicited code samples from developers</a>, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/App_Gallery_Open_for_Developer_Submissions" target="_blank">accepted application submissions</a> and even <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Finding_nice_applications_via_the_Netflix_App_Gallery" target="_blank">showcased the developers apps in the gallery</a>.  Netflix would even help <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Promote_Your_App_to_Netflix_Subscribers" target="_blank">promote your app to Netflix subscribers</a> and <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Untitled_1" target="_blank">threw hackathons</a>.  The Netflix API team worked to <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/API_Performance_Improvements" target="_blank">improve API performance</a>, communicate regularly, but really nothing that amazing happened.</p>
<p>There were applications like <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/" target="_blank">InstaWatcher</a> and <a href="http://www.whichflicks.com/" target="_blank">WhichFlicks</a>&nbsp;(among others)&nbsp;developed on the API, but as Daniel Jacobson puts it, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/michaelhart2/api-strategy-evolution-at-netflix" target="_blank">a thousand flowers didn&rsquo;t bloom</a>.  In these situations its easy to blame the API provider, but developers didn&rsquo;t really step up and build anything that innovative and cool. So is this a failure of Netflix?  A failure of developers to innovate?  Or could it possibly be a third: failure of the API vision?</p>
<p>I would say the demise of the Netflix public API is equal part Netflix and the developer, and just the nature of the industry it exists in.  It didn&rsquo;t take me long to look through the Netflix API blog, so I can tell they didn&rsquo;t put alot into evangelizing the API.   But I really can&rsquo;t find any innovation that occurred by developers as part of it, so I think us devs have to share some of the responsibility as well.</p>
<p>Several of the blog posts covering the news last week, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/08/netflix-changes-its-current-api-program-by-ending-it-will-no/" target="_blank">compared this to Twitter</a> which I think for the untrained eye of the mainstream tech blogosphere, this is easy to do.  But Twitter is user generated content, via one of the newest types of content platforms, and Netflix is heavily licensed and policed content from one of the oldest content platforms.  I think expecting public API success from Netflix and / or developers was a lot to ask.</p>
<p>I love and believe in APIs, but I&rsquo;m not delusional enough to think they will work magically everywhere they are applied. However, even with the closing of the public Netflix API, I consider Netflix is an API success story.  Look what they&rsquo;ve done with their internal and partner APIs. They&rsquo;ve managed to scale not just from the data center to the cloud, but globally and across 800+ devices--while also <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">sharing this knowledge and wisdom with the public</a>&nbsp;via their blog:</p>

<p>When measuring the success or failures of API initatives, we can't use the same yardstick in all scenarios. When you look at the knowledge, wisdom and code that has come out of Netflix, there is no way you can say their API initiative is anything but a success. I don&rsquo;t see see Netflix as a case study in how to stream movies over the web via public APIs, but a deeply important experiment in how to deliver licensed content to over 800 devices, via the next generation of APIs. &nbsp;Something that probably isn't an edge case, it actually represents where we all might be headed in the near future.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get caught up in the recent deprecation of the Netflix public API. &nbsp;There is so much going on! &nbsp;Let's get studying some of the knowledge and technology coming out of Netflix. I know its my motivation for writing this post, and doing this research.</p>

<p>It is exciting to see the explosion of events, and I&rsquo;m hopeful regarding how much progress will occur in 2013 with this many conversations going on.  It is also promising to see the international growth, with Nordic APIs happening in Scandinavia, API Days coming from France, Business of APIs in London and API Summit spreading the conversation from United States and Australia.</p>
<p>With this amount of buzz, APIs will definitely continue its spread to the mainstream.  My only hope is that all the events make sure and represent the space well by being interoperable and sharing content, speakers and ideas openly so that the entire industry benefits.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api-the-humans-win/">SOA vs API - The Humans Win</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/human-cutout.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the API movement marches forward, it continues to grind against the enterprise and its legacy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a>, which increases the frequency at which people ask me, <em>What is the difference between API and SOA?</em> This is not a technical explanation of the differences, but a philosophical one that many will argue does not apply, but in my opinion is the dark matter around the technological and business approach of SOA,  that makes API work.</p>
<p>Many say that a web API is just one component in an SOA toolbox.  This is true.  Using HTTP for an API is not that novel in itself.  That is until it jumped out of the enterprise petri dish, got a little oxygen to grow, allowing the introduction of some new aspects that the industry and technology overlords of SOA would never have introduced on their own.</p>
<p>While reading the <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/nation-building-in-the-age-of-apis/">Nation Building in the Age of APIs</a>, by Matt McLarty (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>) of <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a> today, he reminded me that:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Every paradigm shift in technology has been driven by both innovation&mdash;the new technology itself&mdash;and application&mdash;how that technology can be used.  In other words, there is a machine side and a people side to every technology change.  The technologists responsible for implementing these changes often bias towards their comfort zone&mdash;the machine side&mdash;and overlook the people side."</em></blockquote>
<p>He is right. &nbsp;APIs moves us closer to the people side of the equation, outside the technologists comfort zone, but I would also add that it moves it outside the business and industry leaderships comfort zone, introducing more balance that has the potential to make online communities, platforms and ecosystem thrive. Matt continues to say:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Ultimately, the success of a company&rsquo;s API will depend on the creation of a diverse community for that API&mdash;end users, partners, developers, and more&mdash;as well as the adoption of a business model that allows the API to contribute to the company&rsquo;s bottom line."</em></blockquote>
<p>SOA does a damn fine job of looking after the platforms (business), the developers (technology), but doesn't always provide for the best interest of the user--aka human side of the equation.  APIs have allowed for valuable resources to flow around traditional IT bottlenecks, outside the firewall and be put to use by those who are potentially closer to the human problem that is being solved.</p>
<p>API introduces newer pieces of the SOA puzzle, found within the OAuth security relationship, terms of use and privacy policies, self-service access, transparency, while also providing monetization strategies that encourage partner and developer innovation.</p>
<p>At first glance, it is easy to mistake API as just part of the SOA toolbox, but there are other nuances that bring SOA closer to the users, and solving the real problems they face, by developers who understand.  In the end I don't really think it matters whether you call it SOA or API, just make sure you include the essential ingredients that have worked with "open" APIs, whether your API is public, private or evolving your partner relationships.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/vc/oxford-strategic-advisors-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ve made it my mission to go outside of the Silicon Valley bubble and educate the &ldquo;normals&rdquo; about the potential of APIs.  In doing this I have conversations with a wide range of folks from new startups, to the GSA in Washington DC.  One growing trend I&rsquo;m seeing is the number of VC and angel investors reaching out, to have me help them understand the API space and how it applies to their investments.</p>
<p>I have a couple VC&rsquo;s I talk to on a regular basis, but I have a growing number of new ones who are investing more and more in technology companies and need to get a grip on this API world.  As a Terry Kearns from Oxford Strategic Advisors, LLC,&nbsp;put it yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I wanna let you know I appreciate all the work you've done here. For a guy who is not a tech guy. You really help me out with a lot, your articles and information help me get my arms around this whole API world"</em></blockquote>
<p>That is my mission.  This is what I do.  Nobody pays me to educate people like this about the APIs space, but it is so critical that the folks who are investing in the next generation of healthcare, education, manufacturing and other business sectors, understand APIs, at least at a basic level.</p>
<p>APIs are part of fundamental change in how we conduct business, not just in technology sector, but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERY</span></strong> aspect of our government, business and even our personal lives.  Let me know how I can answer questions about your existing investment portfolio or regarding business sectors you are looking to invest in.</p>
<p>Make sure your companies truly understand APIs, and you are making educated investments.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Nordic APIs" href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/nordic-apis/nordic-apis-logo-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Are you ready for more discussions about APIs?  I know I am. :) This time its from our Scandinavian friends, with four events in 2013.  <a title="Nordic APIs" href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank">Nordic APIs</a> is a series of conferences and events held across Scandinavia which provides knowledge and information about APIs.</p>
<p>API Evangelist is a supporter of Nordic APIs, and you will find me speaking at the 2 day event in Stockholm in September.  I will be speaking with Adam DuVander(<a href="https://twitter.com/@adamd">@adamd</a>) and John Musser(<a href="https://twitter.com/@johnusser">@johnusser</a>) of <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Jacob Ideskog (<a href="https://twitter.com/@jacobideskog">@jacobideskog</a>) and Travis Spencer (<a href="https://twitter.com/@travisspencer">@travisspencer</a>) of <a href="http://www.twobotechnologies.com/">Twobo Technologies</a>, as well as the notorious Andreas Krohn (<a href="https://twitter.com/@andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>).</p>
<p>I feel an awakening happening around APIs, and its not just a Silicon Valley thing.  People around the globe are becoming more aware of the potential of APIs.  I'm getting more and more requests from Europe and South America for API education, resources and tools.</p>
<p>We need to support as many of these open, vendor neutral conversations about APIs as we can.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Nordic APIs series is looking for sponsors and support</span>.  If your company is looking to break into Scandinavia, you should be supporting Nordic APIs, because its guaraneed to be a couple hundred of the smartest folks across the Scandanavian API space assembled in one building.</p>
<p>Head over to <a title="Nordic APIs" href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank">Nordic APIs site</a> and contact them directly to see how you can support the conversations that will be occurring across Scandavia, and I look forward to seeing you there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working through lists of APIs and API service providers who I&rsquo;ve rated pretty highly because of their work in the past, but red flags have gone up because I&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t seen a blog post, tweet or commit from them lately.  One of the service providers I&rsquo;m reviewing is <a title="Zypr" href="https://www.zypr.net/">Zypr</a>, which providers voice enabled architecture built on popular APIs.</p>
<p>Zypr fits in with my vision of where APIs are going, because Zypr is doing the same thing as aggregation, automation and other trending service providers, but the end goal is this use case is voice.  In Zyprs own words:</p>
<blockquote><em>Zypr aggregates proprietary 3rd party APIs, categorizes their functions, and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API. By aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes.</em></blockquote>
<p>That sounds exactly like what <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> is doing, but with voice as the vehicle for making valuable API resources avilable on apps running via mobile phones, tablets and in our cars and homes.  I really like the Zypr graphic.  I will have to create a similar version to articulate some the API trends I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zypr.net/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zypr/zypr-voice-enabled.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I hope Zypr is just heads down, working hard on their platform.  According to my API stack rank, there aren&rsquo;t very many positive signals coming out of the platform:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Last Blog Post - 09/28/2012</li>
<li>Last Tweet - 01/30/2013</li>
<li>Last Commit - 10 months ago</li>
</ul>
<p>What Zypr is doing is important--I hope they have enough runway to make happen. &nbsp;If they need to cut corners, they shouldn't replicate the service or client adapter portion of their platform, they could just partner with an existing <a title="API aggregator" href="/trends/aggregation.php">API aggregators</a>&nbsp;like Singly for these layers, as well as <a title="API reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers</a> like Elastic.io or Foxweave to migrate and tranform data. &nbsp;In my opinion Zypr should focus on how their engine works, and partner and generate open source to build the rest.</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to see more competition in the space of API driven voice enabled architecture.  So far I haven&rsquo;t found any other players doing it at the same level as Zypr.  Let me know if you know of something. Siri is going to need some healthy competition.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see Amazon step up in the advertising game with the beta release of the <a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank">Amazon Mobile Ads API</a> this week.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want Amazon getting into my space, when it comes to any API resource, especially advertising.  On the other hand, one can say that the space needs disruption with the dominance of Google with their multiple offerings:</p>
<p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-dollar-sign-cloud.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>

</ul>
<p>I think we can expect some intense competition when it comes to advertising and specifically around mobile advertising APIs--battling for your eyeballs on smart phones and tablets in 2013.</p>
<p>Another layer that will add to the competititiveness with advertising APIs is the fact that all three social media and networking giants have their own advertising APIs now as well:</p>
<p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-people-devices.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/ads-api" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.linkedin.com/blog/linkedin-ads-unveils-new-api-program" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With Google and Amazon both having devices in the game (Android and Kindle), it will be interesting how they partner with Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin for the social layer, and where all of this leaves Apple.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget about the  me too category with <a href="http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/search-advertising/bingads-api" target="_blank">Bing Advertising APIs</a> and <a href="http://advertisingcentral.yahoo.com/api/overview" target="_blank">Yahoo Advertising Central</a>, or the potentially over <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/21/112-advertising-apis-google-adsense-google-adwords-and-feedburner/" target="_blank">100 other advertising APIs available via ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>
<p>Any way you look at it, 2013 will prove to be a very competitive landscape when it comes to web and mobile advertising, with so many heavyweight contenders with their own devices and API driven advertising platforms.  I think an advertising API roundup is in order, in the near future.</p>
<p>I just hope that we start thinking beyond advertising when it comes to APIs and the monetization of web and mobile apps in 2013.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little behind in working through my list of new APIs to review.  So I&rsquo;m spending about 3 hours each day going through my list of new APIs accumulated from <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Tweets, Bookmarks, Google Alerts and other ways I have for discovering new APIs.</p>
<p>After looking&nbsp;through a couple hundred APIs, I&nbsp;wanted to share some things that stand out, and make me feel someone really doesn't give a shit when they hit publish on their API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Your entire developer area is a PDF</li>
<li>Really long, incoherent URL for dev area</li>
<li>Dev area is just a page in your help directory</li>
<li>You put google ads on every page of your API documentation</li>
<li>No communication, support or contact information at all</li>
<li>Sign up form that pops up in my face as soon as page loads</li>
<li>Require an NDA before I register</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of things that make me give an API a C or D grade, which means you probably aren&rsquo;t on my radar. &nbsp;But then again if you don't have active blog or twitter or developers aren't talking about you, your API won't register on the radar even with a B grade.</p>
<p>With tools like <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a title="APIhub" href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> out there, it isn&rsquo;t hard to hang your API in a professional way, with minimal amount of effort and resources.</p>
<p>After looking through hundreds of APIs I leave with the same feeling:  that there tons of good ideas out there, but 80% of them are just executed very poorly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking at new and innovative ways companies are building <a href="/2013/03/04/next-generation-of-api-driven-analytics-and-visualizations/">analytics and visualizations on top of APIs</a>, and one of the new tools I&rsquo;ve come across is <a href="http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a>.  ImpactStory aggregates altmetrics:  diverse impacts from your articles, datasets, blog posts, and more.  But this post isn&rsquo;t about ImpactStory, I&rsquo;ll crunch what they do and write about in another post.</p>
<p><a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/analytics/impactstory/impactstory-beta-feedback.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This post is about their usage of feedback, helpdesk, and knowledge base management tool&nbsp;<a title="UserVoice" href="https://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, which is a service I always recommend to API owners looking to support different aspects of their API community.</p>
<p>ImpactStory simply has a &ldquo;<em>BETA - Send us Your Feedback</em>&rdquo; image in the top right corner of their site.  When you click on the logo, you are presented with a simple UserVoice form for submitting your ideas of where you think ImpactStory should take their platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/analytics/impactstory/impactstory-beta-feedback-form.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I think this is a pretty dead simple way of soliciting feedback from your community. Involving your users in your roadmap planning can go a long way in building goodwill with them, and encouraging participation and innovation in other ways.</p>
<p>After I spend more time playing with <a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank">ImpactStory</a>, I&rsquo;ll do another post on what else they are up to, but at first glance its a pretty interesting approach to developing tracking analytics, visualization and other embeddable goodness using APIs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the great coverage by Paul MIller over at Cloud Ave about whether <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/26791/is-infochimps-running-from-the-data-market-business/">Infochimps running from the Data Market business</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/25863/discussing-data-markets-in-new-york-city/">Discussing Data Markets in New York City</a>.  He&rsquo;s touched on any interesting topic around the viability of data markets as a business, and the fate of several of the most high profile players in the space.</p>
<p>In 2011, when it comes to data API marketplaces and providers I tended to showcase players like <a href="http://factual.com">Factual</a>, <a href="http://kasabi.com">Kasabi</a>, <a href="http://datamarket.com/">DataMarket</a> and <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a>.  In 2013, we&rsquo;ve watched Kasabi disappear, and the migration of InfoChimps from an open data market, to a enterprise data platform.  While Factual and Datamarket appear to be going strong.</p>
<p>I think this reflects a common, lack of imagination by Silicon Valley because they are so focused on making money, they miss the need to support critical aspects of industries, that are required to allow for the growth they want to see.</p>
<p>While I feel there is money to be made off data marketplaces, however right now I think it is critical that we invest in people standing up and exposing data, not just focusing on making money off this process at levels that VC&rsquo;s deem adequate.</p>
<p>I make the same argument with API providers, its not that there isn&rsquo;t money in standing up APIs, but we need to heavily invest in the education of potential API owners and the healthy standing up of APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be plenty of money down the road from APIs and data marketplaces, but by always looking at it through a Silicon Valley perspective, we are going to stifle the oxygen necessary for a truly healthy, vibrant space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending time looking through the API service provider space, and <a href="/2013/03/01/api-deployment-as-a-service/">last week I noticed the big gap in there being API deployment services vs. API management services</a>.  This imbalance is due to a gold rush by heavily VC funded API service providers looking to capitalize on the enterprise looking to proxy their existing infrastructure with a new breed of API services.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/data-marketplaces/data-markets.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve argueed this with execs at <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unamed&nbsp;API service provider companies</span></em>, on whether the next growth in APIs will be from new, API providers or from the enterprise.   I was told I&rsquo;m naive and it shows my inexperience that I think it will come from outside the enterprise.  While there will be money to be made off the enterprise evolving their existing infrastructure in this new way, in reality this is just a small evolution in business not anywhere near a revolution.  Where big change in business sectors and economies will occur is when companies, organizations and government who didn&rsquo;t jump on SOA bandwagon understand the value of opening up data, and making available via APIs in this new way.</p>
<p>To get here we have a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOT</span></strong> of work to do.  We need education, tools and services available to get these companies, organizations and government up to speed, publishing data and standing up APIs.  Once this occurs, there will be plenty of money to be made in mobile, tablet, devices, analysis, visualations, curation, syndication and other areas you hear Silicon Valley tooting about.  But VC&rsquo;s are focused on the end goal, not necessarily how we get there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work making sure there are open source tools and content to help any company, organization or government group &nbsp;get their data marketplaces up and running.  Let&rsquo;s not focus on making a fortune from it now, let&rsquo;s just make sure it happens.  It&rsquo;s far to important to suffocate with short term visions of making profit.</p>

<p>API driven analytics and visualizations is one of the new areas&nbsp;of API usage I'm tracking on.   There are many &ldquo;big data&rdquo; platforms emerging these days, but I&rsquo;m looking for dead simple tools and services anyone can use to generate analytics and visualizations via APIs.</p>
<p>Think of <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers like IFTT, Zapier and Elastic.io</a>.  These new API driven service providers, make it easy to migrate data between cloud services, using a simple set of source API, triggers, actions and target APIs--with a dead simple icon and wizard based UI, allowing any user to put the platform to work.</p>
<p><a title="Ducksboard" href="http://ducksboard.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-analytics/ducksboard-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I want this approach for embeddable analytics, visualizations and other widgets that are easily generated via APIs. Last week I came across a new platform called <a href="http://ducksboard.com/">Ducksboard</a>, which allows you to easily generate some pretty sophisticated analytical widgets from common API sources.  The platform even comes with a marketplace where you can find other widgets.  The only problem is that Duckboards is meant to generate dashboards, and not really open and portable widgets. &nbsp;We'll keep an eye on this platform, see where it goes.</p>
<p><a title="Keen IO" href="https://keen.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-analytics/keen-io-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Ducksboard" href="http://ducksboard.com/" target="_blank">Then last night I came across </a><a title="Keen IO" href="https://keen.io/" target="_blank">Keen IO</a>, an analytics Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that lets developers build analytics features directly into their apps, from common API services.  Keen IO provides a pretty sophisticated workbench for building embeddable charts, metrics and other analytics or visualizations that you can render anywhere, using  iOS, Android, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and Java libraries they provide.</p>
<p>At first glance, this space can feel just like earlier waves of widget building platforms of the Web 1.0 &amp; 2.0 worlds.  But I think we hadn&rsquo;t reached critical mass, in the number of available API resources, as well as an awareness of APIs in general, in order to realize the true potential of widgets. I think we are getting closer in 2013.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optistic that a new breed of API driven analytics and visualization tools will emerge making dead simple, icon based interfaces that allow anyone to generate useful widgets from valuable API resources and embed them anywhere on the open web or in private portals.</p>
<p>Are there any other similar platforms that I'm missing?</p>

<p>Hands on, interactive tools are proving to be the most useful way to learn about an API--empowering users to see it in action, and witness the value it delivers.  Many companies are doing this by providing API explorers, consoles, interactive documentation and other hands-on tools that allow you to see how any API actually functions and learn about the API in realtime.</p>
<p>One of the latest companies to do this is <a title="MMS API Provider" href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider Mogreet</a>, which has stepped into the API explorer game with their own API tester allowing anyone to visually build an API call that sends multimedia messages, as well as take advantage of the 25 other methods available via the API platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-api-tester.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The API tester is available for all users via the developer dashboard, providing a hands on way to learn about the Mogreet API, all available endpoints, understand which parameters are required or optional, experiment with alternatives and quickly make the calls and see the result, understanding the value and operations before you get to work coding around the API.</p>
<p>While I think using an <a href="http://apigee.com/docs/consoletogo/">API explorer like Apigee&rsquo;s</a> can provide value, but I also recommend rolling your own toolkits that might speak specifically to your target audience.  I think a standard API console or explorer can help developers understand the operations of an API, but I think the right GUI tool can help any user understand the potential your API offers.  Which might make the difference between an integration project getting funded or not, with decision makers properly understanding how your API can be put to use.</p>
<p>Nice work Mogreet team!</p>

<p>How to structure pricing for an API is one of the top 5 questions I get from people who are currently planning their API strategy.  In my opinion, there is, and never will be a one size fits all API pricing strategy.  What you charge for your API resources should reflect their value and how they are accessed and used by your target consumers.</p>
<p>The Backend as a Service (BaaS) space is working hard to differentiate themselves in 2013 with <a title="baas pricing" href="/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">different approaches to pricing of mobile backend resources</a>.  Amazon is still shaking up the API space with new services, pricing models and the price reduction of API resources at a dizzying pace.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting the <a title="apicultur" href="https://store.apicultur.com/">Apicultur</a> team while in Paris for <a href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a>&nbsp;last October.  Apicultur is a linguistics API platform, that is pushing the boundaries of what is an API platform as well as how you price language API resources.</p>
<p>Apicultur recently shared some of the thinking behind the <a href="https://store.apicultur.com/site/pages/prices.jag" target="_blank">current version of their platform pricing</a>&nbsp;where they&nbsp;structure the price depending on three factors:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Complexity of the API</strong> - Some APIs perform a very simple task (like removing commas from a text) while others deal with more complex task (like extracting if the opinion expressed in a particular text is positive or negative)--the "bigger" the API, the pricier it gets</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> - The max speed by default is one call per second. In order to get more calls per second, Apicultur ask for a prepayment that is discounted from the final price at the end of the month (i.e., is not an extra price, is just a prepayment as a commitment). In addition, there's a discount at the end of the month for users for those who get a speed  limit feature</li>
<li><strong>Support -&nbsp;</strong>The basic support offered is the community support. For more support, special fees are offered</li>
</ul>

<p>Apicultur feels that by keeping the everything priced at 10,000 API calls, keeps things easy to understand as well as being fair for small and large projects. &nbsp;Leaving the costs spread between the varying value of individual API endpoints, the speed at which you need API calls and for overall support.</p>
<p>Small projects can register for the free account, which gives you up 20&euro; a month in calls without requiring a credit card, allowing developers to try an API before giving personal information and committing. I find it very interesting they call it a free account, while still applying a price to the value users are getting.</p>
<p>Apicultur has put a lot of thought into how they structure their API pricing.  I think their approach can help other API providers think about the value each of their endpoints offer, as well as other areas you can monetize, delivering more of what your API consumers need, while also bringing in revenue to make sure your API initiative is successful.</p>

<p>I stumbled across the <a title="Twitter Counter API" href="http://twittercounter.com/pages/api">Twitter Counter API</a> in my monitoring for the <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> this morning.  The Twitter Counter API allows you to retrieve key metrics on any Twitter account like username, url and avatar. &nbsp;All data you can get via the Twitter API, but with Twitter Counter API you get additional information like account growth statistics and ranking, that Twitter doesn't provide at all.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that someone can build an API to augment an existing API, which is why I keep talking about it, I guess :) We are seeing a more standardized version of this with API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://adigami.com">Adigami</a>, where they not only aggregate APIs from a variety of sources, they also build entirely new APIs based the added value that is created after they are brought together.</p>
<p>Thinking about if further, it would be cool if you could submit your API to be listed in your parent API providers API area.   Think of <a title="APIHub" href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a>, but every API area would have its own 3rd API marketplace.  API providers often allow 3rd party developers to submit code libraries and samples to be listed as resources, as well as applications for listing in an application showcase. So it makes sense to potetially allow for your developers to submit APIs for validation and publishing into a designated area.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we shouldn&rsquo;t exist as islands, we should be able to invite in other API resources built on top of our APIs, or that compliment our APIs.  We should also have terms of use and pricing models that invite others to take our API resources and deploy in other ecosystem, building the next wave of <a title="BaaS Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS providers</a> that will be delivering specialized stacks of resources for developers to efficiently build mobile and web apps.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/02/i-want-an-api/">I Want An API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="I Want An API" href="http://iwantanapi.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-i-want-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel we have done a good job explaining what is an API, why people need APIs, and providing services to manage APIs, but we are falling short on delivering information, tools and services for deploying APIs.</p>
<p>First I want to acknowledge that many companies have established IT resources, in the form of technology talent, and internal systems they can put to use when deploying APIs.  This post isn&rsquo;t for you.  This is about individual problem owners looking to deploy APIs, who most likely have little or no access to traditional IT resources for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>You want to deploy an API, because you havplease some data, content or other resources you need to make accessible to partners or the public, allowing for integration into other systems or be used in the development of web or mobile applications or possibly even data analysis and visualizations.</p>
<h2>Machine Readable</h2>
<p>As much as I love APIs, I suggest everyone consider your overall objective behind launching an API.  You may not need an API, you may just need to make your information machine readable and available on the open Internet.  Technically, this isn&rsquo;t an API, but publishing your data or content in a machine readable format like XML or JSON can accomplish many of the same goals of an API, without the overhead of an API.</p>
<p>Many tools you use every day like Microsoft Office, Google Apps, Salesforce provide tools for publishing data and content in machine readable formats like CSV, XML or JSON, much like publishing or printing as a PDF.  Not everyone needs an API, but everyone needs to understand the how-to, and the benefits of making machine readable a default in all business, organization, government and even individual processes.</p>
<p>PDF made data and content portable, for humans. But a PDF does very little good for other machines, websites and mobile apps.  CSV, XML and JSON make data and content portable, while also making them machine readable.  Please consider this simple evolution, while planning your API.</p>
<p>Machine readable will go far to increase efficiencies, interoperability, transparency and innovation within many existing government, organizational and business operations.  By providing data, content and other resources in CSV, XML and JSON they can be easily used across mobile, web and data implementations.  However in other situations there will be a higher need for more advanced interaction with data and content in the form of querying, filtering, transformations as well as the need to secure resources, limiting who has access and to what scale.  This is where we start moving beyond just machine readable, and into a truly needing an API.</p>
<p>When it comes to API deployment I would put users into two distinct groups:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Technical</strong> - You have skills and resources to architect, design, develop and deploy infrastructure, code to meet your API needs</li>
<li><strong>Non-Technical</strong> - You do not have the resources to assemble and execute an API strategy, making a cloud service an optimal route</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are about making critical assets and resources available to technical and non-technical groups. &nbsp;APIs are often about circumventing some of the ways technology bottlenecks can slow us down. &nbsp;It is important that there are not just a wealth of cloud services for non-technical folks to deploy APIs, but also a buffet of openly licensed, downloadable tools that anyone can put to use when deploying an API.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>You have some technical resources and the know how (or willingness to learn), and you want an API.  Ideally there would be open source tools available for you to download and implement:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>CSV to API&nbsp;</li>
<li>Database to API</li>
<li>Developer Portal&nbsp;       
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Docs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Code&nbsp;</li>
<li>Support&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Key Management&nbsp;</li>
<li>App Management</li>
<li>Billing</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools would allow you to assemble your own API strategy in the language and platform of your choice.  There should be educational materials helping you understand how to implement individually or collectively as a single platform.</p>
<h2>Non-Technical</h2>
<p>You do not have the technical resources or time to implement your own API Strategy.  You need a dead simple, software as a service implementation.  You can see examples of this with the latest breed of API service providers, <a href="http://emergentone.com">Emergent One</a>, <a title="API Spark" href="http://apispark.com/">API Spark</a>, and <a href="https://apiengine.io/">API Engine</a>.</p>
<p>We are just seeing this new breed of API service providers rise to meet the demand of not just API management, but now also API deployment.  Making API deployment accessible to anyone, not just developers or companies with necessary resources.  This will make the benefits of APIs accessible to the everyday problem owners, who often are restricted by IT bottlenecks or entire lack of IT resources.</p>
<p>Making data and content from a spreadsheet or existing database, machine readable by default or deployed as an API, allowing for more sophisticated interactions, should be as easy as deploying Wordpress for your blog.  You should be able to go to a service provider and get exactly the hosting, deployment and management options you desire, or you should be able to download and install on your own infrastructure, giving you the control you desire over storage, hosting and access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding a new project area to API Evangelist called&nbsp;<a title="I Want An API" href="http://iwantanapi.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">I Want An API</a>, where I&rsquo;ll be working to help define this space, and bring together other people to assist in developing the resources and tools we will all need to easily launch an API.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> was down for a little while today.  I saw the status report and for some reason actually clicked through to the web page.  I don&rsquo;t actually use Heroku, so it doesn&rsquo;t impact me directly, but I&rsquo;m always curious.</p>
<p>I really like the <a href="https://status.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku status and incident report site</a>.  The site elegantly displays the last 30 days of status for the Heroku platform--complete with real-time notifications via email, SMS, Twitter, RSS and API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/emergent-one-logo-horizontal.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are numerous companies, with existing IT infrastructure, who are looking to deploy APIs in 2013. These companies will be deploying APIs using their existing technology teams, or depending on one of the <a href="/serviceproviders/">17 API management service providers</a> available.</p>
<p>This market is ripe for the <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale's</a> of the world to provide valuable services to, but for many companies, organizations and government agencies who need to deploy APIs this year, API deployment will be about taking an existing database or multiple databases, and open them up to the public, partners, 3rd party developers or possibly just provide access to a remote department or branch of their company in the easiest way possible.</p>
<p>Not all companies will have the resources, or the need to deploy full blown API programs. &nbsp;They just need a dead simple database to API solution that will quickly expose their data over the web in a secure way.  Until recently this solution wasn&rsquo;t available in the cloud, but a new API service provider called <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a> has stepped up to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Emergent One is a cloud service that allows you to connect to your company's MySQL, PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS databases, then generate a REST API from your existing data stores.</p>
<p>Using Emergent One you can define a new API, connect to your database using an agent or direct connection, then define your API resources complete with meta data, sub-resources, in-line resources, fields and computed fields.  Pretty much all you will need to make a clean web API from a database.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/emergent-one-api-resources-from-database.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have your API resources defined, Emergent One provides you with a developer portal around these APIs, and the ability to provide developer registration, then issue keys they can use to access your data--providing the openness you desire, while keeping things secure and within your control.</p>
<p>The developer portal is complete with documentation, explorer console and code libraries for iOS, Android and in Ruby.  Emergent One allows you to bind your own DNS to your endpoints, and also provide paid plans, complete with billing management.</p>
<p>Emergent One is a perfect service for any company looking to develop and manage APIs from your local databases.   The only thing I would say is missing is support tools, to help you interact with your developers after you launch your API. &nbsp;But I'm sure its coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/17/api-management-platform-emergent-one-launches-free-tier/">happy to see the Emergent One platform has a freemium tier</a> giving you up to 5,000 API requests a month, a business tier for up to 2.5M requests a month, as well as an enterprise tier with sales support for all levels of needs. &nbsp;The freemium tier will be critical for businesses to play with, and get to know better.</p>
<p>The Emergent One admin needs a little polishing, it could use a more dashboard like feel for the home page, but overall the Emergent One team nails it!  Providing dead simple, yet robust API deployment from your MySQL, PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS databases, in a way that anyone can put to use.</p>
<p>If your company is looking to deploy and API using a database, and don&rsquo;t have the resources internally to make it happen, I definitely recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>.</p>

<p>I try to keep <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> a place where API newbies and API experts can both find what they are looking for.  To meet this demand I&rsquo;m constantly moving the site around, trying to uncover more information, in a logical way that speaks to everyone.</p>
<p>To change things up a little I moved a couple of the most important trends in APIs out of the <a title="trends" href="/trends/">trends section</a>, and put them on the right hand menu, making them accessible from any page.  There are four trends I think are important to how APIs are being used right now:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> - Merging various APIs together into not just meaningful new stacks of resources, but entirely new resources, as a result of merging</li>
<li><strong>BaaS</strong> - The promise of Backend as a Service is to bundle together resources developers need to build mobile apps more efficiently. &nbsp;Some providers are rolling their own stacks, while others are using a hybrid approach with wise use of 3rd party API resources</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity</strong> - The integration, interoperability, automation and transformation of data between cloud services, in a way that respects the relationshiop between user and platform, that uses APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime</strong> - A realtime flow of data and resources using APIs and web technologies, meeting the demand of the API economy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api-trends.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<p>I feel these areas will represent a shift in how APIs are deployed and consumed to meet the growing demand for the data and resources driving web and mobile applications.  While the API should exist on its own, these areas represent an evolution in how APIs are bundled together into more meaningful stacks, new mashups of resources and providing the integration, interoperability, automation and real-time needs of  businesses in the API economy.</p>
<p>In addition to these four trends, I&rsquo;m looking at several other ways APIs are being used in new and potentially powerful ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Voice</strong> - With the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, voice is the next generation of discovering and interacting with valuable API resources</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis</strong> - The era of "big data" is upon us, like it or not. &nbsp;APIs will provide the fuel for the analysis that occurs around the insane amounts of data coming online, but also being generated by new applications and devices</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization</strong> - One fundamental aspect of the "big data" evolution is being able to visualize and communicate meaning derived from data, and keeping visualizations transparent and interactive using APIs is essential</li>
<li><strong>Syndication</strong> - We saw the power of skyndicattion using APIs with the Facebook Like and the Tweet button. &nbsp;APIs will continue to drive syndication and encourage collaboration on the open Internet in new ways</li>
</ul>
<p>These all represent some very important ways in which APIs are being applied across all business sectors.  All these trending areas are using APIs to deliver value to government, businesses and individuals, and if we are not careful we can focus only on the end value and forget about some of the important benefits of keeping open, accessible APIs that deliver the valuable resources needed. &nbsp;The open pipes will prove to be just as important as the end value in my opinion.</p>
<p>We will need to make sure the backends to the mobile phones and tablets our families are using stay open and transparent, delivering the value while respecting our privacy and security.  There needs to be transparency and open access around all analysis and visualizations used in &ldquo;big data&rdquo; decisions in the coming years.  Infographics and industry reports without open and transparent APIs behind them offer little value in the API economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing which of these trends continue to grow in 2013, and which ones go away, or even morph into entirely new trends.  This is what I love about the API space, the unlimited opportunity for change and evolution.  Which is why I keep the conversation going.</p>

<p>APIs are all the rage, anyone should be able launch an API from CSV, Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheet or the common databases such as MySQL, PostGres, Amazon RDS, Microsoft SQL Server.  Right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching <a href="/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a> evolve for the last three years, helping companies be successful in managing their APIs.  But when you actually going through the list of service providers, looking for someone to help you deploy an API, there are very few options out of the box.</p>
<p>The list of API Players coming from the enterprise:</p>

<p>These enterprise players assume you will have existing infrastructure to publish web services, files and other message systems that they can connect with,  to deploy your new APIs that you will manage.</p>
<p>The most recent generation of API service providers:</p>

<p>Are pretty much the same.  While they may provide how to <a href="/2013/02/03/deploy-and-manage-api-on-amazon-web-services-aws/">guides for deploying APIs on AWS</a>, like 3Scale, the deployment of API endpoint is still your responsiblity.  You need to have existing infrastructure that will do it, or find the REST framework of your choice--both requiring you have the appropriate talent and resources.</p>
<p>Next up you can, deploy one of the open source API solutions, to proxy and manage your APIs:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 30px;" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>But again, you need the resources and know how to implement, and they are generally management tools, so you still need to &ldquo;launch&rdquo; your own API endpoint.</p>
<p>When you start looking at the next generation of API service providers like <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>, you can really maximize the design, planning, documentation and deployment cycle, but you still need to code up your actual API.</p>
<p>After Apiary.io we start to get to the service providers who can deliver on my vision of APIs for the masses:</p>

<p>It seems like we are getting closer, albeit its not as easy as I think it should be. We need a variety of service providers and open source solutions in this space, so there are numerous, dead simple cloud options for API deployment.</p>
<p>Emergent One definitely was a pleasant surprise in my quest.  Their tool needs a little polish, but for deploying an API from a database like MySQL, Postgres or Amazon RDS, those guys nailed it.  It is the tool that I will be recommending when people ask me how to launch an API from their database. (story to come)</p>
<p>I'd like to see the Emergent One approach to a dead simple cloud service for going from Microsoft Excel, CSV and Google Spreadsheet.  Maybe there is, and I&rsquo;m missing it.  Something like CKAN as a Service.  I think there is some more research to be done on this.  Of the 3 data API providers I used to showcase:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 30px;" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center"><a href="http://kasabi.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Kasabi-Logo.png" alt="" width="130" align="right" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/socrata_logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><a href="http://www.infochimps.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" /></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Only <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> is still deliving in this space, bringing open data to municipal, state, and federal government.  Kasabi closed down and InfoChimps is focusing on the enterprise big data.   I don&rsquo;t think there is big VC money in the data API space, but it seems like there is still opportunity.</p>
<p>It seems backwards to me, but it seems from 2005-2010 we needed to define and prove there was API opportunity, and in 2011 and 2012 we defined the API management space, so in 2013 are we needing to better define the API deployment portion of our industry?</p>
<p>I will use Emergent One, APISpark, API Engine and Apify more, and do individual stories on them.  Then circle back around and see how I feel.</p>
