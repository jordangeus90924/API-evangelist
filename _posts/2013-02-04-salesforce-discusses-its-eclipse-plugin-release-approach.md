{% include JB/setup %}<p>Salesforce talked a little bit about its strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in. Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their Eclipse plug-in, until API release is complete.I’m more interested in this story from an API building block perspective.An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.</p>
