<p>I am refining my comprehensive list of stops that I highlight as part of the API lifecycle, or what I call <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/17/testing-out-the-concept-of-api-transit-instead-of-api-lifecycle/">API Transit</a>–the stops that each of the services we deliver will have “pass through” at some point. I’m sharing this list with other team members as part of existing consulting arrangements I’m engaged in with Streamdata.io, as well as baking into my API transit work for some workshops I’m doing in April. All of these are available on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">the API lifecycle section of API Evangelist</a>, but I will be pushing them to become a first class citizen on the home page of API Evangelist once again.</p>

<p>Here are 68 potential stops I’d consider for any microservice to be exposed to, as part of a larger API transit strategy map:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>I struggle calling this a lifecycle, as most of these do not occur in any sort of linear fashion. This is why I’m resorting to using the API Transit approach, as it is something that reflects the ever-changing, but also hopefully eventually more consistent nature of delivering microservices. Ideally, every microservice passes through each of these stops in a consistent fashion, making sure that they operate in concert with a larger API platform strategy. However, I know what the reality on the ground is, and know that not all of these relevant to each organization I am talking with, requiring me to trim down and change the order in which I present these.</p>

<p>If you’d like to talk about how these stops apply to your API operations, feel free to reach out. I’m doing more API lifecycle and governance strategy consulting with my partners Streamdata.io, and I’m happy to help your company, organization, institution, or government agency develop your own API transit map, which can be used across your API operations.</p>
