I spend a lot of time looking for a quick description or logo for companies. Â Finding a good quality logo is a pain in the ass!

To be the change I want to see in the world, I created an [about.json file for API Evangelist][1].

Now you can programmatically pull information about API Evangelist, and I will keep updated as things change.

   [1]: /about.json (about.json)
