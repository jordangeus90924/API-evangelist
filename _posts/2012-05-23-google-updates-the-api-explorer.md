Google just released an update to their [API Explorer][1].

Some of the new features include:

  * Indexed history of API calls
  * API request body editor
  * Search box for search APIs and methods
  * Indicator showing which methods require authentication

The [Google API Explorer][1] now supports two dozen Google APIs, up from only six when they first launched.

Googleâ€™s continued investment in their API explorer, which makes APIs not just easier to use, but more accessible to non-developers, really shows that an API explorer has become an [essential API building block][2].
