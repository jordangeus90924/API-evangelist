{% include JB/setup %}<p>Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API that brings together geographic data from multiple sources, connects it with a standardized schema, and delivers it to developers through a single API.When pulling geo data from APIs, developer may not always get the most complete data, but they just deal with it, because we dont always have the time to pull data from multiple APIs.InfoChimps does this for developers, making it possible to have the best data from many sources.Once InfoChimps downloads the data from multiple sources, they tie the data together, making relationships and connections between disparate data, using the Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS).So no matter what the original data source is, there is a consistent, complete and expressive description of a collection of related data its associated assets.</p>
