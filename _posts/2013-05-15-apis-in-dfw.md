I just got back from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I visited Dallas last night to help kick off the first gathering of the DFW API Professionals Meetup.

We got together at Microsoft around 6PM and I talked from 6:30 until 8:00, evolving on my [From Web, to ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld][2] talk.

The meetup was about 45 people ranging from developers to investors. I showed up with a lot of content, but I wanted to make sure and cover the full API spectrum, while also introducing some new content about specifically about API consumption.

During the event I had some time to get to know the [theRightAPI][4], [Proxomo][5], [Layer 7 Technologies][6] and [Pariveda Solutions][7] folks--while connecting with the rest of the meet up group members.
