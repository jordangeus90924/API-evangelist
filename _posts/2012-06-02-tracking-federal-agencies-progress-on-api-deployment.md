{% include JB/setup %}<p>Iâ€™m excited about Barack Obama directing all federal agencies to have an API.The President has given federal agencies 90 days to create a page on its website, located at www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy, to publicly report progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format, and implement the requirements of the Strategy within 12 months.As I said in my post, I wanted to setup a page to monitor this activity.</p>
