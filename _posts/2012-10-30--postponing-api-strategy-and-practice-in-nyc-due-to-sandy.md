{% include JB/setup %}<p>Dear API Strategy Attendee,As you know weve been tracking the weather events affecting New York.Up until now weve been hoping to run the event much as planned and working around the logistics issues that have come up.We were hoping for better news this morning but the situation in New York is still very serious with extensive storm damage, mass-transit and airports with uncertain reopening times and in some areas there are still emergency rescue situations on-going.There has already been significant travel disruption and it looks set to get worse (none of the event team has yet been been able to get to New York and a number of speakers are already unable to fly).As a result weve had to take the tough decision to postpone the event and not run it this week.</p>
