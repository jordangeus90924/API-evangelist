{% include JB/setup %}<p>Listening to an episode of Traffic and Weather yesterday, renewed a concept that John Sheehan(@johnsheehan), founder of Runscope made in an article he wrote for NextWeb back in March.In the post, John walks us through his “Three Commandments for Using Someone Else’s API”, which, after listening to him talk about his story on Episode 8 of Traffic and Weather, I couldnt stop thinking about commandment 2: Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person An open API is a great way to test drive an integration, but it does not absolve you from the responsibility of building a relationship with the provider.If you can’t reach someone, that should be all the reason you need not to use that API.This commandment comes out of Johns unique experience which spans: Twilio - Experience managing large, successful developer ecosystem IFTTT - Experience being consumer of not just one, but many APIs Runscope - Providing tools that make API developers lives easier This experiences is what make John’s perspective unique.He doesn’t just understand delivering APIs and managing developers, he knows what it is like to be a developer and consumer of APIs.</p>
