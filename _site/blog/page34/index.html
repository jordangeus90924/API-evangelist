			<p><em>01 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     Hackathons are growing into a popular way to spark innovation around hardware, data and APIs within developer and hacker communities. I count over 40 hackathons going on in December alone, and this is just what I can discover and keep up with in my research.


     Hackathons are also being used by many companies to drive innovation internally between departments. Businesses like LinkedIn and Zappos employ Hackathons and Hack Days internally to get recreate this same hackathon phenomenon within their own companies, in a much more controlled, safe environment.


     Now Zappos is going even further and opening up their Internal Hackathon to the public. December 12th through the 16th of 2011 they are holding the Zappos API Hackathon Hack-a-long, which in the past, has been an event open only to Zappos employees, but this year, they want the public to hack alongside of Zappos employees.


     On Monday, Dec 12th, Zappos will post a theme on their blog, and developers will have one week to hack up a project that fits in with the theme. Zappos will be awarding three $100 gift cards for Zappos.com to the winners in three categories: Best Mashup, Best Overall, and Most Fun and Weird.


     Public developer apps will be presented along side internal Zappos employee projects, during their Hackathon Open House. The goal of the event is to help inspire Zappos developers and expose them to the passion and creative juices of the public Zappos developer community.


     I’m spending a lot of time tracking on the evolving Hackathon phenonemon and how these events are spurring innovating both internally within companies and externally in public developer communities in cities around the globe. I’ll keep tracking on the innovation and talent coming out of hackathons and I am excited to see more companies adopt them internally and even inviting the public to come participate in the hacking!

     There was a post a couple weeks back in the New York Times Bits Blog called, "TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I."


     Its a pretty straightforward post about the San Francisco based start-up, that gets you in touch with friendly, reliable people who can help you get just about anything you need done. At first glance, it is a pretty standard post. However I feel there are two things very notable about this post and more specifically, it’s title:


     TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I.


     One, the launching of an API is tied directly to the startups expansion into other cities. Those of us in the know, understand the important role an API plays in scaling your company, but explaining this to mainstream audiences is so important.


     Two, that the acronym "API" gets used in a title of a mainstream publication like the New York Times.  Of course they spell it out in the article, but the editor expects that the user will understand the acronym in the title.


     There are many API stories in 2011, but I think this really shows APIs are coming of age, when it is acceptable for a wider, mainstream audience to accept the term into their vocabulary.


     One of the things I like about APIs is they are a silent, but powerful force behind many industry sectors including e-commerce, social, cloud computing and mobile computing. I think this use of API in the NYT represent classic API style, a silent coming of age, showing APIs are being adopted by a mainstream audience.

			<p>There was a post in the Atlantic about Twitter’s advertising network called, No One's Noticing Twitter's New Ad Experiment, Which Is a Good Thing. Twitter is dropping what they call “promoted tweets” into users timelines. Adam Clark Estes of the Atlantic states: Despite months of hemming and hawing over the danger of polluting the sacred Twitter feed, the few people that have taken notice seem reasonably pleased by the hands-off approach. A user, also cited in the article, Ellis Hamburger at Business Insider thinks the approach is awesome: I realized that Promoted Tweets really aren't that much different from TV commercials—brief interruptions from your content. Except they're not very annoying. … Twitter's commercials are different and have a leg up because they will be intermixed with incredibly time-sensitive content. They're also brief, which helps. And a lot of of the time, Promoted Tweets are from celebrities who tweet their thoughts in their own voice. I’m following Twitter’s rollout of their advertising network because its a big deal to finally see the popular micro-blogging platform finally move towards monetizing the network--even if some don’t like it. But I think the work Twitter is doing has even bigger implications, on the future of online advertising, even beyond social media. The Internets seem to be stuck in a rut, when it comes to monetization of our online real estate. There isn’t much innovation beyond the classic online and slightly newer mobile advertising platforms dominated by Google and a handful of others. What is next? APIs of course. As APIs also struggle to develop their monetization strategies, they tend to default to charging for their services, with some API providers like CityGrid are providing mobile and web advertising solutions alongside their APIs. I feel what Twitter is doing is one possible model for other API owners to follow in monetizing their API platforms. Provide relevant, seamless advertising embedded into each API stream.

			<p><em>28 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>"Are API service providers relevant? Will they remain relevant?" Thats the question asked by Ben Kepes at this years Defrag Conference, while moderating a panel with Apigee's Sam Ramji and Mashery's Neil Mansilla. It was a bold question to ask, perhaps, in front of an audience comprised of people from 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Alcatel Lucent -- all API service providers. And Sam's response was to dismiss Ben's question was &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;, steering the conversation elsewhere. Sam seemed to interpret Ben&rsquo;s question as an affront -- not just to Apigee but arguably to all the API providers in the room. But in light of Sam's own arguments about the importance of thinking about apps as intermediaries, I thought Ben's question was particularly interesting. After all, many of these API services providers do just that -- act as intermediaries. On the surface Ben&rsquo;s question may have seemed to be picking a fight with Sam, but I think he meant it, and was seriously asking it of the industry, and I feel it is an important question. I personally think API service providers have a role to play, and can stay relevant if...if they do not impose themselves as intermediaries, but I would love to hear what others think. I believe doing business in the API space, centers around providing clear value to your customers, without getting in their way. In the words of Jeff Lawson of Twilio, "Get out of the way of the Doers!". This philosophy applies to API service providers as well. To stay relevant, the API service providers have to practice what they preach to their customers; be service oriented, decouple and allow their customers to be doers via a self-service, clearly priced, secure platform while providing added value in the form of premium services. Without this practice, API services providers just reflect the old way of building and selling software, not the new API driven world.

			<p><em>09 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE There is a lot of discussion around the growth of APIs, and what the future will look like. How will we discover and make sense of the number of available APIs, and quickly get to work integrating with the APIs that bring the most value to our apps and businesses. One technology that comes up in every conversation I’ve had is Swagger. What is Swagger? Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. The goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server. The documentation of methods, parameters and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to always stay in sync. Swagger was born out of initiatives from Wordnik, developed for Wordnik’s own use during the development of developer.wordnik.com. Swagger development began in early 2010 and the framework being released is used by Wordnik’s APIs, which power both internal and external API clients. Swagger provides a declarative resource specification, allowing users to understand and consume services without knowledge of server implementation, enabling both developers and non-developers to interact with the API, providing clear insight into how the API responds to parameters and options. I’m familiarizing myself with the specification more and playing with the various tools they provide: Swagger UI - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API Swagger Core - Defines Java annotations and required logic to generate a Swagger server or client. Swagger CodeGen - Contains a template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing your Swagger Resource Declaration. Swagger node.js - A Sample App is a fully-functioning, stand-alone Swagger server written in javascript which uses node.js and the express framework.

			<h3><a href="/2011/11/08/google-launches-oauth-2-0-playground/">"Google Launches OAuth 2.0 Playground"</a></h3>
			<p><em>08 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     Last March Google started support OAuth 2.0 for all of their APIs, and has been pushing all developers to switch to using OAuth 2.0 in all applications.


     Today they announced the OAuth 2.0 Playground which allows developers to experiment with APIs using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and understand how the protocol functions and will make your life easier.


     The OAuth 2.0 Playground enables developers to walk through each step of the OAuth 2.0 flow for server-side web applications:


     Authorizing API scopes
     
     Exchanging authorization tokens
     
     Refreshing access tokens
     
     Sending authorized requests to API endpoints
     


     At each step, the Playground displays the full HTTP requests and responses for each API.


     Google’s endorsement of OAuth 2.0 was very important for the standard and the API industry as a whole. APIs need a secure and standard way for users to authenticate and allow access to their resources when using web and mobile apps.  With Twitter, Google, Facebook and other heavyhitters on board, OAuth is here to stay.


     OAuth has traditionally been difficult for some developers to implement, which has gotten easier with 2.0. But we all have to work to help developers understand its value and how to implement--tools like Google OAuth 2.0 Playground will go a long way in helping developers understand the standard, ensuring that users app experience is pleasant and secure, and APIs are seen as a secure and efficient way to builld applications around.

			<p><em>07 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>
Pioneer Corporation just announced the availability of Zypr&trade;, a new voice-powered API that  provides a conversational, voice-control command API allowing developers to integrate Siri like functionality into their own applications.
The Zypr API provides a single RESTful API for developers to access voice UI, maps and routing, local search, social networking, music and radio, contacts, calendars and weather from multiple service providers, including:  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yelp, AccuWeather, INRIX real-time and predictive traffic information, Slacker Radio, Tuner2 Radio, Wcities, xAd and VoiceBox.
I&rsquo;ve covered unified and aggregate APIs in the past, where within maturing industries like social and cloud computing, service providers are stepping up with a single API to work with multiple providers.  Zypr is similar in that it offers a single API for multiple providers, but uses voice as the mechanism for search.   Zypyr&rsquo;s goal is to normalize, stable and voice-enhanced method for accessing a wide array of constantly changing APIs, Zypr can reduces the impact of service-specific API changes.

&ldquo;Pioneer created Zypr so that any type of developer or device maker on any platform can easily offer compelling new services to enhance their own technology and brand equity,&rdquo; said Susumu Kotani, the president of Pioneer Corporation. &ldquo;We have also changed the rules by allowing developers and device makers alike the opportunity to share in revenue when they deploy Zypr.&rdquo;
In addition to providing revenue sharing opportunities, the Zypr API is available at no chrage to developers.  You can access documentation, code, sample application and other developer tools at www.zypr.net.
With a simple, but powerful RESTful API and the buzz around Siri, Apples new voice tasking system , the Zypr API is sure to be a hit.  If Pioneer Corporation can successfully evangelize the Zypr API and get it into the hands of hackers and developer globally, it could easy become the Twilio of voice tasking.

			<h3><a href="/2011/11/07/new-enterprise-api-management-solution-called-atmos-phe-re/">New Enterprise API Management Solution Called Atmos.phe.re</a></h3>
			<p><em>07 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>
I first reported on service oriented architecture (SOA) pioneer SOA Software&rsquo;s entry into the API management arena back in June, today at the Cloud Computing Expo in Santa Clara, CA they are announcing the beta release of their enterprise API management solution called Atmos.phe.re.
SOA has taken their enterprise API management solution, and bundled it with many of the features we are growing accustomed to within open API ecosystems, and deployed as a new solution with a focus on community.
The new platform intends to bring together API owners and application developers into a community, providing a central place where an ecosystem can grow around each of your APIs, whether its a private or public initiative.
Atmosphere is taking the social aspects of popular, open API ecosystems, and are applying these concepts to the enterprise, providing not only a place where API owners and developers can come together, but it also invites business, marketing and creative folks to get involved--creating a truly collaborative, enterprise environment around any API initiative.
&ldquo;Enterprises now have a choice in how they provide APIs. They can use Atmosphere Cloud to manage their developer community, and process messages on-premise.&rdquo; said Alistair Farquharson, Chief Technology Officer, SOA Software. &ldquo;This provides companies with complete control over their API traffic without requiring a large internal infrastructure to support their developer community.&rdquo;
This evolution of the API ecosystem makes sense, by providing the same set of social features available within both public and private communities as well as on-premise or cloud deployments it provides a very agile, business development environment for enterprises to take advantage of.
I haven&rsquo;t had a full test drive of SOA&rsquo;s new platform, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen it posseses all the characteristics I&rsquo;ve seen with other API management providers, but also brings to the table important social and community layers that I think are essential to the future of APIs.
Disclosure: &nbsp;I have consulted for SOA Software.

			<p><em>07 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>I came across this on the White House blog today, &ldquo;Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications&rdquo;. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010, signed by President Obama earlier this year, calls upon OSTP to coordinate with agencies to develop policies that assure widespread public access to and long-term stewardship of the results of federally funded unclassified research. Towards that goal, OSTP last week released two Requests for Information (RFI) soliciting public input on long term preservation of and public access to the results of federally funded research, including digital data and peer-reviewed scholarly publications. The White House is now seeking additional insight from "non-Federal stakeholders, including the public, universities, nonprofit and for-profit publishers, libraries, federally funded and non-federally funded research scientists, and other organizations and institutions with an interest in long- term stewardship and improved public access to the results of federally funded research". Specifically the Working Group seeks further public comment on the questions listed below: What specific Federal policies would encourage public access to and the preservation of broadly valuable digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research, to grow the U.S. economy and improve the productivity of the American scientific enterprise? What specific steps can be taken to protect the intellectual property interests of publishers, scientists, Federal agencies, and other stakeholders, with respect to any existing or proposed policies for encouraging public access to and preservation of digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research? How could Federal agencies take into account inherent differences between scientific disciplines and different types of digital data when developing policies on the management of data? How could agency policies consider differences in the relative costs and benefits of long-term stewardship and dissemination of different types of data resulting from federally funded research? How can stakeholders (e.g., research communities, universities, research institutions, libraries, scientific publishers) best contribute to the implementation of data management plans?

			<p><em>03 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>
I wrote a piece yesterday on the FCC Open Commission recent proposal to require that television stations make their &ldquo;public inspection file&rdquo; available online called, &ldquo;Opening Up Information is Not Enough, Its Needs to be Accessible&rdquo;.
Since writing I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how APIs can become a self-service tool in government regulation.  Here are my rough thoughts on the subject, completely un-polished.
When a government agency mandates that an industry provide some information, along with that request should come with a mandate on a standard for the data format and making it accessible via an API. &nbsp;Of course this could come with some sort of security layer, so not everything is immediately open, but the more open the better.
Along with the regulatory mandate the requesting agency could have some sort of aggregate tool for pull the requested data from each entities API, making available internally and externally as needed for other agencies, researchers or the general public.
This type of self-service, API driven, regulatory framework could force businesses and organizations within an industry to comply with necessary information requirements, reduce the overhead for the governing body to collect and organize the data, while also opening up the data, to allow the public and other industry groups to police and make sure companies are complying.
Seems like it could make the overall process around industry regulation more efficient, while putting the responsibility for policing on the public and other public interest groups, reducing the need for government enforcement that can often be bought.

     According to PCMag.com, Verizon will publish an API that could allow consumers to "turbocharge" the network bandwidth on their smartphone, for a small fee.


     Developers could give users the option to pay for the extra bandwidth using a separate micro-transaction API, that Verizon Wireless is developing and hopes to have in place by the end of 2012.


     I understand that wireless networks are often congested. But isn’t allowing someone to pay money and circumvent that congestion, creating two separate Internets? A faster one for those that can afford it and a slower one for those that cannot?


     Would certain companies be able to offer users “turbocharge credits” when using their apps? So the Internet was faster, only when using the apps that could afford to buy its users attention.


     I am pleased to see Verizon Wireless working on network optimization tools, but is this where we need to monetize the network? Seems like you could make the Internet fast for everyone and charge for other premium services.  You know, really innovate.

			<p><em>02 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     Tru.ly just launched an age verification API that authenticates the age of an online user based by cross-referencing user-submitted personal information with data points from Tru.ly verification partners.


     Verification is done by matching user-submitted information with that in a national database of government and public data. In order to become verified, specific pieces of information must match. Tru.ly also uses a proprietary technology to flag users who may be trying to game the system.


     Using Tru.ly, websites with restricted content such as movies, alcohol and video games can programmatically verify its user’s ages, going beyond using just asking for a birth date.


     The API was developed to confirm an age while also promoting the guidelines set forth in the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), specifically section 1302-9, which defines verifiable parental consent as any reasonable effort, so as to ensure that the parent is aware of the website’s personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices.


     Your can read more on Tru.ly’s age verification API at their site.

			<p>The FCC Open Commission recently proposed to require that television stations make their “public inspection file” available online. The public inspection file is a traditional hallmark of broadcast regulation--a collection of documents that all radio and television stations must maintain and make publicly accessible. But as the Technology Liberation Front points out, “availability is not accessibility”, stating: "If the FCC follows its usual practice of having filers submit PDFs (many of which are often scanned from printed documents), this data may be nearly useless to the small number of researchers who would really benefit from having a large set of public inspection files available online." This is a common misconception among government agencies, that just publishing a PDF to a web is making the information “accessible”. Sure anyone can download this information, but it makes extracting meaning and value across many television stations so much work, pretty much nobody will do it. Researchers need this type of true access to compare data across stations, and identify larger trends and patterns that exist. This approach to information disclosure is does not meet the transparency guidelines set by the Obama Administration to implement Open Government by requiring agencies to: "publish information online in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information." Transparency offers an alternative to regulation that goes all the way back to President Clinton’s Executive Order 12866 (1993) which states "Each agency shall identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including … providing information upon which choices can be made by the public." Federal agencies requiring business to collect and make information to the public, without also requiring that they submit it in a machine-readable format, creates more bureaucratic, useless government. There needs to be more education of officials...[<a href="/2011/11/02/opening-up-information-is-not-enough-its-needs-to-be-accessible/">Read More</a>]</p>

     I’m spending some time getting to know the Topsy Labs API today. Topsy Labs offers access to its proprietary metrics, social content, and influence data via a RESTful API. As I was reviewing, their API access and rates limit page caught my eye.


     Here is their intro paragraph:


     We provide limited, free API access so that you can quickly and easily test the service and confirm the value it will provide to your business. We have three different tiers to match your implementation.


     What is interesting, is they not only provide a freemium level they have one better, a free and open tier, provider two introductory API access levels:


     
          No API Key - 3,000 queries/day – API calls that do not carry an API key will be limited to 3,000 queries/day.
     
     
          Free API Key - 7,000 queries/day – API calls that carry an API key will increase their limit to 7,000 queries/day.
     


     Then they provide a quick link: Register to get started


     What an inviting, frictionless way to getting started with an API. For those wanting more, they also provide information about obtaining a commercial API key:


     Once you confirm the value of our API, you can get a commercial license, giving you more volume to accommodate your business needs, exposes other valuable API calls, provides you with technical support, and ensures you are guaranteed specific service level parameters.


     The Topsy Labs approach provides an interesting model for some API owners to provide limited and free API access to their APIs, enabling developers to quickly and easily test the service and confirm the value before integrating.

			<p>I try to pay attention to how APIs are transforming as many industries as I can. I usually carve out at least an hour each day, to evalute a specific industry, the APIs in it, trying to understand what each API delivers and how the industry works, while also identifying where the opportunities lie. Right now I am looking at two areas or industries of APIs: Cloud Storage APIs Image and Photo APIs Even though I want to be familiar with both these areas, and will write stories on everything I find, my primary goal is to provide the Mimeo development team with as much information, about the best document and photo storage APIs available for integrating into our systems. There are 46 storage APIs and 120 photo APIs in the ProgrammableWeb directory. I went through all of the APIs and pulled out the APIs that were RESTful, had potential for print integration and were popular or were a stable, quality service. I found 19 storage APIs and 12 photo APIs I felt were a fit. After looking at 166 APIs and pulling out 31 APIs that offered value, you walk away with a pretty good sense of what makes a good API deployment. Anyone who is launching an API should spend time looking at at least 50 other APIs before building their own. API areas should simple, straight the point and employ the essential API building blocks. I’d say the biggest problem with each API is: What the hell does this API do? Every API should put a really simple explanation of what it does in 150 words or less. Pretend you just have one tweet to use. What value does your API deliver? Make it count! There are so many other things I consider when evaluating an API, these are a few of my immediate concerns while trying to quickly assess a lot of APIs.

     Twilio just made their first move into Europe by offering Twilio Voice service in the United Kingdom.


     The Twilio Voice API is now available in the UK, allowing developers to launch local phone numbers in the country.  Along with the release Twilio has announced the opening of their first international office based in East London.


     The UK launch is the first to go live of five countries currently in Beta including France, Poland, Austria, Denmark and Portugal with several more countries on the way.


     Twilio's APIs have proven a favorite of developers, and fast becoming an essential cloud computing service for applications.


     The move into Europe will only grow their developer base and the number of applications using the cloud telephony API. Something that traditional telcos should take notice of.

			<p><em>26 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>Last week Mashery rolled out a new on-premise version of their API management proxy. &nbsp;A solution meant to address a common concern of IT and API owners, that when using Mashery, all of their data and resources run through the Mashery proxy in the cloud. &nbsp;This concern can be a show stopper for many companies.
Until this last week, Mashery had four API management solutions that all ran in the cloud.

Now Mashery has separated the proxy portion of their traffic manager into two offerings, one for the cloud and one for on-premise.

Mashery has bundled the new Mashery Cloud and Mashery Local with their existing API Traffic, API Analytics &amp; Reporting and API Portal and are calling it, the Mashery API control center.  Using the API control center you now have the flexibility to deploy on-premise or in the cloud as needed.

Of course the full benefits of the Mashery API Distribution Network which includes scalability, redundancy, PCI compliance, access to global partner network and SLA&rsquo;s are only available for APIs deployed using Mashery Cloud.
Even though the&nbsp;Mashery API Control Center is meant to provide flexibility of deployment for API owners, the move is clearly a direct shot at their primary competitor Apigee, who have had an on-premise solution for some time, but Mashery claims their control center provides much more flexibility than "their competitors".

			<p>I have done a lot of research lately on the API service provider landscape. My goal is to understand who provides API delivery and management services, what they offer and help API owners understand the differences. I wrote a roundup of 11 of the API service providers on ProgrammableWeb last week. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of all the providers, but of course a new one came out of the woodwork. It wasn't a new API service provider like Mashape or Apiary.io, it is a veteran player in the space, Vordel. Vordel has been around for almost 10 years and I would consider them part of the old guard of service oriented architecture (SOA) and web services providers, that existed before web APIs were cool. Vordel provides a range of products we recognize with enterprise API deployments including API Gateways, XML firewalls and accelerators. Vordel specializes in the legacy system connectors that are needed to bring existing enterprise systems into the new web API game. The Vordel API Gateway compares to what I've seen from Layer7 and SOA Software, with the following key features: Protocol translation for REST and SOAP Versioning and lifecycle management Caching of frequently used calls Monitor, log and audit usage Secure API from threats Service level agreements (SLA) Vordel has an impressive client list including the FBI, Coast Guard and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, and delivers some progressive integrations, like a deployment of their API gateway for Blackhawk Network, which extends REST services to their business partners like iTunes and Facebook. I see all the hardened enterprise services I've seen with existing providers, I think why they may have missed my radar is they lack the open API building blocks like developer portals, app showcases, forums and the self-service partner systems I tend to track on.

			<p>One of the ways I develop content for this site is by talking through my day to day experiences as an API Evangelist. I feel that talking through what I’m learning in real-time, is the best way to make it stick, while also sharing with the public. There is a lot of value that comes out of my daily learning, and it would be wrong to not share this. I had someone approach me on LinkedIn today and ask: I'm trying to convince my colleagues and managers on the importance of having internal API, not just as a prologue to public API, but also as a way to have cleaner, better-understood interfaces internally for our developers. Do you have any thoughts or tips on the subject? Internal evangelism is a big part of my role, and I know its something that other API advocates face as they are trying to sell the concept of APIs to decision makers within their company. Testing the water with APIs internally is the best way to get started, and learn what goes into planning, deploying and managing an API. When trying to sell your bosses on APIs for internal use, I would start with: Decoupling - Deploying resources and your data within your company as individual RESTful resources decouple them, allowing them to consumed and managed independently. This kind of of decoupling of data and resources enable more agile scaling, migration and integration into a wide range of organizations and applications across your company. Consider how APIs have enabled Netflix to migrate from the data-center to the cloud, with unprecedented growth simultaneously, and also enabling them to grow globally. Product Management - Allocating your companies data and resources as independent RESTful APIs will simplify your product management allowing them to be defined, launched, deployed and even killed off independently of each other.

			<p>Data.gov for me is like being a kid in a candy store. My experience with data goes back to High School when I got my first programming job right out of Mr. Smiths computer class. I built Cobol database for use by school districts in the State of Oregon, jump-starting my career as a programmer. Ever since I&rsquo;ve had an obsession with data, and specifically with government data, and trying to make sense of how our government operates. I have been playing with various data-sets at Data.gov since they launched, but today I finally spent some time evaluating their approach to delivering the Data.gov ecosystem. It is a pretty robust approach to opening up our government, agency by agency. The Data.gov sites centers around data-sets available by agency, category and topics, with the ability to view as raw data, files &amp; documents, charts, maps, calendars, filtered views and interactive data-sets. Data is made available in a wide range of formats including .csv, .xls, .xml, .rdf, .kml and .shp files when each format applies. Data.gov is not just for developers, many of the data-sets are available in interactive formats, as well as a wide variety of applications, making the data accessible and usable by anyone. A couple examples of applications include product recalls, travel warnings and hospital compare. What really makes these apps valuable, is the data-sets are usually available alongside, so if you want to dive in deeper and use the data in other ways, you can. Since Data.gov is a the top level site for the open data initiative, there is an obvious need to break it down into some smaller communities. These communities include: Energy - Data, tools, apps, challenges, resources, blog, forums centered around energy data, meant to facilitate public discussion of and awareness on our Nation&rsquo;s energy activity. Health - Data, apps, blog and forum centered around health and health care, intended to help the public make better informed decisions about...[<a href="/2011/10/25/a-walk-through-data-gov-with-some-thoughts-on-whats-next/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>As the number of APIs grow, the number of ways in which API owners control and incentivize their developers ecosystems evolves. APIs are your business development 2.0 platform, and it is up to you to tailor your services to incentivize your developers as well as control API usage to meet your business goals. One emerging way to control API consumption to meet your business goals is through a balance between pricing and terms of service (TOS). By offering branding opportunities to developers that they can deploy alongside the content and resources they consume via your API, you can easily turn your developer community into an extension of your marketing department. Price breaks can be offered to developers who extend your brand, encouraging them to build a business around your API content and resources as long as it adds value to your brand. API consumers who opt not to take part in branding, can be charged more, adding value to your company purely as revenue opportunity. Branding and pricing controls are a growing way to ensure your API adds value to your company either as revenue or brand syndication, but another way some content and data API providers are finding success, is through a contribution incentive. Just like brand extension, API contribution gives developers an opportunity to participate deeper and receive price breaks, while also be encouraged to contribute content back to an API, enriching content and add valuable information back to your companies API. Writeable APIs can be made available allowing developers to contribute user reviews, comments, annotations or even correct and update content that originated from your company. Proper service and key management around your API, allows you to track which users contribute content back to your system. As a result of this participation you can offer further price breaks in the form of credits, or even end up paying customers for their content contributions.

			<p>I just finished a four week roadshow that included three Startup Weekend EDU events -- one in Seattle, one in San Francisco and one in Washington DC -- as well as two versions of the Business of APIs conferences -- one in San Francisco and one in New York City. It might not seem at first glance that these events had much in common. During the Startup Weekends, business people, teachers and developers rallied to build startups that focused on solving problems in education, while the Business of APIs conferences showcased businesses telling their stories about how opening up data and APIs have transformed them and made them more competitive within their respective industries. Both events re-enforced for me the importance of both on-the-ground and online evangelism. Both are necessary for ensuring the success of open data and APIs. At both series of events, I encountered many people who had never heard of Twilio or Amazon Web Services -- two API providers that are leaders in their industries (as well as were sponsors at the events). Both Twilio and Amazon Web Services provide essential cloud resources that can be used by any company and developer, but without the proper awareness and education, these resources go unused. Both companies are active in sponsoring start-up weekends, hackathons, codeathons, meetups and the like, but Twilio does much better at having "boots on the ground" at these events. This presence is one of the things that has made Twilio a developer favorite and, in turn, spawned thousands of apps and many start-ups. But clearly they still have work to do to get their name "out there," particularly at events outside of Silicon Valley. But having someone on-the-ground isn't always enough.

			<p>Last spring when I started writing for ProgrammableWeb, my first post was "Everything Should Be an API," Says FCC. The story was about the new FCC web site, that was built entirely on top of RESTful APIs using the Drupal platform. Since that post, I met the company behind the FCC website redesign, Seabourne Inc., which builds some pretty innovative solutions using Drupal, employing APIs in everything they do. As part of the FCC.gov website project, Seabourne Inc. built a module for Drupal that leverages the platform for content publishing, powered by APIs. I spoke with Mike Reich, the CEO of Seabourne Inc. about APIs, he is as passionate about APIs as I am, but has identified the best place to start when it comes to opening up the government, is with content APIs instead of just focusing on data APIs. He’s right. In the rush to open up government data, many of us overlook the huge archives and content generated on a daily basis by our government. Recently, many government agencies are adopting Drupal as a content management platform, and using Seaborne’s Content API for Drupal, any agency or organization can make content openly accessible via an API. Their Content APIs can instantly make content from an agencies website available for other agencies to access in a self-service way, reducing the resources needed for inter-departmental coordination. In addition to making external coordination more efficient, it can make rolling out separate web sites, applications and mobile apps much more cost efficient as well. Content APIs can also open content to the public allowing media, companies and even individuals to pull content and mash it up, evolve, derive meaning and stories from it that a government agency may not have time or even perspective to do. In my opinion this type of content access by the public truly reflects the next generation of democracy, allowing anyone to get involved in government, even demonstrating better ways to understand...[<a href="/2011/10/22/open-access-to-your-drupal-site-with-a-content-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>At a recent presentation at the Business of API conference in San Francisco, Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson argued that two of the ways APIs can be successful in courting new developers are by being self-service and by having a "freemium" option. Both of these features empower developers to start using an API right away, without entering a credit card, talking to customer service, sales or having to wait for budget approval. They can just sign-up, get a key and start hacking! This shouldn't just be a model for APIs targeting the public developers; it can work with the enterprise as well. This model would allow enterprise developers to get up and running using an API quickly, building their own working prototypes, and in turn, using this prototype to make a case for why a company should use an API -- all without talking to their boss or getting approval. Of course, an API can still have a traditional sales funnel, where developers can get support, pay for premium services, and engage to get appropriate SLAs. But by providing both a self-service and a freemium option, there is the potential to reach new customers -- customers that may not respond to a traditional enterprise software sales cycle. I strongly believe that both self-service and freemium have a place with all APIs. These help expose what is needed for developers to see the value an API delivers so they can prove this value to their company; then later, they can engage sales and business departments to strengthen and harden the relationship. This approach is gaining acceptance and can be seen across many of the successful APIs in the space, like Twilio Self-Service and freemium pricing are things that all the major API service providers (3Scale, Mashery and Apigee) endorse when they advise their customers during setup of their own APIs. APIs open entirely new channels, attract new customers, and encourage the development of new ways of doing...[<a href="/2011/10/20/selfservice-and-freemium-are-important-to-the-success-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>Someone asked me recently for some advice regarding what they should consider when constructing the URL and endpoints for their RESTful API.  I thought I’d share the advice I passed along. I don't intend this to be a comprehensive guide to building URLs for a true REST API, just some things to consider for the newbie API product manager who may not have a hardcore REST developer on their team. When planning your endpoints for a RESTful API, there are 3 things I tell people to consider: Domain - Put your API at a separate domain or sub-domain than your website.  It will make it easier to migrate and scale, and your IT team will thank you.  For example:  https://api.yourdomain.com Versioning - Make sure and consider the versioning of your API in your URL structure.  How you version will depend on the preferences of your dev team, the most common patterns I see are a v preceding the version number of your API or using year and month of the version.  How often you release may impact your decision.  For example: https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/ https://api.yourdomain.com/2011/11/ Resources - The next part of your URL should be the resource of what you are offering.  Make it self-describing of the resource you are offering through the endpoint.  Make it reflect what a developer is looking to consume when using your API.  For example: https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/article/ https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/user/ How you define your API resources is very important, its something you will have to live with forever.  Make your resource descriptions count, your developers will thank you. The other thing I strong urge is to offer SSL for your API from day one.  Its not a huge problem down the road, but any change will come with issues, and many of your developers will request and even require SSL in some cases, before they integrate with your API. That is all the general advice I have, how you describe your resources is up to...[<a href="/2011/10/18/considerations-when-planning-endpoints-for-your-restful-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     USA Today has announced that they now support the commercial access of articles, reviews and census data through their content APIs.


     Any developer can request a key, and start making calls for free, with initial calls being restricted at a default rate. But as applications prove successful they are now willing to increase usage caps on a case-by-case basis. USA Today doesn’t describe what its commercial pricing will be, but they state in their terms and conditions:


     If USAT decides to charge a fee for use of or access to the USAT APIs, such fees will be disclosed to you prior to USAT charging such fees to you.


     Every couple of months USA Today rolls out a new API or evolution in their business model, as they get more comfortable with their API. This latest move seems to seems to be centered around encouraging commercial of its census data, which the NY Times makes available for commercial use as well.


     Its interesting to watch these media giants evolve their business models using APIs to make themselves more competitive.

			<p><em>14 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     NASA just launched a new Data API around its online archive of NASA data sets, that they launched back in August. The data.nasa.gov API provides a RESTful interface, with responses in JSON for the NASA data archives.


     The new NASA Data API is part of the ongoing NASA Open Government Plan, providing access to data sets in a variety of categories including aeronautics, climate, earth science, engineering, institutional, life sciences, operations and space sciences.


     There is a wealth of data available at data.nasa.gov. The APIs make it easier to access this data, but they are just data APIs. There is a huge opportunity for someone to abstract more meaningful, focused APIs delivering just photos of the moon, weather or climate change related data.


     


     For example, a developer looking to get earth, moon and other planetary photographs, can find what they are looking for in the data.nasa.gov data sets, but they have to navigate the different categories and build the proper requests to get exactly what they are looking for. Some developers are willing to go through this trouble, while others are not, and will give up quickly.


     There is opportunity for someone to deploy a earth photo API, moon photo API and mars photo API for example. These APIs would provide quick access API interfaces around specific and meaningful collections. Developers could quickly build calls pulling the information they need, while non-developers could also syndicate and share using widgets and other embeddable tools.


     Its great to see government agencies not only making data available, but deploying APIs making the data easier to access. But there are more opportunities to derive more meaning, and identify new opportunities around these rich archives of data.

     I'm getting ready for the X.Commerce Innovate Developer Conference 2011, at Moscone Center in San Francisco this week.


     X.Commerce is the merging of Paypal, eBay and Magento's developer ecosystems into a single developer community empowering the next generation of merchants who need to operate in the world of global, multi-channel commerce.


     The APIs that make up X.Commerce are:


     
          Paypal - Website Payment Pro, Express Checkout and Adaptive Payments are a a couple of Paypals Payment APIs that X.Commerce developers can take advantage of.
     
     
          eBay - The hardened suite of search, trading and buying APIs from the popular auction platform that was one of the early pioneers in the web API space.
     
     
          Magento - The API allows access to the Customer, Catalog and Order modules of any users Magento E-Commerce account.
     


     X.Commerce strives to bring together Marketplace, Payment, Mobile Products into a single developer ecosystem, with essential Account Management, Information and Reporting Products.


     Even though you still have to go out to each individual sites developer ecosystems, you can tell they are working to bring together the communities in a central next generation merchant portal.


     


     This is what I expect at the X.Commerce Innovate Developer Conference, an event bringing together all eBay, Paypal and Magento developers and learn about each other, as well as share resources between the communities.


     X.Commerce Innovate Developer Conference 2011 is October 12th, 13th and 14th 2011 and registration is still open for the event. I can get you $200 off the registration price, if you use the code: API200. Hope to see you there!

			<p>I was introduced to the API service provider Socrata last week. Socrata has a government data platform that exceeds anything I&rsquo;ve envisioned. In the past, I have said that every state should have an API.&nbsp;Socrata looks like that platform. Socrata says it best: &ldquo;Social Data Discovery Solution Promotes Civic Engagement, Improves Decision and Policy Making, and Achieves Government Transparency.&rdquo; Socrata defines "Social Data Discovery" as a solution for public and private institutions to transform raw data, contained in large departmental databases, and deploy using the latest web and API technologies. &nbsp;According to Socrata: &nbsp;&ldquo;Social Data Discovery promotes civic engagement, enabling an online community of journalists, policy makers, scientists/domain experts, and citizens to visualize data and engage in discussion with one another. Together, audiences with disparate viewpoints can analyze and discover insights from datasets, improving decision and policy making.&rdquo; They seems to get the political, technical and economic challenges faced when delivering government data solutions, and provide a very comprehensive solution for city, county, state and federal agencies to manage their data: Data-Set On-Boarding - A process, acknowledging the need to clean and transform data so its accessible by an external audience. Web APIs - Ability to deploy RESTful APIs with for data sets with a key for authentication. Datasets and Feeds - Availablity of datasets in common formats like CSV, TSV, XML, KML, and Atom. Mobile - The platform appears to deliver necessary resources for iPhone, Android, and Blackery mobile platforms. Management - Socrata appears to offer many of the essential API maangement services as other providers. Analytics - Provides the necessary reporting and analytics to make sense of how data is being consumed and distributed. The problem with trying to get data from government agencies, is often that you end up with PDF and MIcrosoft Excel reports, and not the quality data feeds and APIs developers need.

			<p><em>08 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     I had a great response to my Learning Management System (LMS) APIs round-up last week after Startup Weekend Seattle EDU. After posting I quickly updated with another LMS suggestion I got for Sakai. Then a couple days ago the PR director for Instructure introduced me to their LMS platform, Canvas.


     Canvas is a open-source LMS created by Instructure and released under the AGPLv3 license. Instructure also provides a cloud version, with all the features of the open source version of Canvas, but comes with hosting, mobile apps, services integration, and automated provisioning.


     


     The Canvas LMS includes a REST API, using OAuth for authentication, enforces SSL, with all API responses in JSON. The API is currently under development and many areas of the application are still unavailable via the external API, but there are still quite a few methods available for the LMS already, and more to come.


     The Canvas solution appears to have all the latest features of a modern software as a service platform. They provide an open-source version, as well as a hosted platform.  Its built with Ruby, on a PostGres database, and runs on the Amazon Cloud.  The API is simple, and they intend to expose all features of the core LMS via the API, with all documentation hosted at Github.


     When the API is complete, I’d definitely say that the Instructure Canvas and API is the most robust LMS solution I’ve come across so far. When they finish their API, and pull together a community around the API, they will definitely be a strong force in the LMS space.

Factual has launch a new application gallery to showcase the diverse number of applications built using data provided by Factual.
You can search for apps, browse by category, and filter by open source, paid or free apps. &nbsp;Looks like there are about 18 apps in the directory currently ranging from augmented reality to daily deals.
The Factual App Gallery isn&rsquo;t a particularly unique launch, we are seeing app showcases popup within many APIs, but it shows that Factual is gaining steam, and I think it shows the appetite for building apps around datasets is growing.

			<p><em>08 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
I just added four new API to my API stack series.  I&rsquo;m considering breaking the API Stack series into a separate feed, they kind of clutter the main feed.  Anyways, the four new APIs are from 3Scale:

Service Management API
Account Management API
Analytics API
Billing API

These four APIs offer the essential building blocks to control, manage and monetize the distribution of data, content and services via a web API. &nbsp;3Scale has had their Service Management API for a while, but recently added the account, analytics and billing services, making a complete set of API management APIs.
3Scale already has two significant differentiors from other API managerment service providers:

Proxy-Less - 3Scale is different than the other service providers in that they don't proxy your APIs.  3Scale only uses a "connector" to integrate the services you want into your API. 
Self-Service - 3Scale is the only self-service API management service with a freemium model.  Well, except for&nbsp;Mashape, they do to, but are in beta currently. 

Adding a set of APIs, definitely sets 3Scale apart from the other API management service providers.  You can sign-up, connect 3Scale services to your API, without routing your API through a proxy, and seamlessly integrate 3Scale service, account and billing management into your existing systems, complete with analytics.

Using 3Scale you can operate for free up to 50K calls per day, and start paying after your API grows or once you are looking to monetize your API and begin billing users.
Since 3Scale has a freemium model, I can play around with a lot of different deployments, until I find the configuration I'm looking for.   I think I'll launch an API for API Evangelist using 3Scale.  See if I can integrate 3Scale service and user management into my existing CMS, and deploy some API analytics.  I don't have anything at the moment I'd feel good about billing for, but maybe some day.

			<p>I attended Mashery's Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco last week. There were a lot of great API presentations, but I thought one really told a great story in-line with the focus of the event, which is the Business of APIs. Tyler Singletary(@harmophone), Developer Evangelist at Klout, told a story around how they are continuing to grow, control and monetize Klout, while also ensuring Klout continues to have meaning and deliver value. Klout's value lies in brand awareness, integrity and the meaning, usefulness and value of the Klout Score to consumers and businesses. To continue offering value and maintaing the integrity of the brand, they are creating a dynamic way to manage their API community, incentivize postive usage of the API, while controlling negative usage. To build awareness of the Klout brand, and increase value, Klout depends on properly displaying of Klout Score and Klout Logo, and linking back to Klout profiles. The more value an API user delivers to the Klout brand the more relaxed Klout can be on quotas, rate limits and even pricing. Not all API users will deliver the same value to the Klout brand, competitors may access data, and application may use scores in a more programmatical way, and not have the desired awareness generating value of other implementations. In these cases Klout can impose tariffs, implementing much stricter quotas, rate limits and charge more for accessing the API. Through a dynamic terms of service, branding guidelines, and pricing, Klout can adjust these business controls based upon how much value an API user brings to the Klout brand, establishing a desired balance within their API ecosystem. Finding that sweet spot where they are delivering the desired units of value to their consumers, while protecting, growing and building value in the Klout brand, even generating revenue it where it makes sense. I really like Tyler's transparent way telling the story of how Klout is defining its business model, and employing...[<a href="/2011/10/07/the-business-of-klout039s-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>At Mimeo we have demo Fridays where anyone can demo what they&rsquo;re working on. For demo Fridays I tend to build prototypes showing different ways to integrate with the Mimeo Document Printing APIs. As my schedule has gotten busier this fall, with more developer support, and attending hackathons and conferences, I don&rsquo;t always have time to polish a prototype for Friday demos. So this Fridays demo I started showcasing some of the ideas I&rsquo;m brainstorming with other developers, and the potential ways they might use our APIs. Here are the four I demoed today: Cabana - Very sexy, GUI mobile application development environment I saw demo at BAPI. I want to understand more about how they will integrate APIs into the mobile building environment. Breezy - Breezy launched their mobile printing network last month, allowing you to print to Fedex Office, local print shops, coffee shops and hotels from your mobile device. I am brainstorming how to print common business documents using Mimeo and have delivered next day using Breezy. PicPlum - Let&rsquo;s you email or upload photos into a queue and when ready add contacts and have photos printed and delivered to your family and friends. Chute - A centrally located backup, syncing and photo sharing platform. Its currently in beta, but I got a look at the back-end, and its a very powerful photo management and distribution platform. Not all of these projects I demoed are guaranteed to go anywhere. Some of the photo products at Mimeo, still need APIs exposed before I can offer some of the more specialized photo printing services. However showing the types of projects developers are engaging me on, creates more awareness within the company about what developers want, and opens up the floor for comments and valuable feedback. Internal API evangelism is an ever increasing part of my API evangelist role.

I'm spending a lot of time lately evaluating the various API management service providers like 3Scale, Apigee,&nbsp;Mashery,and&nbsp;Mashape.
One thing that I have to explain a lot to people about these API management services&hellip;is they are API management services.  Not API deployment services.
The only one provider that has a solution to deploy your API is Mashape, but now there is a new provider gearing up, called Apiary.io.  Apiary.io wants to make developing and implementing APIs a quicker process.
Apiary.io site says they will also help you describe, test, manage and share your API with developers.
I feel that API deployment services is a huge opportunity in this space, its good to see a provider step up that will help API owners deploy their APIs, as well as manage them.
Apiary.io is still in private Beta, so I can't take it for a spin yet.  It will be interesting to learn more about what this latest API service provider can bring to the table.

			<p>I finished up the Mashery, Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.  After a days rest and reflection on the event I wanted to capture my thoughts on BAPI - SF.   The turnout was impressive.  I got to see a lot of familiar faces, was introduced to some new APIs and met a few new folks looking to transform their businesses using APIs.   On the 16 presentations I saw, here are some of my thoughts: Daniel Jacobson - I have seen Daniel talk several times, so I'm familiar with his talk, but he adds new slides each time.  Always love seeing how they are solving internal and partner needs with their APIs, as well helping them achieve world domination using APIs and the Amazon cloud. Adam Trachtenberg - There were three things I took away from listening to Andy.  1) Your API should get all the same love and attention as your primary business.  2)  Hold Hackathons within your own company to encourage innovation 3) LinkedIn is a model of how any API should employ embeddable buttons and widgets around their API. Steve Citron-Poust -  I need to watch his pitch again.  His speaking style was engaging so I was drawn in by his perspective of ecosystem management, and didn't take good enough notes.  He offers a very realist perspective of managing your developers, and the differences in managing a private-label, partner API platform. John Musser - John always has a very concise view of the entire API industry, showing the growth, and helping us understand the scope and depth of this growth.  ProgrammableWeb recently hit 4K APIs in its directory, showing some phenomenal growth in number of APIs, but also by industry, and varying ways companies are monetizing their APIs. Neel Ketkar - Neel from Rovi talked about the advantages of an open API, and the importance of providing a feedback framework for your developers and incorporating feedback into your roadmap....[<a href="/2011/10/06/business-of-apis-conference-in-san-francisco-wrapup/">Read More</a>]</p>

With over 100 APIs, and an army of developer advocates, Google is one of the top API ecosystems in the world, alongside Twitter and Facebook.
Google is stepping back and rethinking how they interact and support their developer community and are looking for feedback from the developer community.
They want to know what inspires you as a developer, what does being a Google developer mean to you, and how Google can make your experience as a developer better.
Facebook has made a tremendous effort to better engage their developer community with Operation Facebook Love, and its really good to see Google make a similar attempt.  We&rsquo;ll see what comes from it, to voice your opinion, you can submit a video or write to Google.

			<p><em>02 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>At Mimeo I get approached by a lot of customers who use various learning management systems, and ask if they can print training and classroom materials from their LMS. I ask them the name of their LMS system, then set out to research what is possible. I've researched almost 30 LMS systems so far (according to my notes), and I've come across 3 that have APIs. I'm in talks with a fourth, Schoology, that has an API as a premium feature, but information is limited and they are super busy with the new school year. Here are the three LMS platforms that I've come across that have APIs: BrainHoney – A learning management system providing course authoring, learning objective management, and gradebook management Haiku Learning System – Learning management system providing website design and development, listserve hosting, assignment dropboxes, and more for teachers to take classrooms online Litmos – Litmos is a SCORM-certified, learning management system, that enables developers to connect their applications to the Litmos training engine, providing deeper integration of training data generated in Litmos with any other systems I find it pretty disturbing that only 3% of the learning management systems have APIs. APIs are essential not only to providing data portability for your customers, but can open up entirely new sales channels for an LMS provider. A web API can enable other content systems and applications to incorporate your LMS into their application. An API will not give away your content or intellectual property, it will open it up and allow you to build new types of revenue channels with customers who might not have adopted your platform by itself, without seamless integration with their existing systems. My research into the education and learning management space is still in its infancy. If you know of any tools I should evaluate, please let me know.

			<p>Historically APIs are deployed to provide data and resources to business partners. However, in the last 5 years we have seen a shift in focus to also delivering more open, publicly focused APIs, based upon the success of popular services like Google Maps, Twitter and Twilio. In the last year, many companies are also seeing the benefits of deploying and consuming APIs internally, in addition to partner driven, and open public APIs. 3Scale, Apigee and&nbsp;Mashery all advocate for evaluating the deployment of APIs for internal and partner consumption as well as carefully weighing the value of a public facing API ecosystem. As an API evangelist I aslo have found the need for equal distribution of resources when it comes to evangelizing the benefits of APIs as well. Internal API Evangelism - I spend â of my time educating internal departments from IT to marketing about the benefits of APIs. I want everyone to understand that APIs will make our company more flexible and nimble, and help us out-maneuver our competitors. APIs also will assist us in delivering mobile content and applications within our company and to our customers. Partner API Evangelism - I spend â of my time educating our partners about the various APIs we have, how they can be used, and provide as much material as I can about our web services. I also evangelize about other APIs that compliment our services and can provide benefits to our partners. Its not just about selling our partners on our services, its letting them know we are invested in their success. Public API Evangelism - I spend â of my time blogging, tweeting and generating code samples, prototypes and any other materials that will help get the word out to the public about our APIs. Public API evangelism is not just about SEO content, its about social engagement.

Klout just updated their API area. The Klout API was originally released in 2009, but the new API area has several improvements including faster response times for the API, better documentation and improved terms of service.
Using the Klout API developers can pull someones Klout Score, which is the measurement of their overall online influence using social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+.   It provides a way of essentially high-grading users on your network, and rewarding or engaging users differently based upon their overall network influence.
I categorize the Klout API as a &ldquo;partner API&rdquo;, meaning that can add value to just about any existing API community and application.  For example, with my Mimeo Connect Document Printing APIs, a print application could offer lower pricing to a user based upon their Klout score.  If you are building a poster, flyer or book printing application and you offer lower pricing to people who are influencers, you can probably bet they&rsquo;ll talk about your app within their network.
The Klout API opens up a lot of opportunities for web and mobile app developers to enrich their understanding of their existing user base, identifying the users that are the biggest influencers, and may contribute to a larger network effect around their application.
Klout has delivered their API using the Mashery API platform, you can register for an API key and learn more about the platform at developer.klout.com.

			<p>One of the things I do here at API Evangelist is review APIs for their owners and provide suggestions for how they can improve the technology, ecosystem and better monetize their API. When it comes to monetization many of the API owners seem to have a good grasp of how they are covering the base costs of operating their API, but are looking for ways to expand their revenue, and actually make their API profit engine. Just like with web and mobile applications the first way people think about monetizing their API is using advertising. Though I don&rsquo;t always agree with employing advertising as part of an API ecosystem, it makes sense that many owners are considering it. Advertising has been a primary revenue generator for web sites and applications, and has become a staple for mobile applications, using mobile advertising platforms like AdMob. With this growing demand, I see a huge opportunity for someone to step up and provide a plug-and-play advertising network that API owners can deploy as part of their API ecosystems. An API advertising network could provide broad or specialized sponsored content that could be delivered within existing API content. An API advertising network would have different ways to filter and tailor content so advertising would not be intrusive and blend with the content already being delivered as part of an API, whether its delivering text, images, audio or video. API advertising networks would have revenue sharing for developers built in. As an API owner I could choose to share advertising revenue with my developer ecosystem in any amount I wanted. Advertising would be pushed to all API calls made by developers, but they could be given an option to register for the revenue sharing program, and the system would track all ads delivered through a developers site or application, and pay out associated revenue. Web advertising models like Google Adsense are great for website and application development, and mobile advertising...[<a href="/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>Audrey introduced me to a very cool gaming company the other day called Tiny Speck. The company, the latest project of Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield, has released its first game to the public today: Glitch. Glitch is a web-based massively-multiplayer game. The game allows you to choose how to grow and shape the world: building and developing, learning new skills, collaborating or competing with everyone else in one enormous, ever-changing, persistent world. Glitch is a visually stunning game environment, delivered using a flash client (although the startup does state other clients will be available someday). There's a lot that's familiar about the game, particularly to fans of MMOs and social games -- Glitch is a combination of the two, arguably. But where Glitch really strikes me as doing something new is with its back-end. Glitch uses a low level Java back-end with game logic scripted in JavaScript, built on a suite of APIs, allowing for maximum flexibility and easy deployment. No surprise, it's this API piece that strikes me as compelling and different from other games. I do have a list of game-related APIs to evaluate, I just haven’t had the time to dive in too deeply. But at first glance most game APIs tend to only deliver meta-information about games, profiles, and the communities around games. Though I don’t doubt APIs drive a lot of game development, most developers I’ve talked to don’t think much about it, let alone make the APIs public or showcase them. Glitch could be a “game-changer” in that Tiny Speck has built its game around the API, as well as exposing these same APIs to its developer community, enabling them in turn to build web, iOS, and Android games around the Glitch universe. The Glitch API uses JSON over HTTP or HTTPS, in an RPC style, allowing parameters to be passed via GET or POST vars, with an available JSONP callback. The API provides access to players, skills, avatars,...[<a href="/2011/09/27/tiny-speck-is-changing-how-games-are-built-using-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I wrote about the need for more Transit APIs a couple weeks ago, and the opportunity for some company or organization to step up and coordinate transit APIs on a global, country, regional and local level. Also the opporunity for developers to provide local resources for building applications, "acquiring" of local data, understanding local constraints, and be the overall contact for a specific locale. To me, there appears to be a hunger for transit data, and there is a major gap in how this "public data" is being made available for developers to build websites, web and mobiles apps, that businesses and commuters can use. The opportunity is so big, that tech savvy commuters are stepping up, scraping data, and building transit APIs and applications themselves. I had a lot of people contact me after my post, but one clear player emerged, that appears to be just the company I was looking for. That company is Jeppesen, a Boeing funded company that has a new service called the Jeppesen Journey Planner API. Jeppesen has developed a very robust set of transit APIs, providing: Public Transit Journey Plans - Request multimodal public transit journey plans Polyline Trip Details - Draw the journey plans on a map Stop Locations - Locate all the public transit stops within an area Stop Timetable - Obtain a list of departures (or arrivals) from a public transit stop Walk Journey Plans - Request walking journey plans between locations Service Provider - Identify the public transit service providers in an area Fares - Find out the cost of the journey (when transit fare information is available) Trip Timetable - Discover all the stopping points for a specific trip Jeppesen is aggregating data from transit agencies around the world, including 23 regions in the US, and locations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK, into a single set of web services. Jeppesen has enough markets to be a viable option, and they...[<a href="/2011/09/26/a-single-provider-for-high-quality-transit-data-and-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>During TwilioCon last week I covered the release of Twilio Connect in two posts, starting with, "Twilio Introduces Twilio Connect, Its New In-App Billing Model" on ProgrammableWeb, and on API Evangelist with, "Twilio Connect is OAuth for API Billing". Twilio Connect is a new billing solution that enables developers to offload charges for Twilio API usage to their application users, rather than their own Twilio accounts, and billing customers separately. Twilio Connect is modeled after OAuth in that it uses a &ldquo;two-legged&rdquo; process for application users to setup and authenticate a payment relationship with Twilio, that a developer can leverage within their app using a token. I mentioned lightly in my post on API Evangelist: &ldquo;OAuth 2.0 allows for designation of which account resources a developer can access, enabling users to approve at a very granular level, which could very easily be used for billing access as well.&rdquo; Then yesterday I got called out on Twitter by Travis Spencer (@travisspencer), stating that because Twilio did not use OAuth 2.0 to implement Twilio Connect, it was a step backwards, and I was irresponsible for not calling Twilio out on this. He is totally right, and I humbly admit to not covering this story well enough. In most cases OAuth is implemented for basic user account authentication, but with the introduction of OAuth 2.0 you can use for authenticating access in a very granular way for any user resources that you choose. So it could be very easily used for billing authentication, and its irresponsible of Twilio to not embrace industry standards, and developing their own, proprietary, one-off implementation. OAuth has a reputation for being tough to implement, both from a provider standpoint as well as working with as a developer, but with each version it is getting easier to use, and since its being widely accepted as an industry standard it is all of our responsibility as API owners to make sure it is used properly,...[<a href="/2011/09/25/twilio-connect-is-not-oauth-for-api-billing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I&rsquo;m working on reviewing various APIs as part of my database industry overview, where I&rsquo;m trying to understand the different approaches to delivering database platforms using web APIs as the primary interface.
One of these database platforms is Database.com.  I really like what SalesForce.com is doing with Database.com, but I take issue with their section declaring Database.com as an open platform.  SalesForce.com claims because you can access Database.com from any language, any platform, and any device through standards-based APIs, it is "open".
I think many folks in the enterprise space truly believe this makes something open.  All it means is, if you have the money and approved credentials, you can access.  If I launch a database on Database.com it is open for "me" to access, and those I give access to.  And yes, since it uses REST I am "open" to access via any language or platform I choose.  But I'm sorry, that does not make it "open".
I recommend SalesForce.com take a look at Freebase.  All the data contained in Freebase is licensed by a Creative Commons Attribution License, which means that it's free for you to browse, query, copy, and even use the data in your own systems or software, even for commercial use, all you have to do is attribute it back to Freebase.
Anyone has access to use and contribute to Freebase, as well as use any programming language or platform to access the data available on the platform.  Access to data is only one aspect of "open", developers must also be freely open to use and contribute to it, as the community sees fit.
As much as I love and evangelize the power of the API, an API alone does not make systems or data open.

			<p>I was reviewing the Recovery API yesterday, which gives you a RESTful API for exploring where all the money went as part of our governments Recovery Act. I have a sort of obsession with this kind of government data, and began playing with, and tracking on where the stimulus money went in my home state of Oregon. I started hacking on the API by manipulating the query string variables to get different types of responses on how stimulus money was spent by city, county and project types like roads, education and the environment. Since I’m a developer I’m very comfortable with hacking on the URL query string like this, but I noticed they also had a tool they called the, “Advanced Recipient Data Search Widget”. The advanced recipient data search widget allows me to adjust the same fields, but using an actual form. Using the widget anyone can easily build requests against the Recovery API without being a developer, and I even found it allowed me to explore and understand the API quicker and easier. The widget even displays the final request string you can copy and paste and see the XML results in the browser or just as results grid on the screen. And you can also choose to download the results as a CSV when done. The form could be better. It does not provide drop-down values for each of the fields, and the pop-up window is a little clunky. It still is a very useful tool helping not only developers get up and running, but allows the average user to come in and use, understand and export results from the Recovery API. I’m a big fan of API explorer and console tools, but they still often are built for developers, by developers to explore and understand how an API works.

			<p>Twilio just announced a new API billing solution called Twilio Connect.  The new billing solution enables developers to offload charges for Twilio API usage to their application users, rather than their own Twilio accounts, and billing customers separately. Twilio Connect is modeled after OAuth in that it uses a “two-legged” process for application users to setup and authenticate a payment relationship with Twilio, that a developer can leverage within their app using a token. To start, developers put a Twilio Connect button in their application.  Application users then click the button and are taken to a secure Twilio page that allows them to setup a new Twilio account, requiring only the minimal needed information:  name, billing info, and email.   Upon successful setup, the application is then issued a token, which combined with a Twilio developers key, enables that application to consume Twilio API services, and bill to the users account. If you think about it, it makes perfect sense.  What OAuth has done for user account authentication,  Twilio is doing for developer billing authentication.  OAuth 2.0 allows for designation of which account resources a developer can access, enabling users to approve at a very granular level, which could very easily be used for billing access as well.  However the complexity of OAuth 2.0 can often scare away businesses looking to implement oAuth, and developers looking to build around an API that authenticates with OAuth.  Twilio is taking the best features from OAuth, while keep the developer implementation dead simple. Not all APIs would benefit from a billing authentication model like Twilio Connect.  It would work best for APIs that truly have a “cloud utility” model for their pricing, allowing developers to pay for only what they consume.  This would allow for the burden of billing to be lifted from developers, enabling them to do what they do best--code applications.   One problem I see here is that developers who rely on marking up underlying API...[<a href="/2011/09/20/twilio-connect-is-oauth-for-api-billing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>
Not even a week after Google rolled out the long awaited Google+ API, they launched the Google+ Hangouts API, enabling developers to build collaborative apps that run inside of a Google+ Hangout
The Google+ Hangout API will provide developers with the ability to manipulate the UI, interact with hangout participants and respond to the different events that occur within a hangout. &nbsp;The functionality is reminiscent of the way Google Wave gadgets and robots could interact with a wave and its participants. &nbsp;I wonder if we are seeing some of the Google Wave code being recycled?
To use Google+ you have to register your application with Google, and specify any other Google+ users on your team that will be able to load the application into their hangout. &nbsp;Since the Google+ Hangouts API is only in developer preview, this is temporary requirement.

Once registered, apps behaves like a normal web app, but it also can take part in the real-time conversations within a hangout using the API. &nbsp;Google+ Hangout apps will use whats called a &ldquo;shared state&rdquo; among all instances, notifying users of changes by other application users in real-time.
The decision to release the Google+ clearly was a strategic move against Facebook, which I understand, but I still feel strongly that a empowering developers with a fully write enabled API from the beginning, is very important to setting the tone for the Google+ API ecosystem.
Many developers, including myself were not happy with the limited functionality of the initial Google+ API release. &nbsp;However, I could tell that Google was being cautious in their API roll-out, and there is potentially much more behind the scenes. &nbsp;I expect Google will be rolling out new APIs as they feel confident, or maybe when they feel it will give them a strategic advantage, like this week during the Facebook F8 conference.

			<p>Code libraries have been a staple of open API communities for quite a few years now. &nbsp;API owners provide developers with working samples of code in a variety of programming languages, to get started working with an API. &nbsp;Sample code helps developer get up and running quicker, and increases the chances a developer will actually adopt an API. I was reviewing how Google approached the release of the Google+ API this week, and noticed their download section not only contained the usual code libraries, but also contain whats called "starter projects". &nbsp;These starter projects provide a complete framework with everything you need to get start with OAuth, and to start building an application on top of the Google+ API. Does this reflect the future of what API owners should be providing for their developers? &nbsp;Should we be providing web and mobile app starter projects to help get developers up and running with our APIs? &nbsp;These kits could assist them in moving from idea to integration, but starter kits might go even further than that. &nbsp; By providing starter applications projects to our developers we can go beyond faster integration, and also help steer the quality of how applications are designed, ensure they using best coding practices, following security standards, and ultimately delivering better applications that are in line with the goals of the API owner. Companies don't just want developers using their APIs, they want them building quality applications around them, that reflect positively on the API. &nbsp;Starter projects, may be just the way to steer how developers build around an API, and guide them in a positive direction. Starter projects do this from a functional perspective, but another example of this from the UI and branding perspective, can be seen with Twitter's Bootstrap toolkit. &nbsp;Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites, and includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation and everything developers...[<a href="/2011/09/17/providing-code-libraries-is-not-enough-for-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

The Google + API provides a RESTful interface for the newly launched Google social network, Google +, &nbsp;and provides access to profile data and activity streams. &nbsp;The API uses OAuth for authentication and JSON for its request and response formats. That&rsquo;s it. &nbsp;Pretty underwhelming from a developers perspective. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be able to make some badges or widgets, maybe stream my activities in the sidebar of my Wordpress blog. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is my photo access (wait that is in Picassa), or my video access (wait that is in Youtube), &nbsp;or my social events (wait that is in Google Calendar)? Ok, forget about about other content, what about my write access? &nbsp;I want to be able to write to my activity stream and update my profile. &nbsp;I want other apps that I authorize to be able to publish to my activity stream. &nbsp; I'll stop there. &nbsp;Without write access, there is no use railing about lack of application platform, access to circles, and true data portability and ownership via the API. In short, I think Google could have come out of the gate with a little more. &nbsp;Maybe linking up some of my other Google systems via my Google + profile, like Picassa images, and Youtube video. &nbsp;But more importantly developers should have write access. &nbsp;OAuth, plus write access to my social profile and activity stream should have been part of this release. &nbsp;&nbsp;It would have sent the right message to developers.

			<p><em>14 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve come across several APIs lately that rely on getting their data from web scraping. &nbsp;These API owners have written scripts that spider page(s) on a regular schedule, pull content, parse it and clean it up for storage in a database.
Once they&rsquo;ve scraped or harvested this data from the web page source, they then get to work transforming and normalizing for access via a RESTful API. &nbsp;&nbsp;With an API they can now offer a standard interface that reliably pulls data from a database and delivers it in XML or JSON to any developer. &nbsp;
These API owners are still at the mercy of the website source that is being scraped. &nbsp;What if the website changes something? &nbsp;
This is definitely a real problem, and scraping is not the most reliable data source. &nbsp;But if you think about it, APIs can go up and down in availability, making them pretty difficult to work with too. As long as you have failure built into your data acquisition process and hopefully have a plan B, the API can offer a consistent interface for your data.
Web scraping is not an ideal foundation for building a business around, but if the value of the data outweighs the work involved with obtaining, cleaning up, normalizing and delivering the data--then its worth it. &nbsp;&nbsp;And this type of approach to data APIs will continue.
There is far more data available via web pages today then there is from web APIs. &nbsp;This discrepancy leaves a lot of opportunities for web scrapers to build business around data you might own, and you make available online, but haven&rsquo;t made time to open, control and monitor access to it via an APi.
The opportunity to build businesses around scraping will continue in any sector until dependable APIs are deployed that provide reasonable pricing, as well as clear incentive and revenue models for developers to build their businesses on.

     Last week I covered Centralized Geo Data with New InfoChimps API, and talked about how I felt it was a Look at the Future of Data.  After writing I started thinking about other data that is ready for the same type of treatment that InfoChimps is giving geo data.
     
     I was reading Audrey’s post today on O’Reilly today called, A new look for weather data, where she talks with WeatherSpark co-founder Jacob Norda about his company's approach to weather data and visualizations.
     
     Norda talks about where the problems with traditional weather information are, how WeatherSpark gets its data, and how weather data can be improved overall.
     
     It seems weather data suffers from all the same problems as geo data, such as multiple sources, varying schemas, huge datasets that are not easy linked with other sets of data.   Weather data has huge legacy system usage as well as massive growth in generation and consumption with the introduction of sensors and mobile devices.
     
     Norda concludes the interview by saying, “We're considering offering a unified API, but it's in the pre-roadmap stage at this point.”  Seems like a common theme with data and APIs, lately.
     
     What other areas of data are reaching this point, where developers could benefit from a unified API?

			<p><em>13 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>I believe that REST and JSON are breaking up the web, into smaller more understandable, re-usable, mashable pieces that potentially anyone can use, even non-developers. I have written several posts on how tools like API explorers and standards like oEmbed are making APIs accessible by non-developers.  And I’m always on the look out for new ideas, for new ways to arm the masses with tools that take advantage of APIs. Evolving on a piece I wrote a couple a months ago about a Widget Builder Environment for APIs, I was envisioning taking Yahoo Pipes to the next level, add in better API support with OAuth, and make it much more simpler to use.  I did not get much time to think about it before Audrey introduced me to if this then that (ifttt).   ifttt allows you to creates tasks.  Tasks are defined like this: when something happens (this) then do something else (that). this (triggers) - The this part of a task is the Trigger. Some example Triggers are "if I'm tagged in a photo on Facebook" or "if I tweet on Twitter."  that (actions) - The that part of a task is the Action. Some example Actions are "then send me a text message" or "then create a status message on Facebook."  Triggers and Actions come from Channels. Channels are the services and devices we use every day, such as:  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, Phone Call or Weather. You can put one channel's trigger together with another channel's action to create a task that runs every 15 minutes and can be turned on and off. Channels are made possible because these services have APIs.  ifttt does a remarkable job at simplifying this in a way, I never even imagined, and allows any user to take advantage of two APIs, apply meaningful business logic, and automate the task to run regularly.   What really makes it cool is you can save tasks as “recipes”...[<a href="/2011/09/13/api-automation-for-the-masses-with-if-this-then-that/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/09/12/weather-underground-launches-new-api-platform-at-techcrunch-disrupt/">"Weather Underground Launches New API Platform at TechCrunch Disrupt"</a></h3>
			<p><em>12 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     At TechCrunch DISRUPT, this week in San Francisco, the Weather Underground launched a new Weather API platform that provides developers with real-time access to in-depth weather data.


     The Weather Underground Weather API provides access to data from more than 19,000 users contributing local observations from personal weather stations, providing up-to-the-minute weather conditions for the most finely targeted areas.


     The Weather API is RESTful with responses available in a JSON format, with access free for developers making 500 requests per day, and paid tiers for requests starting at 5K requests per month up to 1M requests per month.


     "Weather Underground already distributes its weather data to many of the world’s leading media companies, weather applications and smaller web properties," said Alan Steremberg, President and co-Founder of Weather Underground. "Our new self-service API platform will open up our data to thousands more developers working on web and mobile programs, big and small."


     The Weather Underground provides a very robust developers area allowing developers to signup, manage their keys and choose the appropriate pricing plan. They provide the necessary API documentation and code samples to get up and going, and even throw in some analytics showing your access and usage of the API.

			<p><em>12 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>The response to Sundays post about the Need for More Transit APIs was impressive.  I receive quite a few emails and tweets about other APIs, and it started a good discussion on Hacker News. Adding more targets for my public transit API research. While doing my research, I just finished looking at OneBusAway, a provider of real-time transit information for the Puget Sound region.  The API was started by University of Washington students to support research on improving the usability of public transportation. At first look, OneBusAway seems like the start of a great model for other city and regional transit API initiatives to follow.  First they start with a RESTful API providing data about transit agencies, routes, arrivals, stops and tripping planning, using an application key for authentication and all the documentation and tools you need to successfully integrate with the API. Next OneBusAway provides a very complete list of tools to make it easier to use public transit Web - A map-based web interface for finding stops, routes, and real-time arrival information. Phone - A touch-tone phone interface for real-time arrival information. SMS - A text-messaging interface for real-time arrival information. iPhone - A native OneBusAway client for iPhones, with location-aware features. Android - A native OneBusAway client for Android phones, with location-aware and notification features. Windows Phone 7 - A native OneBusAway client for Windows Phone 7 phones. Mobile Web - Real-time arrival information optimized for mobile web browsers and text-only web browsers. Explore - The Explore Tool lets you search for nearby restaurants, businesses, parks, and other amenities that are easily accessible by public transit. In addition to providing a API and a full set of interfaces for accessing data from the API, they open-source it all, which means they release all the code that powers OneBusAway, for anyone to use.   That includes their iPhone and Android mobile applications, letting other developers take advantage of all the work that's been put into OneBusAway.

			<p>I’m working on some more stories around municipal data APIs, based upon two stories I found recently, where developers took it upon themselves to scrape data, launch APIs, and build mobile tools around local municipal transit data: Madison Transit API - Greg Tracy of Madison, WI has a great story on his journey to build a simple SMS app and ended building an entire API.  Greg wanted an SMS app that could deliver real-time arrival estimates, to meet his needs as a commuter.  After much pain scraping the Madison Transit site for data, he felt he should prevent others from having to do the same, and published an API around his data.  But Greg also wanted to find a way to contribute to the larger mission of opening up a public dataset to make it more accessible, opening up opportunities for his communities to operate more efficiently. Swedish Train API - Erik Pettersson did the same thing in Sweden.  In his frequent travels as a freelancer, Erik was frustrated by the lack of information available, leaving him often sitting at a station wondering when the next train was.  From this frustration, Erik created a simple SMS service where travelers can text their train number, and receive updates on delayed arrivals, departures or even track changes at given stations.  His data was scraped from the Swedish Transport Administration, and in a year of operation, the API has spawned other applications for iOS, Android and Windows Mobile.   I still haven't fully flushed out my stories around both these municipal APIs, but it sure smells like an opportunity for some tech companies to get involved.  You a captured audience of commuters across the globe, needing more information about their daily bus, train and subway.  This need is so great, tech savvy commuters are scraping and building their own systems to meet this need.   I know Google is stepping up to serve this space with Google Maps...[<a href="/2011/09/11/the-need-for-more-transit-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I followed the Jonthan&rsquo;s Card Socal Experiment closely. The whole time I had an entry on my to do list, to write a story about it. I never successfully found an angle I could get behind, then Audrey said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just write about he tech behind it?&rdquo;. Great idea! Jonathan&rsquo;s Card is interesting as a social or marketing experiment, but I am more interested in the technology that was used to make it happen, not just the social experiment. It all starts with an image of Jonathan&rsquo;s Starbucks Card. But it took the mobility of the smart phone to be able to display the image of his sard and purchase a coffee at your local Starbucks. An image and your smart phone are essential technology in this experiment, but none of this would be possible without the Starbucks Card program. Starbucks allows anyone to purchase and add money to the balance of the card as long as you know the card number, and the site also allows you to see charges made against the card. The Starbucks Card is the central ingredient in this experiment, but Twitter also plays an important role. Jonathan uses Twitter as a central messaging channel, and ultimately an API for the Johnathan&rsquo;s Card Experiment. He wrote a bot that scrapes the Starbucks site for the card balance and posts it to Twitter, whenever anything is charged to the Starbucks Card. Twitter is also being used by the community participating in this &ldquo;social experiment&rdquo;. Twitter allows them to tweet at @jonathanscard adding to the Twitter data stream. Also, some innovative developer particpated by adding graphing apps on top of the @jonathanscard Twitter stream, that provided visualisations for the experiment. Additionally, to provide easier access for developers, Jonathan whipped up a simple read only API providing insight into the experiment in the following ways: Balances - Returns the card balance for every minute of the day Latest Activity - Returns...[<a href="/2011/09/10/beyond-the-social-experiment-jonathans-card-is-the-new-gift-card-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

I provided some more coverage of Dreamforce, and their latest mobile platform. &nbsp;Then I covered the US invasion of Viadeo Social Network, and called out the Government software provider TylerTech about their lack of API support for cities across the country. &nbsp;Check the blog posts out for yourself:



APIs Drive the New Touch.Salesforce.com Platform - Last week at the Dreamforce event in San Francisco, Saleforce.com unveiled its new mobile platform called touch.salesforce.com. Built with HTML5, touch.salesforce.com will allow users to access salesforce.com apps on iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. At Dreamforce, Saleforce.com acknowledged that the future of the enterprise is both social and mobile, and the Salesforce.com APIs are a driving force.


Viadeo Looks to Take on LinkedIn in the US - Viadeo, a social network founded in 2004 with 35 million professional members worldwide, is looking to take on LinkedIn as the preferred business social network in the United States &mdash; &nbsp;and the company thinks that its Viadeo API will do it. Viadeo recently launched a publicly available version of its API that provides full access to the social network&rsquo;s users&rsquo; data including career, news, groups, jobs, schools and a users status and messaging system.


Every City Should Have an API - Let's Start With Watertown, MA - We all have a duty as citizens to participate in government, even if it&rsquo;s just to vote. &nbsp;With the convergence of the Internet, RESTful APIs, JSON, mobile phones and the wealth of programming resources available today, the opportunities to participate are increasing.

			<p>Someone asked me about APIs dealing with water and utilities a couple weeks ago.  So I dove in to see what I could find related to APIs for city, county and state water management. First I came cross, what sees like a pretty good model for city water services with the Wellington NZ City Water Service Pipes.  The Wellington Water Service API provides programmatic access to water and drainage data to assist in planning works that are in proximity to water and drainage infrastructure. Next the Emery Water Conservancy District in central Utah provides sensor data from weather, canal, reservoir, pond and river monitoring sites via the MetriDyne API.  The MetriDyne API provides immediate access to data from these sites, leading to better and timely information leads to better water management. Then in Canada there is a pretty interesting initiative to create an open source web platform that will aggregate, federate, and connect water data and information enabling users to access, mashup, analyze, model and interpret water data, information, issues and opportunities, called the Water and Environmental Hub. That was really it, when it came to water related APIs.  They are all three really great models when it comes to looking at the future of water management using APIs. I would throw in another API i found from NASA called the MODAPS Web Services which provides an API to access the data products provided by the Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), providing programmatic access to atmosphere, weather and ocean data. There are also some software solutions for water, energy and utility management that include APIs: ArcFM Solution Overview - maintenance of electric, gas, fiber optic, water and wastewater facility WaterObjects.NET - Gives you complete and programmatic access to Bentley’s water modeling technology, from numerical methods and water modeling capabilities to mapping, data management, and result presentation features Beyond data and software for water management, there is the water, weather and environmental...[<a href="/2011/09/09/a-flood-of-apis-just-waiting-to-happen/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Have you ever tried to get data from a government agencies website? &nbsp;Often, when you find what your looking for, its in a PDF format. &nbsp;Not really a data friendly format. &nbsp;If your lucky, you will find a spreadsheet, but usually they are laid out in a report format and not meant for actual data portability.I have a personal obsession for finding, crunching and making sense out of local, state, and federal government data. &nbsp;I'm willing to do a lot of work to derive meaning about how our government works. &nbsp;I personally feel its my duty to lend a hand, but while doing so, I often get overwhelmed parsing PDF files and often have to rearrange data by hand, or just give up on my project entirely.I've always blamed the the "government bureaucracy for this--it is some sort of conspiracy to hide what is really going on. However, recently I'm beginning to change my tune. &nbsp;I'm getting a feeling that maybe it goes deeper then with government operations. &nbsp;Its the technology they are given. &nbsp;While trying to understand more about the technology our government uses, I came across a post by Matt MacDonald. &nbsp;Matt is trying to get data from his local town of Watertown, MA. &nbsp;After looking around he encountered the same issues. &nbsp;All he could get were PDFs and Excel "reports", which seems to be the common language of government when comes to data portability.After not getting what he was looking for he went to the source, the company that built the tools his town used, TylerTech. &nbsp;TylerTech builds systems for municipalities to manage services ranging from property taxes to school information systems.Matt reached out to TylerTech, and asked whether or not they had an API for their systems available for their town, but he&rsquo;s just gotten a couple cookie cutter responses, and no real information. &nbsp;&nbsp;I reached out to TylerTech for comment on this story, and have not received a response.As I...[<a href="/2011/09/06/every-city-county-and-state-should-have-an-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Mashape, the upcoming, self-service marketplace for APIs, which provides a platform to distribute, consume and manage cloud based APIs, has just closed $1.5M in seed funding. The round was led by NEA, with Index Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Ignition&nbsp;Partners participating, and on the angel side of things, Jeff Bezos and&nbsp;Eric Schmidt&rsquo;s Innovation Endeavors, as well as Erik Rannala, Russell Siegelman and&nbsp;Rick Webb jumped in.Mashape is one of the most recent additions to the API management space, providing an end to end solution allowing you to deploy, manage and market your API from within the Mashape platform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mashape provides API management tools that can be found with other providers like Mashery, Apigee and 3Scale, but where they stand out is they also provide you with a library to deploy your API, auto-generate the code developers will need to integrate with your API, and a social API marketplace to generate attention and drive adoption around your API.&ldquo; We have a very long term vision, we believe APIs will play a major role in theworld of Information Technology for the years to come - the interesting partis that even companies not related to Internet as a core business, are nowintegrating APIs into their products, such Toyota or Nike.&rdquo; Mashape&rsquo;s CEOAugusto Marietti says.&ldquo; If we take a look into those startups that have more than 30 people, we notice that most of them are hiring 2 new positions: API evangelist and API engineer. Thosepositions would never have existed 3 years ago. A new market is coming.&rdquo;Mashape steps into a space that is already dominated by heavy-weights like Layer7 and SOA Software, and has new players like Apigee, Mashery and 3Scale offering business and enterprise API solutions. &nbsp;But Mashape brings a fresher, more social offering, that will appeal to the API hacker in all of us, and with a little more money in their pocket, maybe they can give the other players some serious competition in this new API...[<a href="/2011/09/06/api-marketplace-mashape-raises-1-5m-seed-round/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>Even though I cover the entire industry around APIs here on API Evangelist, I also am the API Evangelist for Mimeo Connect. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mimeo is a printing API that allows you to print a wide variety of business documents, using your Mimeo.com account. &nbsp;Its pretty powerful stuff, if you think about it, an API that is connected to 3 print facilities. &nbsp; The API seems pretty straightforward at first glance, but developers seem to be encountering three major obstacles: Mimeo.com Accounts - Users don&rsquo;t like having to get a developer account as well as sandbox and live Mimeo.com accounts to work with the API Mimeo Documents - Developers don&rsquo;t really have time to build and define the documents before integration, they just want to print a specific document, and pass some settings to change it up. Sandbox and Live Environments - It is great that Mimeo has sandbox and live environments, but developers were expected to maintain two separate environments, just to use the system. These three areas proved to be the difference between some users adopting, and others walking away. &nbsp;There was too much work in navigating the world of Mimeo accounts and documents. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t hard if your already a Mimeo web to print user, but if your a developer you just want to print. &nbsp;So I created four virtualized print APIs. &nbsp;&nbsp;I took a REST framework and deployed four separate &ldquo;document printing APIs&rdquo;: Poster Printing API Flyer &amp; Brochure Printing API Card Printing API Spiral Notebook API Then using 3Scale self-service API management solution I deployed an API area to handle documentation, forum and developer registration and API key management. &nbsp;Each API has seven methods for ordering print documents: Proof (POST) Proof (GET) Quote (GET) Shipping Options (GET) Order Quote (GET) Place Order (POST) Order Status (GET) All a developer has to do is register for a set of keys, grab a code sample and get to work. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t have to setup...[<a href="/2011/09/05/virtualized-document-printing-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>At Mimeo, my API developers were running into problems integrating with our cloud print API, I needed a fast way to virtualize and deploy an API built on top of my existing REST API. &nbsp;A quick and dirty way I could research and develop new APIs, launch, measure and manage without getting IT involved. &nbsp;So I virtualized four document APIs using the CodeIgniter open-source PHP web framework, Amazon EC2, 3Scale self-service API management service and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.First I launched a copy of the CodeIgniter framework on my existing Amazon EC2 instance, configured mod_rewrite to handle my URLs, and wrote seven API methods dedicated to printing just one type of document, like a poster. &nbsp;I now had a simple RESTful API that handled requests, and returned XML and JSON responses.I need a quick way to manage access to my API and measure its usage. &nbsp;So I would know who was using it, how they were using it, and if it was worth while to keep the API and put more resources into it. &nbsp;I selected 3Scale API management, one of two free, self-service API mangement platforms out there. &nbsp;The other is Mashape, but they are still in BETA, so 3Scale was the only other solution I could deploy for free, and scale as I needed when things were successful.I deployed the 3Scale PHP connector on my Amazon EC2 instance as part of the CodeIgniter REST framework. &nbsp;I then launched my 3Scale self-service API area, which provides me with: Self-Service Developer Registration / Login / Key Management Documentation Forum &amp; Support API Metering / Billing&nbsp; Analytics and API Usage Reporting I now had a simple RESTful API, that had self-service documentation, app key registration, forum, and support. &nbsp;I received emails when new developers registered, could track how much they used, and turn off access when needed.I was open for business, using the CodeIgniter tools as a RESTful framework and 3Scale as API management solution...[<a href="/2011/09/05/deploy-and-manage-a-restful-api-with-codeingiter-and-3scale/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Sorry about the flood of 25 API Evangelist posts. &nbsp;It was due to the fact I switched to a new blogging system today.
I was out growing what I could do with Wordpress, and had too much data and other research I need to link together to show the bigger picture of whats going on with APIs.API Evangelist has always been a hybrid Wordpress blog and custom CMS system system I wrote. &nbsp;Over the last couple months I rewrote my CMS, and re-lauched with 7 new systems:

Blog
Industries
APIs&nbsp;
Building Blocks
Service Providers
Tools
Events

These content systems each have their own database, and are linked together by a central tagging system, and I have established relationships between each of the databases as necessary.v2.0 allows me to store data I gather from around the web in a more structured way, &nbsp;one that allows me to identify patterns and trends easier and also opens up more opportunities for discovery here on the site.I have a whole bunch of APIs, tools, services etc. to put into the system, but I couldn't wait anymore and wanted to launch the new site. &nbsp;If you see any problems, let me know please.&nbsp;

			<h3><a href="/2011/09/03/uk-national-archives-launches-api/">"UK National Archives Launches API"</a></h3>
			<p><em>03 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     The National Archives has published a new API, as part of an ongoing program to get more public records online, according to ComputerWeekly.com.


     The National Archives API provides programmatic access to over 11 million records from the discovery service catalogue, broken down into a seven-level hierarchical structure:


     Department - Government department, agency or body that creates the records
     
     Division - Administrative section of a department
     
     Series - The main grouping of records with a common function or subject
     
     Sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     
     Sub sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     
     Piece - A piece can be a box, volume or file
     
     Item - A part of a piece. It can be a bundle, a single document, a sub-file, etc.
     


     Access is provided without restriction or charging for content, but costs $3.50 per document to retrieve the same records online through the website.


     Aleksandr Drozdov, architect for the National Archives, said they have been speaking with academic historians to help them find ways to use the API in their research, and they are very interested in access to the archives in a programmatic way.


     According to Computer Weekly the National Archives is also working an e-commerce system. Since private companies have been paying the National Archives 52M since 2002 for the digitization of paper records they could then resell through websites, the API and associated e-commerce system are a perfect fit.


     The move by the National Archive may prove a great model for other institutions to not only open up access to their collections, but provide new ways to derive revenue from collections, and allow for commercial use of images, documents and other items that have been historically very hard to access.

			<p><em>01 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API that brings together geographic data from multiple sources, connects it with a standardized schema, and delivers it to developers through a single API. When pulling geo data from APIs, developer may not always get the most complete data, but they just deal with it, because we don't always have the time to pull data from multiple APIs. InfoChimps does this for developers, making it possible to have the best data from many sources. Once InfoChimps downloads the data from multiple sources, they tie the data together, making relationships and connections between disparate data, using the Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS). So no matter what the original data source is, there is a consistent, complete and expressive description of a collection of related data its associated assets. InfoChimps doesn't stop at downloading and standardizing access to this geo data, they also tackle displaying potentially large volumes of data. When you look at data from a large geographic region, the amount of data to display for users can very large. Developers are faced with questions of how to group and summarize for display. The Infochimps Geo API provides a summarizer feature that will group data based on intelligent clusters, making the data easier to display, and more meaningful. Next InfoChimps also provides multiple ways to query geo data, allowing developers to query based upon latitude and longitude, as well as other geographic locators like street address, bounding box or any dimension that can be mapped back to a location. This type of geo data querying opens up a whole new ways for developers to empower their users to discover. Then if aggregating from multiple sources, providing a standardized schema, intelligent summaries, and multiple query options wasn't enough, they are also pushing the traditional notions of what is geo data. They've included Wikipedia articles as sources, and opened up the possibility for tying any data set to a location, using the Infochimps...[<a href="/2011/09/01/centralized-geo-data-with-new-infochimps-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>I finally made some time to write up a review of the new Infochimps Geo API, and I think their approach gives us a glimpse at the future of data APIs.
With the new Infochimps Geo API, Infochimps provides some very important features for developers:

Aggregation of data from multiple sources
Tying together with a simple schema
Intelligent clustering and summarization
Provide a flexible query interface
Allow linking with other data sets

These are all problems developers face when working with Geo data, but they are also problems that are encountered when working with other data sets.
The future of delivering data via APIs is not just about providing access to the data via a simple RESTful interface (though that is a great start). It is also about actually solving the common problems developers face when integrating the data into their applications.
I think InfoChimps approach provides a model for other data APIs, and shows they have a viable business model that makes them more than just a data marketplace.

Along with the SSL switch they are letting developers know they will also be eventuallydeprecatingBasic Auth for the Twitter Streaming API, and encouraging everyone to use OAuth.
SSL and OAuth are fast becoming standards for APIs, and it seems wise to implement with the first version of the API, rather than having to force developers to switch down the road.

			<h3><a href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/">Paid Version of Google Translate API</a></h3>
			<p><em>25 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Back in May Googledeprecatedthe free version of the Google Translate API, and pissed off a lot of people along the way. I talked about building your business around Google or any other APIs, and even suggested that Google offer a paid version of the API instead of just shutting down.
Today Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API that provides a programmatic interface to access Google's machine translation technology, supporting translations in over 50 languages.
The paid version of Google Translate API costs $20 per million (M) characters of text translated (or approximately $0.05/page, assuming 500 words/page), and allows up to 50 M chars/month.
Google has give a limit of 100K chars / day until 12/1/2011 for developers who had already created projects in the API console that used the Translate API version 2 prior to today.
It sounds like Google has decided on a solid business model that will keep the translation API alive, and allow developers to commercially integrate the service into their applications. Google Tranlsate API is now integrated into the Google API Console, and is now one of four Google APIs that have pricing / billing frameworks to support them.
Google could have done a better PR job by deprecating the free version of the API at the same time as offering a paid version, but I think Google is trying to figure out how to manage and monetize their APIs just like the rest of us.

			<p><em>24 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I was just reading a post at Mindtouch on having conditional documentation using MindTouch TCS. MindTouch TCS is a social knowledge-base, that can be used in building help systems and support communities.
The post made me think about the API space and smart API documentation like Posterous, and Masherys new I/O docs for APIs. These are all approaches to making documentation more intelligent and personalized to whoever is reading the documentation.
Masherys I/O docs, and smart API documentation allow developers to make API calls from within the documentation, making learning about APIs more interactive. This is a great approach to help developers learn about APIs, but I think we can go even further.
Can we make API documentation even more personalized? Can my API documentation know which language I'm using? Can code samples be in my native language? Should the documentation automatically know whether I'm making a web or mobile app?
The information needed to make the documentation smarter could be gathered when developers apply for an application key. Then documentation can then be dynamically tailored specifically for each application.
Quality API documenation is a huge stumbling point for many developers. How can we make documentation better meet developers needs? Where else can we personalize the APIdocumentationexperience?

			<p><em>24 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I just finished the NYTimes article, United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals. This follows Alaska Airlines adopting the iPad, and Delta Airlines testing the iPad as a viable alternative to on-board manuals.
I don't think of the iPad as enterprise tool. It is a consumer tool, so this type of large scale adoption of the iPad at United, Alaska and potentially Delta says a lot. These major companies have made decisions that tablets, more specifically the iPad, and mobile applications are the future of their business operations.
These applications are driven by APIs. APIs provide the flight, weather and other real-time information that drive these mobile applications, and make the iPad a viable tool in the cockpit.
The growth in APIs over the last 6 years has been driven by social media and cloud computing, and more recently the iPhone and Android led mobile revolution. A large portion of these movements are driven by a grassroots, consumer dominated user base, outside of the traditional IT ranks. Mainstream enterprise and business IT are just now waking up to the potential of the social, and mobile Internet operating in the clouds, and the role APIs play in this.
It shows that the enterprise are coming around, and APIs aren't just the latest trend, and more companies will be deploying systems and devices that depend on APIs, to get business done.

			<p><em>16 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>We hear about the struggles of newspapers, magazines, and book publishers to stay relevant in the digital age on almost a daily basis these days. Many of these publishers are sitting on a treasure chest of content, but are unable to understand how to unlock them -- to make the content accessible in a way that allows them to retain control, adhere to existing licensing agreements, and make money in a world quickly being dominated by the iPad and Kindle. For those of us who live and breathe APIs, its easy for us to understand the power of a simple RESTful interace when it comes to content, but for publishing dinosaurs, it is much harder. I wrote a post back in May about the publishing company Pearson, looking to unlock their content with a new API platform. Pearson made good on their promise, and launched the Pearson Plug &amp; Play Platform at the end of July. The platform includes three content APIs: DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide API: Provides information about hotels, restaurants, bars and shops in London, plus insider tips on everything from where to find the best markets and traditional pubs to great attractions for children. Financial Times (FT) Press API: Provides access to over 500 articles on business, management, marketing and science from award winning authors who deliver timely and authoritative content. Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API: Rich multimedia dictionary containing over 230,000 words, phrases and meanings plus examples and pronunciations as MP3 and pictures. At first glance these APIs may not seem like much. There are other travel, business, and dictionary APIs available already. But for a publishing power house like Pearson, this is a big move. These APIs will provide a model for how the publisher prepares, gives access, controls and monetizes content for any new material as well as their vast archives, in the future. Take a look at the DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide. You can purchase...[<a href="/2011/08/16/reinventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm always on the lookout for innovative data sets and examples of APIs that provide value in ever-day life. APIs are often a very geeky thing, and I'm always trying to find examples of APIs that make sense to my mainstream audience, and help me explain what APIs are, and the value they can deliver.
I found a story from John Mertens of Code for America, about building a Famers Market API, which I think tells a great story about how anyone with a need, can take a valuable dataset and make it available using an API.
Like many of us Mertens loves getting his fruit and vegetables from a local Farmers Market. He was new to the San Francisco area and was unsure how to find the local Farmers Market. After Googling he found the USDA web site which has a great web application to search for Farmers Markets in the United States. It is a great tool, and they also allow you todownload a spreadsheet of the data, but there is no API to build an application on.
So being a data geek (I totally understand), Merts felt compelled to liberate this data using an API, which he build using a couple of freely available technologies:

     Exported the Famers Market dataset using the USDA export to excel
     
     Normalized the data using Google Refine
     
     Uploaded it to a free couchdb instance
     
     Added a map using the open-source geocouch-utils CouchApp
     
Mertens did all this for free. The data was freely available, the tools he used are free, and the hosting of the API is free as well. I'm not sure I'd depend on his API for commercial purposes, but it is a great demonstration how take a data-set and publish as an API, to fill a specific niche.
Now anyone can build an application around Farmers Market data using his Farmers Market API.

			<p>Google just put up a new Google+ Platform blog today, to support the growing demand around their new social platform.
Developers have been waiting for the release of the Google+ API, so they can get to work building Google+ applications. While Google did put up aGoogle+ developers signup form, there has been no other word about access to the Google+ APIs.
Apparently, todays launch of games on Google+ represents the first wave of developers using the Google+ APIs. Google chose to release the Google+ API to a small number of gaming partners so they could experiment, gather feedback and work the kinks out of the Google+ APIs before releasing it into the wild.
It shows they are starting to allow developers into the Google+ APIs, but I am sure they are prioritizing their partners, and unless your a Zynga or a Popcap, I doubt you'll get early access.
It seems wise of Google to open up access to game developers first, after the major success of the Facebook API platform was around gaming.

			<p><em>10 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>With all of the technology available to us, the way we express ourselves online and interact between web applications is still in its infancy. The two most common examples of online interaction are the share and like, which are like grunts and groans in online expression. However they are a very ubiquitous form of showing how you feel about a news article, discussion, event, song, video and many other things we interact with every day. On my blog I can give users a couple of basic actions to interact with my posts: share, link, favorite, vote up and down. These are pretty basic actions in the grand vision of the Internet. Because of the popularity of Facebook, the like has become a common expression for the web. So how do we evolve beyond this homogenized, like based world we've created? Google and Mozilla are trying to evolve the actions available to us with the concept of Web Intents. Both companies are building this spec into their browsers, but Google seems to be taking it a step further with their Web Intents API. This web platform API will provide the same benefits of Android Intents, but better suited for web applications. With Web Intents, you will be able to connect your web app or site to a service with a couple lines of code, and the browser will handle the rest. A web intent based application will let users request a generic action like share or like, triggering this action, and the user is presented with a list of registered apps that can handle the requested intent. When selected, the action is triggered, information passed, and the intended action is fulfilled. Web Intents will start with the usual of intent actions like edit, view, and share, but it will create a framework allowing new types of web intents to evolve.

			<p><em>09 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Factual just launched a new API that will centralize how physical places are represented within Factual data-sets, and across 3rd party APIs, dubbed the Factual Crosswalk API.
Data about physical places is notoriously messy, and with number of providers, and the growing value of location based data, its only going to get messier. Factual is aiming to normalize places data across the web by providing a central ID to link individual entries across multiple data providers.
Using the Factual Crosswalk API you can retrieve a place by providing its Factual ID or any associated URL, either way you get a complete record from the Factual database, and URLs to its associated IDs and locations. The Factual Crosswalk API can be used to link to data across the Internet, as well as cleaning and standardizing local data sets.

Taking the lead in providing centralized storage and API for data-sets will help make Factual the goto place when looking for places data, and it will also make them a source when discovering multiple sources for places online.
The Factual Crosswalk API is free for now, and is only available in the United States, but they are looking to roll-out the service for 40+ countries in the near future. Factual has partnered with multiple data providers to create this centralized resource, and they are welcoming other providers to participate.

			<p><em>08 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Hackathons are becoming a popular vehicle worldwide for identifying talent, sharing ideas, tackling big data, building apps, and providing a forum for developers, graphic designers and business minds to network.
Hackthons were born out of the Silicon Valley start-up scene. During these events, companies bring together a group of developers, give them a coding target, allow them to break into teams where they build a plan and hack together apps, mobile apps, and other web services that meet the criteria of the event.
Hackathons are now being held in Seattle, Los Angeles, London, Paris, New York and beyond. Other start-up groups and incubators have seen the value in holding these coding events and bringing together the best minds in their community, hoping to bring attention to their event on the world wide tech scene.
The success of hackathons as an innovation vehicle is spreading beyond general coding and the start-up community. There are hackathons coming up for photos, water, sustainability, health, government and I just finished covering Hacking Education, an event hosted by DonorsChoose.org, to challenged developers to create apps and data visualizations with the its API that would engage the public and have an impact on education.
Its exciting to see Hackathons being used outside of Silicon Valley. I would like to see the Hackathon format evolve and be applied to other areas, like manufacturing, real estate, mining, livestock, farming and beyond. Hackathons hold a lot of power in bringing together talented minds and ideas, and creating a fertile environment for innovation to occur.
It's important to remember that the technology produced at Hackathons is not always the most important outcome of these events. It's about bringing together the right minds and sharing ideas that can result in people going back to their everyday life with a new perspective and can encourage them to make a real impact in their daily lives.
What industries would most benefit from holding Hackathons?

			<p><em>05 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I've written about the essential building blocks necessary for a successful API, and there are other great posts like, What Developers Say About API Documentation from Peter Gruenbaum of SDK Bridge.
Everyone seems pretty unanimous that a RESTful API, with simple and complete documentation, qualitiy code samples in the popular languages, and real API support from the owner and the community are the ingredients for a successful API.
Iparticipatedin a chat about APIs on Twitter, where amix of API influencers, owners, advocates, evangelists and developers hung out for about an hour, answering questions posed by @retailigence. Overall there were about seven questions asked, but the second one was simple, and thought provoking:
What is the most important characteristic of an API?
The common building blocks were rattled off (by myself included): REST, quality documentation, code samples, while other said more innovative things like API explorer or Masherys I/O Docs. Then @infochimps said reliability &amp; usefulness.
This started some side conversations and got me thinking. Does the overall value an API deliver and its reliability trump its RESTfulness, documentation and available code samples?
I would say definitely, yes! It is true that a RESTful API, with simple and clear documentation, and code samples are a must have. But if your API doesn't offer clear value and reliably deliver on this value, no amount of documentation or code samples is going to work.
These are all pretty basic concepts at first glance, but it is a reminder where to focus your resources when it comes to your API.

			<p>I was just working on a piece for ProgrammableWeb about the new Yahoo WebPlayer, which is amedia player that can play video and audio from any site or service, and be distributed across the web.
While browsing around the Yahoo WebPlayer site I came to the Terms of Service, which I found three items that stand out:
Yahoo! can update and change this Agreement and TOS by posting a new version without notice to you.
You understand and agree that the Player may allow for advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Yahoo! to provide the Player for your use.
Yahoo! Media Player is free, but Yahoo! reserves the right to charge fees for future use of or access to the Player at Yahoo!'s sole discretion.
I think these are pretty standard rules of the road that us publishers and developers are getting used when integrating with APIs and deploying gadgets, widgets and other embeddable tools. But they don't give us much build upon, as a content publisher, or developer trying to build a business.
I cannot see into the future, and I understand the problems providers face, but these terms seem pretty wide open, in favor of the provider. What can we do to make terms of services (TOS) for APIs and other tools more in support of the community a provider is targeting with these services?
I don't have the answers, just asking the question. This bizdev 2.0 stuff is a lot harder than we anticipated.

			<p><em>03 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Each day Federal agencies publish documents in the Federal Register. These documents include proposed rules, final rules, public notices, and Presidential actions. The print-based version of the Federal Register can be difficult to read, process and access, so the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), who all joined forces to launch the FederalRegister.gov website, also deployed an API. The goal of the initiative was to make it even easier for developers to build new ways of interacting with Federal Register data, making it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in the Government decision-making process. The Federal Register API is RESTful, with no keys required for authentication and responses in a JSON format. They even provide a simple JSON interface for callbacks. All data in the Federal Register is updated daily by 6 a.m., and is published Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, and consists of four types of entries: Presidential Documents - Executive orders and proclamations Rules and Regulations - Policy statements and interpretations of rules Proposed Rules - Petitions for rulemaking and other advance proposals Notices - Scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public, grant applications, administrative orders, and other announcements of government actions The Federal Register API is meant to deliver print-based material in machine-readable formats, to make the Federal Register more searchable, accessible, easier to digest, and easier to share withother systems. The Federal Registers, encourages every citizen to become more involved in the workings of their government and to make their voices heard on the things that matter to them, from the smallest to the largest issues.

			<p><em>02 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Last week at OSCON, I wrote about Mashery's release of their new I/O Docs. Mashery I/O Docs are a combination of API documentation and an API explorer, allowing developers to make requests on an API inline while browsing the API reference materials.
I/O Docs provides an interactive documentation system for RESTful web APIs. By defining APIs at the resource, method and parameter levels in a JSON schema, I/O Docs will generate a JavaScript client interface. API calls can be executed directly from the documentation interface, proxied through the I/O Docs server, producing formatted responses.
Mashery has open-sourced a version of the I/O Docs on Github, for any API owner to deploy for their own documentation. This version of I/O docs runs on Node.js and uses Redis as a data store.
Last year Apigee launched their API console which allows users to also make calls against an API, and earlier this year they made it freely available for any API owner to deploy. The API console is a popular tool with developers to get up and going using an API, and build an understanding how an API works. Apigees move to make free was a significant market play, and definitely built awareness of their platform.
Masherys approach to API exploration reflects an alternative view from Apigees, one that integrates API discovery with API documentation, as opposed to being an entirely separate tool. Masherys move to open-source their I/O Docs on Github, is great to see. I'm sure it will definitely attract more attention to their platform and tools.
You can download or fork the Mashery I/O Docs on Github, and find necessary installation info and documentation.
