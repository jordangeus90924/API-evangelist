{% include JB/setup %}<p>Here we are, wrapping up 2011.I concluded my first full year immersed in the business of APIs, which started back in September 2010 with my first blog post on API Evangelist, then by December I was the API Evangelist for Mimeo.In 2011, I spent the entire year evangelizing for Mimeo, while also paying attention to the wider business of APIs, while writing for ProgrammableWeb and API Evangelist.It’s been an amazing year and I’ve learned a lot, but it has left me wanting even more in 2012.I’m convinced that focusing my evangelism on a single API is important, it helps put into practice, what I write about as an analyst in the API space.</p>
