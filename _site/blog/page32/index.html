        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/09/09/a-flood-of-apis-just-waiting-to-happen/">A Flood of APIs Just Waiting to Happen</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/water-drop.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5108589599840343">Someone asked me about APIs dealing with water and utilities a couple weeks ago.  So I dove in to see what I could find related to APIs for city, county and state water management.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>First I came cross, what sees like a pretty good model for city water services with the <a title="Wellington NZ City Water Service Pipes" href="http://www.data.govt.nz/dataset/show/2115">Wellington NZ City Water Service Pipes</a>.  The Wellington Water Service API provides programmatic access to water and drainage data to assist in planning works that are in proximity to water and drainage infrastructure.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Next the Emery Water Conservancy District in central Utah provides sensor data from weather, canal, reservoir, pond and river monitoring sites via the <a title="MetriDyne API" href="http://www.ewcd.org/about/metridyne-api/">MetriDyne API</a>.  The <a title="MetriDyne API" href="/apis/metridyne_api.php">MetriDyne API</a> provides immediate access to data from these sites, leading to better and timely information leads to better water management.</span><br />
     <br />
     <a title="Water and Environmental Hub" href="/apis/water_and_environmental_hub_api.php"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/api/The-Water-and-Environment-Hub.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><span>Then in Canada there is a pretty interesting initiative to create an open source web platform that will aggregate, federate, and connect water data and information enabling users to access, mashup, analyze, model and interpret water data, information, issues and opportunities, called the <a title="Water and Environmental Hub" href="/apis/water_and_environmental_hub_api.php">Water and Environmental Hub</a>.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>That was really it, when it came to water related APIs.  They are all three really great models when it comes to looking at the future of water management using APIs. I would throw in another API i found from NASA called the MODAPS Web Services which provides an API to access the data products provided by the Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), providing programmatic access to atmosphere, weather and ocean data.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>There are also some software solutions for water, energy and utility management that include APIs:</span>
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="ArcFM Solution Overview" href="http://www.telvent-gis.com/products/">ArcFM Solution Overview</a></strong> - maintenance of electric, gas, fiber optic, water and wastewater facility
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="WaterObjects.NET" href="http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/WaterGEMS/WaterObjects.NET-Bentley.htm">WaterObjects.NET</a></strong> - Gives you complete and programmatic access to Bentley’s water modeling technology, from numerical methods and water modeling capabilities to mapping, data management, and result presentation features
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <span>Beyond data and software for water management, there is the water, weather and environmental device and API company HoboLink, which has the <a title="HoboLink Web Services API" href="http://www.onsetcomp.com/hobolink-web-services-hlws">HOBOlink® Web Services API</a>, an API that enables anyone to easily integrate energy and environmental data from the comapny's devices.  Think of the future here, with millions of devices tracking weather, water and our environment.</span><br />
     <br />
     <a href="http://www.onsetcomp.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hobolink/hobo_u30_weatherstation.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a><span>Although its not just environmental monitoring devices that foretell this flood of water management APIs.  When you take a moment to look at the amount of water related data available on the web, there is a clear sign of the potential growth in need for water management APIs.  Take a look at the <a title="California Department of Water Resources" href="http://www.water.ca.gov/waterdatalibrary/index.cfm">California Department of Water Resources</a>, Water Data Library.  You can find datasets on water quality, groundwater levels and snow pack in near real-time or as historical data.   You can query the data on their site, but there is no real API for pulling, parsing and crunching this data to build mobile and web applications and data visualizations.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Water is essential to not just the future of business, but humanity.  The need to manage water in real-time is only going to grow, and there are tremendous opportunities for API deployment in this space when it comes to water and utility management at the city, county, state and federal level.</span>

        <div><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/matrix-pics/washington-crossing-the-delaware-cropped.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /><span id="internal-source-marker_0.13283396931365132">Have you ever tried to get data from a government agencies website? &nbsp;Often, when you find what your looking for, its in a PDF format. &nbsp;Not really a data friendly format. &nbsp;If your lucky, you will find a spreadsheet, but usually they are laid out in a report format and not meant for actual data portability.</span><br /><br /><span>I have a personal obsession for finding, crunching and making sense out of local, state, and federal government data. &nbsp;I'm willing to do a lot of work to derive meaning about how our government works. &nbsp;I personally feel its my duty to lend a hand, but while doing so, I often get overwhelmed parsing PDF files and often have to rearrange data by hand, or just give up on my project entirely.</span><br /><br /><span>I've always blamed the the "government bureaucracy for this--it is some sort of conspiracy to hide what is really going on. However, recently I'm beginning to change my tune. &nbsp;I'm getting a feeling that maybe it goes deeper then with government operations. &nbsp;Its the technology they are given. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>While trying to understand more about the technology our government uses, I came across a <a title="post by Matt MacDonald" href="http://www.mattmacdonald.com/">post by Matt MacDonald</a>. &nbsp;Matt is trying to get data from his local town of <a title="Watertown, MA" href="http://www.ci.watertown.ma.us/">Watertown, MA</a>. &nbsp;After looking around he encountered the same issues. &nbsp;All he could get were PDFs and Excel "reports", which seems to be the common language of government when comes to data portability.</span><br /><br /><span>After not getting what he was looking for he went to the source, the company that built the tools his town used, <a title="TylerTech" href="http://www.tylertech.com/">TylerTech</a>. &nbsp;TylerTech builds systems for municipalities to manage services ranging from property taxes to school information systems.</span><br /><br /><span>Matt reached out to TylerTech, and asked whether or not they had an API for their systems available for their town, but he&rsquo;s just gotten a couple cookie cutter responses, and no real information. &nbsp;&nbsp;I reached out to TylerTech for comment on this story, and have not received a response.</span><br /><br /><span>As I said I'm changing my tune about who is to blame. &nbsp;The average government or school administration can only work with what is given to them. &nbsp;In the case of Watertown, its Munis from TylerTech.</span><br /><br /><span><a title="TylerTech" href="http://www.tylertech.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/tylertech-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>TylerTech is 50 year old company with almost 300 Million in annual revenue, servicing a number of cities across the country. &nbsp;The only mention of an API on the TylerTech site is part of their Eagle Product Suite:</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>&nbsp;</span><em><br /></em><em>Eagle Software is engineered with XML Web Services in mind &mdash; unlike many systems, where XML transactions are an afterthought. Taking advantage of open standards, WSDL and SOAP, Eagle Software can expose a robust API &mdash; simplifying external system integration with Java, .NET, VB, C++, C#, COBOL and others.</em></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Without talking with TylerTech this appears to be an add-on suite, and not a standard offering. &nbsp;Web Services need to be brought into the foreground, and made standard in all installations. &nbsp;Not an afterthought, or add-on.</span><br /><br /><span>When it comes to public data we need to have a high standard, and we need to expect more out of the technology that is purchased with our tax dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;In this time time of economic crisis our municipalities are already overburdened with doing their regular job, they can't be expected to to do extra work, and even better, they could use the help of citizens like myself and Matt, who want to help make sense of data, build apps, and help make government more efficient.</span><br /><br /><span><a title="Watertown, MA" href="http://www.ci.watertown.ma.us/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/watertown-ma-sign.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>We can't do it without access to the right data, and APIs are the perfect way for the government to share data in real-time. &nbsp;They need to be given tools and training that allow them share and publish data in real-time without extra effort. &nbsp;PDF is not Portable Data Format...its a Portable Document Format. &nbsp;XML export is a start, but it still just an export....its not an API. &nbsp;With an API, municipalities can share data with the public in a self-service way, that still allows the government to understand who is accessing data, and how they are using it.</span><br /><br /><span>I look to technology companies like <a title="TylerTech" href="http://www.tylertech.com/">TylerTech</a> to lead, and provide our government with the tools they need to open data, and let the rest of the tech community build web and mobile applications for the government, and crunch data to help them be more efficient, and make the most of taxpayers money.</span></div>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/09/05/virtualized-document-printing-apis/">Virtualized Document Printing APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.mimeo.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>Even though I cover the entire industry around APIs here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I also am the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mimeo is a printing API that allows you to print a wide variety of business documents, using your Mimeo.com account. &nbsp;Its pretty powerful stuff, if you think about it, an API that is connected to 3 print facilities. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The API seems pretty straightforward at first glance, but developers seem to be encountering three major obstacles:</span></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Mimeo.com Accounts</strong> - Users don&rsquo;t like having to get a developer account as well as sandbox and live Mimeo.com accounts to work with the API</li>
<li><strong>Mimeo Documents</strong> - Developers don&rsquo;t really have time to build and define the documents before integration, they just want to print a specific document, and pass some settings to change it up.</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox and Live Environments </strong>- It is great that Mimeo has sandbox and live environments, but developers were expected to maintain two separate environments, just to use the system.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/wiki/poster-printing-api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/posters-sample.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a> <span>These three areas proved to be the difference between some users adopting, and others walking away. &nbsp;There was too much work in navigating the world of Mimeo accounts and documents. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t hard if your already a Mimeo web to print user, but if your a developer you just want to print. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>So I created four virtualized print APIs. &nbsp;&nbsp;I took a REST framework and deployed four separate &ldquo;<a title="Document Printing APIs" href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/">document printing APIs</a>&rdquo;:</span></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Poster Printing API" href="../../2011/09/05/api-stack-large-format-printing-with-the-mimeo-connect-poster-printing-api/">Poster Printing API</a></li>
<li><a title="Flyer &amp; Brochure Printing API" href="../../2011/09/05/api-stack-single-sheet-printing-with-the-mimeo-connect-flyer-&amp;-brochure-printing-api/">Flyer &amp; Brochure Printing API</a></li>
<li><a title="Card Printing API" href="../../2011/09/05/api-stack-card-printing-with-the-mimeo-connect-card-printing-api/">Card Printing API</a></li>
<li><a title="Spiral Notebook API" href="../../2011/09/05/api-stack-bound-document-printing-with-the-mimeo-connect-spiral-notebook-printing-api/">Spiral Notebook API</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Then using <a title="3Scale API Management Solution" href="../../serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale self-service API management solution</a> I deployed an API area to handle documentation, forum and developer registration and API key management. &nbsp;Each API has seven methods for ordering print documents:</span></p>

<p>This will give me an agile way to play around with new configurations of APIs, measure their response using the <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale API</a> analytics, and decide whether or not I put more resources into an specific type of API.</p>

<p><span>I now had a simple RESTful API, that had self-service documentation, app key registration, forum, and support. &nbsp;I received emails when new developers registered, could track how much they used, and turn off access when needed.</span><br /><br /><span>I was open for business, using the CodeIgniter tools as a RESTful framework and 3Scale as API management solution I was able to deploy and manage my APIs on an existing Amazon EC2 instance for free, with minimal work, and the platform will scale as my APIs get more usage.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="National Archives" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/uk-national-archives-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>The <a title="National Archives" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/">National Archives</a> has <a title="published a new API" href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2011/09/02/247784/National-Archives-releases-public-application-programming-interface-for-11m.htm">published a new API</a>, as part of an ongoing program to get more public records online, according to <a title="ComputerWeekly.com" href="http://www.computerweekly.com">ComputerWeekly.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
     The <a title="National Archives API" href="http://labs.nationalarchives.gov.uk/wordpress/index.php/2011/09/the-national-archives-api/">National Archives API</a> provides programmatic access to over 11 million records from the discovery service catalogue, broken down into a seven-level hierarchical structure:
</p>
<ul>
     <li>Department - Government department, agency or body that creates the records
     </li>
     <li>Division - Administrative section of a department
     </li>
     <li>Series - The main grouping of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Sub sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Piece - A piece can be a box, volume or file
     </li>
     <li>Item - A part of a piece. It can be a bundle, a single document, a sub-file, etc.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Access is provided without restriction or charging for content, but costs $3.50 per document to retrieve the same records online through the website.
</p>
<p>
     Aleksandr Drozdov, architect for the National Archives, said they have been speaking with academic historians to help them find ways to use the API in their research, and they are very interested in access to the archives in a programmatic way.
</p>
<p>
     According to Computer Weekly the National Archives is also working an e-commerce system. Since private companies have been paying the National Archives 52M since 2002 for the digitization of paper records they could then resell through websites, the API and associated e-commerce system are a perfect fit.
</p>
<p>
     The move by the National Archive may prove a great model for other institutions to not only open up access to their collections, but provide new ways to derive revenue from collections, and allow for commercial use of images, documents and other items that have been historically very hard to access.

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API" href="http://blog.infochimps.com/2011/08/30/geo-api/">Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API</a> that brings together geographic data from multiple sources, connects it with a standardized schema, and delivers it to developers through a single API.</p>
<p>When pulling geo data from APIs, developer may not always get the most complete data, but they just deal with it, because we don't always have the time to pull data from multiple APIs. InfoChimps does this for developers, making it possible to have the best data from many sources.</p>
<p>Once InfoChimps downloads the data from multiple sources, they tie the data together, making relationships and connections between disparate data, using the Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS). So no matter what the original data source is, there is a consistent, complete and expressive description of a collection of related data its associated assets.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-geo-api-map.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />InfoChimps doesn't stop at downloading and standardizing access to this geo data, they also tackle displaying potentially large volumes of data. When you look at data from a large geographic region, the amount of data to display for users can very large. Developers are faced with questions of how to group and summarize for display. The Infochimps Geo API provides a summarizer feature that will group data based on intelligent clusters, making the data easier to display, and more meaningful.</p>
<p>Next InfoChimps also provides multiple ways to query geo data, allowing developers to query based upon latitude and longitude, as well as other geographic locators like street address, bounding box or any dimension that can be mapped back to a location. This type of geo data querying opens up a whole new ways for developers to empower their users to discover.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/geo_api_chart.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />Then if aggregating from multiple sources, providing a standardized schema, intelligent summaries, and multiple query options wasn't enough, they are also pushing the traditional notions of what is geo data. They've included Wikipedia articles as sources, and opened up the possibility for tying any data set to a location, using the <a title="Infochimps Geo API" href="http://infochimps.com/apis/geo">Infochimps Geo API</a>.</p>
<p>InfoChimps approach to the Geo API, shows they just get it. They aren't just pushing data sets via an API because data is valuable, like I see with other data marketplaces and API providers. They are actually solving data problems for developers and actually enriching our mobile and web apps with quality geo data, and making a better user experience.</p>

<p>With the new <a title="Infochimps Geo API" href="http://www.infochimps.com/apis/geo">Infochimps Geo API</a>, Infochimps provides some very important features for developers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Aggregation of data from multiple sources</li>
<li>Tying together with a simple schema</li>
<li>Intelligent clustering and summarization</li>
<li>Provide a flexible query interface</li>
<li>Allow linking with other data sets</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all problems developers face when working with Geo data, but they are also problems that are encountered when working with other data sets.</p>
<p>The future of delivering data via APIs is not just about providing access to the data via a simple RESTful interface (though that is a great start). It is also about actually solving the common problems developers face when integrating the data into their applications.</p>
<p>I think InfoChimps approach provides a model for other data APIs, and shows they have a viable business model that makes them more than just a data marketplace.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Aug 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Google-Translate.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />Back in May <a title="Google deprecated the free version of the Google Translate API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/spring-cleaning-for-some-of-our-apis.html">Googledeprecatedthe free version of the Google Translate API</a>, and pissed off a lot of people along the way. I talked about <a title="building your business around Google or any other APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">building your business around Google or any other APIs</a>, and even suggested that Google offer a paid version of the API instead of just shutting down.<p></p>
Today <a title="Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/08/paid-version-of-google-translate-api.html">Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API</a> that provides a programmatic interface to access Google's machine translation technology, supporting translations in over 50 languages.<p></p>
The paid version of <a title="Google Translate API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/">Google Translate API</a> costs $20 per million (M) characters of text translated (or approximately $0.05/page, assuming 500 words/page), and allows up to 50 M chars/month.<p></p>
Google has give a limit of 100K chars / day until 12/1/2011 for developers who had already created projects in the API console that used the Translate API version 2 prior to today.<p></p>
It sounds like Google has decided on a solid business model that will keep the translation API alive, and allow developers to commercially integrate the service into their applications. Google Tranlsate API is now integrated into the <a title="Google API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Google API Console</a>, and is now one of four Google APIs that have pricing / billing frameworks to support them.<p></p>
Google could have done a better PR job by deprecating the free version of the API at the same time as offering a paid version, but I think Google is trying to figure out how to manage and monetize their APIs just like the rest of us.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/mindtouch-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I was just reading a post at Mindtouch on having <a title="conditional documentation using Mindtouch TCS" href="http://www.mindtouch.com/blog/2011/08/22/having-conditional-documentation-using-mindtouch-tcs/">conditional documentation using MindTouch TCS</a>. <a title="MindTouch TCS" href="http://www.mindtouch.com/products/mindtouch_tcs">MindTouch TCS</a> is a social knowledge-base, that can be used in building help systems and support communities.<p></p>
The post made me think about the API space and <a title="smart API documentation like Posterous" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/deploying-smarter-api-documentation/">smart API documentation like Posterous</a>, and <a title="Masherys new I/O docs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/02/mashery-open-sources-their-api-io-docs/">Masherys new I/O docs for APIs</a>. These are all approaches to making documentation more intelligent and personalized to whoever is reading the documentation.<p></p>
<a title="Masherys I/O docs" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/26/mashery-delivers-smarter-api-documentation/">Masherys I/O docs</a>, and smart API documentation allow developers to make API calls from within the documentation, making learning about APIs more interactive. This is a great approach to help developers learn about APIs, but I think we can go even further.<p></p>
Can we make API documentation even more personalized? Can my API documentation know which language I'm using? Can code samples be in my native language? Should the documentation automatically know whether I'm making a web or mobile app?<p></p>
The information needed to make the documentation smarter could be gathered when developers apply for an application key. Then documentation can then be dynamically tailored specifically for each application.<p></p>
Quality API documenation is a huge stumbling point for many developers. How can we make documentation better meet developers needs? Where else can we personalize the APIdocumentationexperience?

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ipad-in-the-cockpit.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I just finished the NYTimes article, <a title="United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/united-airlines-to-give-all-pilots-ipad-flight-manuals/">United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals</a>.

I don't think of the iPad as enterprise tool. It is a consumer tool, so this type of large scale adoption of the iPad at United, Alaska and potentially Delta says a lot. These major companies have made decisions that tablets, more specifically the iPad, and mobile applications are the future of their business operations.<p></p>
These applications are driven by APIs. APIs provide the flight, weather and other real-time information that drive these mobile applications, and make the iPad a viable tool in the cockpit.<p></p>
The growth in APIs over the last 6 years has been driven by social media and cloud computing, and more recently the iPhone and Android led mobile revolution. A large portion of these movements are driven by a grassroots, consumer dominated user base, outside of the traditional IT ranks. Mainstream enterprise and business IT are just now waking up to the potential of the social, and mobile Internet operating in the clouds, and the role APIs play in this.<p></p>
It shows that the enterprise are coming around, and APIs aren't just the latest trend, and more companies will be deploying systems and devices that depend on APIs, to get business done.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/reinventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">Re-inventing Pearson Publishing using APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2011</span>
        <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pearson/Pearson-Plug-And-Play-API-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>We hear about the struggles of newspapers, magazines, and book publishers to stay relevant in the digital age on almost a daily basis these days. Many of these publishers are sitting on a treasure chest of content, but are unable to understand how to unlock them -- to make the content accessible in a way that allows them to retain control, adhere to existing licensing agreements, and make money in a world quickly being dominated by the iPad and Kindle.<p></p>
For those of us who live and breathe APIs, its easy for us to understand the power of a simple RESTful interace when it comes to content, but for publishing dinosaurs, it is much harder. I wrote a post back in May about the <a title="publishing company Pearson, looking to unlock their content with a new API platform" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">publishing company Pearson, looking to unlock their content with a new API platform</a>. Pearson made good on their promise, and launched the <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Plug &amp; Play Platform</a> at the end of July. The platform includes three content APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pearson/Pearson-Plug-And-Play-API-iphone-app.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><strong><a title="DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/Eyewitness%2520Guide%2520to%2520London/List%2520Guide%2520Entries%2520in%2520Category/overview">DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide API</a>:</strong> Provides information about hotels, restaurants, bars and shops in London, plus insider tips on everything from where to find the best markets and traditional pubs to great attractions for children.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Financial Times (FT) Press API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/FT%2520Press/List%2520All%2520Books/overview">Financial Times (FT) Press API</a>:</strong> Provides access to over 500 articles on business, management, marketing and science from award winning authors who deliver timely and authoritative content.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/Longman%2520Dictionary/Get%2520Entry/overview">Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API</a>:</strong> Rich multimedia dictionary containing over 230,000 words, phrases and meanings plus examples and pronunciations as MP3 and pictures.</li>
</ul>
At first glance these APIs may not seem like much. There are other travel, business, and dictionary APIs available already. But for a publishing power house like Pearson, this is a big move. These APIs will provide a model for how the publisher prepares, gives access, controls and monetizes content for any new material as well as their vast archives, in the future.<p></p>
Take a look at the DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide. You can purchase the guide and other related information on the <a title="TravelDK / London Website" href="http://traveldk.com/london">TravelDK / London website</a>, a model which has obviously proven lucrative for the company. But it is still a pretty limited way to monetize your content. With an API the travel guide information is available as a database, allowing other publishers and app developers to access just the information they need to create rich user experiences on the web, tablets and mobile phones. While the printed travel guide provided a great model for the last couple decades, the monetization opportunities through an API are only limited by the imagination of app developers.<p></p>
APIs shed light, and provide access to content in ways that printed formats never could. Consumers can now access just a chapter, paragraph, sentence or a single photo from content without buying the whole book. Publishers can open up this access, while still maintaining control, and create entirely new ways of making money off entire collections or just the parts and pieces of their archives.<p></p>
I'm always skeptical of larger companies when it comes to understanding how to leverage the power of APIs, but from what I see, the Pearson Plug &amp; Play team has done a great job with their pioneering efforts in this space. They launched the essential building blocks for their API community using <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, providing the basic tools developers are used to when working with an API. The team also launched with a diverse set of APIs that not only provide valuable content to developers, but also gives Pearson a good place to practice when it comes to serving up content via an API.<p></p>
What the Pearson Plug &amp; Play team is doing can't be easy, I imagine they are up against some seriously entrenched management not just at Pearson, but with their network of partners as well. I will be keeping any eye on the <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Plug &amp; Play Platform</a>, and see what lessons we can pull from what they are doing with their innovative content APIs.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/08/13/united-states-farmers-market-api/">United States Farmers Market API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Farmers-Market-Data-US-Map.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I'm always on the lookout for innovative data sets and examples of APIs that provide value in ever-day life. APIs are often a very geeky thing, and I'm always trying to find examples of APIs that make sense to my mainstream audience, and help me explain what APIs are, and the value they can deliver.
<p></p>I found a story from <a title="John Mertens" href="http://twitter.com/#!/@mertonium">John Mertens</a> of <a title="Code for America" href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>, about <a title="building a famers market Api" href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/08/08/farmers-market-api/">building a Famers Market API</a>, which I think tells a great story about how anyone with a need, can take a valuable dataset and make it available using an API.
<p></p>Like many of us Mertens loves getting his fruit and vegetables from a local Farmers Market. He was new to the San Francisco area and was unsure how to find the local Farmers Market. After Googling he found the <a title="USDA web site which has a great web-application for searching for famers markets in the US" href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/">USDA web site which has a great web application to search for Farmers Markets in the United States</a>. It is a great tool, and they also allow you todownload a spreadsheet of the data, but there is no API to build an application on.
<p></p>So being a data geek (I totally understand), Merts felt compelled to liberate this data using an API, which he build using a couple of freely available technologies:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Exported the Famers Market dataset using the USDA export to excel
     </li>
     <li>Normalized the data using <a title="Google Refine" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">Google Refine</a>
     </li>
     <li>Uploaded it to a <a title="free couchdb instance" href="http://iriscouch.com/">free couchdb instance</a>
     </li>
     <li>Added a map using the open-source <a title="geocouch-utils" href="https://github.com/maxogden/geocouch-utils">geocouch-utils</a> CouchApp
     </li>
</ul>Mertens did all this for free. The data was freely available, the tools he used are free, and the hosting of the API is free as well. I'm not sure I'd depend on his API for commercial purposes, but it is a great demonstration how take a data-set and publish as an API, to fill a specific niche.
<p></p>Now anyone can build an application around Farmers Market data using his <a title="Farmers Market API" href="http://usda.iriscouch.com/farmers_markets/_design/geo/_spatiallist/geojson/full?bbox=-122.61248930742187,37.655669842383595,-122.24788054277343,37.83240550745524">Farmers Market API</a>.

Developers have been waiting for the release of the Google+ API, so they can get to work building Google+ applications. While Google did put up a<a title="Google+ developers signup form" href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/plusdevelopers/">Google+ developers signup form</a>, there has been no other word about access to the Google+ APIs.<p></p>
Apparently, todays launch of games on Google+ represents the first wave of developers using the Google+ APIs. Google chose to release the Google+ API to a small number of gaming partners so they could experiment, gather feedback and work the kinks out of the Google+ APIs before releasing it into the wild.<p></p>
It shows they are starting to allow developers into the Google+ APIs, but I am sure they are prioritizing their partners, and unless your a Zynga or a Popcap, I doubt you'll get early access.<p></p>
It seems wise of Google to open up access to game developers first, after the major success of the Facebook API platform was around gaming.

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/chrome-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />With all of the technology available to us, the way we express ourselves online and interact between web applications is still in its infancy. The two most common examples of online interaction are the share and like, which are like grunts and groans in online expression. However they are a very ubiquitous form of showing how you feel about a news article, discussion, event, song, video and many other things we interact with every day.<p></p>
On my blog I can give users a couple of basic actions to interact with my posts: share, link, favorite, vote up and down. These are pretty basic actions in the grand vision of the Internet. Because of the popularity of Facebook, the like has become a common expression for the web. So how do we evolve beyond this homogenized, like based world we've created?<p></p>
<a title="Google and Mozilla are trying to evolve the actions available to us" href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/08/google-mozilla-team-up-to-create-a-smarter-action-based-web/">Google and Mozilla are trying to evolve the actions available to us</a> with the concept of <a title="Web Intents" href="http://www.webintents.com/">Web Intents</a>. Both companies are building this spec into their browsers, but <a title="Google seems to be taking it a step further with their Web Intents API" href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/08/connecting-web-apps-with-web-intents.html">Google seems to be taking it a step further with their Web Intents API</a>. This web platform API will provide the same benefits of <a title="Android Intents" href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters.html">Android Intents</a>, but better suited for web applications. With Web Intents, you will be able to connect your web app or site to a service with a couple lines of code, and the browser will handle the rest.<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/firefox/firefox-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />A web intent based application will let users request a generic action like share or like, triggering this action, and the user is presented with a list of registered apps that can handle the requested intent. When selected, the action is triggered, information passed, and the intended action is fulfilled.<p></p>
Web Intents will start with the usual of intent actions like edit, view, and share, but it will create a framework allowing new types of web intents to evolve. Google intends to build a site allowing the adding, viewing and curation of web intents and their corresponding actions, and build a community around web intents that will create a sort of marketplace of what can actions can occur on the web.<p></p>
This all reminds me somewhat of the online marketing term conversion event. When someone clicks off a Google Ad and ends up your site, you need to define a conversion event to measure if your Google Ad campaign is successful. The most common type of conversion event being a shopping cart purchase, but could be anything like newsletter sign-up, or even sharing a post to Twitter.

Web intents are the next generation of events that can occur on web sites and applications. These intents will often use services provided by other platforms and applications. The web intents will start simple, using what we know--share--and evolve into more complex forms of online expression like altering, mashing up, curation, and syndication.<p></p>
Web Intents will benefit everyone. It will allow users to perform more meaningful actions while using apps, and allow site owners to easily offer popular actions that users want, and app developers can offer a wider variety of actions and services from a range of providers, as well as enabling developers who are looking to specialize in web intent focused web services. Of course Google will be the big winner in this by providing a frawework to grow what actions can be taken across the Internet, they put themselves at the center when it comes to the next generation of actions, that replace the ones we know now, like search.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/factual/factual-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /><a title="Factual" href="http://www.factual.com">Factual</a> just launched a <a href="http://blog.factual.com/crosswalk-api">new API that will centralize how physical places are represented within Factual data-sets</a>, and across 3rd party APIs, dubbed the <a title="Factual Crosswalk API" href="http://developer.factual.com/display/docs/Places+API+-+Crosswalk">Factual Crosswalk API</a>.<p></p>
Data about physical places is notoriously messy, and with number of providers, and the growing value of location based data, its only going to get messier. Factual is aiming to normalize places data across the web by providing a central ID to link individual entries across multiple data providers.<p></p>
Using the Factual Crosswalk API you can retrieve a place by providing its Factual ID or any associated URL, either way you get a complete record from the Factual database, and URLs to its associated IDs and locations. The Factual Crosswalk API can be used to link to data across the Internet, as well as cleaning and standardizing local data sets.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1133424.js?file=place.json"></script>
Taking the lead in providing centralized storage and API for data-sets will help make Factual the goto place when looking for places data, and it will also make them a source when discovering multiple sources for places online.<p></p>
The <a title="Factual Crosswalk API" href="http://developer.factual.com/display/docs/Places+API+-+Crosswalk">Factual Crosswalk API</a> is free for now, and is only available in the United States, but they are looking to roll-out the service for 40+ countries in the near future. Factual has partnered with multiple data providers to create this centralized resource, and they are welcoming other providers to participate.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hackathons/Hackathon-Tag-Cloud-2.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><a title="Hackathons" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/hackathons-and-contests.php">Hackathons</a> are becoming a popular vehicle worldwide for identifying talent, sharing ideas, tackling big data, building apps, and providing a forum for developers, graphic designers and business minds to network.
<p></p>Hackthons were born out of the Silicon Valley start-up scene. During these events, companies bring together a group of developers, give them a coding target, allow them to break into teams where they build a plan and hack together apps, mobile apps, and other web services that meet the criteria of the event.
<p></p>Hackathons are now being held in Seattle, Los Angeles, London, Paris, New York and beyond. Other start-up groups and incubators have seen the value in holding these coding events and bringing together the best minds in their community, hoping to bring attention to their event on the world wide tech scene.
<p></p>The success of hackathons as an innovation vehicle is spreading beyond general coding and the start-up community. There are hackathons coming up for <a title="Photo Hack Day" href="http://photohackday.org/">photos</a>, <a title="Water Hackathon" href="http://www.rhok.org/event/water-hackathon">water</a>, <a title="Cleanweb Hackathon" href="http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/">sustainability</a>, <a title="Health 2.0's live code-a-thons" href="http://www.health2challenge.org/code-a-thon/">health</a>, <a title="Open Gov Hackathon" href="http://loqi.me/poll/geoloqi-hackathon-2010">government</a> and I just finished covering <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/13/hacking-education-with-donorschoose-org-contest/">Hacking Education</a>, an event hosted by <a href="http://www.DonorsChoose.org">DonorsChoose.org</a>, to challenged developers to create apps and data visualizations with the its API that would engage the public and have an impact on education.
<p></p>Its exciting to see Hackathons being used outside of Silicon Valley. I would like to see the Hackathon format evolve and be applied to other areas, like manufacturing, real estate, mining, livestock, farming and beyond. Hackathons hold a lot of power in bringing together talented minds and ideas, and creating a fertile environment for innovation to occur.
<p></p>It's important to remember that the technology produced at Hackathons is not always the most important outcome of these events. It's about bringing together the right minds and sharing ideas that can result in people going back to their everyday life with a new perspective and can encourage them to make a real impact in their daily lives.
<p></p>What industries would most benefit from holding Hackathons?

        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Code-Value-Reliability.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I've written about the <a title="essential building blocks necessary a successful API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential building blocks necessary for a successful API</a>, and there are other great posts like, <a title="What Developers Say About API Documentation" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/20/what-developers-say-about-api-documentation/">What Developers Say About API Documentation</a> from Peter Gruenbaum of <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/api-documentation/">SDK Bridge</a>.
<p></p>Everyone seems pretty unanimous that a RESTful API, with simple and complete documentation, qualitiy code samples in the popular languages, and real API support from the owner and the community are the ingredients for a successful API.
<p></p>Iparticipatedin a chat about APIs on Twitter, where amix of API influencers, owners, advocates, evangelists and developers hung out for about an hour, answering questions posed by <a title="http://twitter.com/#!/retailigence" href="http://twitter.com/#!/retailigence">@retailigence</a>. Overall there were about seven questions asked, but the second one was simple, and thought provoking:
<p></p><em>What is the most important characteristic of an API?</em>
<p></p>The <a title="common building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks</a> were rattled off (by myself included): REST, quality documentation, code samples, while other said more innovative things like API explorer or <a title="Mashery I/O Docs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/02/mashery-open-sources-their-api-io-docs/">Masherys I/O Docs</a>. Then <a title="@infochimps" href="http://twitter.com/#!/InfoChimps">@infochimps</a> said <strong><em>reliability &amp; usefulness</em></strong>.
<p></p>This started some side conversations and got me thinking. Does the overall value an API deliver and its reliability trump its RESTfulness, documentation and available code samples?
<p></p>I would say definitely, yes! It is true that a RESTful API, with simple and clear documentation, and code samples are a must have. But if your API doesn't offer clear value and reliably deliver on this value, no amount of documentation or code samples is going to work.
<p></p>These are all pretty basic concepts at first glance, but it is a reminder where to focus your resources when it comes to your API.

While browsing around the Yahoo WebPlayer site I came to the Terms of Service, which I found three items that stand out:
<blockquote><em>Yahoo! can update and change this Agreement and TOS by posting a new version without notice to you.</em><p></p>
<em>You understand and agree that the Player may allow for advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Yahoo! to provide the Player for your use.</em><p></p>
<em>Yahoo! Media Player is free, but Yahoo! reserves the right to charge fees for future use of or access to the Player at Yahoo!'s sole discretion.</em></blockquote>
I think these are pretty standard <a title="Rules of the Road" href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">rules of the road</a> that us publishers and developers are getting used when integrating with APIs and deploying gadgets, widgets and other embeddable tools. But they don't give us much build upon, as a content publisher, or developer trying to build a business.<p></p>
I cannot see into the future, and I understand the problems providers face, but these terms seem pretty wide open, in favor of the provider. What can we do to make terms of services (TOS) for APIs and other tools more in support of the community a provider is targeting with these services?<p></p>
I don't have the answers, just asking the question. This bizdev 2.0 stuff is a lot harder than we anticipated.

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2011</span>
        <a title="Office of the Federal Register" href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/government/presidential-seal.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>Each day Federal agencies publish documents in the Federal Register. These documents include proposed rules, final rules, public notices, and Presidential actions. The print-based version of the Federal Register can be difficult to read, process and access, so the <a title="Office of the Federal Register" href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/">Office of the Federal Register</a> (OFR) of the <a title="National Archives and Records Administration" href="http://www.archives.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration</a> (NARA), and the <a title="U.S. Government Printing Office" href="http://www.gpo.gov/">U.S. Government Printing Office</a> (GPO), who all joined forces to launch the <a title="federalregister.gov" href="http://www.federalregister.gov/">FederalRegister.gov</a> website, also deployed an API.<p></p>
The goal of the initiative was to make it even easier for developers to build new ways of interacting with Federal Register data, making it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in the Government decision-making process.<p></p>
The <a title="Federal Register API" href="http://www.federalregister.gov/blog/learn/developers">Federal Register API</a> is RESTful, with no keys required for authentication and responses in a JSON format. They even provide a simple JSON interface for callbacks. All data in the Federal Register is updated daily by 6 a.m., and is published Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, and consists of four types of entries:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Presidential Documents</strong> - Executive orders and proclamations</li>
	<li><strong>Rules and Regulations</strong> - Policy statements and interpretations of rules</li>
	<li><strong>Proposed Rules</strong> - Petitions for rulemaking and other advance proposals</li>
	<li><strong>Notices</strong> - Scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public, grant applications, administrative orders, and other announcements of government actions</li>
</ul>
The Federal Register API is meant to deliver print-based material in machine-readable formats, to make the Federal Register more searchable, accessible, easier to digest, and easier to share withother systems.<p></p>
The Federal Registers, encourages every citizen to become more involved in the workings of their government and to make their voices heard on the things that matter to them, from the smallest to the largest issues.<p></p>
I'm reporting on multiple government APIs lately with, <a title="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/08/01/sunlight-labs-releases-influence-explorer-text-api/" href="Political Influence in U.S. an API Call Away" target="_blank">Political Influence in U.S. an API Call Away</a>" and "<a title="More Government Data with U.S. Department of Labor API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/28/more-government-data-with-u-s-department-of-labor-api/" target="_blank">More Government Data with U.S. Department of Labor API</a>".

I/O Docs provides an interactive documentation system for RESTful web APIs. By defining APIs at the resource, method and parameter levels in a JSON schema, I/O Docs will generate a JavaScript client interface. API calls can be executed directly from the documentation interface, proxied through the I/O Docs server, producing formatted responses.<p></p>
Mashery has <a title="open-sourced a version of the I/O docs on Github" href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">open-sourced a version of the I/O Docs on Github</a>, for any API owner to deploy for their own documentation.

Last year Apigee launched their <a title="API consoe" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API console</a> which allows users to also make calls against an API, and <a title="earlier this year they made it freely available for any API owner" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/apigee-api-console-is-now-free-for-everyone-to-use/">earlier this year they made it freely available for any API owner</a> to deploy. The API console is a popular tool with developers to get up and going using an API, and build an understanding how an API works. Apigees move to make free was a significant market play, and definitely built awareness of their platform.<p></p>
Masherys approach to API exploration reflects an alternative view from Apigees, one that integrates API discovery with API documentation, as opposed to being an entirely separate tool. Masherys move to open-source their I/O Docs on Github, is great to see. I'm sure it will definitely attract more attention to their platform and tools.<p></p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/junk-drawer.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I had a discussion yesterday with <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>about the infamous junk drawer(s) that exists in every house. That end of the counter drawer that seems to accumulate everything from around our house that we think we may some day use.</p>
<p>Junk drawers possess those small items that hold our lives together. Nuts, bolts, fasteners, knobs, hinges and handles as well as the tools we use to assemble the futon, bikes, shelves and other household appliances. We keep all these items because we don't want to throw them away. We will use them some day right?</p>
<p>We all live with this delusion. I have no hard data on what we actually use from the junk drawer, but we all have them, and I'm sure many of us have just taken that entire drawer to the Goodwill, sold at a yard sale, or worse.....thrown away.</p>
<p>Instead of having a junk drawer, what if we could take a picture of each object with our mobile devices. The mobile app would use image recognition or some sort of image scanning to identify the object. The mobile application would scan potentially millions of parts and pieces to identify this little piece of treasure in our lives. Once identified it would pull all meta data related to it, identifying it as a screw, faster for a futon or drawer handle from IKEA.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15 px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AutoCAD_Symbols_Fasteners.jpg" alt="" align="right" />We could create a virtual junk drawer of all these items. Once cataloged in our virtual junk drawer, we could properly dispose of in a recycling bin, Goodwill donation bag, or items in garage for the big yard sale that will make us rich. No more physical junk drawer. We could access our virtual junk drawer at any time, in an online environment.</p>
<p>When that magical time comes, and we actually need the exact same screw, knob, fastener or obscure alan wrench we could search in our virtual junk drawer and pull up the item. Then we could either find out a local place to purchase, or even better the virtual junk drawer would pull the 3D drawing for the part and have it printed for us at the nearest 3D printer.</p>
<p>Instead of clinging to the vision that some day we will need this part or piece, we could keep track of the parts and pieces that make up our lives, and when this day comes we could actually have recreated, and magically it appears in our lives.</p>
<p>This would make way more sense then having a junk drawer with thousands of un-identifiable parts and pieces, and think of the valuable data you could extract from such an application.</p>
<p>Anyways...just a thought.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.twitter.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>I just finished reading two great posts about battles within API ecosystems.<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/07/convoluted-tos-and-open-apis-w.php" target="_blank">Convoluted TOS and "Open" APIs Will Be the Death of Us</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shiondev" target="_blank">Shion Deysarkar</a> and <a href="http://blog.louisgray.com/2011/07/topify-to-go-dark-as-twitter-claims.html" target="_blank">Topify to Go Dark as Twitter Claims Another Dev Victim</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/louisgray" target="_blank">Louis Gray</a>. I recommend you read, and form your own opinion.<p></p>
I'm totally behind Shion in,<em> ..arguing that the breaching parties (i.e. the developers holding the API key) should not be held in contempt of court, as it were. </em>When it comes to terms of service disagreements, there needs to be more discussion.<p></p>
<em></em>I also feel Topify's pain in their decision to, <em>..shut down the service, rather than chasing after Twitter's continued meandering API road-map</em>. This makes it very difficult to build a business on Twitters API.<p></p>
I am the biggest advocate for the developer when it comes to these ecosystems battles. API developers often deliver on the promise of an API, but seldom see the reward.<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/topify_125.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />However I also feel the pain of API owners. How are you supposed to have an API that delivers true value, is sustainable, makes all your developers happy, and have terms of service and a roadmap that is all knowing and sees into the future, and promises never to step on your developers toes.<p></p>
I see both sides of the argument, however I feel much of the trouble Twitter and other API owners run into, is the result of not properly sharing its roadmap with developers. If Twitter shared its road-map <span style="text-decoration: underline;">earlier</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more consistently</span> with its developers, and also allowed feedback periods before launching, I think there would a lot less backlash--even if the community didn't always win 100% in the resulting decision.<p></p>
How "open" an API owner is with their road-map obviously is entirely up to them. They have trade secrets to protect, and many other considerations when managing a roadmap. However you should identify a consistent time frame in which to give the developer community a heads up about what is happening. Something they can get used to, count on.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/APIRoadmap-FeedbackLoop.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" />
Of course there will most likely be partners you share your road-map with before sharing it with your developer ecosystem. And don't forget to make sure to consider the press and blogosphere in this road-map release cycle. The press can be the first to bring up an issue, and ultimately end up being the bullhorn for developer grievances.<p></p>
Also, if your platform has a accompanying web application, you will have to consider the linkage between its road-map and your API road-map. How do features you plan to release impact your developer community? When should they be informed about your companies plans for new products and features?<p></p>
Rather than being polarized about these API ecosystem battles I hear about, I'm trying to put on my product managers hat, and find a balanced approach to solving. I don't think there is one single solution to make developers feel warm &amp; fuzzy about integrating with APIs, and each industry or API sector may be different. But I think many of these problems can be addressed through early and consistent sharing of our API road-maps, which will truly make our APIs more open.

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2011</span>
        <a title="PHP code library for the Github Gist API" href="http://codecanyon.net/item/gist-api/410684"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/php-scripts-codecanon-gist-api.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>One of my Google Alerts picked up on something interesting today. A <a title="PHP code library for the Github Gist API" href="http://codecanyon.net/item/gist-api/410684">PHP code library for the Github Gist API</a>, for sale on the code marketplace <a title="CodeCanyon" href="http://codecanyon.net/">CodeCanyon</a> for $2.00.
<p></p>I almost just closed the window, but then thought a little more about it. I think its the first time I've seen a code libraries for sale like this. I've seen more robust integrations and API clients for sale, but never a simple library for working with an API.
<p></p>The <a title="Github Gist API" href="http://develop.github.com/p/general.html">Github Gist API</a> is well documented and there is a <a title="PHP Library for the Github API" href="https://github.com/ornicar/php-github-api">PHP library for the Github API</a> available for free on the site. It doesn't look like it has Gist API support yet, but is well written, and shows you how to exend the PHP class.
<p></p>Seems like there is a narrow window where you could build an API code library and make money off selling it before a free library is available, or is it also possible to sell them even when there are other free libraries available?
<p></p>I will keep watching for other API code libraries for sell on CodeCanyon and elsewhere, see if this is a growing trend. I prefer to just open source mine on <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>, for the entire community to put to use.

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2011</span>
        <a title="Moodstocks" href="http://www.moodstocks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/moodstocks/Moodstocks-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>I was reviewing the image recognition API from <a title="Moodstocks" href="http://www.moodstocks.com/">Moodstocks</a>, for a story on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> today, and discovered another API management story I feel should be told. Its a story about bootstrapping your API management using existing free and low cost services.<p></p>
Before users adopt your API, it can be hard to justify costs around using paid API management services to support your developer ecosystem (because at that stage the ecosystem often doesn't exist). Moodstocks approach to its API community was a great example of bootstrapping API management until you can afford more.<p></p>
For managing its <a title="documentation" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=120">documentation</a>, <a title="code libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">code libraries</a>, <a title="articles" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=122">articles</a> and <a title="FAQs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=132">FAQs</a>, Moodstocks turned to Github for help. Github provides these tools for free, and are great for delivering these API management essentials.<p></p>
For developer support, Moodstocks uses Vanilla Forums for its <a title="forum" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=131">forum</a>, and Campfire for chat support. Moodstocks uses a nicely skinned copy of Wordpress for its <a title="blog" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=123">blog</a>, and has a solid social media approach using Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube.<p></p>
With this bootstrapped approach, it was up to Moodstocks to deliver its own API processes: rate limiting, security and other reporting features. But when it came to management the startup chose a nice selection of free and low cost services to delivery services to its API community.

<a title="OAuth" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=184">OAuth</a> is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data, and is a popular method to allow secure API authorization, enabling websites to provide a more streamlined user login experience with the additional benefits of enhanced privacy and security.<p></p>
The Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit is the first solution of its kind that enables enterprises to control policy and identity aspects of many different OAuth token operations, a capability that is particularly important as enterprises increasingly use OAuth to authorize access to APIs in cloud settings, said Phil Walston, vice president of products at Layer 7 Technologies. By allowing enterprises to seamlessly manage their OAuth implementations as the standard evolves, the toolkit simplifies operations while providing rigorous security and control.<a title="Layer 7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/layer7-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><p></p>
Features of the Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Policy and identity controls to handle HMAC-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signature methods, SAML and OAuth WRAP</li>
	<li>Mix and match implementations of OAuth with SAML</li>
	<li>Ability to drop in new signature and credential methods without changing APIs</li>
</ul>
Layer 7's new OAuth Toolkit supports a variety of standards, including OAuth 1a, OAuth 2.0, SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, WS-Trust, <a title="REST" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=196">REST</a> and <a title="JSON" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/27/api-technology-json/">JSON</a>.<p></p>
Layer 7 will be demonstrating its OAuth Toolkit at the Layer 7 Hospitality Suite at <a title="Gartners Catalyst Conference" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/catalyst/">Gartner's Catalyst Conference</a> at the San Diego Hilton Bayfront, Aqua Room 311, from 6:00 - 9:00 p.m., July 26-29.

</p>
<p>
     The investment will be used as part of a continued global expansion and R&amp;D efforts focused on the company's in-car, location based services (LBS) and mobile applications businesses.
</p>
<p>
     With over 150 industry-leading customers across 8 different distribution channels, a profitable business, and nearly 90 percent compound annual revenue growth over the past 3 years, INRIX did not need to raise capital, said Bryan Mistele, president and CEO of INRIX. However, given new market opportunities including the rapid adoption of our premium traffic services, increasing demand from automakers for global solutions and the explosion of LBS on mobile devices, we're accelerating several investments designed to firmly cement our global leadership position.
</p>
<p>
     The investment by KPCB Green Growth Fund and August Capital show the growth of the LBS data market, and resulting APIs that gather and deliver this data to mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/inrix/inrix-traffic-mobile-applications.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Traffic congestion costs the U.S. economy upwards of $155 billion dollars annually. Last year alone, US drivers wasted 3.9 billion gallons of fuel sitting idle in traffic, and the US is a small part of a much larger and growing global traffic problem, commented Michael Linse, partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers. We believe that INRIX is uniquely positioned to help improve the efficiency of our cars in ways that reduce fuel consumption and improve sustainability for all.
</p>
<p>
     We are experiencing a convergence of automotive and mobile efforts that leverage the latest smart devices, data analytics and connectivity technologies that improve how the world's one billion drivers travel from place to place.
</p>
<p>
     The use of crowd-sourced traffic information from mobile devices, vehicles, and sensors on the road can provide continuous real-time speed, congestion, accident data that can provide a unique understanding of traffic events from school schedules, concerts, sporting events and everyday commutes to deliver highly accurate real-time, predictive and historical traffic information.
</p>
<p>
     APIs are the "vehicle" in which data will travel from cars, phones, and sensors and to companies like INRIX, and investors are started to see the huge potential in this massively growing market.

I was looking for a new direction. Somewhere I could apply all my strengths, and stay relevant and at the forefront of a fast changing tech landscape.
<p></p>As part of this effort, I spent some time considering what areas dominated the past 5 years of my career. Looking at my resume, social media and cloud computing were the two major themes. Then I put some thought into what technology is dominating right now, and will continue growing in the next couple years. The answer was mobile technology.
<p></p>Looking to apply what I know, but also be relevant and competitive in the future, I wanted to find a common thread. What did all of these areas have in common? It was clearly application programming interfaces, or more specifically, web APIs.
<p></p>APIs drove the social media revolution from Flickr to Twitter, reinvented IT with cloud computing, and is a driving force behind mobile applications.
<p></p>I found an area to focus my energy, but do I have the skills needed to work with APIs. What is needed to be successful with an API?
<p></p>I set off to study all the top APIs out there and answer this question. After much research, success with an API seemed to boil down to equal parts technical, business, and marketing. It sounded like a fit for my skills.
<p></p>Successful APIs like Amazon, Twilio and Google all had one thing in common. They had developer advocates or technical evangelists. This is what I wanted to do. What skills are required to be an API developer advocate or evangelist?

          <strong>Hacker</strong> - You have to have a love of hacking. You have to be able to write code samples, prototypes and be able to know what programmers experience hacking on an API. You should also be able to push the boundaries on what can be done with APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Business Development</strong> - You need business development experience and an understand of how APIs can evolve businesses and industries. You push to understand how APIs can change how business is conducted, where it can be applied, an how this can be communicated to existing business leaders.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong> - You need to be able to plan and maintain an on and offline sales and marketing presence. Attend and speak at events, able to mingle with both developers and business people, and possess a knowledge of traditional marketing as well as online and social media marketing tactics.
     </li>
</ul>The biggest skill you have to posses is the classic self-starter or self-motivator. There is no well laid road-map to follow, you have to be able to plan, strategize, execute and fail or succeed all on your own.
<p></p>I closely monitor how other players are executing, and apply relevant pieces to my own strategy. But ultimately you have have the knowledge and confidence to define your own road-map, and awareness to adjust as necessary.
<p></p>This kind of experience I've gained from being the leader on several development teams, and wisdom gained from running my own business, including several failed startups.
<p></p>I'm writing this blog post this for my own benefit. To establish a clear definition of who I am, and what I'm bringing to the table, and make sure I'm on track with my career.
<p></p>However, I also want to help others understand this evolving new role of being a developer advocate or API evangelist. There is a growing need in this area, and I get offered an average of 2-3 jobs per week in this area. I'm very happy in my current position, so they all end with me telling them I will refer anyone I know from my network.
<p></p>Which is kind of bullshit, because I don't know anyone with these skills, that is looking for work. Do you have these skills? Maybe you should consider a career with APIs. Let me know.

        <span class="post-date">22 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/file-open-dialog.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />The file open dialog box is an important tool that we use every day, but we very rarely notice it or think much about it.
<p></p>On the Windows platform, using the file open dialog box, we see our desktop, my documents or whatever was the last hell hole of a folder we were working in.
<p></p>On the Mac, using the file open dialog box, it seems like I eternally live in my downloads folder with the occasional venture do my documents or desktop folders. Maybe that's just me?
<p></p>More and more I find myself living in my Amazon S3, which I still access via my Firefox S3Fox extension versus the Amazon Console. Old habits die hard. Regardless, more of my world is living in the clouds.
<p></p>The file open dialog box just doesn't have the same meaning in the clouds. Its a desktop, localized tool. When we open it, we see that local desktop mess we've created and maintained (well sort of).
<p></p>When we open a web dialog, we don't see much. It seems to be something made up, nothing near the meaning of when we open it locally. Or we are forced to paste the URL of a single file or page into a textbox.
<p></p>Google is <a title="making a move to re-invent the File Open Dialog" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/07/get-picky-with-google-picker-api.html">making a move to re-invent the file open dialog box</a>, in context of the web, and the context of your Google workspace.
<p></p>With the <a title="Google Picker API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/picker/docs/index.html">Google Picker API</a>, any developer can build a web-based file open dialog box. In Google's opinion, a web-based file open dialog box should provide a user with a more modern experence:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Familiar</strong> � A look-and-feel that users will recognize.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Graphical</strong> � A dialog experience, with many views showing previews or thumbnails.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Streamlined</strong> � An inline, modal window, so users never leave the main application.
     </li>
</ul>I would add that users need to see, and have access to the content they use most. In this day and age, this means on and offline content. Google Picker API gives you access to what you use most on the Google platform. This makes sense in the context of the Google vision.
<p></p>As a developer Google Picker API provides you display access to a users:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Google Docs (Folders, Docs, Spreadsheets, Presentations)
     </li>
     <li>Picasa Web Folders
     </li>
     <li>Videos (Youtube?)
     </li>
</ul>Since I use Google Docs and Picassa heavily, this will help, but I still don't consider this the next generation of the file open dialog box.
<p></p>I would like to see all of my Google Data (I'm sure Google is working on this), and other sources of data I use regularly. I need my Flickr, Amazon S3, Twitter, Instapaper, Evernote, Github, Pinboard and any other relevant applications I use.
<p></p>Will Google open up access to other services, allow them to register their services, and offer access within the new, web-based vision of the file open dialog box?
<p></p>I agree the file open dialog box is ready for an overhaul. I like Google's style. I think they have the talent and resources to make it happen. I also think they will recognize the importance of opening up access to other services.
<p></p><strong>One last random thought:</strong> When will my file open dialog box give me access to my <a title="Locker Project" href="http://lockerproject.org/">Locker Project</a> data?

Many API owners are in experimental mode when it comes to how they make money with their API.
<p></p>Beyond the fuzzy plans for how API owners intend to make money, even more API owners don't have a clear vision of how they will reward their developers, and share revenue with its API ecosystem.
<p></p>There are examples of leadership from API owners. <a title="Qwerly gives discounts of API costs for high volume API users" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/24/whats-next-for-apis-learning-from-social-apis/">Qwerly gives discounts on API costs for high volume API users</a> and <a title="YellowAPI pay developers for high volumes of traffic" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">YellowAPI pay developers for high volumes of traffic</a> originating from their applications as well as sharing advertising revenue with developers.
<p></p>The <a title="Bluevia API" href="https://bluevia.com/en/">Bluevia API</a> is another innovator in the space with its straightforward business models provided for its development community. <a title="Bluevia lays out four business models" href="https://bluevia.com/en/page/view/menupath/main.gotomarket.sell.businessModels">Bluevia lays out four business models</a> developers can choose from:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Downloads - Earn 70% of downloaded apps that developers publish to Movistar and O2 App Stores
     </li>
     <li>Subscriptions - Earn 70% of recurring revenue stream fees of ongoing subscription of apps that developers publish to Movistar and O2 App Stores
     </li>
     <li>Mobile Advertising - Earn 50% of advertising revenue when developers integrate Telefonica's ad network
     </li>
     <li>Messaging Sending and Receiving - Earn 10% of SMS and MMS that are sent from a developer app
     </li>
</ul><a title="Bluevia lays out four business models" href="https://bluevia.com/en/page/view/menupath/main.gotomarket.sell.businessModels"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/bluevia/bluevia-business-models.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>Bluevia provides a step-by-step process for walking developers through obtaining an API key, certifying an application and API key, publishing to the store, and collecting revenue from one or all of the available developer business models.
<p></p>This type of straightforward approach represents the future of how API owners can clearly communicate how a platform intends to generate revenue, and share revenue with the developer community so that they too can be successful in building businesses around an API platform. It sets clear expectations with the developer community, allowing developers to understand the risks and benefits with building a business around an API.
<p></p>Bluevia's approach to revenue earned from selling apps in a marketplace is nothing new. Other providers like YellowAPI also share mobile advertising revenue, and other service revenue with developers. What really stands out is their clear presentation of solid business models that developers can choose from. This identifies the value of the developer community, and gives them the clear revenue opportunities they need to be successful.

Seems like every hackathon I attend, there are discussion about how to better harness the talent available at these events, and develop a way to track what gets generated.
<p></p>The last hackathon I attended one of the ideas pitched was actually a web application that tracks what gets produced at hackathons. It would track the participants, and provide repositories for any code created. The application would provide access to ideas and projects from any participating event.
<p></p>It's a pretty good idea. I think a lot of good ideas and code goes to waste from contests and hackathons. Evening winning ideas may never go anywhere.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hackathon.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Today I came across a Google project called <a title="Melange" href="http://code.google.com/p/soc/">Melange</a>. Melange is an open-source web application that Google uses to track the <a title="Google Summer of Code" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a title="Google Code-In" href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gci/2010-11/index.html">Google Code-in</a> programs.
<p></p>The goal of the project is to create a framework for tracking open-source contribution programs. Google is able to manage Google Summer of Code programs, and other similar programs with the web application.
<p></p>Melange is part content management system, part issue tracking system, and part customer relationship manager. It is written in Python and runs on Google App Engine.
<p></p>At first glance it looks like Melange is setup to track all the users, ideas, projects and code for a hackathon environment. It might take a little customization, but Melange may work as a platform for tracking hackathons and contests.
<p></p>It would be great to have access and visibility to projects and code that gets generated from event to event, and information about the smart people were involved.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/visually/visually-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />It is hard for me to imagine why someone would launch a web application these days, without immediately launching an API, or at least having plans for an API shortly after release.
<p></p>There always is some data that can be liberated, and make it available in a JSON format. Simple data APIs can easily drive widgets and other embeddable tools, providing viral marketing tools that drive awareness and SEO.
<p></p>So when I am playing with new web applications, if there is no clear API strategy, it always gets me thinking about the possibilities. This happened when I was playing the new <a title="infographic builder and marketplace Visual.ly" href="http://www.visual.ly">infographic builder and marketplace Visual.ly</a> today.
<p></p>There is no evidence of an API at Visual.ly. I see an RSS feed of infographics, but no API. So I started thinking about a simple API and embeddable strategy for them.
<p></p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/visually/visually-infographic.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I would start with infographic and designer services providing JSON responses for searches on the infographic marketplace and graphic designers.
<p></p>Visual.ly only provides tools for sharing infographics. You can't actually embed them, I believe this is how they plan to monetize. So you wouldn't have full copies of infographics via the API. You'd provide smaller representations of parts and pieces, or other relevant visualizations.
<p></p>For every infographic, a designer would create a handful of small images, and the API could serve up these images and all the meta data for each entry in the marketplace.
<p></p>This would open up possibilities for embeddable buttons, widgets and gadgets that anyone could copy and paste, and virally promoteinfographics without actually giving away everything.
<p></p>The Visual.ly API wouldn't be complex to begin with, just allow basic access to infographics and designers, and provide an assortment of embeddable tools for users to syndicate content. A more advanced API, providing more complete access to infographics and the builder, can come later.

The goals was to significantly reduce network, memory, and CPU resources needed to work with Google APIs.<p></p>
Now Google is <a title="adding support" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/07/lightning-fast-performance-tips-for.html">adding support </a>for partial response, and an improved version of <a title="partial update, called patch" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/v1/performance.html#patch">partial update, called patch</a>, to a number of newer APIs including:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google Buzz API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/">Google Buzz API</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Tasks API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/">Google Tasks API</a></li>
</ul>
All APIs available in the <a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> and the <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">APIs Explorer</a> supporting partial response and updates.<p></p>
The partial response algorithm works by supplying a fields query parameter to any API call that returns data, you can request specific fields.<p></p>
Here is an example request that returns only titles and timestamps of a user's public Buzz activities: <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">https://www.googleapis.com/buzz/v1/activities/kinlane@gmail.com/@public?alt=json&amp;pp=1&amp;fields=items(title,updated)</a><p></p>
A full response for Buzz activity would be around 53KB and the partial response is 3KB, a reduction of almost 95%!<p></p>
You can try out both partial response and patch algorithms in the <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google APIs Explorer</a>. In partial responses, the fields parameter is available for most methods. You can easily tell which are partial update methods by the .patch in the method name. Both the fields parameter and the patch method on the tasklist resource in the APIs explorer.<p></p>
Partial response and updates are a great way to make APIs more efficient for devices with limited connectivity, as well as making API platforms operate as efficiently as they can by delivering only what information is needed.<p></p>
Google is in a unique position with the number of APIs they offer, volume of API calls they manage, and wide audience they deliver to. We can all learn a lot from watching them organize their APIs, and apply elements of their approach to our own API ecosystems.

<p></p>While considering this, I keep having thoughts about the perfect API stack. In my opinion, these are APIs that do one thing and do it well, makes a developers life easier, and have clear business value.
<p></p>The first one that comes to mind is <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-detail.php?API_ID=1823">Twilio</a>. When I think of Twilio, I think of two clear use cases: voice and SMS.
<p></p>Voice and SMS are two critical tools to have in your developer toolbox. These are services that have clear value, that would take a lot of effort to duplicate yourself, making it a no brainer to pay for as a service.
<p></p>In an effort to define the perfect API stack, I'm going to start blogging about APIs that fall into this category as I find them. They will be short posts that introduce you to these services, and when I get enough I will launch a landing page showcasing the perfect API stack.

        <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/search-magnifying-glass.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />One of the new features that Twitter rolled out with the <a title="new Twitter developer area" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/07/11/twitter-launches-new-api-developer-area/">new Twitter developer area</a> was an enhanced search tool powered by <a title="Apache Solr" href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>. The new unified search provides an engine for searching across all areas of the new developer area, including the mailing list historical archives.<p></p>
Many of us API owners have to cobble together our developer areas from several tools like <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, <a title="Google Groups" href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a>, and other tools we can leverage to quickly provide communication and support for our APIs. There is nothing wrong with this approach, however one side effect is that we end up with information available in separate silos, making information harder for developers to find.<p></p>
Providing a single search interface, that allows developers to search across all systems, delivering comprehensive and relevant search results can make a significant difference in whether or not a developer finds the details they need to successfully integrate.<p></p>
Apache Solr is one indexing tool you can deploy as part of your API area, but there are also lower impact solutions such as <a title="Google Custom Search" href="http://www.google.com/cse/">Google Custom Search</a> that can be deployed as an external service, without investing in costly equipment or software.<p></p>
Don't underestimate the power of having a single search interface that developers can use to find the information they are looking for when integrating with your API.

        <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/fear.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I spend a lot of time looking through various APIs. One common problem I see, are with, what on the surface appear to be <a title="public APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">public APIs</a>, but once I start looking to get access as a developer, I get walls thrown up.
<p></p>Often times, information about the API is public. I can browse the documentation, code samples and more, but when I want to play with the API I have to ask for access and wait for approval.
<p></p>This is different than a <a title="private APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">private API</a>, where you just want to give API access to a private audience. I can tell these API owners have a good idea, want to open it up to the public, but they are very concerned about who has access to their API.
<p></p>These businesses are concerned about what people will do with their data and resources. They have concerns for their brand, and legal issues to wrestle with. What will developers do? How will it affect customers? Will it damage the companies reputation?
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/wall-usb-port.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />There are a lot of unanswered questions when launching an API. None of us have all the answers, and can predict what the future holds, and managing public developers can be a lot of work.
<p></p>What you need is a quality API management platform, with tools for providing visibility into how developers are using your API. If you can't build the tools you need yourself, make sure and check out the API service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, <a title="Layer7" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/layer-7-technologies-launches-new-api-portal/">Layer7</a> or <a title="Atmospher" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">Atmosphere</a>.
<p></p>Next you need an agile process and attitude for evaluating API usage and feedback, then be able to quickly evolve your API to satisfy your business objectives, adding the most value to your brand, while also building a healthy and vibrant developer ecosystem.
<p></p>One of my goals with<a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, is to pay attention to the industry as a whole, understand the best practices for API management and share this knowledge with other API owners so there is less fear and uncertainty around deploying public and private APIs.

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />According to <a title="Reuters" href="http://www.reuters.com">Reuters</a>, <a title="Twitter is preparing to launching an Advertising API" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/twitter-idUSN1E76C1Y920110713">Twitter is preparing to launch an Advertising API</a>, targeting larger advertisers, allowing them to tailor, automate, and publish ads in bulk directly into Twitter users' streams.
<p></p>Access to the Twitter Adverting API, which Twitter plans to begin in the fourth quarter, will initially be rolled out as a test involving a limited number of partners, <a title="according to Reuters" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/twitter-idUSN1E76C1Y920110713">according to Reuters</a>.
<p></p>The Advertising API is a sign that Twitter is pulling together its business model and looking to further monetize its network in the same way as Google does with its Adwords and Adsense, and Facebook with its Ad Network.
<p></p>Right now you have to <a title="submit a form" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/start">submit a form</a>, and talk with a sales person to run ads on Twitter, the new API would create an automated advertising marketplace on top of the Twitter ecosystem.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/Twitter-Advertising-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />According to Reuters, Twitter's advertising API will initially let advertisers automatically deliver ads in two formats:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Promoted Tweets" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/promoted-tweets">Promoted Tweets</a></strong> - Allowing an advertiser to sponsor any 140 character messages via Twitter
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Promoted Accounts" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/promoted-accounts">Promoted Accounts</a></strong> - Enabling advertisers to promote its own Twitter account to other users
     </li>
</ul>A marketing research firm <a title="eMarketer" href="http://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a>, estimates that <a title="Twitter is expected to generate about $150 million in ad revenue" href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008192">Twitter is expected to generate about $150 million in ad revenue</a> through its ad network in 2011.
<p></p>Evolving the Twitter advertising network to a self-service system, and adding an API for programmatic integration, will significantly increase the volume of advertising that runs through the network, putting it on par with Google and Facebook's offering.
<p></p>This kind of system is well-suited for larger advertisers that need to buy ads in bulk and run large-scale online advertising campaigns that involve thousands of different versions of an ad.
<p></p>"They can just flood the system with ad types and almost in real time they can figure out which ads are working, which are most successful, which are getting the clicks at the right price," says Debra Aho Williamson, analyst at eMarketer.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/twitter-monetization.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The release of an API is the next logical step for the Twitter advertising network, but one area that isn't mentioned in the Reuters piece -- and is critical to the overall health of the Twitter ecosystem: where do the developers fit in?
<p></p>Will developers be able participate in the advertising network and share in the revenue generated from advertising on their sites and applications?
<p></p>Developers play a central role in building sites and applications that will drive traffic and resulting revenue for Twitter and its advertisers. Giving developers an opportunity to make money from their efforts, will only strengthen the overall platform, and bring more value for advertisers and Twitter.

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tumblr/Tumblr-Engineering-Blog.png" alt="" width="260" align="right" /><a title="Tumblr just released version 2.0 of the blog platform API" href="http://engineering.tumblr.com/post/7541361718/introducing-tumblrs-new-api">Tumblr just released version 2.0 of the popular blogging platform API</a>, in an effort to make developers lives a little easier when integrating with the Tumblr platform.
<p></p>The previous version of the API made distinctions between read and write operations and pushed different activity to two separate domains, the www.tumblr.com and the blog subdomain.
<p></p>The new API version consolidates all API access to api.tumblr.com and exposes two major resources in the URI: /blog and /user. Consolidation under one domain will allow Tumblr to effectively measure and balance traffic using DNS.
<p></p>The new URLs will follow a pattern, making them intuitive, allowing developers to easily discover and experiment with the API without having to rely exclusively on documentation.
<p></p>Instead of adhering to strict RESTful practices, Tumblr is looking to create simple URLs that enable manipulation by the average human.
<p></p>For example, to pull the avatar of my tumblr blog I use the following URL: <a href="http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar">http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar</a>
<p></p>The API returns the default avatar image, and if I want a larger size, I just append the size to the URL: <a href="http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar/512">http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar/512</a>
<p></p>In the first version of the Tumblr API, all data was available in XML, with JSON support added largely as an afterthought. Now Tumblr has just decide to eliminate XML, and focused on dialing in their JSON implementation. A common approach for API owners.
<p></p>The new API implements OAuth 1.0a for authentication and they are looking at upgrading to OAuth 2.0 in the neear future.
<p></p>I like how Tumblr has consolidated under a single domain, and I favor their approach to intuitive URL's over a strict RESTful implemntation.
<p></p>The Tumblr API v2 is definitely an improvement, I will see how it sizes up against the <a title="new Posterous API launched last month" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/posterous-from-saas-to-paas-using-an-api/">new Posterous API launched last month</a>.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook-removes-app-directory.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Many <a title="Facebook Developers" href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook developers</a> have been confused about what it means to submit to the Facebook App Directory, and frustrated by the length of time it took to get their applications approved.
<p></p><a title="Facebook has stated" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/523/">Facebook has stated</a> that the Facebook App Directory actually drives less than 0.5% of all application installations, with the highest number of installations actually coming from Facebook search.
<p></p>And until now, to be visible in search, you had to submit your app to the App Directory.
<p></p>In light of this data Facebook is removing the App Directory and depending on search for application discovery on the Facebook platform.
<p></p>For an app to show up in search, developers now need to go to the application detail page, and click the Submit to Search link in the left sidebar while editing the application.
<p></p>When submitted, applications are automatically available in search and there is no longer an approval process to go through. When any changes are made to application settings, it will automatically be updated in the listing.
<p></p>Obviously this approach doesn't apply to all <a title="application directories" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">API application directories</a>, but some interesting data to consider from one of the larger development platforms, when deploying your own <a title="API application directory" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/08/a-white-label-api-appstore-platform/">API application directory</a>.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/foursquare/foursquare-engineering-logo.png" alt="" align="right" />Foursquare is <a title="sunsetting their APIv1" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foursquare-api/tZPFTbUTQJQ">sunsetting their APIv1</a>, and recently spent some time sharing the lessons they learned during APIv1 and the decisions that went into APIv2.
<p></p>Here are some excerpts:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>JSON -</strong> This was a no brainer. Its flexible and understood by everybody.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>OAuth2 and HTTPS-Only -</strong> OAuth2 is straightforward to implement on the server and client, and offloading encryption to HTTPS makes it easy to get it right.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>REST Lite -</strong> It makes sense to use resourceful URLs for certain key objects, like users/USER_ID or venues/VENUE_ID, with actions and connections hanging off of them. Also avoiding deeply nested URLs like users/USER_ID/tips/TIP_ID, instead using tips/TIP_ID, leads to much simpler URLs. Finally, they avoided using the extended set of HTTP verbs beyond POST and GET, putting the action into the endpoint name, such as tips/add.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation -</strong> Quality documentation combined with an API explorer is a win. Also theimplementationof a simple documentation generation system, made it easy for Foursquare engineers to keep API documentation up to date.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Timestamps as Seconds Since Epoch -</strong> Renders timestamps not readable by humans, but extremely easy to parse.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Versioning -</strong> The hardest part of designing an API is that you're stuck with a bunch of decisions you can't take back. But in some cases they needed to take them back anyway, so they came up with the idea of clients sending back a version like 20110708 and promising to be compatible with all changes up to the date.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Object Level detail -</strong> It's always hard to decide how much detail to include in an object, and Foursquare lets the clients dictate what to include where. In APIv2, they introduced compact and full JSON representations of resources.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Envelope -</strong> The decision to wrap all responses in { meta: { � }, response: {...} } was well received, along with the error details included in the meta block.
     </li>
</ul>They provide a lot more wisdom in their blog post,<a title="APIv2: Woulda, coulda, shoulda" href="http://engineering.foursquare.com/2011/07/08/apiv2-woulda-coulda-shoulda/">APIv2: Woulda, coulda, shoulda</a>. Some of the points I couldn't do justice with just an excerpt.
<p></p>Some of their reflections are just reminders of the success of JSON, OAuth2 and a simple RESTful approach. But their insight about how to structure objects, envelopes, timestamps and categories has me putting some more thought into upcoming changes to my API.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape/mashape-manage-your-APIs.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Mashape<a title="released a few new enhancements" href="http://blog.mashape.com/introducing-some-new-things-inbox-new-wizard">released a few enhancements</a> to their API management platform.
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Inbox</strong> - Mashape redesigned their inbox and messaging system. Developers can contact you from your API detail page, and the inbox provides interface for managing developers and your conversations.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API Wizard</strong> - The API setup and management wizard is no longer a step by step wizard. It now gives you five options in a left hand navigation, leaving the room for more options to be added in the future.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Private APIs</strong> - You can now deploy a private API with Mashape, only inviting the developers you want to have access.
     </li>
</ul>Some small changes, but prettyimportantchanges for API owners and developers who use <a title="Mashape" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/04/mashape-api-service-provider/">Mashape</a>.
<p></p>I would say the ability to deploy a private API is the most significant, as more people realize the value of APIs, and deploy them for partners, not the general public.

        <span class="post-date">05 Jul 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/rellinking.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I made some more changes to my network over the holidays. I'm working to better tie together my blog(s) and my social network profiles using the <a title="rel= property" href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_link_rel.asp">rel="" property</a>.<p></p>
The process is a three part process, meant to link the various places I write with my author brand, that is represented in my social network profiles, most importantly Google +.<p></p>
I write on several blogs and I want the authorship of my work to be linked back to my <a title="Google + Profile" href="https://plus.google.com/106460238807821851374/">Google + profile</a>.<p></p>
I'm very Google centric, so in my network this is the most important profile in my network. This also feeds into my overall SEO strategy which is another story.<p></p>
I started by created two separate author pages on my two blogs. <a title="Kin Lane" href="http://www.kinlane.com/about/">Kin Lane</a> and <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/about/">API Evangelist</a>.<p></p>
Then I updated all of my blog posts within those domains to link my author name to those respective about pages, and include the rel='author' link.  This attributes each post to me, the author.<p></p>
Then on those about me pages I listed my social network profiles, most importantly Google +, and included the link rel='me'. This attributes each of these social network profiles as my profile pages.<p></p>
The final link is on my Google + Profile page I make sure and add link to both my blogs, and include the option "This page is specifically about me", which automatically includes the rel='me' property for each of the links.<p></p>
All of this completes a circle showing that I am the author of my blog posts, and associating these blog posts with my Google Profile. Google will now recongize that these profile pages and blog posts are associated with my Google Profile.<p></p>
This all results in improving my author brand in eyes of Google, and since Google dominates the web, the eyes of the Internet.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/07/04/updated-blog-sharing/">Updated Blog Sharing</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Jul 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/core-share-buttons.png" alt="" align="right" />I updated the sharing tools on blog.apievangelist.com today.  Previously it had eight buttons, representing the top social network channels that drive traffic to the blog.<p></p>
I'm changing it, putting emphasis on:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google +1" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/" target="_blank">Google +1</a></li>
	<li><a title="Twitter Share Button" href="http://twitter.com/about/resources/tweetbutton" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
	<li><a title="LinkedIn Share Button" href="http://www.linkedin.com/publishers" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>
These are the top places that people share posts on API Evangelist that drives traffic to the blog.<p></p>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/secondary-share-buttons.png" alt="" align="right" />I started by adding individual buttons from all the major providers:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Facebook Like Button" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/#" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
	<li><a title="StumbleUpon Share Button" href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/badges/" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a></li>
	<li><a title="Digg Share Button" href="http://about.digg.com/downloads/button/smart" target="_blank">Digg</a></li>
	<li><a title="Reddit Share Button" href="http://www.reddit.com/buttons" target="_blank">Reddit</a></li>
</ul>
At first I used <a title="AddThis Sharing" href="http://www.addthis.com/analytics" target="_blank">AddThis</a> for the whole share toolbar, but I couldn't get it to layout the way I wanted.   So I used individual buttons from the Google +1, Twitter and LinkedIn, then I used AddThis for the other top providers:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Instapaper</li>
	<li>Hacker News</li>
	<li>DZone</li>
	<li>Posterous</li>
	<li>Tumblr</li>
	<li>Reddit</li>
</ul>
I will be making some major updates to <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://www.kinlane.com" target="_blank">kinlane.com</a> and using the same share strategy for the blog and web site.  I'll keep adjusting to keep in line with top channels that drive traffic to my blogs.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="Amazon Affiliate Program" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/affiliate/amazon-affiliates.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>Amazon sent me an email about the recent <a title="signing of the online sales tax law, by California Governor Brown" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_18282733" target="_blank">signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown</a>, which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores.
<p></p>As a result of this, contracts with all <a title="California residents particpating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/06/amazon-end-affiliate-program-in-california/">California residents participating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated</a> effective, June 29, 2011.
<p></p>As I was writing up the story of this on <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>, ad it got me thinking about the impact of this on API affiliate programs. I'm tracking on various monetization strategies for APIs, and affiliate sales is one of them.
<p></p>California has broadened their definition regarding who has to pay sales tax, to include theaffiliatesof online retailers. But from what I can read it all still goes back to the sale of <em><span class="c2">"tangible personal property"</span></em>. The tax code defines what type of merchandise is subject to use tax as:
<blockquote>
     <em>Generally, the same types of items that are subject to sales tax are subject to use tax. Sales and use tax applies to the sale or use of tangible personal property in California. Section 6016 of the Revenue and Taxation Code defines tangible personal property as "personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses."</em>
</blockquote>I'm no lawyer, but my interpretation of the <a title="assembly bill 28" href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/abx1_28_bill_20110628_enrolled.pdf">assembly bill 28</a>, is that if your API is not faciliting the sale of <em><span class="c2">tangible goods</span></em>, you are safe. If your selling access to bits and bytes, and you want to share revenue with developers and / or affiliates who drive traffic and sales to your API, you are not subject to any online sales tax for California.
<p></p>I haven't read New York, Illinois or other states bills. I will some night when I need help going to sleep, and update in the future.

Version 1.1 is whats available for <a title="download on Github" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/Mashape-API-Proxy">download on Github</a>, and Mashape is testing the private version 1.2 of the proxy with a small set of API providers, and they will push it to Github after its been tested.<p></p>
The new version dramatically improves the performance and the security of the proxy, while reducing latency.<p></p>
The API Proxy version 1.1 is an extremely early version and Mashape recommends waiting for version 1.2 before deploying.<p></p>
The open-source Mashape API Proxy is written in JavaScript and runs on the latest version of <a title="node.js" href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a><p></p>
This is the first <a title="open-source API proxy" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/Mashape-API-Proxy">open-source API proxy</a> that I know of, and in my opinion, opens up a lot of possibilities for the API industry.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="Energy pricing data provider Genability" href="http://www.genability.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/genability/genability-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Energy pricing data provider Genability" href="http://www.genability.com/">Energy pricing data provider Genability</a> just announced the roll-out of more <a title="flexible pricing for their API" href="https://developer.genability.com/plans-pricing">flexible pricing for their API</a>.
<p></p>The new pricing structure gives Genability API developers more options with no long term commitments, when accessing the Genability tariff and electricity pricing database.
<p></p><a title="Genability API" href="https://developer.genability.com/">Genability API</a> pricing starts with a free plan which offers 10 unique tariff credits per month, and will serve up 1,000 calls per hour.
<p></p>Genability bulk paid plans range from $89.99 / month to $1499.99 a month:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/genability/genability-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Bronze for 89.99 / month</strong>, with 100 unique tariff credits per month, and 5,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Silver for 299.99 / month</strong>, with 350 unique tariff credits per month, and 20,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Gold for $799.99 / month</strong>, with 1000 unique tariff credits per month, and 50,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Platinum for $1499.99 / month</strong>, with 2000 unique tariff credits per month, and 100,000 calls per hour
     </li>
</ul>The call per hour portion is pretty straightforward, but whats a tariff credit?
<p></p>A tariff credit is when you request a full tariff (including all its rates, bands and properties), or request a price, or a calculation on a tariff. Genability keep track of each tariff you request, and keep a count of the unique ones, with subsequent calls for previously requested tariffs being free.
<p></p>All of Genability's API plans both, both free and paid, include LSE data, season &amp; time of use data, and zip codes, and geo-location data.
<p></p>Genability also offers custom pricing plans, if one of their doesn't fit your needs, just contact them and they'll negotiate additional services, flexible usage policies or volume pricing.
<p></p>It's interesting to see pricing for an API that provides access to energy utility pricing, take on a very utility pricing model for consumption.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.mashape.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm exploring the <a title="Mashape API Platform" href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape API Platform</a>, trying to break things down and understand everything in more detail. Blogging about a topic does this for me.
<p></p>So let's start with deploying an API with Mashape.
<p></p>With the <a title="Mashape PHP Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-php-library">Mashape PHP Library</a> you can deploy an API on your infrastructure. You <a title="download the library from Github" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-php-library">download the library from Github</a>, deploy on your server, and then add the methods for your API by extending the Mashape PHP component class.
<p></p>If you already have an API that returns JSON responses, you can just register it as a Mashape API for distribution, without deploying the Mashape PHP Library.
<p></p>If you've deployed your API without the Mashape PHP Library you will need to accomplish one more step. You will need to implement the <a title="Mashape Connector" href="http://www.mashape.com/guide/publish/xml#authentication">Mashape Connector</a> by adding one line of code to your API, which is required to connect your API to the Mashape Platform and handle user authorization, billing, and rate-llimiting.
<p></p>Whichever way you deploy your API, you can now distribute it using Mashape. The first step for distributing an API is to create an XML file that describes what the API does. This XML file gets deployed on your server and needs to be updated as your API evolves.
<p></p>Once your API is deployed and published to Mashape, the platform distributes your API to the <a title="Mashape Marketplace" href="http://www.mashape.com/explore/">Mashape Marketplace</a> and provides a detail page with title, description, documentation, test console and <a title="Mashape PHP Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-php-client-library">PHP</a>, <a title="Mashape Python Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-python-client-library">Python</a>, <a title="Mashape Ruby Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-ruby-client-library">Ruby</a>, <a title="Mashape Java Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-java-client-library">Java</a> and <a title="Mashape Objective C Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-objectivec-client-library">Objective C</a> client libraries.
<p></p>Mashape then provides a way for developers to sign-up and start hacking on any API in the Mashape Marketplace with a single developer account and key. There are also social features allowing users to follow and contact other users.
<p></p>All APIs that are published using Mashape will connect and communicate with Mashape through an API Proxy. This is the proxy that handles the authorization of users, implementation of billing, rate limiting and other functions described above.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape/Mashape-Manage-Your-API.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />Right now the proxy is primarily available via the Mashape platform, but you can also find an <a title="Open-Source version of the Mashape API Proxy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/30/open-source-version-of-the-mashape-api-proxy/">open-source version of the Mashape API proxy</a> on Github. The API Proxy is intended to be downloaded and installed on your servers, which will increase the performance and security of your API.
<p></p>In addition to being able to register your API and use the <a title="Mashape API Proxy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/30/open-source-version-of-the-mashape-api-proxy/">Mashape API Proxy</a> in the cloud, you can <a title="download and install" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/Mashape-API-Proxy">download and install</a> on-premise. Since it is open-source, you could also fork the code and potentially add in your own modifications to the API proxy, which is written in JavaScript and runs on the latest version of node.js
<p></p>I'm playing around with deploying one small and one large data-set as two separate APIs using the Mashape PHP Library, so I can get more familiar with how the platform works. I just wanted to work through some thoughts about what they provide here on the blog. More to come on <a title="Mashape" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/04/mashape-api-service-provider/">Mashape</a>...

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook-graph-API-explorer-bubbles.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Facebook just <a title="officially launched the Graph API Explorer" href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/517/">officially launched the Graph API Explorer</a>, a tool allowing developers to quickly explore the social graph of people, photos, events, pages and the relationships between them, via the <a title="Facebook Graph API" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Graph API</a>.<p></p>
Like other <a title="API Explorers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API explorers</a>, the <a title="Graph API Explorer" href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/">Graph API Explorer</a> allows developers to make requests against the API and see formatted results in-line.<p></p>
The Graph API Explorer interface allows you to obtain an access_token with the specific permissions necessary to access data, navigating the same permissions dialog users will see when permissions are requested in a production app.<p></p>
The Graph API Explorer then allows developers to switch between HTTP GET, POST and DELETE to get, create, update or delete objects.  When POSTing to the API, you can also provide a list of fields and values that you want to send as parameters to the API.<p></p>
For every request the Graph API Explorer provides formatted results, allowing developers to move between objects in the graph by click their Ids, showing the details of each object on the social graph. Just like the real Facebook application, the Graph API Explorer only shows you the objects and data you have acess to see, and that you give the Graph API Explorer permission to access on your behalf.<p></p>
The <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer was originally deployed by a Facebook employee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/17/facebook-joins-api-explorer-game-sort-of/">Facebook Graph API Explorer was originally deployed by a Facebook employee</a>, and now is being officially as part of the Facebook developers program, and is part of a growing trend of RESTful API explorers like <a title="Apigee Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/apigee-api-console-is-now-free-for-everyone-to-use/">Apigee Console</a> and <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google API explorer</a>.

        <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/apigee-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/">Apigee</a> justannounced their <a title="Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI" href="http://forms.apigee.com/acton/form/549/001c:d-0002/0/index.htm">Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI</a>, a new offering that enables organizations to deliver transactional APIs, securely deployed in a private or public cloud.
<p></p>Apigee's new Enterprise Cloud PCI supports full compliance with the <a title="Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard" href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)</a>, while taking advantage of the compute resources of the cloud to support transactional API traffic and sensitive customer data.
<p></p>To fully protect critical customer credit card information, there's an increased focus on compliance, especially as more e-commerce services shift to cloud computing and APIs, said Chet Kapoor, Apigee CEO. ...The Apigee Enterprise Cloud API also protects and screens sensitive data flowing between an application and an API residing on a public cloud, so businesses can now confidently broaden their e-commerce network with transactional APIs.
<p></p>The Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI solution is deployed in PCI-compliant data centers, allowing customers to:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Build and deploy transactional APIs
     </li>
     <li>Maintain PCI compliance and data protection of all API traffic
     </li>
     <li>Tap the scalability of the cloud for secure transactional APIs
     </li>
</ul>The <a title="Apigee Enterprise" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee Enterprise</a> Cloud PCI can also be deployed on-premise, delivering the same capabilities for in-house PCI-DSS compliant deployments.
<p></p>PCI-DSS is associated with e-commerce, and financial transaction security, but can be universally applied to securing any online transactions. The availability of this type of API security will go a long way in convincing IT departments to deploy their API infrastructure in the clouds.

<p></p>Forrester Research predicted that mobile commerce will hit $6 billion in 2011 - and reach up to $31 billion by 2016.
<p></p><a title="Paypal Mobile Payments" href="https://personal.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=marketing_us/mobile_payments">PayPal</a> just raised their 2011 Mobile Total Payments Volume (TPV) projections to $3 billion. Paypal first predicted $1.5 billion in 2011 mobile payments volume, then in February, they upped that to $2 billion, and now they've adjusted to $3 billion.
<p></p>Paypal is running $10 million in mobile TPV a day, up from the $6 million they reported in March.
<p></p>It shows that mobile users are actively purchasing products and services online using sites and applications on their mobile devices.
<p></p>Just like with social media and cloud computing, APIs are a silent force behind the mobile revolution. APIs drive the applications and sites that mobile users are puting to use.
<p></p>The growth in mobile payments is a sign of the overall growth in the mobile market, as well as massive growth in API deployment to support the mobile demand.

On November 25, 2011 Amazon will deprecate the Alexa Top Sites SOAP API. The SOAP interface has had repeated security issues over the last couple of years, and since only a small percentage of users actually use the API, they decided to decommission it.<p></p>
Alexa will also be enforcing that all requests to the API must be signed using <a title="signature version 2" href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AlexaTopSites/latest/CalculatingSignatures.html">signature version 2</a>.  Version 2 is significantly more secure that the version, and all <a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> are being required to migrate to it.<p></p>
I wonder if Amazon is having similar security issues with other SOAP APIs?   Maybe the other SOAP APIs just have more users and it was worthwhile for them to fix.<p></p>
Makes you wonder how many SOAP users vs. REST users Amazon Web Services has.

        <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="self-service registration to your API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=198"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-registration.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>This is one story I'm sure I will be telling over and over. Its about providing <a title="self-service registration to your API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=198">self-service registration to your API</a>, and access to your documentation.
<p></p>I'm working my way through 78 travel APIs right now, reviewing each of them for a series of travel industry API stories.
<p></p>I'm only halfway through, and about 25% of them require me to email them or submit a contact form to get access to their API.
<p></p>I can understand doing this if your goal is to only work with partners and vendors, but all of these APIs came from the <a title="Programmable Web API Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb API directory</a>. So I assume your goal is to target a wider public audience.
<p></p>Here is how your approach is hurting you:
<ol class="mainlist">
     <li>As a developer I need instant gratification. I need to make sure your API has what I need. I need to quickly get at your documentation, see your endpoints, and potentially be able to grab a code sample and see some results. If you can't provide this for me, someone else will.
     </li>
     <li>As an API blogger and writer I need immediate access. If I'm going to include you in my story for the travel industry APIs, and showcase what you offer. I need access, without waiting or talking to you, to see the value you deliver, and where you fit in.
     </li>
</ol>Now I've submitted the contact forms and emails for each of these APIs. I've gotten a couple responses, 24 or 48 hours later (some no response). I've already moved on, I see the name in an email, realize its from my travel research, but I don't remember anything else. Even though I have access now, its unlikely that I will return. The moment to make your mark has passed.
<p></p>What would be the reason for limited access to your API? Maybe you don't have staff or time to manage the potential spammers or other probing type of users that will come through? If you don't have the resources, its likely you won't have the resources to support my needs as a developer either.
<p></p>Put some thought into why you are preventing access to your API. Why isn't it self-service? You are hurting your growth way more than you know.
<p></p>If you don't have the resources, you should consider talking to a service provider like <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, or <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a>. They can deliver the type of self-service gratification, consumers of your API have grown accustom to.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/23/api-ecosystem-tracking-with-statsd-and-graphite/">API Ecosystem Tracking with StatsD and Graphite</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/graphite-stats-d.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />When managing an API and its ecosystem, we are all making this up as we go along.  We have to constantly try new things, build them out, test, measure, and readjust.<p></p>
Measuring being the most important, and when considering your API analytics, it shouldn't be just about tracking usage of your API.  You should measure every aspect of your <a title="API ecosystem" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php">API ecosystem</a>.<p></p>
Applying metrics, gathering data, and reporting on this should be easy, and be part of your development DNA.  Your metrics should be flexible and change as your ecosystem evolves.  Any engineer, evangelist or other team member should be able to implement, gather and measure as the need arises.<p></p>
I was introduced to StatsD and Graphite reporting last week, by <a title="Flip" href="http://twitter.com/#!/mrflip">Flip</a> from <a title="InfoChimps" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">Infochimps</a>, while at the <a title="O'Reilly Velocity conference" href="http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011">O'Reilly Velocity Conference</a>.<p></p>
<a title="StatsD" href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">StatsD</a> is a dead simple NodeJS daemon that listens for messages over a UDP port. When a message is received, it parses the messages, and extracts metrics data.<p></p>
<a title="Graphite" href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/faq#toc0">Graphite</a> is a highly scalable real-time graphing system. Data can be sent to Graphite's processing back-end, carbon, which stores the data in Graphite's specialized database. The data can then be visualized through graphite's web interfaces.<p></p>
StatsD lets you define what you want to track, throw it at the StatsD over a UDP port, once processed you can schedule it to dump to Graphite for further processing and visualization.<p></p>
Using StatsD + Graphite, you can provide any metric you wish, and Graphite will just report on it, with no management overhead.  This type of flexibility provides the perfect agile environment measuring anything in an API ecosystem.<p></p>
For example you can introduce new tracking for each deployment of an account sign-up widget using:  StatsD::increment("widget.accountsignup.deploy");<p></p>
StatsD will accept and process the new data, where Graphite will begin receiving, processing and provide a visualization for this new data set.<p></p>
Since the StatsD interface is over UDP you don't have to worry about what this will do to your API or application performance, you just throw data at it....and let StatsD and Graphite do the rest.<p></p>
StatsD and Graphite introduces a very flexible environment for analytics, allowing you to track anything and everything as you roll it out.  You can track your API, widgets, forum activity, virtually anything you implement as part of your API ecosystem.<p></p>
This type of deploy and measure strategy can help you understand whether your succeeding or failing in real-time.  In the volatile world of APIs, this can mean the difference between overall success or failure with your API.

API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a Web interface -- all without writing code.
<p></p>These <a title="API explorers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API explorers</a> are making it a lot easier for developers to discover, learn, and integrate with Web APIs. I also think they have a lot more potential, beyond the developer community.
<p></p>Non-developers can use an API explorer to make calls against an API, retrieve JSON, and then use tools like Google Spreadsheets to process responses, building visualizations, and so on.
<p></p>There is a huge opportunity for API explorer providers to tap into the larger, non-developer community, and one of the easiest ways to do this may be by adding a widget layer to their applications.
<p></p>An API widget builder would have similar features to the <a title="Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/18/integrated-development-environment-ide-for-apis/">Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for APIs</a> I proposed last week:

          <strong>API Discovery</strong> - Allowing users to discover and select pre-defined selection of RESTful APIs
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Authentication</strong> - Enable HTTP Basic and oAuth authentication with APIs
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Services</strong> - Render full list available services for selected API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Request / Responses</strong> - Allow for building requests, manually sending, and seeing fresponses for selected API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Github Integration</strong> - Allow adding and connecting to both private and public Github repositories
     </li>
</ul><a title="WolframAlphas widget builder" href="http://developer.wolframalpha.com/widgetbuilder/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/wolfram-alpha/wolfram-alpha-widget-builder.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>Then I would add a new layer to the environment:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Widget Builder</strong> - Provide tools for widget discovery, creation, connecting to APIs, configuration, sandbox, and copy / paste embeddable code for syndication.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Export Tools</strong> - Ability to export any API responses to Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel, Comma Separate or Tab Separated values.
     </li>
</ul>With this type of environment, non-technical users could easily connect to APIs, mash-up responses and build widgets for embedding in their presentations, web sites, applications, and mobile devices.
<p></p>There are a couple of widget building platforms out there like <a title="Sprout Inc" href="http://sproutinc.com/">Sprout Inc</a> or <a title="Widgetbox" href="http://www.widgetbox.com/overview/">Widgetbox</a>, but I'm picturing something more like <a title="WolframAlphas Widget Builder" href="http://developer.wolframalpha.com/widgetbuilder/">WolframAlpha's widget builder</a>. Take <a title="Apigee Console" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">Apigee Console</a> and add a widget builder like WolframAlpha's, and I think you'd have something close to what I'm envisioning.
<p></p>I hope some existing API service provider or IDE developer sees the opportunities within the API space and builds a developer IDE and widget builder for APIs.

        <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/enterprise.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />APIs are hot right now. With the success of Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and others -- due in no small part to their APIs -- the enterprise space is taking notice. The demand for enterprise API services is increasing, with a number of services providers stepping up to compete for the business. As this happens, there are three major areas that may prove challenging for API service providers targeting the enterprise space:
<p></p><strong>Developers:</strong> Wide range of vendor, partner, and public developer needs and expectations.
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Open and Accessible</strong> - A public, self-service and accessible API ecosystem, with less of an enterprise feel
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation</strong> - Simple, yet complete API documentation
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Common Tools</strong> - Forums, Mobile SK, explorers and other tools developers have grown accustom to.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Monetization</strong> - The ability to make money from their work.
     </li>
</ul><strong>Business Interests:</strong> Wide variety of business interests wanting to deploy and manage APIs
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Legal</strong> - Whole new worlds of legal concerns for some companies
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Transparency</strong> - Struggles with what transparent means? And how much is too much?
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Branding</strong> - What happens to the brand? Where are pitfalls? Where are opportunities?
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Non-IT</strong> - More engagement from non-IT decision makers when deploying APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Tools</strong> - Reports, widgets and other GUI tools that allow decision makers to put APIs to work.
     </li>
</ul><strong>Enterprise IT:</strong> Sector that has high expectations when it comes to software.
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Secure</strong> - Mission critical security in all areas.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Scalable</strong> - Scalability has to be baked in.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>SLA</strong> - Service levels have to be guaranteed.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>On-Premise -</strong> Ability to deliver behind the firewall.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Private Cloud -</strong> Deploying in their private cloud infrastructure.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Public Cloud -</strong> Deploy on public cloud infrastructure.
     </li>
</ul>When it comes to providing API services to the enterprise, you have different public, vendor and partner-developer expectations -- which all may be quite different. To complicate things, you may have decisions around APIs increasingly coming from non-IT departments, bringing a whole bunch of business related concerns.
<p></p>Lastly, this is the enterprise. Things have to be solid. Web APIs have been proven in social media, cloud computing and other areas not born in the enterprise. There is just a much higher expectation over quality of service then there has been with the Twitter API and other open APIs.
<p></p>All of this will test API service providers, forcing them to deliver a unique set of tools that meet the needs of some potentially competing interests of open developers, internal and external business interests, and traditional IT decision makers.

        <a title="HAPI Hackathon" href="http://www.hapihack.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/HAPI-Hack-Weekend.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>The <a title="HAPI Hackathon" href="http://www.hapihack.com/">HAPI hackathon</a> wrapped up June 12th in San Francisco. The event brought developers together to hack on over 9 APIs in order to build something cool over the course of a weekend.
<p></p>The event started out Friday night with <a title="Tokbox" href="http://www.opentok.com/">TokBox</a>, Ebay / <a title="Paypal" href="http://x.com/">Paypal</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="http://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>, <a title="Box.net" href="http://box.net/developers">Box.net</a>, <a title="Twilio" href="http://twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, <a title="Genability" href="http://developer.genability.com/">Genability</a>, <a title="Factual" href="http://www.factual.com/">Factual</a>, and <a title="Mashery" href="http://developer.mashery.com/apis">Mashery</a> showcasing their companies and their APIs to developers.
<p></p>Next, developers lined up to pitch their ideas and generate interest amongst other participants. 10 ideas were pitched, then developers formed groups and got to work.
<p></p>Developers spent all weekend drinking coffee, eating pizza and bagels, and hacking away. Everything culminated Sunday afternoon when developers presented their hacks.
<p></p>Over sixteen hacks were presented, with prizes going to the best:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>FourSquare2Go</strong> won a Foursquare prize for their offline Foursquare application.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Energy Dashboard</strong> won both the Mashery APIs and Genabiity API prizes for their energy insight, and prediction tool.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Congress Connector</strong> won multiple Twilio API, Factual API and Ebay / Paypal API prizes for their tool that made connecting with your congressional rep easier.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Chat Living Room</strong> won a TokBox API prize with their group Youtube video chat room.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Hapidocs</strong> won a Box.net API prize for their location based file storage application.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>SoshoWise</strong> won a Ebay / Paypal API prize for their expert driven how to video application.
     </li>
</ul><a title="TokBox" href="http://www.tokbox.com/">TokBox</a> who organized the event, wanted to bring the developers together into an environment where they could make whatever they want, and offer support and prizes from nine different APIs.
<p></p>Overall the <a title="Hackathon" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/hackathons-and-contests.php">hackathon</a> was a success, with developers going home with cash and schwag, and the APIs involved generated more awareness of the services they provide.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/NetworkedHelpDesk/Networked-help-desk.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />At the <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/">Glue Conference</a> this year in Colorado, I sat on a panel called, <a title="Whats Next for APIs?" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/whats-next-for-apis/">Whats Next for APIs?</a>. In my talk, one area I focused on, was how industries would organize and put APIs to work.
<p></p>There is a growing trend within specific industries. They are coming together and pushing for standards, interoperability, and ways to work together.
<p></p>I'm seeing evidence of this within the customer service industry. An industry association called <a title="NetworkedHelpDesk.org" href="http://networkedhelpdesk.org/">NetworkedHelpDesk.org</a> is using APIs to connect together customer service applications and establish a seamless way to communicate among industry partners and vendors.
<p></p>Customer service applications are in high demand, and potentially connected with many other applications, so it is critical that they communicate and inter-operate efficiently.
<p></p>NetworkedHelpDesk.org has brought together other applications such as <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-detail.php?API_ID=1823">Twilio</a>, SugarCRM, Freshbooks, Atlassian and Zendesk, with different types of applications including ticketing systems, bug trackers, development trackers, knowledge bases, and CRM software.
<p></p>The goal of <a title="NetworkedHelpDesk.org" href="http://networkedhelpdesk.org/">NetworkedHelpDesk.org</a> is to deliver on the promise of the cloud, and enable disparate systems to collaborate with each other, using a standardized API format for the customer service industry.
<p></p>I think we'll see more industries coming together like this, to establish ways they can work together more efficiently using APIs.

        <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="Akshell" href="http://www.akshell.com/ide/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Akshell-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I recently moved my IDE off my desktop and onto the web. I'm test driving two separate web-based integrated development environments (IDE):
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Akshell" href="http://www.akshell.com/ide/">Akshell</a></strong> - I like environment, its smooth and has Github integration. But its primarily a JavaScript IDE. I met the developers and like where they are going with it.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="ShiftEdit" href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a></strong> - This is the one I'm using the most, because I work 70% of the time in PHP. I like the FTP access, but only has SVN for its repositoring integration.
     </li>
</ul>As I was working with the <a title="Dropbox API" href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers">Dropbox API</a>, <a title="Posterous API" href="http://posterous.com/api">Posterous API</a>, and <a title="Tumblr API" href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api">Tumblr API</a> today, and was thinking how nice it would be to have an IDE dedicated to APIs.
<p></p>There are several <a title="API Explorers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API explorers</a> popping up out there, that let you play with one or multiple APIs and generate requests and display responses. This is a start.
<p></p>I would like a full-blown IDE that I can add <a title="RESTful APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=196">RESTful APIs</a> to my libraries and would have all the capabilities of an explorer, but also have access to client libraries, code samples, and other features of an IDE for the APIs I use the most.
<p></p>I could integrate both my public and private Github repositories, and I could leverage the social coding available in the <a title="Github Community" href="http://www.github.com">Github community</a>.
<p></p>Switching between APIs can be a bitch, remembering what I did last time I worked with an API, where the code is, the syntax, and more. I'm also spending a lot of time using multiple APIs, in a single script. Like pulling <a title="bookmarks from Instapaper API, generating a PDF with PDF Crowd, then sending to Mimeo to have printed" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/06/read-it-later-binder-with-instaper-and-mimeo-connect/">bookmarks from Instapaper API, generating a PDF with PDF Crowd, then sending to Mimeo to have printed</a>. That is 3 separate API calls.
<p></p>I see a lot of potential for an IDE that is dedicated to the API space, an IDE that helps us developers efficiently integrate with the APIs we use most...as well as discover new APIs.

        <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/layer7-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>Two new API management platforms were launched this month. <a title="Layer 7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/products/layer-7-api-portal">Layer 7 technologies</a> launched the <a title="Layer 7 API Portal" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/products/layer-7-api-portal">Layer 7 API Portal</a>, and <a title="SOA Software" href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software</a> launched their <a title="Atmosphere API Platform" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">Atmosphere API platform</a>.
<p></p>These new platforms show the API space is really heating up in 2011. The enterprise is taking notice of the value of APIs, and service providers are lining up to compete for the business.
<p></p>These new platforms offer asimilarset of services as <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a> including:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>API Provisioning
     </li>
     <li>Metrics and Billing
     </li>
     <li>Security and Control
     </li>
     <li>Reporting and Analytics
     </li>

Each provider has their own approach to API management, but essentially accomplish the same end goal.
<p></p>I'm going to work on a better side by side comparison of Layer 7, Atmosphere, Mashery, Apigee, 3Scale and Mashape. Hopefully to help people understand what each API service providers delivers.

</ul>
The Layer 7 API portal provides all the common API management tools service providers, and developers are growing accustomed to.<p></p>
The new API portal is the latest addition to the Layer 7 family of API <a title="gateway" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/products/xml-gateway-overview">gateway</a> and <a title="cloud management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/products/cloudspan-gateways">cloud management</a> tools.  Layer 7 has been playing in the API space for a while now, but this portal represents a growing trend of API management tools targeting the enterprise.

        <a title="Posterous" href="http://www.posterous.com"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/posterous/posterous-logo.jpg" alt="" width="160" align="right" /></a><a title="Posterous" href="http://www.posterous.com">Posterous</a> recently launched a <a title="new API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/posterous-from-saas-to-paas-using-an-api/">new API</a> giving users access to all the functionality available through the Posterous web interface.
<p></p>Instead of just delivering documentation for the <a title="Posterous API" href="http://posterous.com/api">Poserous API</a>, they went a step further and made the documentation smarter, and more interactive.
<p></p>Think <a title="API Explorer" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=209">API explorer</a> meets <a title="API Documentation" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=120">API documentation</a>. The Posterous API documentation provides a list of all API services, endpoints, and methods, but it doesn't stop there.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/posterous/posterous-api-make-request.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />When logged into your Posterous account, the API documentation automatically includes your api_token, which is necessary for making API calls.
<p></p>Once authenticated you can make any call against the API right in the documentation. Each endpoint allows entry of necessary fields, displays a request URL, and a JSON response message.
<p></p>This type of interactive API documentation allows developers to learn and explore how an API works in a live environment, making real calls.
<p></p>This approach to delivering API documentation steps up the game a little bit, and the same old type of documentation may not do anymore.

<p></p>Atmosphere provides a secure, platform that companies can deploy to manage their APIs for either a private or public developer community.
<p></p>The Atmosphere platform gives API providers a management interface to define APIs using a wide range of messaging types and formats including REST/XML, REST/JSON and SOAP. The platform also provides paging and caching mechanisms to improve app performance.
<p></p>Atmosphere also provides security capabilities that allow API providers to control and monitor app's usage of the APIs. While also protecting internal applications from overload, as well as provide customers with service-level guarantee through QoS management for SLAs and quotas.
<p></p>These tools for monitoring and managing consumer contracts and traffic can also be applied to enable monetization of APIs.
<p></p>The Atmosphere API Management can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud, or a combination of the two. Providing the flexibility and scalability needed by many providers.

Its a great idea.  Perfect way to organize videos and presentations in a central location, as they are produced.  Then users can come back at anytime and learn.<p></p>
A YouTube channel for an API community could also be a great way to build community, by soliciting feedback on what type of content users want to see, or even accept submissions from your developers.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/14/the-usa-today-api-matures/">The USA Today API Matures</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="USA Today API" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://www.editorsweblog.org/usatoday.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>Back when I first started doing API reviews on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I did a review of <a title="USA Todays first release of their API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/27/usa-today-api-review/">USA Today's API</a>.<p></p>
At first I almost didn't post the review.  It was such a simple API, with nothing innovative to speak of.  It just didn't seem worth covering.<p></p>
When they first launched the <a title="USA Today API" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today API</a>, it provided services for <a title="best-selling books" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/bestselling_books">best-selling books</a>, and <a title="Sports Salaries" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/salaries">sports salaries</a>.  It wasn't very exciting.<p></p>
Fastword 10 months, and their API is looking much more robust.  Now they also offer <a title="Articles" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/articles">Articles</a>, <a title="Book Reviews" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/book_reviews">Book Reviews</a>, <a title="Breaking News" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/Breaking_News">Breaking News</a>, <a title="Movie Reviews" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/movie_reviews">Movie Reviews</a>, <a title="Music Reviews" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/music_reviews">Music Reviews</a>, and <a title="Snapshots" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/snapshots">Snapshots</a>.<p></p>
Most recently, USA Today also added<a title="US Census Data" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/Census">US census data</a> to their API offerings.<p></p>
Looking back it was easy for me to criticize the big media company for releasing such a simple API, but in reality they are doing what I feel everyond should do, start simple.<p></p>
USA Today looks like they are getting their footing with packaging up data sets and making available via their API.  This data is probably very usable by their internal teams as well as makes USA Today a potential integration partner with other applications.<p></p>
I think other news and media organizations can learn a lot by following in USA Todays footsteps, and deploy very simple APIs, learn, and slowly tackle more as you find the right approach to your API community.<p></p>
Also, I'm sure USA Today was able to tackle so successfully with the help of <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>.

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/evolution-of-distribution/IMG_0504.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Many API owners depend on their APIs for identifying new types of business models, turning their API ecosystems into research &amp; development platforms.
<p></p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/edwinaoki">Edwin Aoki</a> of Paypal and Ebay APIs also feels they can also be used by human resources(HR), to nurture and identify new developer talent. At the <a title="Mashery Evolution of Distribution" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/02/mashery-evolution-of-distribution/">Mashery Evolution of Distribution</a> event, Aoki mentioned how Ebay and Paypal use their API ecosystem for talent acquisition.
<p></p>If you think about it, your API provides a fertile ground for developer to learn about your APIs, how to code with them, and understand your companies way of doing business.
<p></p>Hopefully within your API area there are ways for developers to excel and showcase their work. Submitting code samples, applications and forum participation all give them an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/4-developers.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />And If your company, eats your own dog food and uses your APIs internally, hiring developers from your API community can provide immediate benefit to internal projects.
<p></p>Beyond internal projects, developers can also be identified and used for partner projects. Identifying rockstar developers you feel comfortable referring to your partners, is another great use of your API community.
<p></p>Another place to look for talent, is at Hackathons. Hackathons can also be fertile ground for identifying fresh new developer talent. It is place to watch developers in action, showing their skills in real-time, and demonstrate how well they work with other people.
<p></p>An API provides many ways to attract, groom, and identify talent for your company. Have you ever hired someone from your API community?

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hunch/hunch-logo.png" alt="" align="right" />Having a <a title="privacy policy on your API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=165">privacy policy on your API</a> is an important part of making it clear to developers and end-users, where your company stands in regard to their data and personal privacy.<p></p>
Just having a privacy policy is not enough, make sure it truly reflects your companies values, whats important to your users, and is in line with how you deploy your technology.<p></p>
One shining example of this in the API space, is <a title="Hunch" href="http://hunch.com/">Hunch</a>.  Hunch's provides a  'Taste Graph' of the entire web, providing information on what people like;  anything, from books to electronic gadgets to fashion or vacation spots.<p></p>
Hunch is combining algorithmic machine learning with user-curated content, with the goal of providing better recommendations for everyone.  The information they provide through their web application and API, is extremely valuable, as well as potentially very private.<p></p>
<a title="Hunch's API Privacy Policy" href="http://hunch.com/developers/v1/docs/privacy/">Hunch's API privacy policy</a> articulates their position very clearly:
<blockquote><em>Hunch takes our users' privacy very seriously. When using the API, Hunch returns predictions for users within the Taste Graph. Certain API calls can be made for any user, while other calls require the user to Hunch Connect before predictions will be returned. Our guiding principle for this distinction is whether the user's likes or facts about themselves are already made public on the internet.</em></blockquote>
Obviously the privacy of their users is very important, and they back this up by using <a title="OAuth" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=184">OAuth</a> as it is meant to be used.  Giving users granular level control over who has access to their sensitive data,  while still providing other, non-sensitive, rich data without authentication.<p></p>
Hunch has a clear vision of API and data privacy in a space, where there is a lot of potential for abuse.  An example that many other API providers should follow.<p></p>
Also make sure and check out the <a title="privacy policy on their main site" href="http://hunch.com/info/privacy-policy/">privacy policy for their main site</a>, they really lay it out honestly, and in plain english. I wish more technology providers would approach privacy this way.<p></p>
<strong>Update: </strong> From my girl <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a> @ <a title="RWW" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com">RWW</a>: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/chris_dixon_hunch_taste_graphs_the_link_between_le.php">Dixon made it clear that despite Hunch's ability to predict users' tastes that the company would never sell that data. "We have never made a data deal," said Dixon. Furthermore, people can only get predictive information about themselve</a>s.

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2011</span>
        <a href="http://appstores.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/Appstores.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>When I review a new API, I take a look at the technology they provide, but I tend to focus on the business of their API.<p></p>
One area I look at, is what tools they use to deliver the <a title="building blocks that make of their API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks that make up their API</a>.  Did they build it themselves?   Did they use <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a> or <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a>?  Are they using other open-source tools or a software as a service (SaaS) provider?<p></p>
I'm always on the look out for new open-source tools or services providers that can be leveraged for APIs in this way.  My goal is to find an open-source solution or service provider for <a title="each one of the building blocks i have defined" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">each one of the building blocks I have defined</a>.  Some examples are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="API documentation with SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/api-documentation/">API documentation with SDK Bridge</a></li>
	<li><a title="API forums with Get Satisfaction" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/30/api-forums-using-get-satisfaction/">API forums with Get Satisfaction</a></li>
	<li><a title="Application Showcase with AppStores.com" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/08/a-white-label-api-appstore-platform/">Application Showcase with AppStores.com</a></li>
</ul>
I like to have an open-source tool available for each building block, but having a solid company that can deliver specialized services for a API, and have them up and running instantly is even better.<p></p>
Some characteristics I look for in a service provider are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Self-service </strong>- Instant registration and activation of services.</li>
	<li><strong>Branding</strong> - The ability to brand and make look like your API area.</li>
	<li><strong>Tiered Pricing </strong>- A pay as you go model allowing small companies to try out first, then grow as needed.</li>
	<li><strong>DNS</strong> - Ability to point subdomain at service, to keep with a single company domain.</li>
	<li><strong>Support</strong> - Quality support from self-service forum to someone you can talk to.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus</strong> - Delivering a high quality service ina  single area, and not trying to be everything to everyone.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Portability</strong> - The ability to take <strong>ALL</strong> of your data with you when you are ready to leave is critical.</li>
</ul>
These are just a few of the key strengths I look for when finding <a title="API Tool" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/category/tools/">API tool</a> and <a title="service providers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/category/services/">service providers</a>.<p></p>
As an example, take a look at <a title="AppStores.com" href="http://appstores.com/">AppStores.com</a>, they have almost everything I look for in a <a title="building block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building block</a> service provider.  They are still working on the self-service and tiered pricing aspects, but its at least on their roadmap.<p></p>
Do you have any open-source tools or software as a service providers that you use to deliver your API?

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/12/api-proxies-connectors-and-addons/">API Proxies, Connectors, and Add-Ons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2011</span>
        I'm working through some 100K views of the API service provider arena, and trying to evolve my perspectives of <a title="Whats Next for APIs" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/whats-next-for-apis/">Whats Next for APIs</a>.<p></p>
This is all a work in progress, so I'm publishing here on <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://www.kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> instead of on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>.<p></p>
I wrote the other day about the <a title="Battle for Your API Proxy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/11/the-battle-for-your-api-proxy/">Battle for Your API Proxy</a> between the API service providers.<p></p>
This included a tier of "proxy" API service providers that run all your APIs through proxy before hitting your API.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/proxy-connector/APIProxy.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /><p></p>
Next there are the group of "connector" API service providers that provide you with a connector to put in your API and provide the same services that a proxy would.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/proxy-connector/APIConnector.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /><p></p>
Based upon what I'm seeing with Mashape and other indicators, I tried to show the playing field in a slightly different, and evolved way.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/proxy-connector/Proxy-PerfectWorld.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /><p></p>
My vision of the future of APIs involves several key areas of evolution. These are based upon movements I'm already seeing, and where I'd like to see things go.<p></p>
In this vision API service providers don't just provide proxy, connector, management, developer area tools, and API marketplaces. They also provide actual API frameworks for APIs like Mashape provides, as well industry wide developer opportunities.<p></p>
Developers can build code against a single API, or multiple APIs, they can build tools for API owners to deploy in their own management, developer areas as well as within the "proxy" or "connector" layer too. Service providers will provide developers with distribution opportunities to other marketplaces and API owners.<p></p>
API Owners will not be locked into a single API service provider for their API, Management, Proxy, Connector, Developer or Marketplace needs. They will have a buffet of add-ons they can choose from to enhance every aspect of their API ecosystem.<p></p>
One key difference is that API owners can choose to proxy or connect their API, or both if necessary for different services.<p></p>
This model provide sadd-ons at every layer of the API ecosystem. If a developer builds a set of tools for video streaming, it can be deployed at the proxy / connector, management, API, and developers area. Billing for a video API might look radically different then billing for a print API.<p></p>
This will provide the type of innovation that is needed at this stage of the game. A nice selection of tools for API owners to choose from, with service provider and developers making money.<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Jun 2011</span>
        Every Web API is designed to receive requests from and respond to the outside world.<p></p>
Every day an API can receive thousands or potentially millions of calls. Before the API can process these requests and returns a response, it has to potentially tackle a huge laundry list of functionalities:
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/traffic-lights.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Identity / Authentication</li>
	<li>Traffic Controls</li>
	<li>Rate Limiting</li>
	<li>Performance</li>
	<li>Security</li>
	<li>Scalability</li>
	<li>Filtering</li>
	<li>Encryption</li>
	<li>Logging</li>
</ul>
Once all these items are handled, then the API can do what it is designed to do -- process its payload and return a response.<p></p>
Many API owners tackle all these layers of the API themselves. But there are also several service providers out their looking to do this for them.<p></p>
The first group of API service providers in this area use what I call the Proxy Flow Through, and this includes <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a> and <a href="http://www.apigee.com/">Apigee</a>.  Mashery and Apigee deliver these service by routing all calls to an API through their proxy.   Each call actually is made to <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a> and <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, then they route the request to the actual API for a response.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ProxyFlowThrough.png" alt="" width="500" align="center " /><p></p>
The second group of API service providers in this area, use what I call the Proxy Connector, and this includes <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/04/mashape-api-service-provider/">Mashape</a>.  <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and <a href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> deliver these services by providing a connector your API can use to communicate with the proxy during each call.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ProxyConnector.png" alt="" width="500" align="center " /><p></p>
<a href="http://www.apigee.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/apigee-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>All of these service providers end up delivering a similar set of services.  This proxy, whether flow through or connector tackle the needs listed above, but then also provide much needed data on API operations.  Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale provide you with tools for monitoring and analyzing this operational data.<p></p>
There is a lot at stake here.  The next wave of Internet growth will pass through these proxies. More API owners are turning to these providers to deliver this layer, where all usage of the API from web apps, mobile apps, and other devices developed internally, by partners and the public will pass through these proxies.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.mashery.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Mashery-Logo.gif" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>These proxies are becoming brokers in the API economy.   Each service provider is competing, for the ability to proxy your web API and be your broker in this new economy.<p></p>
Mashery, Apigee, and 3Scale all provide some very robust services via their proxy, Apigee even offers their proxy technology as an on-premise appliance.<p></p>
Newcomer Mashape does not provide a full suite of services via their proxy, like the others, but Mashape is taking a different approach, by introducing an add-on layer within their proxy.   There are only two add-ons available (billing, rate limit) currently, but this concept opens up an entirely new type of marketplace for the entire API industry, not just a single API.  Developers can now build specialized tools to sell, and push forward whats possible within a proxy.  This proxy add-on layer also has potential for allowing a more a la carte set of services available to API owners.<a href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/3Scale-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><p></p>
The demand for API proxies is growing, and each service provider is pushing the definition of what it means to proxy your API. Mashery, Apigee, 3Scale, Mashape and others are working hard to define the space, push it forward, while also winning market-share.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.mashape.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>One might compare this playing field to the competition between database service providers of the last two decades, where companies like Microsoft and Oracle battled it out for market share. There are many differences for sure, but with the amount of information and value running through APIs, the parallels to database choices are there -- except I still don't see the MySQL of API proxies as of yet.
