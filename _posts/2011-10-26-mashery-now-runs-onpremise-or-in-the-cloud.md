Last week [Mashery][1] rolled out a new on-premise version of their API management proxy.  A solution meant to address a common concern of IT and API owners, that when using Mashery, all of their data and resources run through the Mashery proxy in the cloud.  This concern can be a show stopper for many companies.

Until this last week, Mashery had four API management solutions that all ran in the cloud.

Now Mashery has separated the proxy portion of their traffic manager into two offerings, one for the cloud and one for on-premise.

Mashery has bundled the new Mashery Cloud and Mashery Local with their existing API Traffic, API Analytics
