{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m building a small API that I want to allow developers to register for.I don’t want to make it a complicated registration process, I just want them to provide some sort of credentials and I will issWue a key that they can use to make API calls.To keep it simple I’m offering a login using a Github account.Every developer has a Github account right?Well if they don’t, they should.</p>
