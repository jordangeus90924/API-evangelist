{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im reading all the starred items in my Google Reader about Googles latest closing of APIs, most notably Google Translate API.There are some pretty sensational headlines: Google pulls the rug out from under web service API developers, nixes Google Translate and 17 others GOOGLE IS NOT YOUR DADDY (OR LONG TERM RELIANCE ON APIS IS AS BAD AS OUTSOURCING) Google Translate API to Go Kaputt in December I dont feel the need to defend Google here, I wish to only defend APIs against people blaming them for what is the fault or responsibility of developers and API owners.I see this same line of attacks on APIs anytime an API company makes a change in their strategy, and developers freak out!First, lets start with the claims that developers are having the rug pulled out from under them, and you cant build a business on APIs!This week I was fortunate enough to hear Mark Suster of GRP Partners talk at Gluecon on Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years.</p>
