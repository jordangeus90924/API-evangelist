{% include JB/setup %}<p>It was inevitable.API Evangelist now has its own API.I had a couple partners ask for more sophisticated access than provided by RSS or JSON dumps out of my platform.Â So I launched a handful of API endpoints, allowing you to get at information from my world.I currently have 13 endpoints providing access to the core of my platform, in 8 key areas: APIs - Name, logo and description of the 2K APIs Im activtely monitoring API Stack - Access to my weekly and monthly API stacks Analysis (Blog) - Access to my entire blog catalog Service Providers - Access to all API service providers I track Tools - A full catalog of all the API tools Ive found Curated News - Title and links of news that I personally curate from my 2K+ feeds Notes - Notes I make during my daily and weekly curation Building Blocks - The common building blocks Ive identified after looking at 2K top APIs There is a lot more data behind my firewall that I want to open up.</p>
