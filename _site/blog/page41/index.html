<p><em>This is a guest post from one of our sponsors. We didn&rsquo;t vet them as a sponsor, or the content they were going to write. We just cashed their check on the way to the strip club this evening, and gave the a Wordpress login, so they could post their post.</em></p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t in the business of understanding where the actual technology space is headed, we are in the business of telling you stories of where we want the technology space go, in the service our own selfish desires. You see we view technology blogs as a PR urinal for us to piss our stories into, so we all can pretend like they are real stories.</p>
<p>Our technology is a cloud based REST-like hypermedia API micro services framework, that is deployed in a web-scale, reactive, docker containerized environment that run anywhere in the cloud or on-premise within your infrastructure, or a hybrid of the two. Our technology is priced to serve you, so just let us know what you want to do with it and we&rsquo;ll make up some price that we think you will pay.</p>
<p>Our product is what you need, and we are so convinced that we won&rsquo;t even bother making up a story, we&rsquo;ll just blow smoke straight up your ass. Since all of the tech blogs allow us to pay for the posting of our moose diarrhea, in your eyes, as a loyal reader and consumer of this shit, our technology immediately validated, solidifying it as the way of the future&mdash;it is the way it is, there is no denying the future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/flare"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/eclipse/eclipse-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Another layer to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">release of Codenvy this week</a>, was the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20141027_cloud_initiative.php">announcement of the Eclipse project Che</a>, an open source "project to create a platform for SAAS developer environment that contains all of the tools, infrastructure, and processes necessary for a developer to edit, build, test, and debug an application&rdquo;.  Che represents the next generation IDE that runs in the cloud, which coincides with other signs I've seen around <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> moving into the IDE with signals from API pioneers like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-with-the-developers-ide/">SalesForce&nbsp;and Google</a>, or from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">Microsoft in Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about Che, but I&rsquo;m beginning to see two distinct ways Che and APIs can be employed. First lets start with the environment:</p>
<blockquote><em>You can build extensions for Che, and when those extensions are compiled into the kernel, Che creates server-side microservices, a RESTful API, and cross-browser optimized JavaScript, which is then pluggable into a browser IDE. With Che, developers are given the pluggable structure of Eclipse, but accessible through a cloud environment.</em></blockquote>
<p>This means you can orchestrate development workflows, with APIs. You can predefine, deploy, customize, maintain and orchestrate very modular development environment where everything can be controlled via API. What a perfect environment for orchestrating the next generation of application development.</p>
<p>Next I see APIs leading the development lifecycle as well, not just defining the development environment and process. Earlier stories I&rsquo;ve done on API discovery via SDKs, showcase SaleForce and Google providing native discovery of their APIs directly in Eclipse. In an Eclipse Che driven development environment, you could define pre-built, or custom API stacks, bringing exactly the API resources developers will need and bake them directly into their IDE&mdash;meaning APIs find the developers, developers don&rsquo;t have to find their own APIs.</p>
<p>This approach to API discovery via the IDE provides some various interesting opportunity for marrying with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">earlier thoughts I&rsquo;ve had around being an API broker</a>. I can envision a future where API evangelism evolves to a point where you don&rsquo;t just represent one API, you can represent many APIs, and configure API fueled developer environments for building any type of application. Think of what <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers like Parse and Kinvey</a> have been doing since 2011, but now think of pre-configured, or custom tailored IDE environments with exactly the resources you need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting started with <a href="http://docs.codenvy.com/che/">Che</a>, and <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, so it will take me a while to work through my thoughts on using it as an API brokerage platform. The one thing you can count on me for, is that I will tell stories all along the way as I figure it out.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/10/28/evolving-beyond-just-resources-towards-a-more-experience-based-api-design/">Evolving Beyond Just Resources Towards A More Experience Based API Design</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-experience-design.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I really love the thought process around API design, and I am always looking for ways to push forward my craft. Telling stories is one way I do this, forcing me to make what I&rsquo;m doing understandable to a wider audience, which is also the exact thing I&rsquo;m trying to do with my API designs&mdash;mind blown!</p>
<p>An example of this in action is with my link API, which I use in multiple places across my API monitoring system. The Link API has a pretty basic design, that reflect the resource, and its underlying database structure:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/link/ (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li>
<li>Title, Description, and URL</li>
</ul>
<p>I use this API in numerous ways, the original API design is very much based upon the resource that it is, a link. As a developer who understands REST, and very much comes from a world of databases, this works just fine. However much of the magic around my usage of links is defined in my code, and not in my API interface, something I&rsquo;d like to change.</p>
<p>After having two separate conversations with folks about my link API, I experienced two very different motivations on using said link system, and came with very different perspectives on how to use mu ink API, that had nothing to do with the database or resource this API was born from.</p>
<p><strong>Archival Motivations</strong> <br />One person I discussed my link API with wants to use it for archiving a link. When they pass the link to an API, if it isn't already recorded it logs the URL, and then grabs a screenshot of the page, as well as stores any HTML content present. This could be a one time archive, or they could also pass a parameter that would set up a daily, weekly or monthly archive to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Harvesting Desires <br /></strong>The second person I discussed my link API with wants to use for harvesting of specific things from the page, and in this particular conversation it was to harvest all other links available on the page. You would pass the URL to the API, and get back a list of URLs available on the page. The only setting was to filter and return only URLs that contained the base URL of the URL being passed to the API (mouthful of URL).</p>
<p><strong>Pushing My Resources To Deliver Experiences </strong><br />This story reflects why I feel that companies should hurry up and begin their API journey, so they can begin moving beyond just APIs designed based upon the resources as they exist, to more of an experience based focus, designing APIs that deliver &nbsp;the solutions that people desire. Both of these folks I talked to were not programmers, and only understand APIs enough to be dangerous. They understand the basic CRUD abilities I gave with my resource design, but it doesn't excite them or really mean anything. What really motivates them was satisfying a specific need that fits in with their experiences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working on what this new set of APIs will look like based upon these thoughts, but I wanted to tell the story of this slight shift in my API design thinking. It is extremely difficult to see API design this way unless you are actively on your API journey, having discussions with people who want to use your APIs. It is easy for us developers to get caught up in perfectly defining our API resources from the technical perspective, when in reality the most important part of the journey seems to me is all about learning to craft APIs that deliver meaningful experiences, not serving up just services&mdash;experience oriented architecture over service oriented architecture.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://quandl.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/quandl/quandl-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">benefits of APIs over download of data stores</a> in the government space, and I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for other interesting examples of making data available via an API, as well as a full data download. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of research right now on the financial API space, and <a href="http://blog.quandl.com/blog/quandls-first-premium-databases/">stumbled across Quandl</a>, a data provider who has free access financial data APIs, while also selling access to premium databases.</p>
<p>Quandl has <a href="http://blog.quandl.com/blog/quandls-first-premium-databases/">aggregated 7 financial and economic databases into one database solution that you can pay to download</a>, or you can freely access via their unlimited use API--Quandl puts it like this:</p>
<blockquote><em>All these new premium databases will of course automatically benefit from Quandl&rsquo;s free data-usage features: unrestricted API access, integration with 20+ libraries and tools, unlimited downloads in any format, multiple export and visualization options, and more. (Needless to say, the addition of these premium databases to Quandl will not change the &ldquo;free Quandl experience&rdquo; in any way. All data and all features that are currently available for free on Quandl, will remain free forever.)</em></blockquote>
<p>It is an interesting approach to monetizing database assets, while also making freely available via an API. I&rsquo;m not exactly clear on what you get in database vs. the API with Quandl, but now that I have the &ldquo;building block&rdquo; identified, I will keep an eye out for other API providers who are doing similar things. Right now I&rsquo;m just looking at financial, banking, payment, and other commerce APIs, but I&rsquo;m sure there are other data providers doing similar things.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://blog.snapchat.com/post/99998266095/third-party-applications-and-the-snapchat-api"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/snapchat/snapchat-logo-transparent.png" alt="" width="220" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had several browser tabs open around the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-snapchat-future-security-idUSKCN0I32UJ20141014">recent Snapchat security breach</a>, hoping to craft an API-centric story around the whole affair. I think <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/readyapi/security-lessons-courtesy-of-snapchat/">SmartBear covers the security lesson around the Snapchat breach well</a>, my motivation in writing a story would be more about incentivizing popular mobile platforms like Snapchat to establish a robust approach to APIs, and provide a platform for everyone discuss the tech, business, and politics of application integration, rather than keeping it all in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>Your Application Programming Interface Surface Is Publicly Available</strong><br /> As I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/07/mapping-the-world-of-internal-apis-via-rogue-api-registry/">play with tools like Charles</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">API tools</a>, and other proxy and application traffic management tools, I can easily map out the surface area of any iPhone application I have installed&mdash;providing me with a blueprint of an API, and potentially its underlying data model. If I can do this for your mobile app, you have a public API, regardless of how you view the world.</p>
<p><strong>Bring More Awareness, Control, Security, And Stability To Platform</strong><br /> The benefits of have a public API approach to delivering a public mobile application gives you a new layer to understand how not just your mobile app is using resources, it gives you a central channel for al mobile, web, and Internet of Things apps to use. An API focus gives you a central point to log how resources are being access and put to use, introduce analytics, monitoring, and other vital security components into operations. There are a wealth of API management services available on the Internet, and having an API management strategy can open up a company to a wealth of vital resources across an application's lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimize 3rd Party Developers With A Modern API Platform</strong><br /> The 3rd party developer who was responsible for the latest Snapchat breach was not given official access to Snapchat APIs, because there is not formal API program. If there was a Snapchat API platform program, users could request access, and the platform could still deny acess to anyone they wished, and all applications would have to adhere to a standardized approach to dealing with identity, and access management for all resources. With a modern approach to API management, developers can be legitimized, while also providing a more secure perimeter to keep rogue applications from gaining access, and compromising privacy and security.</p>
<p><strong>Empower End-Users With Identity And Access Control (oAuth)</strong><br /> If you have a public mobile app available today, you owe it to your end-users to provide them with the latest in account management, and tools for managing who has access to their data. If you need a model for where the bar should be set, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/06/05/google-accounts-as-blueprint-for-all-software-as-a-service-applications/">go look at what Google does</a>. Modern approaches to API management, along with a common approach to using oAuth, provides the tools all mobile application users should have, allowing them to help contribute to their own security.  End-users need to be aware that they should only use mobile applications that provide API access, and oAuth controls, allowing them to take control over their digital footprint, and play an active role.</p>
<p>APIs are not a cure-all. I'm not prescribing APIs because they fix everything. I&rsquo;m prescribing APIs because it provides a layer where a platform, its users, 3rd party developers, and the public can come together and make sure any platform is seriously addressing security and privacy. APIs aren't just about innovation and all that bullshit you hear from us in Silicon Valley, they are about providing the access, and tools necessary to strike a balance in providing remote access (aka mobile) to wide variety of partners, 3rd party developers, all in support of end-users.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.snapchat.com/post/99998266095/third-party-applications-and-the-snapchat-api">Snapchat issued a response to all the API discussion on their blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>It takes time and a lot of resources to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem. That&rsquo;s why we haven&rsquo;t provided a public API to developers and why we prohibit access to the private API we use to provide our service. Don't get us wrong - we're excited by the interest in developing for the Snapchat platform - but we're going to take our time to get it right. Until then, that means any application that isn't ours but claims to offer Snapchat services violates our Terms of Use and can&rsquo;t be trusted.</em></blockquote>
<p>It does take time to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem, but with the proven blueprints already in existence, and a growing number of API service providers, it doesn't take a lot of resource. What Snapchat and other mobile providers lack is a healthy awareness of not just the tech of APIs, but also the critical business and political aspects of API operations, and just putting their head in the sand and pretending like these issues do not exist.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/api-management.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you have a publicly available mobile application, you have a publicly available API, and you should possess a modern API management strategy to protect the privacy and security of your end-users. How open you make access to this API is up to you, but I encourage you to make it as open as possible, providing transparency into security, and platform operations.  I don't feel like this is something state or federal government should be enforcing, but is something that should be the acceptable approach to delivering public applications, something that is enforced by end-users be educated about avoiding web and mobile applications that do not have an API, and this transparent approach, demonstrating they have each users privacy and security in mind.</p>
<p>What has happened to Snapchat will continue to happen to other companies, with an increased frequency. You can greatly mitigate the risks of having a public web or mobile application, with a formal API strategy, and <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/readyapi/security-lessons-courtesy-of-snapchat/">listening to security advice from providers like SmartBear</a>, as well as protecting the interests of your end-users.  If you do not have the expertise on staff at your company or organization, let me know, I can help point you in the right direction to find the resources you will need.</p>

<p>I just finished going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and recording some information about each of the providers in my API monitoring system. When I started looking through my stack a couple days ago there was 830 companies listed, and after this pass through I carved the stack down to 690--why?</p>
<p><strong>APIs Go Away</strong><br /> It is a fact of life, APIs go away. I'm always amazed at how quickly an API will disappear or just fall into disrepair. I don&rsquo;t have time to assess what exactly has happened to all APIs, but if I get 404s, or can't find signs of an API program in 10 seconds, and a quick Google search, I pull them from the stack. I've noticed many start-ups seem to be coming out with a slick mobile app + API, and then a few months later the API seems to disappear. I'll start tracking on things better, and see if I can&rsquo;t produce some better examples to discuss this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Raising The Bar</strong><br /> As I look at hundreds of APIs, and try to get familiar with them, I can't help but get frustrated by certain things, something that inevitably raises the bar of what I include in my API stack, all along the way. Sometimes I'll notice an API is actually a SOAP web service, or after playing with I find it very difficult to navigate, on-board, and actually put to use. Whatever the reasons I will remove some companies from the stack, and while I will still be keeping an eye on what they are doing (or not doing), the API is not something I'm looking to shine a light on as part of my stack.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding The Docs</strong><br /> One thing I feel like I keep coming across as I look through APIs, are companies pulling back their API documentation. As with APIs going away, I don't always have details about what types of documentation were available historically (something that is changing), so it is hard to tell if an API had docs, then moved them behind a password protected area. Regardless, if I can&rsquo;t learn about an API, without registering for yet another account, you aren't in the stack. I will not be requesting access, signing up for, or begging you for the opportunity to learn about, and showcase your API.</p>
<p><strong>API Is A Priority</strong><br /> Your API is not a &ldquo;support entry&rdquo;, or &ldquo;advanced feature&rdquo;. Your API is the next step in the evolution of your companies online presence. While I may still showcase some seemingly dysfunctional APIs, usually there is other value present there, otherwise I wouldn't be highlighting a company's effort. If your API is buried deep within your CMS, or barely a footnote in your online presence, it is likely I won't be talking about it. You can tell sites where APIs are a priority, because they have portals available at http://developer.example.com, modern API documentation, simple sub-domains like http://api.example.com for their APIs, and a link to APIs in the header or footer navigation for a site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my API Stack will grow and shrink over time, and new APIs will come, and others will mature and be put back into the stack. Right now <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack is just a list of 690 companies doing interesting things with APIs</a>, and some basic details, with links to their efforts. I&rsquo;m working to better defining the over 100 business categories these companies exist in, as well as better define each API resource they possess, and I'm looking to continue providing a better defined API stack.</p>
<p>In 2014 when it comes to APIs I&rdquo;m a little more focused on quality, than quantity.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzly-square.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just finished going through <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and looking for one simple thing&mdash;the base URL for each of their APIs. Throughout the process I looked at almost 700 API developer areas, trying to find the base URL they are using to serve up some of the most valuable API resources publicly available on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Accepting The Madness</strong><br /> When you look at 700 APIs, you have to wade through a lot of madness. When I'm looking at APIs, I&rsquo;m looking for more than just a perfectly designed API from a technical perspective, I&rsquo;m interested in value, presentation, and other more meaningful aspects. Often times I will overlook your base URL, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop me from taking note of some of the crazy domains, and subdomains people are using to provide access to their API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Patterns For Base URL</strong><br /> Once you wade through the madness, and start looking for the strongest patterns for base URLs applied across the API space, it is easy to see that two of the most common approaches are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>api.example.com -</strong> Pretty simple, common, and current approach to pointing a subdomain to a company&rsquo;s API resources.</li>
<li><strong>example.com/api -</strong> When you don&rsquo;t have control over setting up subdomains, a simple API folder is next in line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subdomain for a company&rsquo;s API effort says a lot. When you do not put much thought into the path for your API program, it demonstrates that you will probably not put a lot into your overall API effort. A subdomain may not seem like much on the surface, but it consistently provides a barometer for other things that are going on, as I wade through these APIs.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm consistently seeing, is that many API providers assume that API consumers will understand the the API is available at the root domain, and referencing /api/v1/ as a root, without directly stating the base URL is http://example.com/api/v1/. It is not a punishable offense, but something that reflects the short-sighted, siloed world that many API providers operate within.</p>
<p><strong>A Distributed, Programmable Web</strong><br /> After identifying the strongest patterns for base URLs, the next layer of domain usage, that I found interesting, was the use of account or user based, network, and geographic based subdomain API access:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>[user].example.com -</strong> A dynamic subdomain based upon a users account, allowing for API access centered around a user&rsquo;s platform account.</li>
<li><strong>[network].example.com -</strong> A select group of network, and CDN locations. Sometimes they were based upon AWS regions like east and west coast, and other times just providing DNS redundancy with know clear geographic intent.</li>
<li><strong>[geo].example.com -</strong> Other times you would clarity in assigning API domains based upon geographic regions like US, UK, and German specific locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have three motivations in telling this story, 1) for my own education, 2) encourage more consistent patterns amongst API providers, and 3) work to understand where things might be going. I think the use of a user account, network, and geographic centered URL for your API, tells something about where things might be headed. I think that your API access will be tailored just for you by delivering virtualized containers, just for your account (you can pay for more performance), that may run on specific networks, and in specific geographic regions, as the API world move forward.</p>
<p>As I struggle to deal with the madness I'm finding across base URLs for APis, and enjoying it greatly when I come across more standard approaches, but what is really interesting me is trying to better understand how we are going to scale all of this to better meet the needs of developers, end-users, and keep pace with changes like we are seeing with the Internet of Things. How do we keep things up and running, stable, while also meeting the terms or service of online platforms, ensure security across numerous 3rd party developers, while also keeping the privacy and interests of end-users in mind?</p>
<p>In the future I can see terms of service (TOS) negotiations at the API level for each user, support in their personal needs, and keep API traffic isolated in a particular region, or via a particular network base upon a countries laws, all the way to delivering on an individual citizens wishes. For now, all I can do is try to understand what is going on, and hope for a future where this type of scalability, regionalization, and interoperability is truly a reality.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/kimono-labs-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am tracking on around 2500 companies who are doing interesting things in the API space. Out of these companies about 1000 of them have blogs, which for me is a pretty important signal. About 1/4 of these companies with blogs, do not have an RSS feed, which in 2014 seems a little odd to me, but maybe I'm an old timer.</p>
<p>I believe that a blog is one of the most important signals, any API provider come put out, right alongside Twitter and Github. Historically I depend on the Twitter account for these RSS-less blogs, but now I'm taking a different path, and using <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono Labs</a> to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Using the Kimono Labs Chrome extension, I just visit the main blog page for one of these companies, and select the title of the first blog post. Kimono gives me the ability to name this field, which I usually just call &ldquo;title&rdquo;. Since the title is a link, Kimono also associates the link to the blog post, along with each title. You could also highlight the summary text, but I don&rsquo;t need this, as I have secondary processes that runs and pulls the full content of a blog post, as well as the timestamp, author, and taking of a screenshot.</p>
<p>Within a couple of seconds, using Kimono Labs, I now have an API for each companies blog, assuming the role RSS would normally play. When I have time each week, I will generate an API for the most important companies I'm tracking on. Maybe someday I will close the entire blog syndication gap for the companies I track on, but for now its nice to be able to tackle the most high value companies, and know that I have a viable solution to the problem with <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono Labs</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-api-docs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">visual API documentation</a> a few months back, after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">I looked at the approach from OpenFDA</a>, and now after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/dwolla-using-slate-for-an-evolved-api-documentation-experience/">taking a look at the value Slate brings to API providers like Dwolla</a>, these feelings are re-surfacing in my mind. Since I have limited time, I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at putting my ideas out there, allowing anyone to step up and execute on opportunities I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space&mdash;I just do not need the extra work.</p>
<p>I love me some <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>, as you can tell from the fact that all of my APIs use <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger as the API definition format</a>, as well Swagger UI for the interactive documentation. I&rsquo;m pretty convinced of the importance of documentation being a hands-on experience, but after looking at approaches like OpenFDA, and Dwolla with their Slate driven API docs, I&rsquo;m convinced they should also be more beautiful and functional.</p>
<p>Let me explain what I would like to see developed for the API space:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Definition Core -</strong> As we are beginning to see across the space with current interactive API documentation practices, everything needs to be driven by a machine readable API definition, providing a set of instructions for how any user will engage with an API.</li>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-endpoint-visualization.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<li><strong>Interactive - </strong>In 2014 the bar is already set, and API documentation should be interactive, allowing users to make live calls to a demo, or production API, making learning about an API hands-on experience. </li>
<li><strong>Inline Code - </strong>The tools are available to generate code samples from Swagger and API Blueprint, and wherever we make an API call, we should also be able see the code for making the call inline, side-by-side with wherever I am engaging with the API&mdash;in my language of choice please!</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations -</strong> I don&rsquo;t want just to get back a response from the API, I want to be able to visualize the value returned from an API. I would like a suite of <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js visualizations</a> for each API endpoint I&rsquo;m interacting with, allowing me to immediately see the value generated by each API.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet - </strong>Allow me to export a CSV, or more robust Excel or Google Spreadsheet representation of an API. Sure, this would not be applicable to all APIs, but would bring a lot of value to many APIs out there. APIs aren&rsquo;t just for developers in 2014. Oh, and make me the D3.js code for any visualization too copy &amp; paste as well.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable - </strong>I enjoy being able to deploy my Swagger UI to any Github repository using Github Pages, and I think portability is essential for the success of API engagement. I want to be able to copy &amp; paste API expressions, visualizations, and other simple, easy to use widgets to any site, anywhere&mdash;no coding experience necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source -</strong> If you are building something like what I&rsquo;m describing, it really should be open source so that all aspects of it can be reused, by anyone, anywhere. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to be a proprietary, closed solution, and you if are building something in this way you owe me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$1 million dollars</span> for my ideas. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/slate/slate-tripit.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API docs have become much more than just API documentation, they have become about API discovery, education, expression, collaborations, and interactions, going way beyond just our grandfathers way of documenting an API.  We have the language (Swagger &amp; API Blueprint) to describe our APIs, lets begin providing more meaningful ways to engage with them as well.</p>
<p>If you would like to, or are already building any of these features I&rsquo;m laying out, feel free to connect with me, and I'm happy to provide feedback anywhere during the design, development, and implementation&mdash;just let me know what you need.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m a demanding bitch in the API space, expecting people to do this work for me, but the space needs it. Thanks for building it! ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://docs.dwolla.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm liking the new&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.dwolla.com">Dwolla's new API docs</a>&nbsp;that they just launched. They are using an <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">open source API documentation framework called Slate</a>, developed by <a href="https://www.tripit.com">Tripit</a>, for their own API documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoy seeing the different directions that providers take with their API docs.  Slate's approach is a different path than we've been seeing with interactive docs using frameworks like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, but provides a very intuitive, elegant documentation experience which includes code samples tailored to each API endpoint.</p>
<p>Here are the features Slate lists on the Github repository for the project:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Clean, Intuitive Design - T</strong>he description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side. Inspired by Stripe's and Paypal's API docs. Slate is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even print.</li>
<li><strong>Everything On A Single Page - </strong>Gone are the days where your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed link-ability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.</li>
<li><strong>Slate Is Just Markdown - </strong>When you write docs with Slate, you're just writing Markdown, which makes it simple to edit and understand. Everything is written in Markdown &mdash; even the code samples are just Markdown code blocks!</li>
<li><strong>Write Code Samples In Multiple Languages &mdash;</strong>&nbsp;If your API has bindings in multiple programming languages, you easily put in tabs to switch between them. In your document, you'll distinguish different languages by specifying the language name at the top of each code block, just like with Github Flavored Markdown!</li>
</ul>
<p>Slate provides some pretty interesting tools for any API documentation toolbox. I also really like that they are Github-centric, acknowledging that many API providers will use Github Pages when deploying their docs, adding that <em>"Not only does this mean you get free hosting for your docs with Github Pages, but it also makes it's simple for other developers to make pull requests to your docs if they find typos or other problems.&rdquo; - s</em>omething I thoroughly enjoy across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.dwolla.com"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-api-docs.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>It looks like to me (maybe I&rsquo;m wrong) that the code samples are hand written? Something that could easily be remedied using Swagger. It would be way cool to see a Swagger and API Blueprint generated version of Slate emerge&mdash;merging the Slate experience, with the interactive documentation experience we&rsquo;ve seen evolve over the last couple years. This way your docs would be elegant, interactive, and very utilitarian with the inline code samples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice job <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>!</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/consistent-api-program-domains.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I know that some of my readers are URI experts, URL ninjas, and masters of the domain, but most of my readers are not, and I wanted to share some of the 100K view of what I see across the world of domains, in the API space. I&rsquo;m going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a> over the last couple days (continuing this weekend), looking at 800+ companies who have APIs, and after going through roughly half, I&rsquo;m seeing some seriously crazy practices for crafting URIs for APIs programs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the general path to your developer program, I highly recommend providing a simple subdomain, providing access to your APIs &nbsp;in a simple, consistent path like http://developer.example.com--at the very least put it in a consistent folder like http://example.com/developers. When you put your API into your http://example.com/help/bullshit-cms-system/@$~!$(bullshit-guid$#(@)/developer/ location, it really just sends a signal that your API is just a support feature, and something that is&rsquo;t getting the resources it will need for success.</p>
<p>When it comes to identity and access management for your APIs, I recommend working from your root using http://example.com/oauth for authentication and discovering of your APIs. After that I recommend taking a similar approach to the developer program, and use http://api.example.com or http://example.com/api. It really sucks to have to guess the baseURL for any API, and if I have to download your SDK to figure out the baseURL, I may skip using your API all together. I&rsquo;m stilling processing thoughts around the dynamic API subdomains like http://accountname.example.com, giving users a custom base URL for API access.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose when configuring a domain for your API efforts, I probably don&rsquo;t need to see /rest/, /tcp/, or /http/ in the URL structure. I&rsquo;m hoping your API resources are these things, you should not have to declare it. When designing your API resources, work hard to think about the core resources, and how they will be used, not necessarily how they are being transported.</p>
<p>I will get a lot of hate from my linked data friends, restafarian cool iya's, and hypermedia homies, about my simplicity and possible errors, but my goal is to just move things forward, and not necessarily convince everyone of exactly the right way of doing things. I find that taking a pragmatic tone, providing a 100K view of what others are doing across the space, is the most effective way to influence change at a macro level.</p>
<p>If I was highlight an particular implementation I would point to Dwolla. The Dwolla developer program is pretty simple, and consistent. You can get at the developer program at <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">https://developers.dwolla.com/</a>, API documentation at <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/">https://docs.dwolla.com/</a>, a blog at <a href="http://blog.dwolla.com/">http://blog.dwolla.com/</a>, and support at <a href="http://help.dwolla.com/">http://help.dwolla.com/</a>. You authenticate, and access the Dwolla API at <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/">https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/</a>, and can do the same for a sandbox environment at <a href="https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/">https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to emphasize anything, I would say that consistency is the most  important thing when crafting domains for your API program, and emphasis on the fact that your API effort is a priority, not just some sort of whacky side project ran by a single employee. (oh shit, maybe most are?) Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it is fine that your developer API program is run by one crazy person in a company (I fully support this), but you can at least put some work into looking like you are organized, and sane.</p>
<p>This goal of this post is to focus on configuring a sensible base URL for your public API surface, and isn&rsquo;t about how you should craft the path to resources you are making available. In a perfect world every domain would allow /auth from the root, and employ hypermedia across all API design, but in the world we have I think just getting folks to use simple, and consistent base URLs for key areas of public API efforts, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">considerign of the usage of a APIs.json file in the root of your domain</a>,&nbsp;can be a healthy place to start when it comes to API discovery.</p>

<p>APIs came in to existence to satisfy a demand for access to valuable content, data and resources, and the more APis that are developed, the more the appetite for API consumption has grown. APIs enable website, web and mobile applications to build applications, using resources that were completely out of reach in even the recent past. Some API resources, like a simple city look-up by postal code, might be simple enough that a developer could recreate, but other resources such as global satellite imagery is something the average developer does not have the resources, or the time to create&mdash;the more API resources available, the cooler the apps we build,  and the more we hunger for valuable API resources grows.</p>
<p><strong>Starts with a Need</strong><br /> API consumers rarely want to use an API, just to learn about APIs, they have a need, a problem they need to solve. They want to provide a feature in their website, or mobile application. Often times people just want two systems to talk to each other, or be able to analyze and visualize information in a particular way, to accomplish a business or personal objective.</p>
<p><strong>Discovering The APIs You Need</strong><br /> The API savvy technologists are aware of the vast wealth of APis available today, and know to Google for the API they need, visit API directories like <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> or <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a>, and emerging API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br /> Before you can unlock the value of an API, you need to understand how common authentication patterns work for any API. Some API providers use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">basic authentication</a>, which is baked into HTTP, while others use application or developer keys to be able to talk with APIs. <a href="http://oauth.net/">oAuth</a> is fast becoming default for API providers who serve up private users information, allowing platforms to manage identity and access in a way that gives control over to end-users of applications built on top of APIs. Many providers are also using SSL as default for all API communication, protecting API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Integration</strong><br /> Actual integration between applications and APIs, is ultimately up to API consumers, but API providers and a growing number of API tools and services, are making API integrations easier, and often automated. Most web API resources can be accessed via a simple URL, something anyone, with a basic amount of web knowledge, can integrate API resources into their world.</p>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong><br /> There are plenty of API projects to be had for fun and hobby, but for any project to be sustainable it must generate revenue and be able to sustain itself. There several proven approaches to generating revenue around API integration including application sales, providing premium features, selling content or subscription to the content, advertising, in-app payments, affiliate links, data generation, and through partnership. Of course there is always the independently funded efforts, which make things easier.</p>
<p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong><br /> The primary motivation for API integration is to provide access to data, content, and other resources available in online Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms. Services like Evernote for notes, Pinboard for links, Flickr for photos, and Youtube for videos, all use APIs to enable integration with other applications, as well as basic data portability for software users.</p>
<p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong><br /> Like SaaS, its cousin Platform as a Service (PaaS) employ APIs to enable application providers, developers, and hackers with the ability for rapidly deploy applications ranging from Wordpress, to ElasticSearch. Usually if an application is running on PaaS platforms like Heroku, or Google Apps Engine, there is a set of APIs for configuring, monitoring and managing most aspects of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong><br /> The savviest of IT Operations have moved to the cloud, and run all of their infrastructure using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers like Amazon Web Services for everything from server capacity, and storage to DNS and content delivery networks (CDN). Every piece of IT infrastructure that runs in the cloud has an API or CLI interface for it, allowing the management of all IaaS infrastructure programmatically.</p>
<p><strong>Backend as a Service (BaaS)</strong><br /> As if we needed another acronym, but here we go, <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> is an approach for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to connect their applications to backend cloud storage and processing while also providing common features such as user management, push notifications, social networking integration, and other features that mobile users demand from their apps these days. As approaches to API deployment evolve, we are seeing more API deployment platforms emerge that very much resemble earlier goals of BaaS, allowing for the agile deployment, and consumption of valuable resources, via BaaS platform APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br /> The popularity of platforms like Twitter and Facebook owe a great deal of their buzz to the fact that there were embeddable buttons, badges, and widgets, allowing for the sharing, syndication, and engagement with their platform using API driven, embeddable tools. The ability to copy and paste a little bit of code, maybe configure a few settings, and be able to publish data, content, media, and other digital resources is the cornerstone of any API integration.</p>
<p><strong>Web Hooks</strong><br /> Webhooks enable API platforms to push data, and notify any other URL of a change or event that has occurred via the platform. Webhooks are how API platforms become a two way street, allowing API consumers to make APIs work for them, and reduce the overhead of application usage when it comes to polling API resources. Webhooks are an API integrators best friend, and always look for them on platforms before considering which resource is best for your application or use case.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /> Everything on the Internet today is guided buy the terms of service of web and mobile applications, and their underlying API platforms. TOS dictate how developers can use APIs, and the end-users can take advantage of services on the platform. Nobody reads TOS before they sign up for online services, but if you are looking to build a business on top of any API, you should read the TOS to see if it is something that will support what you are looking to do.</p>
<p><strong>In Perfect World Everyone Provides and Consumes API</strong><br /> There are over thousands of public APIs available on the open Internet, and if you are building applications, you are most likely consuming APIs, as well as designing, deploying, and managing your own APIs. The best API providers, consume their own APIs, as well as the APIs of other providers. To truly understand what makes a good API, you should be consuming, as well as providing APIs.</p>
<p>In 2014 we are moving well beyond the old days of API mashups, or even applications using just a handful of APis. Applications are depending on entire stack of APIs, employing 10s or 100s of API resources to deliver applications across multiple web and mobile channels. Consuming APIs aren't just for developers, and about building applications, APIs are fueling many new trends that allow even non-developers to consume APIs and put them to use in documents, spreadsheets, and other common tools we depend on everyday for our personal and professional lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/forest-service/department-of-agriculture-forest-service.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I need your help with something. I&rsquo;m in the business of helping start-ups, all the way up to our federal government identify valuable assets, and make them more accessible for use in websites, and mobile devices. As part of this work I&rsquo;m always on the look out for valuable public assets across city, state, and the federal government, and help make sure the conversations around these assets always include APIs, so that we aren&rsquo;t just building websites, mobile applications in silos, and limiting the potential for public access, by individuals, and small businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last couple years I have cultivated a small group of API evangelists in various sectors, who help keep me informed of important government projects, and one of my partners in crime Alyssa Ravasio (<a href="https://twitter.com/alyraz">@alyraz</a>) brought a <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">pre solicitation for an RFP to my attention from the Department of Agriculture, for a &ldquo;Recreation On Stop Support Services&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;to my attention&mdash;a service you can see in action at <a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.gov</a>. In short this is an ongoing contract that our federal government engages in with a private sector contractor on, to provide access to our nations campgrounds and campsites at our federal parks.</p>
<p>I would put our national parks and campgrounds at the top of treasured assets that this country possesses, and something that we need to make sure continue to be as accessible to individuals, and small businesses as possible. I want to take the time to respond to the pre-solicitation from the Department of Agriculture, in hopes of helping them craft a better RFP, before this goes out to bid. I also want to encourage others, who are also passionate about camping and our national parks, to submit their own feedback to the Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services</a></p>
<p>The current incarnation of the one stop service for recreation project has an API...well it has web services as part of the existing <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf">Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</a>, but you also find mentions of API in the proposed RFP, under the&nbsp;<strong>5.3.9 Mapping and Geospatial Capability</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A segment of the user community will not only be accessing and viewing the mapping data through the web interface at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.recreation.gov">www.recreation.gov</a>, but will also have a need to search, retrieve, and download the geospatial data via the RIDB data sharing interface(s), or APIs.&nbsp; The Contractor shall demonstrate utilization of programming languages, formats, data types/conventions/sources, etc. which maximize the portability and usability of maps and map related data by third-parties. This minimizes the need for third-party data consumers to procure expensive and/or proprietary software to utilize, edit or manipulate the mapping data. The contractor shall ensure that all available geospatial data within R1S is incorporated into the user interface to provide users with the most complete mapping solutions available.</em></p>
<p>There is another mention of APIs under&nbsp;<strong>5.3.6 Provide Travel Planning Tools wit</strong>h:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Non Federal reservable inventory may include state and local reservable and non-reservable recreation inventory which may be incorporated into the system or accessed via various application programming interfaces (APIs).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Then towards the end you see the following needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Sharing and Data Management -</strong> Information originating from within RIDB and imported shall be presented in a manner such that the external origin of the data is transparent to users and consistent with presentation of information originating from within.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Information Sharing -</strong> The Contractor shall deliver automated and manual services for the sharing of the consolidated recreation information described herein. The sharing service shall utilize prevailing industry best practices and technologies to make the consolidated recreation information publicly available to data consumers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Information Consolidation -</strong> The Contractor shall deliver automated and manual services for collecting of a wide variety of recreation information from a wide range of sources including Federal Government Agencies and Federal Partner organizations such as Historic Hotels of America.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, all of this infers that whoever wins the contract will need to at least maintain what is available via the RIDB, which is nice, but it is just a web service, not a modern web API, and only reflects providing access a small portion of the valuable resource that will need to be made available via Recreation.gov, to partners, and the public at large. We can do better. An API needs to be a first class citizen in this RFP, something that is not just an afterthought, and a connection to the database that just needs to be maintained&mdash;an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API will be central to deliver the resources</span> needed for a "one stop services for recreation".</p>
<p><strong>Camping Resources<br /></strong>When you look through the requirements for this project you see all the building blocks for allowing individuals to engage with campsites across our nation, inventory, ticketing, lotteries, permitting, day use and group facilities, special events and use, equipment rentals, recreational and pass sales. All of this keeps our national parks accessible to campers.</p>
<p><strong>Mapping and Geospatial Resources<br /></strong>Camping resources are meaningful to us because of where they are located. Mapping and geospatial resources will be vital to enabling users to discover the parks and campsites where they wish to stay on their camping trips. The ability to search, and navigate campsites via modern mapping, providing geospatial resources is central to the one stop service for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Resources<br /></strong>A third cornerstone of the recreation one stop support services platform are the financial resources. The ability to accept and process credit cards, cancellations, modifications, and refunds will play a role in every engagement on the platform. Access to to all aspects of commerce via the platform will make or break operations at every level for the one stop service for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>User Resources<br /></strong>I&rsquo;d say the fourth corner of the one stop service for recreation platform is the user. Providing secure, seamless access to user profiles, and history throughout the Recreation.gov experience will be critical to it all working. User resources are central to any modern web or mobile application in 2014, and depends on camping, geo, and financial resources to bring it all together.</p>
<p><strong>Recreation.gov Website<br /></strong>All of these resource need to be made available on at Recreation.gov, in the form of fully functioning web application providing a content management system (CMS) for managing the site, complete with a reservation system that allows users to discovery camping resources, via mapping geospatial resources, and pay for their reservations via financial resources&mdash;all via a secure, easy to access user profile.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Planning Tools<br /></strong>Beyond the core public website, and its reservation system the requires call for travel planning tools including point-to-point itinerary planning, field sales and reservations sales, third party sales, and reservable inventory management. While these tools are likely to primarily be web-based, the requirements call for remote sales and management of inventory, which requires a central API solution.</p>
<p><strong>Robust Reporting Solutions&nbsp;<br /></strong>Reporting is prominent through the requirements requiring web analytics, canned reports, customizable reports, monthly performance reporting, and enterprise reporting systems (ERS). In short, reporting will be essential to all aspects of the one stop service for recreation for both the contract winner and operator, as well as all of the agencies involved. I would add in that end-users will also need some views into their own Recreation.gov usage, adding another layer to the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Data Accessibility &amp; Portability<br /></strong>Another element that is present throughout the requirements is data access and portability, of the camping, reservation, customer (user) and resulting financial data. Pretty much everything in system should be accessible right? This definitely goes beyond just what is available va the RIDB, and requiring all aspects of the one stop service for recreation to be accessible for use in any other system, or just as download.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Required Applications &amp; Platforms<br /></strong>As part of the requirements, there is a minimum requirements for browsers, and mobile platforms that the one stop service for recreation should operate on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"> 
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Apple Safari</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platforms: &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"> 
<ul>
<li>Android Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Apple iOS Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Apple Desktop OS</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows PC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For me this portion of the requirements are extremely vague. I agree that the Recreation.gov and travel planning tools should work in all these browsers, and be responsive on mobile browsing platforms, but these requirements seem to allude to more, without actually going there. In 2014-2016 you can&rsquo;t tell me that native mobile experiences won&rsquo;t be something end users of recreation.gov and the overall system will be demanding? Mobile wills be the gateway to the platforms mapping and geospatial resources, and APIs are how you deliver the resources needed for developing mobile applications on all of the platforms listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A One-Stop Service for Recreation Requires A Multi-Channel Approach<br /></strong>The one stop service for recreation requires a multi-channel approach to deliver the camping, mapping &amp; geo, financial and user resources to the main Recreation.gov website, supporting reservation system, travel planning tools, reporting solutions, and potentially any other web or mobile applications, and round it all off with needing to provide the data accessibility and portability that is demanded of a modern federal government platform.</p>
<p><strong>Transform The RIDB Web Service Into A Modern API And Make The Center<br /></strong>The only way you will engage with users Recreation.gov on the web and mobile locations they will demand, as well as deliver the reservation, travel planning, and reporting solutions, while making sure everything is portable, the RIDB database and supporting web services needs to be brought up to date, and transformed into a modern web API. &nbsp;The&nbsp;RFP_-_Attachment_10_-_Notional_Future_RIDB_Data_Flow_-_Sep._22_2014.pptx even reflects this vision, but the actual RFP severely falls short of describing the role an API will play in the platform.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/forest-service/ridb-api.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p><strong>Making Security A Priority Across All Aspects Of Operations<br /></strong>With a single API layer being the access layer for all web, mobile, reporting, and data accessibility channels, security takes on a whole new meaning. APIs provide single access point for all access to platform resources, allowing security, and auditing to occur in real-time, using modern approaches to API management. APIs use existing web technology, and don&rsquo;t require any special technology, but do provide a single layer to enable, monitor, and deny access to all resources, across the one stop services for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>A Centralized Metrics, Analytics, and Reporting Layer<br /></strong>Married with security, an API centric approach allows for a platform wide analytics layer, that can drive security, but also provide the data points required for the overall platform reporting system. With an API analytics layer this data can be delivered to platform, government, developer, and end-user reporting solutions. A comprehensive metrics, analytics, and reporting strategy is essential to a modern one stop services for recreation platform.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Let In the Sunlight Enforcing Transparency &amp; Accountability<br /></strong>One critical aspects of a modern, API-centric approach is the transparency and accountability it can provides. All database connections, and web or mobile applications are brokered via an API layer, requiring all applications to rely on the same pipes for reading, writing, modifying, and removing data from the system. This approach provides a secure window into all aspects of platform operations, providing the accountability requirements set forth in the proposed RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Some Constructive Criticism For Language in the Proposed RFP<br /></strong>There are some points in the proposed RFP that in my opinion move the conversation backwards rather than looking to the future, and fulfilling a vision of what the "one stop services for recreation platform" could be. One example is <strong>5.3.6.3 Third Party Sales</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government anticipates that during the potential 10-year period of performance after go-live there may be an interest by commercial travel and recreation planning companies (such as Travelocity, Expedia, etc.) to utilize R1S inventory and availability data to facilitate R1S transactions. The Government may be open to such Third Party Sales arrangements, provided the business, financial and legal terms of the arrangement are in the Government&rsquo;s best interests. At the Government&rsquo;s request, the Contractor shall lead exploratory meetings, including Government and applicable industry representatives, to determine commercial interest in such a service and also explore the technical and fiscal feasibility of such Third Party Sales arrangements. Upon the conclusion of all necessary exploratory meetings, and should the Government decide to implement Third Party Sales, the Government will issue a formal modification to the R1S Support Services contract to incorporate the service. There is no requirement for the contractor to provide Third Party Sales services until a post-award modification is issued requiring them.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be an interest by commercial travel and recreation planning companies (such as Travelocity, Expedia, etc.)?&rdquo; In the current online environment I am pretty sure that this shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;may&rdquo;, this should be &ldquo;will&rdquo;, and that the pace of business today moves quite a bit faster than this section describes. APIs enable a new approach to business development, that was coined 10 years ago by the co-founder of Flickr, the popular sharing platform. I understand that you will have to certify developers, but this should not get in the way of small business developers experimenting and innovating with the resources available via the platform. Business development via an API has been going on in the private sector for 10 years, and isn't something the Department of Agriculture should be putting off until the next procurement cycle for the platform.</p>
<p>The proposed RFP states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The current contract is a Variable Quantity contract with Fixed Price per-transaction pricing such that the Contractor earns a fixed fee for each transaction processed via the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.recreation.gov">www.recreation.gov</a>&nbsp;website, the telephone customer support line, or in-person at participating Federal recreation locations.&nbsp; The fixed fees under the current contract vary depending on the type of inventory being reserved, the sales channel, etc.<br /></em></p>
<p>In an era where we have over 10K API resources to use in applications, where cloud-based utility pricing is successfully being applied, and you pay for what you use across numerous industries, you can&rsquo;t have a business model like this for a public / private sector partnership, and not put APIs to use, and enabling trusted partners to build a business model around the commerce opportunities available via a platform. Right now this is exclusive to the current contract holder&nbsp;Active Network, d.b.a. ReserveAmerica, and for the next round should not be something that is exclusive to the contract winner--it should be open to the thousands of businesses that serve the parks &amp; recreation space.</p>
<p>Another item I have an issue with is ownership over the source code of the platform:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government owns all of the inventory, transaction and customer data associated with&nbsp;<a href="http://Recreation.Gov">Recreation.Gov</a>; however the reservation system remains the sole proprietary property of the current service provider.</em></p>
<p>I know this is the current situation, but I strongly urge that for the next relationship, this is not the case. The government should own all of the inventory, transaction, and customer data, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the reservation system should be open source</span>. Period. The chances that there will be innovation via the platform if it remains a proprietary solution is slim, and requiring that the core reservation system, and supporting API platform remain open source will stimulate innovation around Recreation.gov. Any business, including the winner of the contract, can still build proprietary solutions that use the API to deliver specific applications, or end-user solutions, and premium features, but the core software should be open this time.</p>
<p><strong>Some Praise For What Is In The Proposed RFP<br /></strong>I am not one to just criticize, without providing at least some praise, acknowledging where the Department of Agriculture is looking towards the future. One area I have to note is their inclusion of the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>, where&nbsp;#3 on the checklist for deploying in a flexible hosting environment is "resources are provisioned through an API&rdquo;, and #2 on the checklist for defaulting to open says that you should provide data sets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces). I think the&nbsp;<a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>&nbsp;should be included with ALL federal government RFPs, and it makes me happy to see it in here.</p>
<p>I also understand the number of agencies involved in the project include the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Department of the Interior (including at least the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service), the National Archives and Records Administration and other potential Federal partners to be determined at a later date.&nbsp; Agencies involved in the trip planning component include the agencies named above, as well as the Department of Transportation; Federal Highway Administration (FHA), the Department of Commerce; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the Smithsonian Institution. &nbsp;This is a huge undertaking, and commend them on the effort, but can't also help myself in throwing in that this is all the more reason the one stop services for recreation has to have an API. ;-)</p>
<p><strong>In Closing<br /></strong>I think I&rsquo;m finished with my response to the <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services</a>. I would like to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">request that they extend the deadline for response for another 30 days</span>, to allow me to drum up more feedback, as well as put some more thought into the RFP myself. Following your own lead of including the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, I would also recommend bringing in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a></strong> - Building on the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, 18F has an amazing set of resources to help the Department of Agriculture move forward with this RFP in a way that is in line with other leading platform efforts in the federal government&mdash;please make sure 18F is involved.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Round 3 PIFs -</strong> This is probably already be in the works, but make sure there is someone from the recent round of Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs) are on board, helping make sure this project is headed in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I think all the right parts and pieces are present for this project, but when it comes to &nbsp;finding the right language, and vision for the RFP, it needs a lot of help, and I'm confident that 18F and PIFs can help bring it home. The most important element for me is that <a href="http://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf">web service from the RIDB</a> needs to be transformed into a modern web API, and brought front and center to fuel every aspect of the platform. I&rsquo;m confident that if the RFP speaks the right language, the winning contractor will be able to translate the RFP into the platform it needs to be, and serve the expectations of the modern consumers who will be using the platform in coming years.</p>
<p>If this RFP goes out the door without an API vision, planning of the family camping trip will done in a silo, at Recreation.gov, and not on the mobile phones that are ubiquitous in our everyday life. User do not need a web experience that is translated to function in mobile browsers, they need a web experience when it makes sense, and a native mobile experience, and even offline when necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planning the family vacation will not happen from just Recreation.gov, it needs to be part of a larger vacation planning experience, occurring via the online platforms we already use in our daily lives. If the Department of Agriculture focuses on an API-first vision for delivering the one stop service for recreation, it will live up to its name&mdash;truly being a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one stop service</span> that can be used for planning your recreation from any platform or device.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://siftscience.com/"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/1475_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time reaching out directly to API providers, in an effort to better understand what they are up to. A couple weeks ago, I asked Sarfaraz Rydhan (<a href="https://twitter.com/safoo">@safoo</a>)&nbsp;from the <a href="https://siftscience.com/">Fraud Detection API platform SiftScience</a>, what is the biggest challenge you face in attracting developers to your system?</p>
<blockquote><em>In many cases, the biggest challenge is developers needing context into the business and operations side of the companies they work for. We offer a machine learning powered fraud detection product to help internet companies in many verticals fight fraud. In an e-commerce integration, for example, a developer may need to know about how users interact with the store, when a customer's credit card is charged, how order information is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment, how operations analysts work within the e-commerce system.</em></blockquote>
<p>Context--something that is so important, and is often lost in translation, or forgotten entirely when APIs are purely an IT or developer led initiative. As a developer I can easily see the many uses of an API, but articulating to someone who is actually living within one of these use-case scenarios, is very difficult&mdash;something that takes a lot of practice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gift.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The world of APIs starts with an individual, company or organization, with some sort of content, data, or other digital resource, wanting to make it available, on the Internet, in a machine readable way, so that others can build sites, and applications around it. Even though APIs use the Internet for communication, it doesn't mean that they are openly accessible to anyone. Providing APIs, is very similar to providing websites, you can control which users have access to it, where they can go, and what they can do&mdash;APIs are just meant for other websites, web applications, and mobile developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solving a Problem</strong><br /> APIs are all about providing solutions, to everyday problems in our increasingly digit worlds, from sharing data with partners, developing mobile applications, to disrupting an entire legacy industry who refuses to change and evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Resources</strong><br /> Providing APIs is about open up access to content, data and other complex objects, or systems that exist within a company or organization, in a way that anyone can use the resulting resources in any programming language or external system.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Solutions</strong><br /> APIs are about the path of least resistance when making content, data, and other resources available, and in the world of APIs you see a lot of initiatives that are born in the shadows of existing company efforts, scraped from existing websites, and are often organized by rogue groups outside of normal business or even IT groups. APIs are about getting things done.</p>
<p><strong>Design First</strong><br /> Providing APIs has evolved beyond just exposing an interface that exactly reflects the content, database or other resource being made available, and establishing a design first approach where you mock, share, and collaborate around the value an API delivers, before any code is even written.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient Deployment</strong><br /> There are many roads an individual or company can take when providing APIs, from DIY approaches using open source API frameworks, to gateways provided by IT that access internal resources, and a new breed of cloud based solutions for deploying APIs from any existing systems. Whichever path a provider takes, deploying APIs is about finding the quickest, most efficient way to making API resources accessible, being used, and moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Operations</strong><br /> Once the API is deployed, the work doesn't stop. Over the last decade, API pioneers have establish some pretty proven ways to manage API operations, by providing documentation, code resources, support, monitoring, communication and other resources that consumers of an API will need to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Service Composition</strong><br /> A single API, is an opportunity to provide multiple internal, external, and public consumers the ability to access resources in a variety of ways. Service composition provides a way that API providers can allow for a wide variety access to resources, to only the groups of consumers they want, charging for services in optimal ways that meet their business goals.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Monetization</strong><br /> API providers have established some new, and innovative ways for monetizing APIs, ranging from API consumers paying for use in a utility style approach, paying API consumers for driving traffic, to other more indirect ways of generating value, while covering operational costs, and monetizing usage beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Available For Discovery</strong><br /> As part of evangelism, there are emerging approaches to ensuring APIs are discoverable, by generating machine readable API definitions, and making sure APis are available to API search engines and directories. Discovery by design, is emerging as the way that API providers reach API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful Evangelism</strong><br /> There is no &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo; in the world of APIs. Even for internally focused APis, it will take a solid amount of evangelism to make consumers aware that an API exists, as well as achieve successful integration into any website, web application, or mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Emmbeddable Everywhere</strong><br /> Some APIs lend themselves to driving data, content, and other functionality across web sites, applications, and spreadsheets. JavaScript, plus APIs, are a common way to provide embeddable, API driven functionality that any site owner, social media user, and other Internet user can find API driven solutions to their problems.</p>
<p><strong>Security a Priority</strong><br /> Since APIs employ HTTP, the same communication protocol as the World Wide Web, security becomes a big priority in API operations. Most APIs are NOT publicly available, employing SSL, application keys, and other approaches to securing API access, including new standards like oAuth for handling both identification, and access to valuable API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Web Hook Relationships</strong><br /> APis don&rsquo;t just receive information, they increasingly are making calls to outside URLs, allowing API consumers to receive real-time notifications, when any data, content or other event occurs around the API resources their applications and system deepened on&mdash;making APIs a two way street.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced Terms of Service</strong><br /> In our online, digital worlds, terms of service dictate all relationships, and this is no exception in the world of APis. API terms of service make or break API operations, allowing for adjustments that protect API providers interest, but also enable API consumers to successfully integrate, and put API resources to use. Some API providers have found a balance to API terms of service, while others struggle finding the balance that will bring in API consumers, and keep them integrated.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Baked In</strong><br /> The privacy of everyone involved with providing APIs, consuming APIs, and ultimately the websites, applications, and systems that end-users are depending on is critical. Whether it is purely internal corporate systems, federal government applications, or a publicly available social network application like Facebook, privacy will set the tone for all platform operations.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency As Part Of Your DNA</strong><br /> Finding success with APIs takes a different breed of business and organizations, requiring a certain amount of transparency in operations that some people just aren't ready for. However, many companies and organizations find that by becoming an API provider, they experience a transformation, that teaches them to be more transparent, open to external ideas&mdash;resulting in changing culture.</p>
<p>Providing APIs will be something every company, non-profit organization, and government agency will be doing after 2015. APIs will be how content, data, and resources shared, and consumed in the future. In 1995 every company, organization, and government  agency was faced with the question of whether or not they should have a website, and by 2000 that question was yes. In 2010 every company, organization, and government agency was faced with the question of whether or not they should have an API, and by 2015 that question will be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YES</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The concept of providing APIs is not something exclusive to organizational entities, it is something that is also a reality for the individual. In practice, the Twitter API, enables all Twitter users to have their own API, and platforms are emerging that take this to the next level, and allow users to have content and data storage lockers, and using their own personal APIs to share, and reclaim the content and data they generate across the web each day, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p>Everyone has a website in 2014, everyone will have an API in coming years.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/ada-lovelace/ada-lovelace-1.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I track on the API space, the gender gap becomes increasingly obvious. As with many other guys, I&rsquo;m struggling with coming up with the most constructive way that I can contribute to closing the gender gap in technology. As I do with the rest of the API space, I figured I can work harder to tell more stories about women doing interesting things in the API space, while also working to understand the history of women in the space.</p>
<p>With this in mind I took the opportunity on Ada Lovelace Day, to publish a project dedicated tracking on women doing interesting things in the world of APIs, and as with the other 75+ projects, I will spend time each month moving the project forward. My goal is to find more stories for my blog, more speakers and attendees for API industry events, and make sure women are better represented across my research.</p>
<p>To kick things off, I wanted to showcase notable women in the history of compute, and by spending my day looking beyond just the Wikipedia entry, I was able compile a <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/noteable-women-in-history-of-tech.html">pretty impressive list of women who have made a significant impact on technology</a>. The list I compiled is not complete by any means, but it is far more complete than any one list I have found out there, and the big difference is my list is machine readable--meaning you can pull <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/noteable-women-in-history-of-tech.html">the JSON listing of notable women in compute history</a> and use on any other website, or in mobile applications.</p>
<p>Next up, I want to make an functional web API so anyone can search the listing, as well as provide the ability to add, and update the list via API. I want to also take advantage of the fact that my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech">women in tech research website is build on Github</a>, and encourage visitors to help me make the list more complete, and extend the reach of the information available here.</p>
<p>If you know someone or something that should be represented here, feel free to reach out via the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech/issues/new">Github issues</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, or feel free to fork the project and contribute in any way you see fit. Use the <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/updates/">updates</a> and <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> pages to find out what I&rsquo;m working on, and where I am planning to take my research next.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.ou.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-university-of-oklahoma.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote a story a couple of weeks ago, about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/09/30/where-do-we-start-with-apis-at-the-university-of-oklahoma/">how to kickstart APIs at the University of Oklahoma (OU)</a>. I ended the post, saying I would find some easy targets for generating the initial APIs, and publish a basic developer portal using Github Pages. After some work I think I have enough done to initiate another conversation with my friends at OU.</p>
<p>In any company, organization, government agency, or institution, where you are trying to decide where to start with APIs, the public website is the place to start. If data and content is already published to the website, it should also be available in a machine readable format via an API&mdash;this is the obvious place to start at OU.</p>
<p>To help find the low hanging fruit, when it comes to data and content at OU, I wrote a simple script that would slowly spider every page of the ou.edu website, looking for the opportunities, providing some potential targets for deploying APIs. So far my script has identified 183,094 pages across university sub-domains, and processed 52,281 of these pages looking for any HTML tables on pages, with over 20 rows, as well as .xls spreadsheet files, and XML files.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running the script slowly in the background, as I don&rsquo;t want to put any burden on OU sites, and just pulling pages every few seconds. To date I&rsquo;ve identified 252 pages that have large HTML tables, 330 spreadsheets, and 68 XML files. While the script will still be running and looking for more, I think this represents a pretty good start when it comes finding the low hanging fruit for open data and content at OU--resources that should be APIs.</p>
<p>As I do with all my projects, <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">I published my work for the OU API effort on Github, as an open repository</a>. Using this repository, I&rsquo;ve published the low hanging fruit as JSON, and HTML pages to allow for easy browsing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Tables (252) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-tables.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-tables.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets (330) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-spreadsheets.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-spreadsheets.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>XML Files (68) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-xml.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-xml.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/discussion.html">created another page which is driven from the Github issues for the repository</a>, to help handle discussion around which tables, and files should be targeted. I will put some thought into how to improve the process, better using Github to move the conversation forward. I&rsquo;m not going to be able to do this alone, ultimately we need the students and factuality at OU to get interested in participating, but this will take time&mdash;something which Github is well suited to help manage asynchronously.</p>
<p>The next steps for this project, is to have another conversation with Mark and Adam from OU, and look through some of the low hanging fruit I&rsquo;ve identified. After that I will put together a strategy for using <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a> to help us easily publish APIs from the targets I&rsquo;ve identified. I also suspect that as part of this process there will be a lot of de-duping, and other data janitorial work before we can publish some usable APIs, and move things forward.</p>
<p>You can follow my work on this at the <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">OU API project Github repository</a>, and when it makes sense I will publish stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dictionary.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways to compose, and examine collections of APIs. I have a database of over 2500 API that I keep an eye on, and for some of them I&rsquo;ve been generating Swagger specs, and using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to compose them into collections. I did this with 1<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">0 APIs I'm calling my utility stack</a>, because they are some of the fundamental utility style resources I depend on to make the API Evangelist network function.</p>
<p>I generated Swagger specs for the 10 following APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>bitly Data API Search</li>
<li>FullContact Name API</li>
<li>FullContact Location Normalization API</li>
<li>Pinboard All Posts API</li>
<li>AngelList Startup API</li>
<li>Wordnik WordList API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Keyword and Term Extraction</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API</li>
</ul>
<p>Then using these Swagger definitions, I outputted any parameters that are used for endpoints, as well as the fields for all of the APIs underlying data model. I grouped all of these fields together and created a sort of dictionary for my utility stack API collection. By doing this I&rsquo;m learning a lot about the vocabulary that each of these API providers are using, as well as beginning to see patterns across similar APIs, like text extraction APIs, and URL shortener APIs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/utility-stack-dictionary.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>In a perfect world, APIs would use commonly established vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, but in the imperfect API world we are given, I&rsquo;m enjoying taking a look at the sort of API slang that has emerged across the various types of popular APIs we are adopting.  API definition formats like Swagger give me a great way to define the surface are of APIs, and these exercises allow me to push forwards tools and approaches to understanding this new landscape.</p>
<p>The more APIs I generate Swagger definitions for, and the more tools I develop to analyze the landscape, the better I will get at communicating the interesting patterns I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space, and hopefully extract some blueprints that I can follow in my own API design work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://poemofthetimes.laneworks.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/poem-of-the-times/poem-of-the-times.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first started Poem of the Times back around 2003, and for about five years I harvested a poem each day, from the top headlines across the  top english speaking newspapers around the world.  Sometime in 2008 I stopped generating the poem, but in an effort to showcase the potential of APIs, I thought it would be a good time to revive the project.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 of Poem of the Times used RSS to pull its headlines, and for version 2.0 I want to use APIs. Something that seems impossible when you are faced with the fact that most of the top newspapers do not have APIs, which is very sad. ;-( However in 2014 we can make APIs from any web page using Scraping to API tools like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Using Kimono Labs I created an APIs for each of top 25 newspapers. I worked my way down a list of top newspapers around the globe, and using Kimono&rsquo;s Chrome add-on I was able to map my API to whatever part of the news homepage featured the latest stories. This was different for each news site, and some of them threw errors when I ran Kimono, but when this happened I quickly moved on until I had 25 successful APIs&mdash;something that took me about an hour and half.</p>
<p>Now that I had 25 separate news APIs I <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/poem-of-the-times/tree/gh-pages/definitions">published a machine readable Swagger definition for each</a>, and then published an <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/poem-of-the-times/blob/gh-pages/apis.json">APIs.json listing all 25 APIs in a single Poem of the Times API collection</a>. Right now this is manual, but I know this is something that is on the Kimono roadmap, introducing the ability to automatically generate Swagger specs, and build APIs.json collections from your Kimono API catalog.</p>
<p>Next I wrote a simple PHP script that pulled the APIs.json, spidered all 25 APIs, made a call to each one, and randomly grabbed a single headline, adding to an overall poem for the day. Once I had collected 25 news stories, I hit shuffle on them again, making sure the poem was in no particular order. After that I published the results to a single HTML, and JSON file, providing a single poem for each day.</p>
<p>As I do with all of my projects, <a href="http://poemofthetimes.laneworks.net/">I published Poem of the Times as standalone Github repository</a>, and I am publishing each poem as a Jekyll blog post, and linking to each days poem JSON file. I have a job setup each day to pull the poem, but the publish to Github will be manual until I get it working 100%. My Poem of the Times projects was a great &nbsp;vehicle for learning more about <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>, while also get to play around with another way to tell stories using APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">Exploring The Possibilities of Being An API Broker</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-broker.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways of building API collections using <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, and building on a concept I saw introduced by <a href="https://medium.com/@cyrilgaillard/i-dont-need-a-business-co-founder-i-need-an-api-broker-c9be536cf8fa">Cyril Gaillard&rsquo;s story titled "I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker</a>", something which was expanded on by Patricio Robles (<a href="https://twitter.com/probles">@probles</a>) on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/would-your-company-benefit-having-api-broker/analysis/2014/09/29">ProgrammableWeb with "would your company benefit from having an API broker</a>?"</p>
<p>The concept of an API broker is interesting. If you had talked to me a year ago, I would have framed my thoughts on API brokering in a more algorithmic way, but after reading these posts, I am looking to merge in my thoughts around API evangelism, taking more of a human approach to API brokering. While I think API brokering in the future might look like more like high speed trading with algorithms doing the heavy lifting, I&rsquo;m thinking for right now it is something we need humans to bridge, bringing a more personal approach during the wild wild west days of APIs.</p>
<p>To push forward my thoughts on API brokering, I&rsquo;m playing around with describing various APIs using <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0</a>, then building a collection of these APIs using APIs.json, and publishing it all to a Github project&mdash;which for now I&rsquo;m calling the <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">Utility Stack</a>. In this exercise I&rsquo;m organizing 10 separate APIs that provide me with a very useful stack of API resources. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I will be building with all of this, but the current stack reflects what I&rsquo;m already using to manage the API Evangelist network, so I know they are useful.</p>
<p>Here are the 10 APIs I&rsquo;m working with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Keyword &amp; Term Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API</li>
<li>Angellist Startup API</li>
<li>Bitly URL Data API</li>
<li>FullContact Location Normalization API</li>
<li>FullContact Name Normalization API</li>
<li>Pinboard Bookmark API</li>
<li>Wordnik Word Lists API</li>
<li>Wordnik Words API</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all API resources that provide some very useful elements in my operations. I use them to pull details about blog posts, look-up start-ups, shorten URLs, organize bookmarks, and other very utilitarian functions that I perform across my platform. I use these APIs for my own purposes, but for this project I&rsquo;m looking to assemble them potentially as a collection that can be used in the development of a specific application, or for ongoing development within specific company or group.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Swagger version 2.0 to describe these APIs, and publishing all of it to Github, using APIs.json as an index of the collection. This allows me to generate interactive documentation for each API in the collection, which makes the entire stack accessible via a <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">single development portal</a>. I&rsquo;m still working on the authentication across all of these resources, some of which are basic API keys, and other are BasicAuth or oAuth. Its all doable though, and based upon work I&rsquo;ve done before I can easily store API keys, and oAuth credentials in the master branch of the Github repository which I keep as private.</p>
<p>To summarize this exercise, as an API broker I could easily find the resources my clients will need to build a specific web or mobile application, or accomplish a specific system integration. I could setup all of the accounts for each of the resources in a central, private configuration file that can be used by the developer hub I&rsquo;ve setup so developers can explore using interactive documentation, as well as use directly within an application.</p>
<p>Think of this applied to Cyri&rsquo;s vision of needing an API broker, or possibly something that every company would have as Patricio suggests in his ProgrammableWeb post. With this project, I&rsquo;m not deploying any APIs, I&rsquo;m merely aggregating and brokering a machine readable collection across numerous other API resources. This exercise has also shown me that I can easily identify gaps within any stack I&rsquo;m working on, and make suggestions for new APIs that help developers accomplish a specific project objective.</p>

<p>Imagine if I needed to add an image stack, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, or my <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulate API</a>? I could easily added in other features, and resources that developers are needing, allowing them to do what they do best, building applications, and delivering on system integrations. As a broker I can do the legwork of finding the resources they need, and aggregating into a single developer hub.</p>
<p>The fun in all of this is that I have each of these API definitions in a central system, allowing me to orchestrate collections like this <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">utility stack</a>, or possibly <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/launching-25-apis-to-assemble-a-single-poem-for-each-day/">API stacks like my poem of the times</a> that all work towards a single objective, no matter whether its for developing a specific mobile application, single page application, or any other system integration you can imagine&mdash;even just writing a simple poem each day.</p>

        <p><a href="https://developer.target.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/developer-target-com-portal.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my usual monitoring of the API space, and while looking at various developer areas, I stumbled across the <a href="https://developer.target.com/">Target Developer Portal</a>. I find the Target developer portal interesting because it is publicly available, but before you can get any information you have to register or login.</p>
<p>When you land on the landing page for developer.target.com you simple get a page that says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Please Note: Access to the developer portal is restricted to Target employees and trusted third parties that currently have a working relationship with Target Corporation. Registration requests that do not meet these guidelines will be rejected.</em></blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more information about Target&rsquo;s API efforts, which I think they could do without giving away business intelligence, but overall I support the line they are walking with their API efforts. To me, Target is making a statement that they have an API, and if you are <em>"Target employees and trusted third parties"</em>, you can get more access--it is a start, so I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>I'm part of many private API discussions lately, where I&rsquo;m trying to educate companies about the benefits of being more public, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more companies take targets approach to publishing their developer API portal in coming years.</p>
<p>My only hope is that more of them will also share a blog, and other details about what they are up to, and hopefully some day even some publicly available APIs providing access to information that is already available on their website.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="http://api.report/2014/10/07/hacker-news-launches-official-api/">API news story of the day was the release of the Hacker News API</a>. I&rsquo;m only lightly interested in the fact that HN now has an API because, honestly I don't feel like an API at this point in the evolution of tech curation site is something to applaud, but their approach to making their API real-time I think does subtly reflect other currents in the API space.</p>
<p>HN partnered with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> to make sure the tech news curation site doesn't just have an API, it has a real-time API. Meaning you can now get HN links in machine readable way, so that you can build the popular flow of tech information into other web, and mobile applications&mdash;in real-time! HN launching an API&hellip;yawn! HN launch an API with Firebase bkked in, reflects a growing trend from influential APIs. For me this is more about real-time and Firebase, than it is about HN.</p>
<p>You see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">other API providers like Nest from Google baking in real-time frameworks into their APIs</a>. Real-time isn&rsquo;t something every type of API should be considering as a default feature, but there are definitely areas where the real-time flow of data is not just a nice to have, it is essential to demonstrating the value of APIs. In my experience, I would say that there are several sectors like news, financial, Internet of Things where I'm seeing real-time being present as a fundamental ingredient for the API platform--something I will be keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>As I said before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">some of the trends I&rsquo;m tracking on are quickly moving from trend to being baked into APIs</a>, going beyond just the release of web APis, and adding additional layers that developers are demanding to deliver the features their end-users are demanding.</p>

<p>I've been a big proponent of APIs in the federal government, and it makes me really happy to see <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> using <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/api.json">APIs.json to provide an inventory of APIs available at the federal agency</a> dedicated to strengthening "the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements".</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, it is the open format that <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist are working on to help make APIs discoverable. You can see APIs.json in action at the <a href="http://apis.io">open source API search engine APIs.io</a>, where the <a href="http://trade.gov/">International Trade Administration (ITA)</a> has submitted their APIs.json file for inclusion. ITA is the first of many federal agencies I will get to adopt the APIs.json format, and help make their valuable API resources much more discoverable, and ultimately more consumable.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a future where <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all global trade</span> is machine readable by default, and there are millions of simple, discoverable APIs available to help stimulate, as well as regulate industry? A future where the Department of Commerce and other relevant agencies are at the center, with the highest quality APIs you can imagine, and the healthiest outreach to not just industry, but also individual business owners.</p>
<p>Trade.gov&rsquo;s impressive entry into the world of APIs with <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.gov</a>, their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">quick responses to feedback</a>, and the publishing of an APIs.json file for the agency, makes me optimistic for this vision of the API economy. If our federal government can do it, then I think industries can follow the lead, ensure that the future of trade and commerce is more real-time, transparent, and accessible to everyone.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent some time this weekend updating a handful of my APIs to the new <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0 API definition format</a>. I was already using an older version of Swagger, so the migration wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. I have about five new APIs I want to roll out over the next couple weeks, and I wanted them to up to date, using the latest version, so moving forward my knowledge using my existing APIs was the best way to prepare.</p>
<p>I moved forward the five "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>", as I call them, analysis, APIs, building blocks, curated, and tools, to all use Swagger 2.0. These APIs provide access to my monitoring system I use to keep track of the space. I also migrated two of my "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a>", i<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">mage manipulation</a>, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture</a>, which are designed to be general purpose, utility APIs &nbsp;I use across my platform.</p>
<p>To support the migration I wrote a Swagger manager for my API monitoring system, which I use to track on 2794 APIs, from 3215 companies, which API Evangelist is one of these companies. Using this new tool I imported my old Swagger 1.2 versions, and after a little touching up in my new editor, I published brand spank&rsquo;n new Swagger 2.0 definitions for all seven my APIs.</p>
<p>The process reminded me of how API definitions really can help you describe, see, understand and ultimately communicate the API surface area you posses. I&rsquo;m going to take this and apply it to a couple of business sectors I&rsquo;m tracking on as part of my API Stack, and see what the process does for me there. After that I&rsquo;m going to get to work on the next five APIs I&rsquo;m designing, and see how Swagger 2.0 contributes to my design of brand new APIs, as well as later on in the life cycle.</p>
<p>I'm using my Swagger API definitions as a central truth for driving server side code, and my documentation. I&rsquo;m eager to continue exploring how it can further generate my client side code libraries, as well as SDKs, and help me better test, and monitor my APIs. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll perfectly automate every step in the API life cycle with Swagger, but it damn sure is making some of the steps much less painful, and following a central design truth, that in this case is a simple Swagger JSON file that I keep in a library, pushing forward my catalog of API resources, at the same time I push forward my own understand of what is possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/business/hewlett-packard-announces-breakup-plan.html?_r=0"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/HP-large.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/business/hewlett-packard-announces-breakup-plan.html?_r=0">hear stories of the HP separation today</a>, I'm reminded of how companies of all shapes and sizes interact, both historically, and in this potentially new API driven business landscape we find ourselves in. I&rsquo;m not an expert in running any size company, but this won&rsquo;t stop me from being a pundit on the subject! ;-)</p>
<p>The HP story brought me back to a conversation I was having the other day with a VC, regarding what is next for Apigee, and when I said IPO, the VC asked me if maybe SAP would buy them. I know that SAP and Apigee are partnering, but honestly I don't know jack about Apigee&rsquo;s business model, or even SAP, so I really don't have a clue what is next, I can only guess.</p>
<p>The conversation did prompt me to create this Evernote (birth of any API Evangelist blog post), helping me flush out some of my thoughts on how companies could potentially work together in an API driven business environment. I know that one way that big companies get the talent and market share they need is through the acquisition of smaller companies, something that has worked well for some time. However, another aspect to this history that only rarely gets discussed, is how many people, and brands just disappear into these acquisitions&mdash;never to be seen or heard from again (until their next start-up of course).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not inferring that big companies shouldn't acquire little companies. The point I'd like to make, is that maybe larger companies should consider how they could be a little more interoperable, and achieve numerous loosely couple relationships, versus always just acquiring a company. You never know, you maybe get all of the benefits of a relationship, without the negative of bringing a start-up in house only to see it chewed up by your internal bureaucracy&mdash;you know it happens!</p>
<p>I see plenty of large multinational corporations working through subsidiaries, shell companies, and other incarnations to move money around and avoid tax burden, you'd think it would make sense from an efficiency, agility, and cost saving standpoint as well. I know many companies are being built, exclusively for acquisition, but when they are going something very well in the space, generating value &ldquo;as a start-up&rdquo;, why do you want to throw a wet blanket on that? There are other ways to invest, and engage with these start-ups to benefit from the exhaust they generate.</p>
<p>Anyways, I guess I made my point. I just personally feel that the way we work as individuals is forever changing because of the Internet, and I can't help but think the era of bigcos will begin to fade, and the companies that succeed will learn to be leaner, and develop the loosely couple partnerships they need from companies, to be successful, and yes sometimes this requires investment, but doesn&rsquo;t have to involve full blow acquisitions.</p>
<p>Who knows, I could be high on my own farts here, but I think divorces, mergers, and acquisitions will look very different in the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">outspoken advocate for more open source API management tooling</a>, for some time now. I'm sensitive to the fact that startups have to make money in the API space, but in my opinion a certain layer of the API space needs to remain open and interoperable for this all to work, and I feel that open source tools are an important variable in this equation. When I last checked into what was available in the space, there really wasn't much, so in 2014 I figured I'd take another look.</p>
<p>Originally there is just one player on the space who was completely open source, and that is WSO2:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://wso2.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/wso2-logo-white-800X360.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>
<td>API management is just one tool in the massive open source catalog that WSO2 brings to the table. The company provides a number of open source tools including identity &amp; authentication, ESB, data  and <a href="http://wso2.com/">API management solutions</a>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>WSO2 is the shining open source example in the space currently, and <a href="http://www.liljeholmensstadshotell.se/">I was very happy to see them emerge on the landscape</a>. I feel WSO2 plays a strong role in the API space, but their approach to open source is the enterprise version, where the open gets rid of software licensing cost (yay), but is targeted specifically at an enterprise audience. I&rsquo;m not the enterprise, so to compliment what they bring to the table, I&rsquo;m also looking for a different version of &ldquo;community&rdquo;, and eager to see smaller players step up as well.</p>
<p>After WSO2 I got a taste of open source from Alcatel Lucent, with their release of API Grove, which was a whole other definition of open source:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://apigrove.net/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/alcatel-lucent/apigrove/apigrove-logo.png" alt="" width="75" align="center" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apigrove.net/">API Grove</a> was open sourced late in 2012 by Alcatel Lucent, holding some promise that another strong enterprise open source player would step up, but within months it would be clear that it was not a live open source offering, but Alcatel abandoning their API program, and publishing as open source to get the press release.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I&rsquo;d call API Grove, enterprise fire sale open source, and while the code is out there (I think), there is nobody home, not an enterprise, or other community to be seen. This type of open source releases just make me sad.</p>
<p>After WSO2 and API Grove, the only other player that saw emerg on the scene was ApiAxle:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">

<td width="100"><a href="http://apiaxle.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/api-axle-logo-3.png" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apiaxle.com/">ApiAxle is an proxy</a> that sits on your network, in front of API(s)and and provides common API management features like rate limiting, authentication and caching. ApiAxle was recently purchase by application platform infrastructure provider Exicon.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>ApiAxle has been on my list for a couple years now, and was recently purchased by <a href="http://www.exiconglobal.com/">Exicon</a>. The site is pretty good looking, but I can't tell if there is any activity in the community recently. The blog is silent, but the site was updated a few days ago, and the Github repo for the project was last updated July 31st&mdash;it can be hard to tell sometimes, just how active an open source project is.</p>
<p>Beyond ApiAxle, there are two API management pioneers who been hard at work releasing open source tooling:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">

<td>3Scale is one of the original API infrastructure providers, and has developed an <a href="http://www.3scale.net/api-management/api-proxy-for-api-traffic-management-by-3scale/">open source API proxy using the NGINX Web Server</a>, designed to work independently, but also be able to take advantage of freemium 3Scale API analytics, billing, etc.</td>

<td width="100"><a href="https://github.com/apigee-127/volos"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/apigee-logo.gif" alt="" width="90" align="center" /></a></td>
<td>Like 3Scale, Apigee is one of the original API infrastructure provider, and has been working on <a href="https://github.com/apigee-127/volos">Volos an open source Node.js solution for developing and deploying production-level APIs</a>, providing common features such as oAuth 2.0, caching, and quota management into APIs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It can be hard to envision exactly how open source fits into 3Scale or Apigee&rsquo;s business model, but as the core features of API management become more commoditized, I can't help but think that open source tooling will increasingly be a reality on the front-line for these API infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>After these projects from leading API management providers, I hadn't see any other open source API management tooling until I started to look closer at APIs in the public sector:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">

<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://www.socrata.com/products/open-data-portal/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/socrata_logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td><a href="http://nrel.github.io/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a> was born out of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to manage their own APIs, but then has evolved to be used by other agences, as well as being adopted by central data.gov efforts within the federal government.&nbsp;<span>API Umbrella is a proxy that sits in front of your APIs. It can seamlessly add common functionality like api keys, rate limiting, and analytics to any API.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think what is happening in the public sector API space, reflects what the private sector is needing as well, in regards to open, interoperability, and the room to play, experiment and figure things out before you have to start putting to much cash on the line.  I just think the government is in more of a position to mandate this, where in the public sector freemium solutions from 3Scale have been a buffer for this demand, but as the space expands I think open source tooling will begin to evolve to provide further relief valves.</p>
<p>In doing this research, what has really caught my attention, is the number of new players that are picking up momentum in 2014:</p>

<p>Overall I think these new players reflect the maturation of the space, but beyond that I'm not sure what it means for the API world, it will take some time for me to work through what features are being offered, and what business models exist around these open tools. In my experience, the motivations behind open source mean everything, and the relationship a open source project has to their parent company can make or break the momentum any open source project will possess--setting the tone for any community, enteprise or otherwise.</p>
<p>Eventually I'll bring together the open source tools I've found in the API management layer, with the open source design tooling I'm seeing from Apiary and Swagger, and other <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API design providers</a>, as well as the wealth of tooling I'm seeing for <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a>&mdash;still playing catch up on the roundup here. When I squint my eyes, and think about the space, I can't help but feel that we are getting closer to my earlier vision of open source in the API space, but we still have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>What else am I msising from the pool of open source API management tooling? I depend on my audience letting me know what they are using.</p>
<p><em>P.S. I know I'm going to get an email from Mulesoft on the piece, I&rsquo;m sure you guys fit in here somewhere, but honestly I spent about 2 hours looking through your stuff, and I can&rsquo;t figure out just exactly what version of open source you guys are. I understand the <a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/">Mule ESB is open source</a>, which isn't squarely in my API management category, and after that I really can't tell with the other open tooling you guys have&mdash;feel free to post a blog post response, helping me, and the community understand better.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com/index.html">home page of API Evangelist</a> has always been my API 101 page, where any new visitor can land, not know a thing about APIs, read the page, and walk away understanding at least what an API is, and hopefully also a greater understanding of how it impacts their world. From the beginning the API Evangelist home page always had a lean toward API providers, and over time I've added information about consuming APIs, as well as trends in the API space I'm seeing.</p>
<p>In my opinion my 101 content has become too lengthy, and not properly onboarding people to the multiple areas of APIs like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/provide/">providing APIs</a> vs <a href="http://apievangelist.com/consume/">consuming APIs</a>. I think it is time to overhaul my 101 section, and produce some newer, more relevant API 101 content for 2014. To support this, I'm working on a series of 15 API 101 segments, with each one having a story version, as well as a slideshow edition, complete with audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finished the first one, which is my 100K view, API 101 introduction. I'm still working on the slideshow version. Once I'm done I"ll move on to providing APIs, and as I finish each one I'll hang on the homepage, as well as publish out via the blog, and Twitterz.</p>

<h1>API 101</h1>
<p>APIs, also known as Application Programming Interfaces, at their most basic level, allows applications to talk to other applications, but they are so much more than this when you begin to explore the world of APIs further. APIs are slowly becoming part of every aspect of our personal, and business worlds, often even without us knowing. If you surf the web, and use a mobile phone, this explanation of what an API is for you. APIs are affecting your life right now, and with a little more understanding you can learn to identify APIs, and put them to work for you, even if you are not a geek.</p>
<h2>861,379,000 Websites</h2>
<p>There are 861,379,000 websites registered in 2014, making up what we know as the World Wide Web. In 2014 it is easier to build a web than it has at any other pointing in the history of the Internet, allowing any individual, company or organization to publish a website and even point a custom address to it.</p>
<!--

-->
<p>In 1995 only the most tech savviest had websites, and by 2000 many businesses realized having a website was the normal way of doing business. In 2010 many of the tech savviest companies had APIs, and by 2015 many businesses are realizing that having an API is the normal way of doing business--imagine what the Internet will look like by 2020.</p>
<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p>Websites like Facebook allow us to interact with friends and family, sharing messagings, photos, links, and other essential life bits, establishing a social platform for us to engage in our online lives.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/facebook-screenshot.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>Facebook is a daily destination for users around the world, with much of the interactions via an increasing number of mobile devices that all of us have in our pockets. These mobile devices all use APIs to connect our mobile app to Facebook.com.</p>
<h2>Yahoo</h2>
<p>Yahoo has long been a staple of the Internet providing users with access to their news, sport, weather, stock, and other important bits of our daily lives. Yahoo was an early player on the web, and continues to find new ways to compete in 2014 via the web and mobile.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/yahoo-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>Yahoo may not be what it used to be, but the company continues to innovate through acquisitions, and still plays a role as the home page for many users who were first introduced to the World Wide Web through Yahoo search and directories.</p>
<h2>Youtube</h2>
<p>YouTube provides us with hours of online entertainment, bringing home user-generated, and sometimes professionally produced videos, ranging from family home videos to music videos, and live concerts. YouTube is quickly replacing the television of the previous century, re-inventing how we are entertained in our homes.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/youtube-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>YouTube users often spend time watching videos on the main YouTube website, but also consume a considerable amount of videos using the universal embeddable video player allowing Youtube videos to be embedded on any website around the web, all driven by APIs.</p>
<h2>Amazon</h2>
<p>Amazon has made e-commerce part of the mainstream conversation, allowing us to order almost any physical, or digital product we can imagine from the vast warehouses that Amazon posses, as well as those of its affiliates. Amazon found got started with physical products like books, but in 2014 has led the charge in delivering virtual goods such as movies, e-books, and other online products consumers are craving.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/amazon-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>Selling you products is just the first part of the conversation when it comes to Amazon, they also want to provide with consumer any possible channel they could possibly choose to purchase their products, including providing infrastructure for web, mobile, and tablet developers, and even producing their own tablet device, and supporting platform.</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter allows us to send short, SMS style messages across the public Internet, and follow, or be followed by the people we find ost interesting. Twitter has gone beyond just a messaging platform, or even a social network, and has become the pulse of the online world through its API driven platform.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/twitter-screenshot.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>Everything you know about Twitter was originally developed using the Twitter API, its mobile applications, desktop applications, buttons, widgets, and other analytics and visualizations are all developed using the Twitter public API, which makes the entire Twitter platform available to developers.</p>
<h2>Pinterest</h2>
<p>Pinterest provides users with a simple, yet addictive way to share photos on the open Internet, and with friends. Photos play an important role in our lives, and Pinterest stepped up as a new way to express ourselves using these valuable photos and images.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/pinterest-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>Only part of the interactions with Pinterest occur via their website, the majority of engagements occur through sharing on other sites and social networks, and via mobile applications that allow users to quickly share and express themselves with photos.</p>
<h2>Reddit</h2>
<p>Reddit is the home page of the Internet, providing users with links to the important stories, products, and conversations of the day. Redditors curate the best links that are submitted through the site, and through user engagements the best of the best floats to the top for everyone to explore.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/reddit-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>Reddit demonstrates the real-time network effect that we often associate with the Internet, providing a heartbeat of the best links being viewed, and engaged with across the Internet, making the trillions of web pages, across billions of websites accessible each day by average people.</p>
<h2>Bits Of Our Life Across These Sites</h2>
<p>All of these websites are built by other people, but as users of these sites we all leave a little bit of ourselves in these locations, each time we visit. Whether its just a comment, photo, all the way up to sustained engagement via our mobile phones, we are consistently leaving ever growing footprint across this digital landscape of web sites, and mobile applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/tag-cloud-life-bits.png" alt="" width="625" align="center" /></p>
<p>It has taken decades to go from just a handful of the first sites on the World Wide Web to the 861,379,000 we have in 2014. It is taken the hard work of web site designers and developers to make these sies a reality, but increasingly through the use of API driven interactions via 3rd party websites and mobile devices, all the information on these sites are being generated by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU</span></strong>, the user.</p>
<h2>Hand Written Websites Using HTML</h2>
<p>Iin the early days, all websites were hand coded, with web designers writing all the HTML, and building their own images. Individuals spent numerous hours maintaining each page across vast sites, and often hired large teams help maintain single sites that could span millions of actual web pages.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 200px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-html.png" alt="" width="200" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/yahoo-screenshot-og.png" alt="" width="300" align="center" /></p>
<p>As the number of websites grew this became even more tedious to maintain, but savvy designers turned developers were finding innovative ways to create, publish, and maintain the growing number of websites. While some websites are still hand-coded, the majority of sites are generated, published, and maintained by an ever evolving set of web development software, and Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms.</p>
<h2>Website Content Was Coming From Databases</h2>
<p>Eventually the concept of a database driven website came to be, allowing websites to evolve from sites into applications, and all the content across a website was stored in a database. Now your site was more than just publishing content from a database, you also allowed users to interact, purchase, and generate content as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 50px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-database.png" alt="" width="150" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/facebook-screenshot-og.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="center" /></p>
<p>Databases allowed websites to evolve, and go beyond just content publishing, potentially making their websites not just about the delivery of valuable content, but you could also encourage users to create content either knowingly or unknowingly, and not just on a single website, but across hundreds or thousands of sites around the world.</p>
<h2>Adding An Amazon Product Widget</h2>
<p>Along the way it became clear that it wasn't enough to have just your products on your website, or maybe you were a content site and didn't have your own products. Either way, users needed a way to put widgets, and other syndicated content on their site, which would pull products from other sites, which is something Amazon became very, very good at.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/amazon-widget.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="425" align="center" /></p>
<p>API driven content widgets became a great way to publish products onto the growing number of blogs, review, and other sites that were popping up across the Internet. These approaches to content delivery proved to work not just for product owners, but eventually any content could be syndicated across websites using simple, small, embeddable widgets, benefitting an entire network of connected sites.</p>
<h2>Add A Delicious Bookmark Widget</h2>
<p>As the social evolution of the Internet began, links to valuable content, and the social influence behind these curated groups of links became apparent. It wasn't just about bookmarking your favorite sites, it was about grouping, curated, and sharing of this content across any website that would have you, using embeddable tools.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 150px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/delicious-widget.png" alt="" width="150" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="425" align="center" /></p>
<p>Curated links often show as spammy advertised links, but can also show relevant links based upon what you are searching for, what your friends are doing, and in other ways, that makes the embedding of links, or groups of links, an important way to share information across the Internet.</p>
<h2>Add Twitter Widget</h2>
<p>With the social movement in full swing, just posting links to your favorite sites was not enough. Users wanted to be able to communicate in real-time about the sites they were visiting, what they were reading, watching online, and increasingly what people were doing offline. With the introduction of Twitter users wanted to be able to show what what on their mind, not matter where website it was on the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/twitter-widget.png" alt="" width="150" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="375" align="center" /></p>
<p>Widgets were now allowing every piece of your life that was generated online to live beyond just the website where you created it, and could travel around from any website, to any other site or application that it could. Embeddable content and tools elevated the World Wide Web beyond just any single site, it was a distributed Internet now.</p>
<h2>Content Comes From Many Databases &amp; APIs</h2>
<p>If you were a website developer, your website content no longer comes from any single database. You were pulling your content from a variety of databases, and API resources that you may or may not own. Product sites like Amazon, and social networks like Twitter were emerging, equipped with APIs they were generating content, and allowing it to come in from, and be published back to any website on the open Internet.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 100px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="125" align="center" /><img style="padding-bottom: 100px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-database.png" alt="" width="100" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="center" /></p>
<p>Having a direct database connection to your content wasn't enough anymore. You needed to have APIs so that trusted partners, as well as potentially the public, can get access to data, content and other information, for use across other websites, anywhere on the Internet. Just as this concept was spreading across the Internet, another thing happened, that would forever change how we interact online.</p>
<h2>Then The IPhone Happened</h2>
<p>On June 29, 2007 the first edition of the iPhone was release, and slowly over the next 3 years computing would undergo a transformation, building on existing approaches that first were used to distribute content to website, but would also prove to be low cost, efficient ways to distribute content to a growing number of mobile devices.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/iphone-series.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>While the iPhone is just one of many mobile devices being manufactured today, it did set in motion a new way of designing, and developing applications that could run on the web, or mobile devices, anywhere in the world using simple web-based APIs. Mobile application development has brought many changes to the world of compute, but simple API access to valuable data, content, and other resources has been the most significant.</p>
<h2>Foursquare</h2>
<p>Mobile applications came with the simple knowledge of your location, as well as where you were at online, enabling a new form of communication, called the check-in. A new breed of mobile apps like Foursquare allowed users to see where they were, find friends, as well as places and experiences nearby, making the Internet a more local affair.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/foursquare-mobile-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="450" align="center" /></p>
<p>From this point forward, the longitude and latitude of each online user would be an option when receiving messages, photos, videos and other life bits from users, changing how we think about developing applications--it was a mobile app world now.</p>
<h2>Instagram</h2>
<p>In addition to knowing the location of each application user, each user was potentially given a high quality, internet enable camera on their mobile device. With the ability to take a picture, anywhere, anytime, new applications like Instagram emerged providing users with new features, and social capabilities built around photos.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/instagram-mobile-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="450" align="center" /></p>
<p>Photos continue to be one of the most important, and valued life bits that we can generate across the Internet pipes, providing a very basic ingredient for use in online communication. This is something that would prove essential to users of all ages, from teens all the way up to grandparents discovering the potential of web and mobile apps.</p>
<h2>Pandora</h2>
<p>As with photos, music plays a central role in our life, and it is no accident that along with the introduction of the iPhone, Apple brought along its successful model for a music platform centered around their portable music player, the iPod. Music is an extremely valuable space when it comes to our life bits, something developers and platforms are looking to capitalize on by delivering the next generation of music apps.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/pandora-mobile-screenshot.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /></p>
<p>APIs are stimulating our musical tastes beyond just our Pandora or Rdio playlists, by allowing us to interact with friends, watch videos, purchase concert tickets, buy merchandise, and much, much more. The music industry has been slow to change, but ultimately consumer interests are winning out, and the industry is slowly understanding that a mobile experiences is where today's music experience is at.</p>
<h2>WhatsApp</h2>
<p>In an online, mobile world, staying in touch is one of the most important elements of our digital self. Staying in touch with friends, co-workers, and the ability to organize into groups and meet for sport practice, or to protest the government, is the focus of leading messaging apps like WhatsApp.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/whatsapp-mobile-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="450" align="center" /></p>
<p>Companies like WhatsApp are seeing record investment, valuations, and usage by users around the world--showing that messaging online is an important part of the online and mobile experience, and building apps that connect users in real-time, when they they want, and how they want, is a huge opportunity for start-ups.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Powering Websites</h2>
<p>APIs have been powering websites for almost 15 years now, delivering data, content, and other digital information to the websites we use everyday like Amazon, Twitter, and Pinterest. The average website gets its content from a variety of API driven resources, both from public and private sources, making the aggregation of content a viable business model in 2014.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 100px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="375" align="center" /></p>
<p>Using content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, combined with API driven plugins, anyone can be a curator of content, providing a website where users can find stories, photos, videos, and other valuable resources. In 2015 WordPress will also launch its own API, which will give 65 million websites their own API, turning many average site owners, into API providers.</p>
<h2>API Are Powering Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>The number of mobile phones in our pockets will reach 7.3 billion in 2014--equally the population of the world. Of course not everyone has a cell phone, but it shows the ubiquitous nature of these devices, and shows the size of the opportunity to provide API driven resources like messaging, products, images, videos, and the other life bits we generate, and depend on each day.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 100px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/iphone-6.jpeg" alt="" width="275" align="center" /></p>
<p>Web APIs are well suited for sending and receiving the small, bite-size chunks of data, content, and other digital resources we use through our personal and business worlds. Mobile apps are not just being developed by the latest tech start-ups, mobile apps are becoming the normal mode of operations for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Powering Buttons, Badges, and Widgets</h2>
<p>APIs break up our valuable data and content into small bite-size chunks for transmission to mobile devices, but also so that they can be moved around the web, and published to where we need them. APIs are powering a wide range of buttons, badges, and other widgets that are making any single website, into a globally distributed network of content publishing and creation.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 100px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/buttons-widgets.png" alt="" width="325" align="center" /></p>
<p>Buttons, badges and widgets are extending likes, follows and favorites from your favorite social network to any other site you may be reading or participating on, providing a bridge between all of the application you use on the web and your mobile devices. Facebook is a big part of the identity of any online user, and being able to log-in, share, and participate on the open Internet using our Facebook profiles has become normal for the average Internet user.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Powering Spreadsheets</h2>
<p>APIs are quickly finding their way beyond web and mobile applications, and are being used in spreadsheets to provide the data needed for business calculations, analysis and visualizations. A large amount of the worlds data exists in spreadsheets and the next wave of API developers are currently spreadsheet administrators, they just have not been informed that they can get the data they need via APis.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 75px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/google-spreadsheet.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="center" /></p>
<p>The days of emailing around spreadsheets, having out of date excel documents strewn here and there, is going away. Spreadsheets are connecting to APIs using excel connectors, and online using Google Spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are being constructed to make sense of Tweet streams, aggregate comments or messages, and number crunch the latest industry numbers from the government.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Powering Devices</h2>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say APIs are penetrating almost every aspect of our world. APIs are being used to connect physical devices in our lives like thermostats, smoke detectors, automobiles, clothing, glasses, and just about every object you can imagine, and some you can't.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 50px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/nest.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="center" /></p>
<p>In 2014 a wave of new start-ups, calling themselves Internet of Thing companies, have emerged to build on the API movement, extending the low-cost, simple approach to delivering resources to the physical world around us. Using APIs, the Internet is moving offline, and wiring up almost every aspect of our personal, public, and professional life.</p>
<h2>Not Just For Developers</h2>
<p>APIs are not just for developers. If you can use a web page, you can use most APIs. There are a great deal of educational materials (like this), to get you up to speed with APIs. API providers are also working to make it a priority to focus on non-developer users, such as data journalists, analysts, and many other non-programming user types.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-programmer.png" alt="" width="375" align="center" /></p>
<p>Even if an API has a more developer focus to it, often times you can just ask questions of the community, or the API provider and they will help you understand the value an API delivers, and how you can possibly put it to use. One of the characteristics of Software as a Service (SaaS) applications that people are using, is there is an API behind the scenes, something that only the API savviest of users are aware of.</p>
<h2>Orchestrate Using APIs With IFTTT And Zapier</h2>
<p>A new generation of services have emerged, acknowledging the wealth of API resources available, and the growing number of SaaS applications that have APIs, and are delivering tools that help anyone put APIs to work. Services like IFTTT and Zapier provide very simple recipes that allow anyone to migrate content, data, and other digital resources between online platforms--no code necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/"><img style="padding-left: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/IFTTT-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="320" align="center" /></a><br /><a href="https://zapier.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zapier/zapier-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="350" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>These API enabled orchestration platforms allow anyone to automate, migrate, and keep their online worlds in sync. These services are targeting non-developers, but provide such instant value, they are often used by programmers to make their worlds go around. This approach to using online services, is allowing companies, organizations, and even individuals to find new found freedom and control in their digital lives.</p>
<h2>Making Companies More Nimble &amp; Agile</h2>
<p>Companies are learning that when they make all data, content, and other digital assets available via well designed, simple, and modular APIs over the Internet, they find a new nimbleness and agility in how they operate internally, engage with partners, and even are able to interact with the public at large.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-running.png" alt="" width="300" align="center" /></p>
<p>While APIs are technical in nature, their simplicity, and efficiency are meant to make things more accessible, in simple but secure way, using the path of least resistance. Historically valuable digital resources are locked up by software developers and information technology groups, API developers are looking to change this, making resources available to as wide of an audience as possible.</p>
<h2>Making Companies More Open &amp; Transparent</h2>
<p>Another aspect that is transcending the technology of APIs, is the openness and transparency it can introduce into company, organizational, institutional, and government operations. This isn't always good by default, but when done properly it can let a little sunlight into a potentially closed process, and eliminate some illnesses that occur behind closed doors.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-windows.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="center" /></p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to business, sometimes transparency can work against you, but many corporations, and young start-ups find that being closed can hurt not just potential competitors, but also slow your own company in finding success. As we've learned from open source software, openness can actually boost security, privacy and many other concerns, and a true approach to using APIs can bring some of the same effects to organizations of any size.</p>
<h2>Allowing Companies To Be More Competitive</h2>
<p>The ability to rapidly design, develop, deploy and iterate websites, mobile applications, while also empowering workers to be more effective via API driven spreadsheets and widgets, is giving companies a competitive edge. APIs open up a new way of doing business that the savviest of online businesses are participating in. There is a stunning amount of investment for start-ups looking to disrupt even the most entrenched industries, and companies, but it also doesn't take a start-up to make change, and many large businesses are also taking notice and getting to work on their own API efforts.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/bw-competition.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="center" /></p>
<p>In the next five years, it will become evident which companies, and organizations do not have APIs, as they will not be participating at the levels of API driven companies. Large organizations will not be able to keep up in an always on, real-time business environment, something that APIs power across multiple channels including web, mobile, devices, and other ways of doing business online, in this new environment.</p>
<h2>Empowering Individuals To Take Control Online</h2>
<p>The most important thing APIs are bringing to the table, is the empowerment of the average online individual. APIs are providing access to much of the data and content we are generating online. APIs are how we can get access to the photos of our children on Facebook, and our home videos we've shared on YouTube. APIs are not just about driving business innovation, it is how the average user is taking back their digital self from a growing wave of data hungry start-ups.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-fist.png" alt="" width="200" align="center" /></p>
<p>API literacy is much like financial literacy. You don't have to understand the inner workings of banking and credit card industry, but you damn sure need to be educated enough to understand who has access to your bank account and credit card statement. With API literacy you don't have to understand how APIs work, but you should only use online services that have an API, and know who has access to your data and content, while also being able to download and walk away with your own valuable information that you have generated via <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANY</span></strong> online service.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Important, Please Keep Learning</h2>
<p>This is just the first of a series of 101 tutorials on the world of APIs. On the home page of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> you can find other tutorials on providing APIs or consuming APIs, and the research that went into this material. I have other research areas like real-time, and voice APIs, which as I have time will be generating 101 tutorials for--let me know if there are any of them I should prioritize</p>
<p>I will be adding new tutorials as I have time, until then you can tune into the news stream from each area of research on the API Evangelist network, as well as tune into the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> blog for the latest analysis on the business of APIs, <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a> for the latest on the politics of APis, and the <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a> the latest in news from the APi space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elastic-path-logo-2014.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving my <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/">hypermedia API research</a> a little love today, and as part of this I was reviewing examples of hypermedia in the wild like with the <a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/hypermedia-api">Elastic Path Cortex API</a>. Elastic Path was the first company to introduce me to the possibilities around hypermedia way back in 2011, so I enjoy checking in regularly to see what they are up to with their APIs.</p>
<p>As of January 2014 <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">I&rsquo;ve committed more time to doing research on hypermedia APIs</a>, as well as work to tell stories about how hypermedia is being applied by companies, in a way that anyone can understand. This last summer at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/28/video-from-the-hypermedia-panel-at-apicraft-in-detroit-last-month/">API-Craft in Detroit, the hypermedia community acknowledged</a> that they have an image problem, and had some significant work ahead of them when it comes to storytelling, specifically around speaking to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t 100% speak hypermedia-eze, but I know with some practice I can get better at translating. I also know that some of the hypermedia folks aren&rsquo;t so good at speaking plain english to normal people, but with some practice I htink they will also get better. To help me in my jouney I figured I&rsquo;d translate what Elastic Path has written on their Cortex API page, but first I want to acknowledge the image they have--which is the first sophisticated hypermedia visual I&rsquo;ve seen, and I want to work on creating more like it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/hypermedia-api"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elastic-path-developer-cortex-diagram-2.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get on with the translation from hypermedia-eze to plain english. Elastic Path starts with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Cortex is a mediation layer that uses patent-pending dynamic linking technology to discover and assemble resources from multiple business platforms into one consistent interface. Data and services from enterprise applications like Commerce Engine, Adobe&reg; Experience Manager, OpenText&reg; CEM, and others are mapped to Cortex using a lightweight schema. Once abstracted, these resources &mdash; from any source &mdash; are linked together to generate Cortex Business APIs that securely project your unified services to the world.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation: </strong>Cortex brings together all your information, no matter where it resides, into a single, consistent API that you can then securely share with anyone you desire.</p>
<blockquote><em>Cortex mediation completely decouples client applications from business platforms, yet enhances their ability to securely retrieve data and perform transactions. This breakthrough hyper media approach gives designers, developers, and API consumers the unprecedented freedom they need to create unique digital experiences &mdash; from mobile apps to Internet Retailer&reg; Top 500 websites &mdash; that engage customers and create business value.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Cortex understands that you are delivering information to a wide assortment of web, mobile and tablet devices in 2014, and Cortex handles the heavy load, abstracting away the complexity for API developers, allowing them deliver more meaningful experiences for end-users, agnostic of any platform they use.</p>
<blockquote><em>A hypermedia API means self-serve e-commerce.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> A hypermedia API means self-serve e-commerce.</p>
<blockquote><em>Unified services from your application portfolio are exposed via Cortex Business APIs, a set of highly scalable REST interfaces that conform rigorously to the HATEOAS constraint and Level 3 of the Richardson Maturity Model. This means that client applications can securely access enterprise data and perform authorized operations using only the hypermedia controls generated by the mediation layer. No deeper knowledge of your business platforms is required &mdash; so the tyranny of constant integration work ends with Cortex. It's simply the best API for ecommerce platforms.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation: </strong>Similar to understanding all of the devices you will be delivering information to, Cortex understand which users are accessing your information, and securely delivers only the information they have access to, and enables them to only take the actions they have afforded to them, again abstracting away the complexity of business operations for developers.</p>
<p>My translations may not be perfect, but in short, because the they employ hypermedia design patterns, the Cortex API can more intelligently consider which internal, or external systems your information is being pulled from, while also understanding the context of the end-user who will be accessing this information, both who they are, and what device(s) they are using, potentially handling all of this logic for developers, leaving them to do what they do best.</p>
<p>You see, APIs have been abstracting away the complexity of back-end system for a while now, but hypermedia has the potential to abstract away a couple more of the key  layers for developers--who the user is, and what device (channel) they are engaging upon. When done right, this has the potential to make the delivery of digital resources via APIs, to any number of online channels much more streamlined and efficient for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Of course, even though all of this is a reality with Elastic Path right now, we have huge hurdles to jump in helping resource owners, and application developers understand the benefits hypermedia can bring to their operations, and this is why I'm honing my hypermedia translation and storytelling skills so I can help be a conduit in these ongoing discussions.</p>

<p>As the popularity of APIs rapidly increases, I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets play a growing role in both providing APIs, as well as consuming APIs. On the road to #APIStrat Chicago I came across a company who has a pretty dead-simple approach to using spreadsheets to drive data via APIs, called <a href="https://www.dataeverywhere.com/">Data Everywhere</a>.</p>
<p>Data Everywhere describes their service:</p>
<blockquote><em>Select the cells in your existing spreadsheet and click publish. Your data will be instantly available in other spreadsheets. Our REST API makes your data available in databases, phones, websites, and other applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>Whether we want to admit it or not, most of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and providing dead simple tools to liberate this data via APIs are a very logical solution. We aren't just talking about taking an entire spreadsheet and turning it into an API with <a href="https://www.dataeverywhere.com/">Data Everywhere</a>, we are seamlessly making data available from spreadsheets via API, leaving the existing workflow in tact.</p>
<p>Educating the &ldquo;every day &ldquo; spreadsheet user of the importance of APIs in making their work interoperable, and accessible in web and mobile is definitely a priority for me in the coming years. I feel like this education process will continue to be an important layer to my evangelism work for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. </strong>Thank you to Data Everywhere for helping moderate the data session at @APIStrat!</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ying-yang.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend many of my days talking to startups, SMB, SME, larger enterprise, institutions, and federal government folk about APIs&mdash;if you haven&rsquo;t heard, its what I do. I&rsquo;ve become the sort of counselor for the world of APIs, sometimes just listening, but often times giving advice, and sharing random thoughts with a wide variety of characters, who are looking to understand the world of APIs.</p>
<p>One pattern I've been consistently seeing across many of these API sessions, is that questions around internal API strategy are trumping any external or public API questions. These usually discussions start with questions of API design, deployment and management, but then often times move to strategies around internal evangelism, and incentivizing the usage of APIs in general, not just consuming your own internal APIs. Many are recognizing that the path towards being a healthy API provider, involves also being a healthy API consumer&mdash;a sort of yin yang of APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m realizing that for many of these folks that I speak with, the challenge of selling the concept of APIs internally is often a bigger, and more daunting challenge than designing, developing, managing, and evangelizing an API to partners, or even the public. I think we are underestimating the challenge our friends at larger organizations are facing when they try to get the resources they need to be successful within their own work, let alone also contribute to the overall success of their company, agency, or organization.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding that many of these conversations only occur because I do not have anything to sell them. Many of the people I talk to are starved for an educated, outside perspective, even before any desire to understand, and learning about the larger API space. If you are an API service provider in the space, this is a layer of the API economy you need to help me with. How do we onboard these folks as they come into the space, and equip them with the tools, information, and yes the services they will need to be successful&mdash;yet also understanding that they are just starting on a journey that will take some time, and we all should think critically about when we push our warez on them, or just sit, listen, and provide some valuable advice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2014</span>

<p>I was doing some research on travel and transportation APIs over the last couple of weeks, and one of the developer portals I was looking at was one of the enterprise leaders in the space, the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/">Sabre Dev Network</a>. I really like the overall implementation from Sabre, except for one thing...</p>
<p>There is no pricing page for the Sabre Dev Network. ;-( The only place you find a mention of pricing is in the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/resources/FAQ">FAQ page</a>, where it says:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have a number of different pricing options for our services. Whether you are a company just starting out or an established travel provider, we have pricing options that will fit your business needs.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>I understand you are a little apprehensive about sharing your pricing, or maybe you haven&rsquo;t really thought it through all the way, and just want to shake the trees and see what falls out. Whatever the reason, when it comes to APIs you should be a little more transparent about what is going on.</p>
<p>Additionally, as far along as you are with some of the other parts of your developer program, you should have a pretty robust service composition page, and a partner and certification framework for developers to work towards.</p>
<p>Other than the lack of information about what everything costs, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/">Sabre Dev Network</a>, as a platform. I have two other stories to do around their approach, but wanted to start with the constructive criticism before I move into the praise. ;-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working through my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design stories</a>, and was working through some research on the origins of <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and as I'm writing a paragraph on <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, I became distracted around how Swagger was born out of this "word" startup. You see, Wordnik presents themselves as "a new way to discover meaning", and out of this work, Swagger, "a new way to discover meaning" from APIs was born.</p>
<p>Words are an important building block in communication, and I see APIs as a similar, more structured way to approach online communication on the open Internet. Swagger has given us a new vocabulary, providing a new way to describe, and communicate around APIs. You can programmatically pull a a Swagger specification for an API, and within a few seconds you have an idea of what the API resources means, and has to offer.</p>
<p>There really isn't any major point to this story, other than the fact that I find it interesting that a company who is striving to discover meaning among words, would also be looking to help us discovery meaning of APIs. I think this essence is why so many are adopting Swagger to define their valuable API resources, because it comes from a purer place, than just trying to sell you API tooling, and is actually working to help you find and communicate the meaning amongst APIs.</p>

<p>As the API lifecycle continues to expand and comes into focus, new services are emerging to help both API providers, and consumers, better manage API operations from start to finish. New API integration services like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> have emerged to better understand how APIs are actually being consumed, and services like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a>&nbsp;are born out of the need to produce better quality SDKs for developers--it only seems natural that eventually these services would start working together.</p>
<p>APIMatic will now generate SDKs in 7 languages that are designed, and enabled to inspect/debug all of the requests and response data between their API, and the applications that depend on them.  This will provide both API provider, and consumer with vital details on the integration in real-time, that can help ensure applications integrations are all optimized.</p>
<p>All of this is made possible because <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/overview">Runscope has APIs</a>, and APIMatic was savvy enough to weave in integration, monitoring and testing capabilities directly into the SDKs of any API. APIMatic will import API definitions in WADL, Swagger, I/O Docs, API BluePrint, or Google Discovery, then generate SDKs for you in Android, Windows, iOS, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, complete with Runscope integration, monitoring and testing! Something made possible because you have a machine readable API definition for all of your APIs.</p>
<p>This latest expansion of the API lifecycle I feel was kicked off by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a>, introducing the ability to generate interactive docs, server and client code for your APIs. This was then expanded upon by <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a> by allowing you to mockup APIs using <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and now APIMatic and Runscope are expanding the lifecycle to include SDKs and API monitoring. It makes me happy to see the API definition continue to play such an important role, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/">as the central truth in the API lifecycle</a>, enabling all of these API services along the way.</p>
<p>Someday I'll create a cool little lifecycle visualization that shows each step in an APIs life, and what is enabled by using a central, machine readable API definition for all of your APIs, and underlying data models, but we all know graphics isn&rsquo;t one of my strengths, so we'll see..</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

As I do with other sectors, I would like to shed light on how APIs are being used at universities, and potentially share best practices, and stories between higher educational institutions, amplifying the positive effects of APIs.</p>

They had seen my&nbsp;<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">University research</a>, and read my white paper, but what really lit their fire was the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/nyregion/students-inventing-programs-to-streamline-their-colleges-data.html?_r=3">piece in the NY Times about student-built apps teaching colleges a thing or two</a>&mdash;after reading that, they decided to give me a call to discuss APIs more.</p>
<p>I started with the two approaches to using APIs that I am seeing at <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/universities.html">universities</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Access To Institutional Resources - </strong>APIs being deployed to provide better access to data, content, and other digital resources across campus, allowing integration with internal or external systems, and across campus web and mobile applications.</li>
<li><strong>Using Public APIs On Campus - </strong>Putting APIs from the public space, like Twitter and Google Maps to use in classrooms, and even in administrative operations, allowing for the better access to information, and seamless integration with existing campus workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I discussed the different approaches to introducing APis on campus that I've come across so far:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Top-down IT Lead APIs -</strong> School executives take the initiative to make APIs a mandate across all campus operations, acknowledging the benefits APIs can deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Middle-in Faculty Lead APIs -</strong> API efforts led by teachers and other faculty, taking advantage of APIs in their daily work, and hopefully also in the classroom.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom-up Student Lead APIs - </strong>The kids today get online technology, and encouraging them to use APIs in all aspect of their learning will only increase overall digital literacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, we talked about what the best way might be to kick off an actual API platform at OU. There wasn&rsquo;t a clear top-down mandate at OU, so I figured the best place to start was middle-in, as well as bottom-up. We had the middle-in started, with Mark and Adam wanting to see APIs at their institution, but how could we plant the seeds for a bottom-up, student led movement, something that would ultimately get us to where we could demonstrate the value of APIs to campus leaders.</p>
<p>Without any clear place to start, I&rsquo;m exploring the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/">ou.edu website</a> looking for any spreadsheets, CSV files, or obvious tables that could contain some easy data or content that I could easily turn into APIs--pulling ideas from my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">university API building blocks list</a> in my research. Once I have a few targets established, I will then setup a basic developer portal to house all of the early API efforts.</p>
<p>Once I have a basic developer portal, and a couple of data or content APIs, I can then make a plan for what is next. My goal is to just get going, and tell the story about APIs at OU. I&rsquo;d say this is definitely the most basic API effort I&rsquo;ve ever kicked off. We are truly starting at ground zero here, and even though we have the initial desire to have APIs, we don&rsquo;t know exactly the how or what of APIs at OU, but we have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>This is what I love about APIs. Where do I start? What will make the difference? There are no perfect answers, and there is so much work to do, but we have to start somewhere. Hopefully I can find some easy targets for generating the initial APIs, and publish a basic developer portal using Github Pages, and jumpstart the API conversation at OU. Once I do that I will connect back with Mark and Adam, and I&rsquo;m sure by then I will have more ideas of what we can do next when it comes to APIs at the University of Oklahoma.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-people.JPG" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get asked about hiring developer advocates, and API developers quite often during the week, but this specific question in my inbox from <a href="http://augmate.com/">Augmate</a>, I found more interesting. I thought their usage of a &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; was a little different, which gave me a reason to provide some fresh thought on the subject.</p>
<p>After reading the question, my first response was going to be: API developer for consuming APIs or providing API?  A thought which I immediately nullified, because any &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; is both. You should never just consume APIs, or just develop APIs, you should always do both&mdash;something that will give you the healthy perspective that I would be looking for when hiring.</p>
<p>Next, there is the matter of which programming language they should be fluent in. I'll leave it to you to test for skills and knowledge that is relevant to your technology stack. Having been a director of IT, and development team manager, the requirements are always different in each environment I've worked in&mdash;I won't pretend there is one HR process to rule them all. You know your environment and needs, and you should develop a line of interview questions that reflects your objectives.</p>
<p>In addition to your regular line of questioning, I would suggest that you also want someone who is language curious, and has played around with many of the popular languages, and not just stuck in one discipline like enterprise (C# &amp; Java), web (PHP, Python, Ruby, JS), mobile (Obj-C), and even someone who plays around with leading edge approaches using Node.js, Scala, and Go. You want to make sure they are proficient in the languages and technologies that speak to your core operations,  but someone who is also aware of what is going elsewhere in the landscape&mdash;making for much more of a pragmatic developer, and reducing dogma to healthier levels.</p>
<p>Beyond the code I&rsquo;m also looking for signs that a developer is well read, and communicative, and the best ways to identify this in 2014 via their blog, Twitter, Stack Exchange and Github accounts. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of scenarios where you want a developer who is better coder than communicator, but when it comes to API design and development, I want someone who is a rabid consumer of other blogs, active communicator, and isn't afraid to publish code in the public sphere. Your API is about communicating with external systems and applications, and if your developer isn't a communicator, will they be able to do this?</p>
<p>To be a modern API developer, you should be fluent in multiple languages, active across relevant communities, via Twitter, and Github, and have an active blog demonstrating your passion for your craft. I know this isn&rsquo;t the perfect formula for you to follow when embarking on your API developer hiring process, but hopefully it gives you some important tools you can use to help find what you are looking for. Additionally, each of the tools I&rsquo;ve referenced have APIs themselves, and maybe its time that our hiring processes moved online, become more interoperable, playing both a synchronous, and asynchronous role in hiring developers, while also keeping pace with where the API space is headed?</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usitc/pub4485.pdf" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usitc/united-states-internation-al-trade-commission-report.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Those of us who live and breathe the API space, throw around a phrase, &ldquo;The API Economy&rdquo;, quite a lot. Referring to the increased usage of APIs across vital industries to drive web and mobile applications, but we as we do often, the phrase is used to describe the future of things, rather than where things actually are. While we are seeing APIs begin to affect global economies, we really don't have much hard evidence that "The API Economy" is a thing beyond our own techno fascination.</p>
<p>With the release of a new report from the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), called <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usitc/pub4485.pdf">Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies</a>, us API geeks are getting the first actual evidence of "The API Economy", with a section in the report called "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces".</p>
<p>The USITC reached out to me several months back, and interviewed me as part of the work on the report, and this week I finally got to see the resulting work. The report is the second of two compiled by committee, with the first report, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usitc/pub4415.pdf">Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 1</a> published last year. The earlier report laid the groundwork for the second report by providing an overview of trends in U.S. digital trade, describing the ways digital trade facilitates trade in other sectors, and approaches for estimating the economic impact of digital trade on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Now with Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 2 the commission is focusing on the value of U.S. digital trade and the potential growth of this trade, providing insight into the broader linkages and contributions of digital trade to the U.S. economy (aka API economy). The report that includes a survey of U.S. firms in industries particularly involved in digital trade, also examines the effects of notable barriers and impediments to digital trade, and presents case studies that examine the importance of digital trade to selected U.S. industries, including the case study: "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It makes me happy to see APIs reflected alongside other aspects of our increasingly digital economy, and not just the good represented, but also many of the challenges we will face. It is my mission to make sure everyone understand that APIs are not good, bad or neutral, and that they are just the digital pipes that are making up the underbelly of this new economic landscape. My goal in using the word &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;, is to highlight best practices around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, not to just get everyone hyped with yet another meaningless tech phrase.</p>
<p>After four years of hard work in the industry, it is good to see things beginning to mature, and go from just something just us alpha API geeks are paying attention to, to something government and industry leaders are taking notice of.</p>

<p>We just wrapped up the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">4th edition of @APIStrat in Chicago</a> last week, and once again I&rsquo;m very happy with the way things went, as 400+ folks gathered to discuss APIs. The event had the right tone, and I got the usual flood of comments from attendees, speakers, and sponsors about what a great experience the event was.</p>
<p>I would love to take credit, but all of the responsibility goes to <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> for making it happen. 3Scale takes all the risk, and their rockstar team makes the event a reality&mdash;I just help get folks to the conference, contribute ideas to the schedule, present, and MC as much of the event as I possibly can.</p>
<p>@APIStrat has been helping move forward the conversation in the API space for two years now, starting with <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/">New York</a> and <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/">San Francisco</a> in 2013, and now <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">Chicago</a> in 2014, all made possible because of 3Scale's investment.</p>

<p>The number one priority for 3Scale, when it comes to @APIStrat, is to move the conversation forward, while investing in the API community. This is why the event is a success, setting the tone for the conversation amongst sponsors, speakers, and attendees. I&rsquo;m thankful for being able to to take part in @APIStrat, and look forward to digesting all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">videos from Chicago, which are already on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already announced that the next @APIStrat will be in Berlin, spring 2015, and we are <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/2014/09/24/as-apistrat-chicago-kicks-off-apistrat-europe-and-us-for-2015-are-in-the-works--we-want-your-input/">accepting input on where it should for the fall of 2015</a>. Let me know if there are any topics you&rsquo;d like to see discussed at @APIStrat 2015, and we'll see about getting your ideas into the lineup.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.report/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-report/api-report-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I curate a lot of interesting stories across the API space from my RSS feeds, the Twittersphere, and my overactive email inbox each day. Only a small percentage of these stories ever make it to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">business of API analysis site apievangelist.com</a>, or my <a href="http://apivoice.com">politics of APIs analysis at apivoice.com</a>.</p>
<p>Over the summer, this got me thinking, and while wandering around Detroit after <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft Detroit</a> this last July, Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I were talking about the rapidly expanding API space, and both felt there was a gap in the news reporting for the API sector. <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>&nbsp;(PW)&nbsp;does a good job of providing API news and analysis for the space, but because of my monitoring of the space, I know there is a lot more news that never sees the light of day.</p>
<p>Steve and I both aggreed that PW is the tip of the API news iceberg, and while API Evangelist, and API Voice provide some added analysis, there was no straight news site that showcased all of the news across the thousands of companies doing interesting things in 2014. Beyone PW,&nbsp;<a href="http://apiscene.com/">APIScene</a> and <a href="http://apicodex.3scale.net/content/Welcome">API Codex</a> are aggregating stories from across the blogosphere, providing access to the best stories across the blogosphere, but still do not reflect the wealth of stories I see being published by both API providers, and consumers.</p>
<p><a href="http://api.report/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-report/api-report-news.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Out of this conversation, the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a> was born. The API.Report is a Github Pages hosted API news site, that anyone can post short, concise blog posts that are no more than 500 words, with supporting links to additional sources of information. There are two ways you can post:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Fork and Post to Github -</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-report">entire site runs on Github</a>, and if you understand how Jekyll works you can easily publish your own story to the _posts folder, and submit a pull request to have added to the daily stream of stories. </li>
<li><strong>Email Your Story - </strong>If you don't want to use Github, you can easily email a story, and supporting image to <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a> and I will post the story for you. Stories on Github will get priority, but emails will be processed as I have time.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will take a couple of weeks before the site will get up to a regular pace, as I'm the only one writing for the blog at the moment, but as more writers step up, the number of stories should increase. I&rsquo;m going to play around with a couple of other features, like a list of all companies who are referenced in news stories each week, and rolling out a custom advertising network for the news site, allowing people to purchase monthly advertising slots.</p>
<p>If you want to become an author, or would like to advertise on the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a>, feel free to <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">tweet</a> at me, and I'll get you plugged in. If you have any feedback, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-report/issues">issue management for the site</a>, and I&rsquo;ll work to incorporate your ideas into the site.  While the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a> is part of the API Evangelist network, I consider it a community site, and would like for you become part of the storytelling for the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1qOp06R"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/clarify/clarify-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on a growing number of video, and voice enabled APIs lately, and one that is continually popping up to the top of my API monitoring list is <a href="http://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.clarify.io/docs/">description Clarify provides on their docs page</a> is pretty concise:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Clarify API provides a RESTful API to extract knowledge from audio and video content</em></blockquote>
<p>Why is Clarify popping up on my list lately? There are a number of things that will cause an API related company to show up on my radar, but Clarify has several things going for it lately:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Shift -</strong> Recently they migrated from being Op3nVoice, which I didn&rsquo;t think wasn't that hard to spell, but I know that many people would have trouble with, to being Clarify&mdash;which is a cleaner brand.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Clarify is an extremely well designed API which employs <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL, and hypermedia JSON format</a> for al API responses.</li>
<li><strong>SDK Writing Guide -</strong> They provide an <a href="https://developer.clarify.io/docs/#sdk-writing-guide">SDK writing guide</a> for anyone looking to develop SDKs for Clarify, making sure they are consistent from language to language.</li>
<li><strong>Story on Helper Libraries -</strong> Clarify produced a great blog post called "<a href="http://clarify.io/blog/spoil-your-users-with-great-helper-libraries-2/">SPOIL your Users with Great Helper Libraries</a>", which I added to my curation, and stories around API management.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">15 separate APIs as part of my voice API research</a>, and <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=video-stack">18 as part of my video API research</a>. These are fast growing spaces, and the problem of delivering indexable meta data alongside audio video is only going to increase, something startups like Clarify is looking to provide an API driven solution for.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> is over, I'm going to take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">video from the conference</a>, and run through <a href="http://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a>, to get a feel for how the API works, and see first-hand the value it adds to my existing audio and video content.</p>
<p>Clarify is a well designed API, and now that they've found their footing with their new brand, I predict Clarify will be one of those high value APIs like Twilio and SendGrid, that we are all talking about, and showcasing when it comes to how to do API right.</p>
<p>Look for more stories on <a href="http://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a> as I get time to process the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat</a> content.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/workshops.php"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-101.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on the details of my <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/workshops.php">API 101 workshop</a> with Kirsten Hunter (<a href="https://twitter.com/synedra">@synedra</a>) next week. She is delivering most of the content for the 2 hour workshop, as she has evolved a pretty sophisticated set of API 101 materials. My contribution will be from my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a>, and my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">API trends</a> material, helping people understand the how we got here, and some thoughts on where we are going.</p>
<p><strong>History of APIs</strong><br /> As I continue to make sense of the API space, I'm evolving my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs story</a>, adding and consolidating areas that I think have significantly contributed to the overall growth of the API space. While <a href="http://theapistack.com/">I track on 100+ categories, or business sectors, in which I think APIs are being applied in some interesting ways</a>, I feel these seven areas are the cornerstones of the app, and its underlying API economy.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Commerce</strong> - Beginning with API pioneers like Salesforce, eBay, and Amazon to payment leaders like Stripe, and Paypal.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Teach us how to share, interact in collaborate with Deliciious, Facebook, and Twitter, to more recently Google+.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon forever chagned how we will use APIs</a>, enabling us to go beyond hobby, and actually deploy global infrastructure using web APis.</li>
<li><strong>Geo</strong> - Google Maps brought the resources web and mobile developers would need, and Census, MapBox, and others are pushing forward a valulable stack of geo API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Flickr brought the businesses of APis into the mainstream consciousness, and Instgram, YouTube, and others stream rich media into our worlds via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - Twilio, Sendgrid, and other messaging APIs provide valuable resources for developers, and also show the rest of us API providers how to manage and evangelize your APIs right.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are definitely other valuable API resources that are contributing to the success of the space, these six areas represent the bedrock of the app, and API economy. You can find these areas playing a role in two major channels for delivering applications.</p>
<p><strong>Channels</strong><br /> I do not think we can adequately talk about the history of APIs without discussion the motivations for deploying, and consuming APIs in the categories listed above. Historically there as been two main areas motivating companies to put APIs to work:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web</strong> - Delivering valuable data and content byeond just a single website, and allowing distribution to hundreds, or thousands of websites using APIs is of growing importance in a globally distributed Internet fueled economy.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Mobile is outpacing web, as the number of reason for deploying, and consuming APIs. Simple web APIs are well suited for deliverin gthe resources need to develop mobile applications.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are definitely other motivations for deploying APIs, but when we start labeling something as a definite part of history, I think these areas dominate. In 2014 I think mobile has definitely overtook web as a driving force, but distributed data, content, and other compute resources web still plays an important role.</p>
<p><strong>Trends</strong><br /> At the same moment I&rsquo;m trying to understand the past, I&rsquo;m also working hard to understand where we are going, based upon what companies are up to in the API space. I also track on six other interesting areas, that I&rsquo;m closely watching, adding new players, trying to understand what their bringing to the table, and putting them into buckets I&rsquo;m calling API trends.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">Aggregation</a></strong> - Bringing together several APIs into a single, aggregate endpoint. Example could be bringing together image APIs from Flickr, Instagram, and Facebook into a single resource.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a></strong> - The forward motion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">extract, transform, and load (ETL)</a> into a more cloud-centric environment. IFTTT and Zapier are leading in this new world of moving valuable resources, around the globe, using the open Internet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">Realtime</a></strong> - Some APis require more than just a basic request / response approach, resulting in a variety of real-time technologies from prototcols like XMPP or Web Sockets, to frameworks like Firebase, and Fanout.io.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">Voice / Speech</a> </strong>- Apple's Siri embodies this latest wave of voice enabled APis, providing the sources you need to bridge the physical world of speech to a vast array of digital resources made available via APis.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com">Single Page Apps (SPA)</a> </strong>- Moving forward the web channel, and delivering simple, single page applications using common frameworks, and API resources to deliver data, content, and other digital resources needed for these SPAs.</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) </strong>- Using simple web APIs to deliver and consume information from physical objects, in our homes, businesses, and spread across public and private spaces.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these trends are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">beginning to get baked directly into some SaaS, PaaS, and API platforms I&rsquo;m tracking on</a>. Each of these trends are delivering value in different ways depending on which industry your looking at, such as real-time might be more important to financial APIs over regular business listing APIs. Areas like IoT are already expanding beyond just label into wearables, automobile, and other fast moving, but currently niche areas.</p>
<p><strong>Maturing</strong><br /> Even with the innovation in all of these areas by a handful of tech giants, and the long tail of tech startups, the space is slowly maturing in two key areas, which in the future will become bedrock cornerstones for the entire app and API economies. These areas are slowly maturing, and not moving as fast as some of the other areas I&rsquo;m tracking on, but will be critical to the future of the API economy.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">Government</a></strong> - Federal, state, and city governments are opening up data, and APIs at an increasing pace, making some very valuable resources available to developers. Government APIs will be fuel to the app, and its underlying API economy, in coming years.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">Enterprise</a></strong> - The largest companies in the world are slowly beginning to see the potential of evolving their SOA approach to include an API-centric approach to delivering products and services It will take the enterprise to truly scale the API economy into the next decade.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that we are only 2-4 years into these layers tot he API economy, and there is a ton of work to do. We need leaders in these space to step up and help evangelize a sensible approach to APIs in their industry, but we also need the rest of the API space to be patient, and also contribute to helping guide government of all sizes, large enterprises, and institutions in understanding the tech, business, and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm biased, because I've been tracking on the API space for a while now, but I&rsquo;m pretty happy to see things maturing, and after 14 years of playing around with web services, and more recently APIs, I feel good that we are moving past the wild west, and beginning to stabilize things a little bit, while still also experimenting with API trends in some pretty exciting (and scary) ways.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/09/19/some-advice-for-the-enterprise-when-beginning-your-api-journey/">Some Advice For The Enterprise When Beginning Your API Journey</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hiking.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm seeing the enterprise wake up to the potential of an API centric approach to doing business, slowly evolving beyond a Service Oriented Architectural (SOA) approach, and trying to understand why APIs are superior for delivering resources to the web, mobile, and Internet of thing (Iot) apps they are delivering, and increasingly depending on. Even though we are clearly in an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">enterprise phase of the API evolution</a>, I&rsquo;m watching many leading enterprise entities struggle with their early API efforts, producing some pretty weak solutions, that developers are not finding useful, and hurting their efforts right out of the gate.</p>
<p>I know that many enterprise API architects will dismiss my advice, because they know better than I do, but I feel compelled to share my thoughts, in hopes that even a handful will be more successful with their API efforts, which I think will also help the overall space as well. When embarking on your API journey, you are going to be handicapped right out of the gate, because as a large enterprise organization, you do not have many of the essential characteristics necessary in your DNA to be successful with APIs, but this is why it will require an API journey, to reprogram your DNA, and better operate on the open Internet.</p>
<p>Before you start planning your APIs, and the supporting developer area, you need to play with other public APIs, to better understand what makes APIs different. I am always amazed at how many enterprise API architects that I engage with, when I ask them what public APIs they have used, admit that they have never used one. They just have heard of many of the common APIs out there, so to prime the API pump, let&rsquo;s hack on a couple of the most popular API solutions out there:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter</a></strong> - Hacking on the Twitter API provides some very important lessons when it comes to API design, as well as developer support.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Github</a></strong> - Github is an essential tool in an API providers toolbox on so may levels, but using their API for managing code is an important experience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a></strong> - Twilio is a god when it comes to API providers, and we all look up to them, so if you aren&rsquo;t familiar make sure and hack together a simple API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not skip this section, you may think you understand how these APIs operate, by visiting their developer areas, and I know you come to the table with a wealth of experience, and this is your handicap. You have a serious amount of technical experience, way more than I do, but what you are missing is an understanding of many of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">business and political building blocks that are making all of this work</a>, ares that you have very little experience within the enterprise.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Simple, Simple, Simple</li>
<li>Begin With API Definition</li>
<li>Interactive Documentation</li>
<li>Self-Service Registration</li>
<li>Play With Service Composition</li>
<li>Telling Meaningful Stories </li>
<li>Showcase  Your Developers</li>
<li>Establish Feedback Loops</li>
<li>Flexible Terms of Service</li>
<li>Invest In Your Developers</li>
<li>Internal Evangelism</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology is part of all of these suggestions, but ultimately APIs represent a new way of doing business that you just aren't used to, and you will have to learn it&mdash;something that will take time. Even once you launch your API, you won&rsquo;t be ready, you will have to learn over time, and this is what the API journey is all about, in addition to the core proposition of making vital company resources available to the public, partners, and internally across the enterprise.</p>
<p>Your biggest challenge, beyond the ones listed above will be what you face internally. Getting developers to use your API resources is tough, getting them to deeply integrate them into applications is even harder, but changing culture at your company and getting the support and resources you will need will be a massive undertaking!</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Up  Change</strong><br /> Your senior leadership will most likely not be on board with an API way of operating, and will need a lot of convincing, and most likely ask you for more &nbsp;evidence of why this will work, before they will give you any resources to embark on your journey. They will want the type of ROI that can kill any API effort before it even gets going, so you will have start small, produce results, and demonstrate the value an API delivers in small, bit-size chunks, week by week. This is not field of dreams, nobody will come once you build it, but this is why you start small, iterate, tell stories, showcase what has been done, and evangelize heavily internally to change senior leaderships view, and win hearts and minds with every integration.</p>
<p><strong>Top Down Change</strong><br /> Even if you have the luxury of having the buy-in of senior leadership, which is extremely unusual, this doesn't mean that your API effort will be a gravy train. Chances are you will hit obstacles, and resistance all along the way. All the advice listed above is meant for your public, and partner audience, but also needs to target your senior, and mid-level management. If you don't have the buy in of the people in the trenches, your API efforts will stumble, and probably fail. The growing number of reasons API fail, are not technical. APIs fail because they do not deliver the value developers actually need, and fail to get the internal change needed to maintain the resources you will need to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>The Enterprise In Age Of Internet</strong><br /> APIs are not just about the enterprise exposing technical endpoints that provide access to your vital resources, and giving you the control you need to govern the usage of these resources. APIs are about the enterprise learning to operate in the age of the Internet, a world that is much more open, global, and distributed, requiring a different approach to business that is about investing in innovation, and less about governance and control. The reason you are probably looking at APIs, is the desire to be more agile, nimble, and deliver web, mobile, and Iot applications faster, better, and cheaper than your competitor&mdash;something that takes a shift from your legacy approaches, and slowly shift your culture to reflect the Internet.</p>
<p>You will not be able to master plan your API strategy, and ensure success. You will need to open up a simple, useful API developer area, with a handful of valuable API resources that can be applied internal, bring value to your partners, and quite possibly the public, and get the wheels of change rolling forward. Only then will then will you start to understand the world of APIs, and if you neglect the simplicity, storytelling, showcasing, and other critical elements needed to develop the feedback loops that are necessary to keep the wheels rolling, you will doom your efforts. APIs don&rsquo;t fail because they are public, or not what is relevant, they fail because you don't see the elements that make them successful, and lack the culture necessary to be an API driven company&mdash;get started making the change that will give your organization the tools it needs to not just be competitive, but lead in the Internet age.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-20.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://swagger.io/">machine readable API definition format Swagger</a>, just rolled over to version 2.0. I use Swagger to describe all of my APIs, and I largely associate the creator of Swagger, <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a> for kicking off this latest renaissance in defining APIs in a way that provides us with a machine readable vocabulary to talk about all of these valuable resoures that we are exposing via APIs.</p>
<p>There are other formats out there, older ones like WADL, and more recent ones like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, but Swagger was the one that revived this movement, helping us create ways for generating important elements throughout the API lifecycle, from mock interfaces in the design process, to testing and monitoring of product APIs.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't much of the details of what has changed from version 1.0 to 2.0, except that with version 2.0 you can use YAML to describe your API, just like competitor RAML, or markdown as with API Blueprint. The common assumption is that by using YAML and Markdown, even non-programmers will be able to communicate around APIs without having to navigate JSON&mdash;something I'm not entirely sold on, but will keeping looking for signs of in the wild</p>
<p>When it comes to the rubber meeting the road, I think Swagger has an advantage because of the amount of adoption, and the tooling available in the community. Swagger has a pretty significant lead when it comes to language libraries, both server and client side, as well as converters, and other integration tooling you will need. There are some areas like an API design editor, where Swagger has been playing catch-up, but overall the community has a pretty significant lead from my vantage point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working to convert all of my Swagger files from version 1.3 to 2.0, then I'm sure I will have more thoughts about the latest version, once I get down into the weeds, but for now I&rsquo;m just happy to see the focus Wordnik is giving <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and that it is continuing to mature in the way that it has, providing us with a much needed way to describe and communicate around APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I'm preparing for a talk at the <a href="http://sgip.org/2014-SGIP-Fall-Conference">The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel Second Annual Conference</a>, in Nashville Tennessee, specifically participating on a panel titled "Using Power Grid Open Data Initiatives". I accepted the request to go speak as part of my wider work on the Green Button iniative out of The White House, DOE, NIST, and the GSA. I was asked to provide some thoughts on how to help move the Green Button efforts forward earlier this winter, and again in the spring, and just haven't had the bandwidth to give any energy, so I saw this as a great opportunity to make some time as part of this panel.</p>
<p>In May, The White House, 18F, some Presidential Innovation Fellows, and myself were asked to move the Green Button ball forward, resulting in a new website, and developer area that is all hosted on Github. I'm bummed I wasn't able to make time to participate, but now I have been able to go through the new site, and developer area, and gather my thoughts on where we could go next with the effort.</p>
<p>Before we get started, lets start with the basics, what is Green Button? Nick Sinai (<a href="https://twitter.com/NickSinai">@NickSinai</a>), Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>Green Button is a policy idea.  It's the notion that customers &ndash; residential, commercial, industrial, and yes, government customers of energy &ndash; ought to get access to their own energy data, in a standard digital format.  The Administration has articulated this several times, in a number of Administration energy, climate, and smart grid policy documents.  The government is a big customer of energy, and we deserve our own energy usage and price data.</p>
<p>Green Button is also a public-private initiative, in response to a 2011 White House call to action.  The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA have been collaborating with the utility and tech industries on this growing effort for a few years now.  The White House has been convening industry and celebrating its progress. NIST has been supporting industry on development of the standard, DOE has been working with utilities, and GSA has been an early adopter.</p>
<p>Finally, Green Button is an actual data standard, for formatting and transferring energy usage and price data.  This standard can be implemented in both utility and non-utility contexts.  Customers can manually download or upload a file formatted in the standard, and IT systems can automatically transfer data between them using the standard.</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>The White House, 18F, and fellow PIFs, have done a great job organizing everything under a single, Github pages site, at <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. The site is a big improvement over what was there before, and moves us closer to solving the fragmentation in the Green Button effort, which I believe is the fundamental issue that is holding it back from being fully realized. Green Button is a big vision, and it is going to take some serious effort to bring together all of the industry, and 3rd party efforts, and most importantly getting individual consumers on-board with taking control over their own energy data.</p>
<p>To help organize my thoughts on how we can move Green Button forward, something I will be discussing on stage in Nashville, I wanted to walk through the site, and take a snapshot of where we are at, then work on a strategy for what is needed to keep the momentum we already have moving forward. Green Button is an extremely critical effort in not just   empowering individuals and institutions to take control over their energy data, but also for the overall health of the energy sector, and whether the utility companies can see it or not, open data and APIs will be central to their continued success. So as I do with other areas, let's walk through where we are at currently with Green Button, to help prime the discussion about where we should go.</p>
<p><strong>First Impressions</strong><br /> When you land on the <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> site, it looks like a modern, clean website effort, with a simple tagline and meaningful image to help you understand what Green Button is all about. The first description is "Helping You Find and Use Your Energy Data", and then when you scroll down you see an answer to the question What is Green Button? -- "Green Button is a secure way to get your energy usage information electronically. I like the concise messaging, but it is solely focused on the consumer, and leaves out the commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations listed on the "use" page. I know this all revolves around energy data, but when you land on site, you should have the site speak to you, no matter who you are.</p>
<p>I think the "use" page does a great job in breaking down who the target audience is, but the first impression doesn't reflect this, and I don't think there is any path for these users to follow, once you do find yourself on <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. As a data custodian, or 3rd party developer, I think the build or developer page will quickly speak to you, but as a consumer, you are quickly dropped from the focus of the site and will be completely lost in the rich information that is available. To on-board each user properly, we will need to begin to carve out paths for each user, one that start with a meaningful first impression off of the home page, then puts them on a path that leads them twoard action and the relevant resources they will need, depending on their role.</p>
<p><strong>Learn About Green Button</strong><br /> I really like the learn page for Green Button. It is clean, simple, informative, and not overwhelming for me to learn about what Green Button is, from any perspectives. My only suggestions for next steps is that we begin massaging some of the rich content available under "library", and link to specific learning opportunities from this page. Each summary should provide users with links to follow, taking them to the detail they will need to fully understand each aspect of Green Button as it pertains to their position. However, with that said it is critical to keep this page a simple overview of Green Button, and make it an easy doorway to the world of energy data.</p>
<p><strong>Using Green Button</strong><br /> As I said above, the "use" section provides a nice overview of who should be using Green Button, with sections focusing on commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations, as well residential consumers. What is needed for each of these sections, is a clear call to action, taking you to another page that is a "getting started" specifically targeting your role in the Green Button movement. I don't think the lack of this, is a deficiency of what is currently there, it is just the next logical step for evolving this page to better onboard users, now that these roles are better defined.</p>
<p><strong>The Green Button Community</strong><br /> This is the first time I've seen the Green Button community reflected on a single page like this, and is exactly what is needed to help reduce the fragmentation currently present across the community. Presenting the four groups in this way, complete with links to their sites, and relevant contact information to get involved, is very important for bringing together the community. My only critique is that the page could use a little more layout love, formatting, logos, and some polish to keep it looking as good as the rest of the site&mdash;nothing major.  Eventually it would also be nice to have some sort of stream of activity across all of these efforts, aggregated here. I'm not sure how this would occur, as the groups are all using different ways to keep members informed, but something should be considered, further bringing together the community.</p>
<p><strong>Build With Green Button</strong><br /> The developers section probably needs the most help right now, and I'm not 100% sure of how to make more coherent. It is a little redundant and circular, and its called "build" on home page, and "developers" in the top navigation, something that should be consistent. The RESTful APIs is represented twice, and i see glimpses of trying to provide separate information for data stewards, and 3rd party developers. Along with the development of specific paths for different target users, this needs to be reworked, and woven into those efforts, but I do like the focus on the open source nature of Green Button. The first time I landed on Green Button, I didn't fully grasp that it was an open source API that anyone can deploy, and that the sandbox version that is in operation is just a demo, something that I think we need to make fully clear to users of all types.</p>
<p>We have a big challenge ahead when it comes to helping data custodians understand what is possible, and hopefully we can help spur 3rd party developers in not just build around existing Green Button code, but also work to develop new versions in other languages, as well as specific cloud offerings on maybe Amazon or Heroku. The sky is the limit when it comes to developing, and building Green Button solutions, both server and client side, and we need to make the separation as clear as possible. It will take some serious architectural vision to help bridge what code is currently available for Green Button, and stimulate commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations in understanding what is possible, and incentivize them to deliver solutions that are quickly deployable across the cloud landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Library</strong><br /> As with the "learn" and "use" sections of the site, the current library section was a great step forward in bringing together the wealth of current resources available to support Green Button efforts. What is needed now is just the refinement of what is there, making it easier to access, and learn from, while also making sure that resources are appropriately grouped into buckets targeting each of the Green Button user groups. As I'm working through the the library of materials, I can see there are some seriously rich resource available, but there is a lot of disconnect between them because they are designed, developed and deployed to support different goals, by different authors&mdash;we need to establish some consistency between them.</p>
<p>Right now the library is very much a list of resources, and it would be nice to make sure it truly is a library that is organized, indexable, and is easy to navigate. Having all of these resources in a single location is an excellent start, but how do we start refining them, and making them much more usable by all users? Documents should have a consistent document formats, videos should have single Youtube (or other) channel, and much more. All of this would make it much more likely that these resources would be explored, an consumed by a wider audience, beyond just the alpha geek crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Testing Tools</strong><br /> I'm happy to see the Green Button testing tool here, but ultimately it feels like one tool, that should be in a toolbox. Right now it is its own top level navigation item, and I don't think a single tool should be elevated to this level. I would change this to tools, and make the testing tool the one item in the toolbox right now, and I'm sure there are others we can quickly add to the toolbox as well. As with other areas, we should break down the toolbox by user group, making sure consumers easily find what they need, as well as utility providers, 3rd party developers and the other user groups.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started With Green Button</strong><br /> I was excited to see the Getting Started button, until I realized it was just an email address. ;-(  That isn't getting started, it is sending an email. Getting started should be prominent, and truly provide users with easy paths to well...get started. If you are data custodian, utility, or energy provider, you should have a simple page that explains how to get started, in a self-service way&mdash;no email needed. Separately, there should be contact information for Green Button, something that hopefully includes much more than just an email address, with no face and personality behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging Where We Are</strong><br /> That is a quick walkthrough of where things are at with <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>, and in my opinion, things have come a long ways from what I was seeing spread across the Green Button landscape this last winter. Most importantly it is aggregating the community, developer, and the wealth of other resources into a library, which is a very critical step to continue moving Green Button forward. In my opinion the v1 tech of Green Button tech is in place, it is just lacking all the refinement, storytelling, and relationship building that is necessary to move Green Button into the consciousness of utility companies, 3rd party developers, and the average, everyday energy consumer&mdash;so how do we do this?</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Needs A Champion</strong><br /> First, before we get into any of the nuts and bolts of what we can do to keep <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> rolling forward, the project is going to need a champion. I think The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA are doing an amazing job of making sure things move forward, but <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> needs someone who is super passionate about energy data, APIs, understands the energy industry, and wants to put in the hours necessary to refine the information currently available, build relationships, and generate new content that will bring in new players. This role isn't some cushy job that you will get a regular paycheck for, but for the right person, I think it could be pretty lucrative, if you get creative in piecing together sponsorship and support from industry players, organizations, and worked hard on the grant writing front. Essentially you need The API Evangelist, for energy data and APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Who's offering Green Button?</strong><br /> I think the first place to start is visible right on the home page, and looking at who is already putting Green Button data to work. I see 50+ entities who are already putting Green Button to work, so who are these people, and how can we showcase what they are up to.  There are some meaningful implementations here, and I know there is some great material here to demonstrate the power, and importance of Green Button, and help spark the imagination of new visitors.  Green Button has traction, the problem is not enough people know about it, or have the imagination to understand how it is being used. Let's take the time to showcase this, and create some really great content that will make the site more educational. This is something that can be led by the Green Button evangelist I talk about above, but is also something I think the community should also contribute to. I'm going to carve out some time to reach out to some of the providers listed, and see if i can showcase how they are putting Green Button to work, and generate more detail, and content that can be contributed to <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. Do you want to help?</p>
<p><strong>Showcase Of How Green Button Is Used</strong><br /> Building on the work above, we need a place to showcase how Green Button is being put to use. I'm not sure this should be a top level navigation item, but if we group each entry in the showcase, by the type of user, I think we can make it one stop of the path each user takes, as they learn about Green Button. As each commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations, and individual energy users is learning about Green Button, they should also be exposed to examples of other similar individuals or companies like them that are already putting Green Button to work. This will go a long way in helping people see the potential of Green Button, and begin the journey of putting it to work across the energy industry landscape in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>Blog For Bringing Green Button To Life</strong><br /> The <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> site needs a blog. This is something that will be difficult without a champion to keep alive, but a blog is going to be essential in bringing the site to life, helping share stories about the value Green Button is bringing to companies, organizations, institutions, and most importantly the average consumer. Without a blog, any developer community will not have a soul, or a personality, and it will be difficult to convince anyone that someone is home, and that they should trust and care about Green Button. I think a blog could easily be crowdsourced, allowing passionate folks like myself to post, as well as other organizations, companies, and key stakeholders to post relevant stories, that will give the site a heartbeat. A blog will be central to any of the suggestions I will have to help move things forward, and give <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> a personality that will go a long way in building trust amongst users, and across the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Giving Some Coherence To The Developers Section</strong><br /> The developer section of <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> will be essential to scaling the effort, and right now the page is a little all over the place, and will take some significant effort to simplify, make usable, and bring the wealth of developer resources into focus. This will take some serious work, by someone who is a developer, architect, and can make actually organize everything into something that easily on-boards data custodians, and 3rd party developers with as little friction as possible. You have to walk them through the wealth of tooling that is already available, show them what is possible, and then give them the downloads they need to get things working in their world.</p>
<p>There is also a need for some other additional tooling, some of the current solutions are very enterprise oriented, and I think with some encouragement, providers could replicate Green Button tooling in other languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, and other platforms that will encourage rapid adoption by other providers. There also needs to be some ways to help people quickly bring Green Button to life using cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, Google, Azure and other platforms that companies and individuals are already depending on.</p>
<p>The developer section is something that will take some deep thinking, hacking, and architectural magic from the champion, and Green Button evangelist. They will have to look at it through the eyes of each of the data custodians, and 3rd party developers who are already putting Green Button to use, and try to deliver things in a way that will speak to this, as well as potentially other new users. This type of work is not easy, and takes some serious effort, something you can't expect to happen overnight. However, if it is done right this can really help scale the number of Green Button implementations in the wild, and take things to the next level much quicker.</p>
<p><strong>Turning The Library Into A Consistent Resource</strong><br /> I am happy to see all of the rich Green Button resources brought into a single location, but I wouldn't call it quite a library yet. It is a listing of valuable resources, that aren't really organized in a way that speaks to the different Green Button users, and are not consistent in form because they come from different sources. Even with this said, their is a wealth of resources available there, and with some work you could build a really nice, interactive library that can help educate users on how to put Green Button to work. Similar to the showcase, once the library is organized, and grouped by target user, I think the library can be a stop on the path that each user takes, showing them exactly the resources they need in the library to help onboard them properly.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Paths For Green Button Users</strong><br /> As I discussed above, each user needs a path they can take from the "use" page to begin their journey. Right now the "use" page is a dead end, where it should actually be a call to action, providing each visitor the chance to take a path through the site that speaks to them, without forcing them to have to wade through the wealth of resources that are currently there. From the "use" page, each user can be taken to a showcase of other implementations from similar users, then depending on their role, could be walk through other sections of the site, landing in the library, presenting with exactly what they need to get going. I'm not exactly sure what the user experience will be on these new paths, but I think once we profile the existing uses of Green Button, and unwind the developer and library resources, a pretty orderly route can be established for each user group. These paths will go a long way to onboard users in a fraction of the time, and maximize the potential reach, and scale of the platform&mdash;adding more implementations to the Green Button platform, and scaling the audience with each new user.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Green Button From Site to Community</strong><br /> I will stop here. I think this is all that should be focused on for now, when it comes to moving Green Button forward. It is important to not bite off too much, and make sure we can be successful in moving things forward, and not make things more complex. The goal is to simplify what we have, now that we have everything organized into a single site, and begin the process of bringing <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> to life. With someone at the helm, an active blog, and a more coherent focus on each user group, I think that things will start picking up steam, and with more outreach, and involvement with existing Green Button implementations, and the existing Green Button community, we can move <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> from being just a site, and put it on its way to becoming a community.</p>
<p>It is important that Green Button evolves to become a community. It cannot remain just a government initiative. Green Button has to be a vibrant community that commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, energy efficiency organizations, and individual energy users are all part of, otherwise it will always remain just something being pushed from the top down. Green Button has to be also owned by the individual energy users, and institutions, providing essential bottom up momentum to match the energy given from the top by the federal government partners&mdash;without this the energy industry will never buy in.</p>
<p>Profiling the existing Green Button implementations, and making the site speak to each of the user groups will be important for taking things to the next step. This process will help communicate to a next generation of implementations what is possible, and through regular showcasing and storytelling we can move Green Button beyond just a policy idea, and initiative from government, or just a technical data standard, and transform it into something that is a default part of the energy industry. In this new world, energy users will be used to having control over their data, and entirely new markets will be established delivering services to energy consumers, within this new space.</p>
<p>All the parts and pieces are there, and much like last round of work on the <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>&nbsp;site brought all these resources together, we need to figure out how to bring the energy industry together and show them the potential of Green Button data and APIs. We need to make sure energy consumers, both individual and institutional, understand the importance of having control over their energy data, and show data custodians that this is the future of doing business in the energy space. Once we can achieve this, Green Button will take on a life of its own, driven not just by the government, or even the utility providers, but by the energy of 3rd party companies who are delivering meaningful solutions for institutional, organizational, and individual energy consumers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The conversation around open data and APIs in government is dominated by talk of making resources available to the public, which is a good thing, but is only 1/3 of the discussion that should be occurring amongst gov-focused techies, as well as the project owners, and data stewards who are managing these vital public resources across federal agencies.</p>
<p>APIs are not just deployed to support public access to resources, this has just been the trend that is getting all the headlines, and there is still lot of value to be realized when putting APIs to work within an agency, opening up access to data, content, and other digital resources, increasing efficiency agency-wide using Internet technology. The best example of this in action is out of the private sector from Amazon, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">story of the important role internal APIs have played in the company's success</a>, across internal operations, but also in the public as a commerce, and a cloud computing leader.</p>
<p>To help you relate to the idea of an internal API, think of all the times you've had to ask IT for access to something from a database, like a list of facility locations, government programs, or maybe an employee directory. You have to find out where the source of these resources are, track down the right contact information, then put in a request to get a copy of the data or content you are looking for. Often times even once you get the data dump, it could be the wrong information, or missing what you are needing, requiring you to go back, yet again, to get what you are looking for--not very efficient, and also extremely frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Access To The Resources You Need</strong><br /> When you open up data or content via an API, despite common belief, you aren't necessarily making the information available to anyone on the open Internet, you are just using Internet technology to make it accessible. In some cases, you may publish the fact that the information is available in a public location, but can require that only internal staff has access to it. Regardless of exactly how you approach, the information, and registration for access of an API should always be available in a self-service way, allowing anyone to discover, and gain access without requesting permission from IT, or having to hunt down the source. In a perfect API world every agency will have a central API area where anyone can find all the resources available across the agency, eliminating many of the bottlenecks that commonly exist across government.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Are Not Just For Developers</strong><br /> Developers would like to think APIs are just for them, but this is a reflection of the historic power and control IT has wielded when controlling access to databases, file stores, and other digital resources that are used across government agencies. Sure, APIs require knowing how to access the resource, and potentially the ability to write code that will pull, parse, and publish information to where it is needed, but APIs can just as easily be connected to spreadsheets, documents, and have ready to go HTML listings, details, and other fully functional widgets. This approach to API consumption has been pioneered by private sector technology companies, allowing tech savvy users to reverse engineer API access or put to use as is&mdash;no development experience necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Data And Content Kept Up To Date In Realtime</strong><br /> Without APIs, when you finally do get the list of facilities, programs or contacts from IT, it might already be out of date. If you are requiring IT to provide a dump of data in XML, CSV, spreadsheet or other format, it is just that&mdash;a dump. Any changes made in the central database will not be reflected in your dump, rendering your work obsolete, and potentially turning it from information, to misinformation. APIs allow you to keep a connection between the information source, and your web and mobile application, spreadsheet or other system, up to date in realtime. Even if updating your project is manual, at least you have a realtime connection to the original source that you can use to update as you dictate, not based on only when you can get &nbsp;the IT resources to help.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics For Data And Content Owners On Who Is Using</strong><br /> APIs are not just about getting users access to the data and content they need in their projects, it goes both ways, and can provide a wealth of valuable information to the database administrator, content owner, and data steward who is in charge of the vital government resource. With everyone accessing your resources via an API, you have a realtime pulse on who has access to your resources and rich details on how they are using it. Do you know who is consuming your digital resources today? It is likely you do not, and this new approach using web APIs come with built in tools for truly understanding who has access, while also allowing for access in realtime without demanding extra time and attention, but when you are ready you can audit and understand how these resources are actually being put to use across an agency.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking Beyond Public APIs At Your Agency</strong><br /> Understanding that APIs are much more than just making data available to public developers is extremely important, and can transform how your agency works. Amazon managed to internalize APIs in such a way that changed not just how they do business when it came to online commerce on Amazon.com, but transformed the way we all do business on the Internet. Imagine if a federal agency could see APIs the same, and allow the accessing of internal resources in a similar way, it could entirely change how government services are delivered.</p>
<p>If all digital resources at an agency could be made available via APIs, it has the potential dramatically shift how agencies operate. Right now most agencies already have a wealth of internal web services that somewhat resemble modern web APis, the problem is they are designed by, and deployed for IT and developer stakeholders, not everyone else in the organization. The significant difference between web service and APIs is that APIs use Internet technologies to make data and content available in a very simple way, that if bundled with the right building blocks can make vital resources accessible to anyone across the agency.</p>
<p>IT and developers are fine with just publishing an API and calling it good, as they know how to access these APis without assistance. With just a little more thought, and work, connectors, widgets, and spreadsheet tools can make resources much more widely available across an organization, department and even agency-wide. Undoubtedly it will take a lot of work to shift how IT makes resources available, but there are also tools to help content owners, and data stewards to deploy and consume their own APIs. There are wealth of database, and <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">spreadsheet to API solutions</a> available, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">content management system (CMS) to API solutions for common platforms like Drupal and Wordpress</a>. Ideally IT gets on board with an API centric vision, but it isn't a requirement in 2014, where waves of web APIs are emerging providing access to the resource you need to solve the problems you face in your everyday world, with or without IT being involved.</p>

<p>I am working on a white paper for a big enterprise provider who is looking to deliver solutions in the API space. At their request I&rsquo;ve gone through six industries and looked for companies who have over 5k employees and are doing interesting things with APIs--a request that produced some great research for the white paper, as well as for stories here on API Evangelist.</p>
<p>It can be hard to find large enterprise organizations who are doing full blown "API", because honestly many of them just do not get it yet. Sure I can find many that are doing web services, and dabbling with APIs, but it can be downright difficult to find examples of companies that I would showcase as a healthy API patterns.</p>
<p>Doing this research I was looking more for examples of anything &ldquo;API&rdquo; happening, any bare-bones, positive signals that could be emulated, and try and demonstrate what huge opportunities there are in these industries, for anyone who could do it right. I got my first draft ready, and submitted for review, and jumped on a call to discuss.</p>
<p>Everything looked great in the paper, except senior leadership said there was a lack of detail demonstrating how developers were building applications on these enterprise public APIs, They would need more hard examples of how these large company APIs were being used, how this benefited the API provider, and some hard numbers of usage, revenue, showing how business models, products and services were being developed.</p>
<p>After smiling, I told them I could guarantee that most of these providers themselves don't have that detail, and are still working to figure this out. Your request is exactly why we do APIs, and begin to establish an external R&amp;D lab for providing answers, in realtime. Even if some of the more mature providers have this information, I can guarantee they aren't going to share it publicly. Maybe if they were a startup, this type of sharing might be in their DNA, but not the enterprise, sorry.</p>
<p>These types of questions are what I got from government agencies (and still get) two years ago after President Obama mandated that all federal agencies go machine readable by default. They wanted to see the ROI from other agencies doing APIs, before they'd do it too. I wish I had all the answers to make risk averse government agencies, institutions, and enterprise feel warm and fuzzy about APIs, but just like it has taken all of us over two years to get any results in the federal government, and four years for me in the wider API space. It is going to take a lot of hard work before you will see those numbers, and if you require these before you get your feet wet, I can guarantee the numbers will be generated by your competitors before you do.</p>
<p>You have to be a little adventurous, agile, and nimble to operate in this realm. If you aren&rsquo;t, I recommend starting with some of the low hanging, safer fruit in your company, and just get started, because then you can hopefully learn from the API process. Once you begin your journey you start to see cultural benefits of an API-centric focus&mdash;otherwise you can sit back and watch a new wave of startups and your existing competition do it for you.</p>

<p>I used to work hard to write blog posts on API Evangelist that would have broad appeal with the Hacker News community, and at first I didn't have any luck, after trying to engage with readers on posts, I found myself blacklisted, where nothing I submitted showed up. I lived in some kind parallel universe, all because I argued with a couple influential HN users, who didn't like what I had to offer.</p>
<p>I started a new account for API Evangelist, and began playing the game with a little different approach. I didn't engage with users, and wrote posts with titles that would bring in readers, kept things short and superficial, and had some front-page exposure, which would result in thousands of pageviews, and then would dissipate. This type of storytelling ever really turned into meaningful traffic, an engaged audience, conversations, or brought any value to my overall mission.</p>
<p>Early last year I stopped posting to HN, only occasionally posted a story, but never really used it in the same way that I had before. I was worried my traffic would be hurt, but I went back to work, trying to write meaningful posts, that brought value to my target audience, and supported my mission. In the last year and a half, I've seen my sustained monthly traffic go from 500 page views a day to almost 2000 a day, all by just my sticking to my mission.</p>
<p>The audience that does visit my blog, for the most part engages with me, shares posts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other channels, and I see much of what I write echoed on other blogs, and in conversations I see on social media, and in person at events. This approach to building my audience, and ultimately traffic to my site has been very healthy in helping me obtain my objectives. My goal is not pageviews for advertising sake, it is to build an awareness in the average business person, and the everyday individual, about the importance of APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post because see echoes of HN in another blog DZone, which I don&rsquo;t actually syndicate to, but because of the history behind my kin lane.com blog, some of my posts still get hand selected by the DZone staff, and syndicated to the blog. Many of these blog posts get some pretty good comment activity, and the other week a blog post I wrote on Google&rsquo;s hiring process, which got quite a bit of comments, including some pretty trollish ones.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of feeding the trolls, something I don't usually do, but I can&rsquo;t help myself occasionally, and it made me think of this same illness that many advertising driven technology sites possess. I&rsquo;m so happy to have my blog, something I know that reaches a wide range of people, not just because of the page views, but also because of the online and in-person feedback I get. The alpha geek crowd is not my audience, and I don't care what they think about what I&rsquo;m saying, but the trollish comments still get to me sometimes. i quickly shrug them off, but writing about these emotions is one way I do that&mdash;resulting in this post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to have a mission driven blog, that goes beyond monetization through advertising. My audience may be small compared to DZone or Hacker News, and what I do may not matter to a lot of their users, but at least I have purpose that involves helping educate people, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to tell people how stupid they are, and that what they do is worthless. I can&rsquo;t imagine being so lost, that doing that makes you feel better. It makes me sad, but then I get back to work, and move on, keeping on with my mission.</p>

<p>In 2014 we are making significant progress in deploying APIs in support of city operations, but we still have so much more work ahead of us when it comes to making public resources available. You can find a dedicated developer area full of data sets, and APIs, in most major US cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and many more, but what else can we do to really pick up the momentum and quality?</p>
<p><strong>Standardizing API Design Practices</strong><br /> APIs are not that difficult to design with the right education, and experience. Developers who work on city contracts, or are employed by the city should all be taught common web API design practices, and be exposed to modern API design tooling like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a>. Even with this type of education, there will still be many differences between city deployments based upon needs, and tactics, but a little training could go a long way to make city operations more streamlined.</p>
<p><strong>Open Solutions For API Deployment</strong><br />There are a lot of common approaches to delivering city services, which means there should also a be a number of ways to provide standardized, open solutions for deploying APIs that support city operations. There should be a wealth of open source, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/22/wordpress-style-api-modules-for-government/">Wordpress like solutions for deploying APIs in support of government operations.</a> Sometimes connecting to legacy systems is just to much work, and deploying a simple, standalone solution, then syncing using data dumps or directly with backbend system might be more fruitful.</p>
<p><strong>Common API Management Vision</strong><br />I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the standard approach to deploying city developer areas, and delivering data sets, and APIs, but in reality this is the result of the hard work of <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, one of the API management providers dedicated to the government space. I think Socrata, and the other vendors out there are definitely one piece of the puzzle for managing APIs for city operations, but I also think we need other competing, open solutions similar to <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a> which is being used across the federal government.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling Across Cities</strong><br />When it comes to helping cities better serve their citizens, and save money along the way, I can&rsquo;t think of a better place to start than by providing common, open source tools for delivering web, and mobile applications on top of city data and APIs. We have to stop re-inventing the wheel for each city when it comes to developing common apps, city needs are going to be very similar across cities--just take a look at solutions like <a href="http://www.open311.org/">Open311</a>, and the let&rsquo;s get to work on delivering similiar solutions for every part of city operations.</p>
<p>There is no reason each city should have to go at it alone when it comes to designing, deploying, managing, evangelizing, and putting APIs to work across city operations. We should have standard data models, API definitions, and a wealth of open source tools for cities to put to work.</p>
<p>I don't see APIs as the solution for all cities problems, but I do think that APIs should be common practice for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> cities. Every city should be publishing all of their data and content in machine readable way, without causing employees any extra work&mdash;it should just be part of normal operations.</p>
<p>In the future, all cities will have standard APIs across all cities, and common open source solutions that can be put to work serving citizens in all aspects of city operations. This is how we are going to empower our cities to more with less, and make governing a more inclusive for everyone.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I saw another story about whether or not public APIs are going away, which is another story in a fairly long line of stories I&rsquo;m seeing lately from enterprise outlets about whether or not the demise of Netflix, ESPN, and now Aetna means public APIs are a bad idea, unsustainable and now will be going away&mdash;proving enterprise API architects right that an SOA is the way to go.</p>
<p>If you are looking at the bigger API picture, the answer to this question is clearly no. Amazon, Salesforce, Twilio, and many other public APIs with straightforward business models are doing just fine. Just because a handful of companies who never quite had a business model, and never really gave their API efforts &nbsp;the resources they needed to be successful, doesn't mean that public APIs are a bad idea.</p>
<p>Looking through my list of 2500+ APIs I track on, I can point to numerous other APIs that are about to shutter, which has nothing to do with the fact that they are public, and everything to do with not having the right business and political building blocks for their API. I&rsquo;m sorry if you are just in the game to exploit developers and get them to build things for your company, you can&rsquo;t be exploitative in this game and last, developers smell that shit a mile away--you have to give, just as much as receive.</p>
<p>To be successful when it comes to APIs, you can't just launch an API, spend 100K on a popular API management solution, hire one guy (you know it, you hired a guy), and expect miracles within a couple months. It just doesn't work that way. APIs take a lot more grassroots building of an evangelist team, investment in a lot of projects, telling of many meaningful stories, and going to many conferences, Meetups, and events before anyone will know you exist, let alone building anything on your APIs.</p>
<p>Public APIs being a failure is something the enterprise wants you to believe so they can sell you their SOA solutions disguised as API ones, Public APIs disappearing is more about the business and politics of APIs, and less about the technology and whether something is publicly available or not. If you don't have the company culture to invest in transparency, outreach, and providing meaningful resources that developers will need to be successful, you will fail in the public API game, so give up now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about how the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">open source API search engine APIs.io</a> can be deployed as an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/an-apisjson-collection-of-api-resources-across-your-public-partner-or-internal-resources/">internal API search engine</a>, as well as for public API discovery in the past. One aspect of this approach that I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, is that the search engine doesn&rsquo;t just return APIs in the search results, it can <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/">provide access to supporting building blocks</a> as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a> doesn't just provide a machine readable way to describe, and index your APIs, it also provides a way to describe the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that support your APIs like code samples, SDKs</a>, and other things API consumers will need when putting APIs to work for them.</p>
<p>The indexing of these API support elements really starts to benefit company operations when you also bundle tools for non-developers alongside internal APIs, like spreadsheet connectors, <a href="http://d3.js">d3.js visualizations</a> built on top of APIs, and other elements that any user can reverse engineer, or just put to work immediately--no configuration necessary.</p>
<p>Imagine if your internal staff could access any digital resources across the company, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">similar to what Amazon has done internally</a>, and not just find the API driven resources they need, but also the tools they need to apply them in their jobs. This is where APIs started getting really powerful, allowing anyone at your company to put APIs to work and get their jobs done in a self-service way, with a limited amount of IT resources required.</p>

<p>I get a lot of folks who engage me about the API space, most of them are API providers, many are focused on API consumption, with only just a small few are looking the evangelism and analyst side of things. As far as I know I&rsquo;m the only individual out there looking at all industries, across all of these areas, working hard to understand how APIs are being applied across the board.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always keeping an eye out for talent that is also working to expand their knowledge in the same way, but as the API universe expands I think this is going to be increasingly difficult, and I think we are going to start needing more analysts who focus within specific domains, and business sectors.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching Mark Silverberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/skram">@skram</a>) over at <a href="http://SocialHealthInsights.com">SocialHealthInsights.com</a>, and is what I&rsquo;d considered to be an API expert when it comes to the convergence of healthcare and APIs.</p>
<p>Mark is always hacking on interesting things related to healthcare, and pushing the envelope when it comes to healthcare APIs, by not just hacking on healthcare APIs, but also developing apps for Google Glass. Mark has developed his expertise in a similar way as I do, by hacking, telling stories, and consulting--which I think is the best way to develop yourself as an API expert.</p>
<p>Earlier this spring the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">FDA was preparing their new developer area</a>, including the release of a handful of APIs like the drug labeling and adverse effects APis, and a handful of us with DC connections that were on the backchannel, providing feedback for the FDA during this beta period. Unfortunately I was too busy traveling to participate, but Mark was front and center providing some serious feedback on the API, resulting data, and the overall approach by the FDA.</p>
<p>It has taken me four long years to develop my eye for not just the technical, but the business and political approach to delivering APIs, and it is something I&rsquo;ve only lightly touched on when it comes to the healthcare sector. I would say that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark is this</span>, cultivating a pretty critical eye for what is important when it comes to APIs in the healthcare space. If you are needing any guidance when it comes to planning, designing, deploying, and managing your healthcare APIs I recommend you connect with Mark, he can help you out like nobody else I know&mdash;make sure and tell him I sent you his way.</p>
