			<p><em>03 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>In July of 2010, I started researching what would be the next step in my career. I was VP of Technology at WebEvents global, and was in charge of the technical side of running conferences for SAP and Google. I enjoyed the work I did, scaling the technology to support the events, using the Amazon Cloud and APIs, but I was not fully satisfied in the events industry.&nbsp; I clearly remember spending my Fourth of July weekend researching some possible next steps. Building on my strengths at the time, I looked at what I could do in the cloud computing space. My early research is still even online, forever preserved as a Google Site. The last update to the research was mid half way through July, when after a couple weeks of careful evaluation and contemplating, I saw the core of cloud computing was really about APIs. I had an epiphany -- APIs were central to the recent social and cloud evolutions in the Internet, and as I looked deeper, I saw that web APIs were also beginning to play a central role in the mobile evolution as well. As I continued my research in July of 2010 I also noticed that everyone was focused on the technical aspects of APIs, discussing, often arguing about the technical merits of REST, and very few people were talking about the business side of successful API efforts. Through my early research in cloud computing, and ultimately APIs, I had found my focus -- the business of APIs. My partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) was also looking for her own direction, and we agreed that if she started Hack Education, I would help her run her server and other IT infrastructure, and if I started API Evangelist, she would help me learn to write, and craft better stories--some of the early stories were actually written or edited by her. July 2010's research was all about finding my focus,...[<a href="/2015/07/03/five-years-of-api-evangelist/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was doing one of my regular checkins with my friend Anne Wootton (@annewootton) of Popup Archive today, something we try to do regularly, to share stories about what they are up to in the world of audio and podcast API, and what I am seeing across the voice, audio, video, and wider API landscape.&nbsp;
Anne was walking me through their latest rollout&nbsp;AudioSear.ch, a&nbsp;full text search &amp; recommendation API for podcasts and radio, that is API driven. One of the endpoints for the AudioSear.ch API allows for searching of people who are involved with the podcasts and radio programs that they are indexing. As we talked, she articulated that in order to help people see the value the AudioSear.ch People API, rather than just telling them about it, they were building micro applications, that demonstrated it.
This may seem obvious too many, but I've made a career out of shining a light on the obvious, and with APIs being such an abstract concept, little ideas like this can go a long ways. In this era of microservices, the concept of micro, portable, simple, and focused goes a long way, and what AudioSear.ch is doing with their people API is something that other API providers should consider as well.
Sometimes, the little things like a demo micro application built on top of your API can be the thing that plants a seed in someones mind about what your API does--a seed that over time could grow into something much, much more. I already advocate for other code related building blocks like SDK, PDKs, and starter projects--maybe I'll add micro apps as a building block and see if I can incite API providers to deploy more of them to support API operations.

			<p><em>30 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I try to go through each of my areas of research as often as I can and update the content, as well as my understanding. Ideally I update the news each week, take a look at the organizations involved once a month, and evaluate the building blocks and tools each quarter. Unfortunately it doesn't always happen as planned, but as a one man operation, I think I do pretty well.&nbsp; I just went through my API design research, and adjusted my definition of what I felt needed be listed there. As I move API definitions to their own research area(s), I'm reconsidering what I want to keep an eye on when it comes to API design, and my current definition involves organizations who offer API design editors, either in the cloud or as download. They should allow you to add, edit, and manage the API details, then also provide the ability to import and export using common API definition format(s). Currently I have nine organizations represented, as part of my API design research: Apiary&nbsp;Apiary jump-started the modern API design movement, by making API definitions more than just about API documentation, allowing API designers to define APIs in the machine readable API definition format API blueprint, then mock, share, and publish documentation via a cloud platform. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apigee API Studio&nbsp;Apigee launched their API Studio out of their earlier Apigee-127 product, their work on the Swagger platform and editor, and their BaaS offering.

			<p><em>30 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am going through each of my research projects, and tightening things down, now that I have them all driven through my new, master stack of APIs. First up was API design, and the other day I spent time going through the organization I track on as part of my API design research, and today mission was to refine the tooling section.
Previously my tooling page was just an alphabetical list of tools, and I wanted to at least group things in a more meaningful way, reflecting how I break them down in my own monitoring system. So I reworked the publishing to allow me to group the tools by tags, resulting in the following list:





API Blueprint



API Blueprint
&nbsp;
API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A couple of semantic assumptions over the plain Markdown. API Blueprint is perfect for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read &ndash; after all it is just a form of plain text. API Blueprint, its parser, and most of its tools are completely open sourced so you don't have to worry about vendor lock-in. This also means you can freely integrate API Blueprint into any type of product, commercial or not.

			<p><em>29 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I just read on Re/Code, that the Supreme Court declined to hear Google's appeal on the Oracle v Google case--prepare for the waves of stories from tech blogs, that this will suffocate the API economy. During the last response to the case by the US Solicitor General, I wrote about how I can't even argue the concept anymore, and nothing has changed for me.&nbsp; I just wanted to take the moment to remind everyone that this decision means nothing if we all share our API definitions, in open ways, using machine readable definitions like API Blueprint and Swagger. The disturbing move by Oracle to bring a lawsuit against Google, and the very unaware decision(s) made all the way up to federal level, will NOT bring down the API economy--your inaction will! If I've learned anything during my time defending APIs, as part of the Oracle v Google case, is that many of you are holding your API designs close to your chest, thinking maybe, just maybe, they are intellectual property we should protect, and can make money on, when we are the next unicorn start-up. You are willing to do this, even at the expense of the success of your APIs, ignoring that it creates huge amounts of friction with developers, and the businesses you are asking to integrate your APIs into their systems. When you bundle this with the large numbers of folks who don't even understand the difference between an API definition or design, and its code back-end, you end up with a very dangerous, controllable group of folks, who will slowly stifle, and potentially suffocate any momentum we have built with the API economy. It will be these groups of individuals and companies, who will blindly do Oracle's bidding, and make sure any democratizing power APIs had, stays in the hands of the powerful few. Why would anyone integrate your API definition into their application, if at some point they can be...[<a href="/2015/06/29/apis-will-not-be-suffocated-by-oracle-and-the-courts-it-will-be-done-by-each-of-you-not-sharing-your-api-designs/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I wrote that&nbsp;we should be generating Slate API documentation from Swagger so we maintain a machine readable core the other day--while I love the look of Slate, I want to make sure all API meta data is machine readable by default. Shortly after publishing my post, someone kindly pointed me to a version of Swagger that was developed by&nbsp;Jens-Ole Graulund, which was exactly the evolution that I was looking for.
The more response, Swagger driven version of Slate API document is perfect!&nbsp;Giving API providers a more attractive, response version of Swagger UI (sorry Tony), while also keeping the core machine readable.--it is the best of both worlds! I plugged in one of my other complete Swagger definitions, and boom...I had a new version of my API docs.

Tips like this from my readers is why I blog about all my ideas out loud. If I kept my thoughts locked up, this type of discovery would never occur. I am going to play with deploying this version of the Swagger UI for my API stack, to see how versatile it is, and how well it works with my own site template.&nbsp;
I just wanted to put it out there that this new option for Swagger UI exists, in case you were looking for an alternate version of the Swagger UI. I predict this is the beginning of many different iterations on Swagger UI, resulting in one eventually that is themable. ;-)

			<p><em>27 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have been using the Atom editor&nbsp;when I work on local files on my workstation for some time now. With the latest version 1.0 release I took a fresh look at the architecture, and under the hood at the packages that make the platform so powerful, and extensible. One of the packages I was reverse engineering this weekend, is the&nbsp;Atom API Autocomplete Package. The&nbsp;Atom API Autocomplete Package is one of several autocompete packages that gives Atom some of that IDE feel when you are editing files. I like the feel of Atom autocomplete, and I really dig that this functionality is extensible via Atom packages. This experience got me thinking again about the IDEs role in API design and development, and how I'd like to see more API definition driven dictionaries, defined using APIs.json, driving IDE autocomplete features like the Atom editor has. Like everything in my world, my concept of APIs.json driven dictionaries is a work in progress, but to kick things off I launched a new API I'm calling my dictionary API, that helps me build and manage dictionaries that I can potentially use in an Atom autocomplete package. As I do with all of my work, I want to put my ideas out there early to get feedback, and stimulate other people's imaginations. To provide the content for my dictionaries, I am using Swagger, my primary API definition format. All I do is index any single, or collection of multiple APIs using APIs.json, and pass the URL to my new dictionary API, and I get back a JSON dictionary.&nbsp; This is my first draft of an potential dictionary output. I still have to get familiar with the Atom package design, and I've noticed different autocomplete packages handle their completions differently, but I at least wanted an automated way for importing Swagger definition(s), and create a single JSON dictionary that I could use as my Atom package completion store. My API will allow...[<a href="/2015/06/27/apis-json-driven-api-dictionaries-for-use-in-atom-ide-autocomplete-packages/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am a big fan of API documentation when done using Slate. It creates very beautiful, and easy to use documentation, that makes learning about an API much more pleasant. You can find some pretty good examples of Slate being used in the wild, with the&nbsp;Travis CI API, Dwolla API, and API Science API.&nbsp;
Slate goes a long way in standardizing the documentation for APIs, but I would like to see this go further. I am working to profile both Dwolla and API Science as part of defining the stack of APIs that I depend on to operate the API Evangelist network, and while I enjoy the attractive UX Slate brings to the table, I'm lamenting the lack of a machine readable API definitions along the way.
I have a set of import scripts I use to scrape API documentation, and generate Swagger definitions, which I will be using to auto-generate a first draft Swagger file for any API I come across using Slate for the documentation, but I'd like to see a formal solution emerge. It would make sense to have a Slate generator from Swagger, for the API providers who would prefer the attractive looking Slate documentation, over the more functionality interactive Swagger UI.
We definitely need to make sure API documentation UX is as polished as possible, but we can't lose any of the momentum we've gained from machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. I have previously talked about moving forward the API documentation and UI conversation forward, and making sure Slate, and other attractive API documentation tooling, are interoperable with common API definition formats will be critical to keeping things moving forward.

			<p>This is one of several stories I am evolving as part of series I'm calling API fairy tales. With these tales I want to educate business leaders, technologists, and government about the importance of Application Programming Interfaces (API), and how they are being applied in almost every aspect of business occurring online today--providing simple examples that mainstream users can learn from, as well as retell in their circles. The Internet is slowly changing almost every aspect of our society, and a major part of this evolution is rooted in how we develop software, something that has been slowly building over the last 15 years, in the form of what is known an Application Programming Interfaces, or simply called APIs. This new breed of web APIs are providing access to data, content, and the other digital assets that are essential in building websites, mobile applications, and increasingly even physical devices. This modern web API movement is not some new software from a company like IBM, Microsoft, or Google, it is simply the next step in the World Wide Web, where you don&rsquo;t just surf the web, consuming HTML documents. In the API economy you navigate the Internet, creating, consuming, and interacting with not just HTML files, but any type of content, data, or digital resource that can be accessed via the web, desktop, and mobile applications that we increasingly depend on in our personal, and professional lives. APIs are being used by almost every type of company, across almost every industry, to deliver the web and mobile applications business and consumer users are demanding. Companies ranging from Amazon to AT&amp;T are putting APIs to work across business operations, and are something you increasingly see in governments as well, with APIs available for the city of San Francisco, New York, the White House, and across government of all shapes and sizes.

			<p><em>25 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>The concept of a form, is one one of those skeuomorphs, that have taken on an entirely new life on the Internet. The concept of a form is baked into HTML, PDFs, and many other commons aspects of our digital lives, while also still dominating many of the information exchanges in our physical worlds. There are a handful of APIs out there that let you build forms, and their are APIs that let you build forms for platforms like Drupal, but I have yet to see a platform that uses the concept of a form, as carrot to design, deploy, and manage your API--until now.&nbsp; I was introduced to Form.io at Gluecon this year, and was very please with the demo I was given (and my time playing with since). Form.io is a platform that enables developers to build web and mobile applications using a drag &amp; drop interface which allows you to create both the forms and the RESTful APIs all at once. I like this concept, because forms is something the average business user will potentially understand, and is something that has helped them also better understand web, PDF, and other digital platforms--whcih tells me it might do the same for the world of APIs. Form.io lets users craft their resources, from a forms point of view, allowing you to construct using common elements like email, password, address block, as well as being able to define the custom elements you will need. This is important because it is shifting API design to begin from the standpoint of how it will gathered or put to use, rather than just the system resource it came from like a database. This approach, in my opinion, has the potential to bring API design, closer to the people who are trying to solve everyday problems. Once you have crafted your forms, and the underlying resources, Form.io gives you the ability to publish an application front-end as an AngularJS...[<a href="/2015/06/25/looking-at-api-design-deployment-and-management-from-a-form-point-of-view/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am working to craft complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack, and what better place to start than with the APIs that I actually use on a daily basis. I am working hard to make sure all the APIs for my own master API stack are as complete as possible, but taking inventory of the public APIs that I depend on also makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; I've long kept a list of APIs that I use, for IT purposes, but I don't have a complete profile of all of these services. As with any vendo, I should have a complete profile of the APIs I depend on, with relevant support channels, documentation, code samples, monitors, and some of the other essentials I track on for other APIs in the space. This is all a work in progress, that is published as its own Github Pages hosted API Evangelist research project, but here are the 30+ APIs I have on my list: 3scale &nbsp; &nbsp; 3Scale Account Management &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3Scale Analytics &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3Scale Billing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3scale Service Management &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AlchemyAPI &nbsp; AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AlchemyAPI Keyword and Term Extraction &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon Web Services &nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon EC2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon Relational Database Service &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon Route 53 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon S3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList &nbsp; AngelList Startup API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; API Science &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; API Science &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit.ly &nbsp; &nbsp; bitly Data API Search &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...[<a href="/2015/06/23/the-over-30-apis-i-depend-on-to-run-api-evangelist/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As part of my monitoring of the API space, I keep track of new posts on CodeProject, and occasionally I come across an API integration project. Some of the times it references it as an API project, while most of the time it will just reference the platform being used, like a Magento Commerce project, or a Youtube project.
As I was reviewing a couple of interesting projects this week, I was thinking it would be nice to have a more modern, simpler version of CodeProject, but exclusively dedicated to APIs. The site could provide regular walk-through of API integration, aggregation, or reciprocity patterns. The site wouldn't have to do that many projects, just a couple a month would be fine to begin with, increasing the volume after things get going.&nbsp;
Another important feature would be the ability browse project by API provider, so you could find all the Twitter how-tos, or the Instagram how-to. The site would use Github to host each how-to, providing a simple, forkable way for API projects to submitting for inclusion by the community, while also empowering the audience to take each how-to-project with them.
I would totally love to do this idea, but I need another project like I need a hold in my head (any new ones). I would surely support anyone who setup a site like this, provide how-to, and help get the word out about it. ;-) I think you could easily monetize by getting paid to do how-to for specific APIs, and within specific business uses cases and industries.&nbsp;
Alighty, idea share, back to work.

			<p><em>23 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I wrote a story yesterday about APIMATIC releasing a new API validation API to compliment their existing API client code generation API. I received an email from the APIMATIC team is how I found out about the API, but as I'm processing that story, and thoughts around what I'd like to see for API Changelog (something Paul of @BlockSpring brought up), I'm lefting thinking about how antiquated our whole world of API discovery is. As soon as APIMATIC updated their API Blueprint file, all who use APIMATIC, and us API pundits (clowns) in the space should, should receive a push notification. This type of notification is exactly what API Changelog does, but it does it based upon a document diff, rather than finer grain, machine readable detail like what is available in a Swagger or API Blueprint definition. This is something I know they are working on changing, using APIs.json.&nbsp; Using APIs.json, companies like APIMATIC can publish a machine readable index of API operations in a "known location", aka the root of their domain--in this case, it would be at http://apimatic.io/apis.json. This index lists all of the APIs, and their supporting elements, in a machine readable way, that companies like API Changelog could parse, and provide notification to API consumers, and the pundits like me--providing us with fine grain notifications like, change to existing API, addition of new API, or changes to parameters, data model, etc. I know API Changelog is working on all of this, but I wanted to recount, to keep the topic fresh in my head, and also acknowledge that one of the problems in all of this, is the initial discovery. API Changelog is good at tracking on known or existing APIs, but how do you find new APIs? This is a very manual process, but when you can just introduce a list of URLs, and look for APIs.json--the API discovery game will improve significantly.&nbsp; When any service like API Changelog,...[<a href="/2015/06/23/image-if-everyone-automatically-knew-that-apimatic-had-added-a-new-endpoint/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I wrote about the Global Change Information System (GCIS) API earlier this year, and how they what they are doing with their API design represent how APIs are the next step in the evolution of the web. If you have the time, go look at what they have done, it is mind-blowing. I am on their email newsletter, and have had their latest update in my inbox for a few days, with some thoughts attached to it I wanted to blog about, before I archived the email. I love that they provide updates like this via email, but ultimately this story is about how they are iterating on their API design, making it much more useful, and powerful along the way&mdash;with some elements I&rsquo;d like to see spread across other content and document based APIs. Maybe I should backup, and clarify what GCIS does. The platform &ldquo;use identifiers and semantic information to provide points of reference and traceability&rdquo; across the research from 13 US federal agencies, that researchers, citizen scientists, application developers or information theorists can put to work for them. With their latest release, GCIS provide a very approach to the relationship between publications and its references, enabling some interesting ways of getting at the information contained within publications. First, with any publication you can append /reference to any publication in the API, and receive a list of any references for the publication. For me, where things start getting cool, is that you can then also apply the same to a specific chapter in the publication, or even down to a particular figure. This is something I&rsquo;m trying to establish in a coherent way in my own systems. I&rsquo;m looking to apply this line of thinking beyond just references, and also make it work for specific companies, tooling, and what I consider to be common building blocks for each area of the API space I track on.

			<p><em>22 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am partnering with the Restlet team to put on a Summer of APIs, a virtual API challenge. The goal with this summer program isn't to build apps on top of APIs, but build APIs that anyone can use, by crunching some valuable information resource, and make it easier to use in web and mobile, as well as potentially in embeddable tools, and even in spreadsheets--using APIs. I've gathered up some valuable sources of data, ranging from industry datasets from Data.gov in Washington DC to data sets that can help us with the water crisis out in California, which is included in detail about the program. I did a little homework for you, but dont' feel like you have to stop there, you can make any data, content, or other digital resource into an API during the Summer of APIs. With the summer of APIs we want bring awareness to the API design, deployment, and management tools that Restlet brings to the table, but we also want to increase the number of valuable APis out there, and potentially make a bigger impact. You'd be surprised how the right access to election data could shift an election, or the availability of health inspection data could save lives--so put some thought into the change you'd like to see. The Summer of APIs is not just for developers. Using Restlets API Spark platform, just about anyone can design, deploy, and manage APIs--without knowing how to program. All you need is a healthy curiosity about how to work with data, and make the time to learn the API Spark interface which walks you through everything you'll need to import the data, develop the APIs, and manage them. It doesn't hurt to have some coding expertise, but not a requirement. Head over to the Restlet Summer of Code website for all the details. If you need ideas for projects, feel free to tweet at me (@kinlane)--I have lots of ideas...[<a href="/2015/06/22/build-some-apis-with-restlet-and-api-evangelist-during-the-summer-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am working hard to establish a complete set of APIs for my own API stack which includes establishing complete Swagger definitions for the 25 APIs that I personally operate. These Swagger definitions are then used to generate Postman Collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors. I am also working hard to establish complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack, something I am partnering with APIMATIC on.&nbsp; As part of this work, both teams are working hard to evolve our tooling for working with, and validating API definitions. I mentioned a couple weeks back, when I shared client SDK research conducted by APIMATIC, that quality SDK generation is kind of the high water mark for measuring API definition completion--meaning if your API definition isn't complete enough to generate a functional SDK, you need to spend more time in your API design editor, until it is more complete. As I've been working to establish my own definition of what a complete Swagger definition is, APIMATIC has been hard at work doing the same, but applying to&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery. Also at the same time I'm building my questions API to help me automate the validation of Swagger definitions, APIMATIC has been working on their own validation API, which they just added to their existing API client code generation API. If you are generating machine readable API definitions in&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, or Google Discovery, then you should be validating your API designs using APIMATIC. Once you know your API definitions are solid, then you should also generate all your SDKs with APIMATIC too--I am only about 20% the way through doing this for my API Stack.&nbsp; Nice work APIMATIC team. I predict by the end of the year we will have a full stack of APIs, and tooling, that helps us through almost every step of the API definition driven, API lifecycle.&nbsp; P.S.

			<p><em>21 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I create a lot of machine readable API definitions for the 1000 companies I monitor as part of my API Stack. I am using Swagger to define all of my APIs, providing me with a simple, yet powerful way to profile each of the APIs I'm working to understand better. If you aren't familiar with Swagger, it provides a handful of fields you can use to fill out the metadata profile for APIs, like title, description, etc., but where it really gets powerful is when you put the paths collection to work, outline the details of each endpoint. Most of the APIs I come across that are defined using Swagger, focuses on providing details on each path, including verbs, headers, parameters, and sometimes response status codes. When looking for the benefits of Swagger, many stop here. With basic metadata, and details about the paths, you can launch interactive documentation using Swagger UI--which is how about 80% of folks are using the API specification format. When it comes to Swagger, my own motivations are all about API discovery, so when crafting Swagger files for the APIs I track on, I can easily call it quits after defining the basic meta information, and path details, but all of this ignores some of the exremely valuable aspect of using Swagger--with the definitions collection. Using the Swagger definitions collection you can quantify the underlying data model across API operations, providing a machine readable profile of the XML and JSON that will be part of each API request and response. Once you have the underlying data model defined, including each parameter, description, and type, you can then link to each path and / or parameter, where the data model is being put to use as part of the request or response.&nbsp; Swagger definition collections are not a requirement for Swagger UI, or for API discovery currently, but if you want to generate high quality server side code, or client SDKs,...[<a href="/2015/06/21/the-swagger-definitions-collection-is-the-cherry-on-top-of-each-api-that-i-profile/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>Making sure the Swagger files I craft possess a complete definition for its underlying data model, one that is linked to each API path, and parameters where it is put to use, is important to me, but damn it is a lot of work. As I mentioned in my last piece I'm looking at the Twitter Swagger file, and my head starts spinning thinking about how much work it will be to hand-define all of the data models that used across the almost 100 Twitter endpoints. I quickly got to work finding a better solution--I landed on Charles Proxy. I had downloaded and installed Charles Proxy to better understand how we could map out the dark layer of the API universe, that the popular mobile applications we use depend on. When running, Charles proxies all the requests and responses my desktop apps, and browsers make on my local Macbook. I can also route my iPhone and iPad through the proxy, when I want to also record my mobile app usage. This is perfect for helping me map out the public APIs in my API Stack work! When the Charles Proxy is running, it saves an XML summary export to my local Dropbox folder, which then gets synced to the cloud via the Dropbox API. I am now working on a script that will keep an eye on my Dropbox folder, and process any new Charles export files it finds. As I process each file, I'm cherry picking from the domains of specific companies that I'm tracking on, pulling out the request and response information I need to craft a Swagger definition.&nbsp; To generate the traffic I need, I just load up any API I'm looking to profile in Postman, and started working my way through the list of endpoints, until I've covered the entire surface area of any API.

			<p><em>21 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am playing around with making several stops along the API life cycle more accessible, and machine readable using APIs.json. To help me in my work, I am using&nbsp;my own API stack&nbsp;as a proving ground, resulting in the&nbsp;addition of Postman Collections,&nbsp;APIMATIC SDKs, and&nbsp;API Science monitors over the last couple weeks. As I'm working through the 25 APIs I have, and almost 350 endpoints, making sure the Swagger definitions are complete,&nbsp;the latest evolution of my API management service composition is applied, APIMATIC SDKs up to date, and API Science monitors are setup, I stumbled across another critical stop along the life cycle--the IDE. I use Codenvy for my IDE. It allows me to easily manage my numerous APIs, and applications that depend on my APIs, in a single cloud based development environment. The definitions for my API stack, both front and back-end lives on Github, but I use Codenvy work spaces to manage each repo, the runners to design, develop, and test out my APIs, and apps, at various stops along the life cycle. As I was doing my work, I saw how non-linear the life cycle ultimately could be, and how the IDE is a window for several stops I am concerned with along it. While I am using Codenvy to design, develop, and deploy my own APIs, I am also using to evolve my own educational API integration projects. As part of this work,&nbsp;I am currently developing what I consider an API 101 stack of APIs, a common set of APIs, anyone who is just getting started with API integration would want to learn about--I am starting with the classics: Twitter Twilio Sendgrid&nbsp; I would consider these APIs to be messaging 101, and a good place to start for anyone looking to learn about APIs.

			<p><em>19 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am helping a client work through their monetization strategy for an API deployment service. To help me give me a starting point for the work, I wanted to take a look at a handful of existing service providers, that may not be a perfect match, but somewhat in the same realm--API deployment.&nbsp; For this phase of the work, I looked at six&nbsp;API deployment providers, who in my opinion have a pretty straightforward, modern approach to crafting, publishing, and sharing their pricing. It always amazes me how hard it can be to just find a companies pricing, let alone make sense of it...but I digress, that is another story. Here are the API deployment providers I reviewed: API Spark, with 5 pricing tiers, broken down by concurrent connection (based upon IP address), number of APIs, the entity and file storage across APIs. APItite, width 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs, API calls, data transfers, data storage (by row), whether the API is public / unlisted / private, and support InstantAPI, with 1 pricing tier, with incremental add-ons to get more API call volume, broken down just by the number of API calls, with an option to pay for custom domain. Sheetlabs, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by storage, number of queries, spreadsheets, APIs, and users. Orchestrate, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs calls and applications, with options for Service Level Agreement (SLA) and support as well. Algorithmia, with 2 pricing tiers, broken down by an equal ratio of credits to API calls. You get 10K credits for free, and can purchase more at 10K per $1.00. I think these six provide a good test sample to kick of my research. Most of the other API deployment providers didn't have a straightforward pricing model, were open source, or just didn't seem like a good fit. &nbsp;As I looked through these companies approaches to monetization, I see two of...[<a href="/2015/06/19/initial-thoughts-around-monetization-for-an-api-deployment-service/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I use Gumroad for publishing of my white papers, and I also keep an eye on what they are up to as part of my API monitoring--they have a pretty useful publishing API. During my weekly API.Report this last week I came across their&nbsp;Gumroad Small Product Lab, a cool idea that I'd like to see happen in more API ecosystems, or maybe even across them.&nbsp; According to Gumroad the the Small Product Lab is a "mini course, community, launchpad, and contest to remove the unknowns and barriers to getting your work out in the world"--Ten days, ten actionable lessons: Day 1: Mark your calendars Day 2: What&rsquo;s your product? Day 3: Plan it Day 4: Create a style guide Day 5: Ready, set, go! Day 6: Share your process and progress Day 7: Decoding the pricing puzzle Day 8: Package it up Day 9: Prep for launch Day 10: The launch and onward Gumroad is focusing on their customer base (media publishing), but the format is something I'd love to see occur in API ecosystems, helping developers and API consumers put API resources to work for them. It seems like something API providers could do quarterly, monthly, or some other relevant schedule, that would really help API consumers be more successful.&nbsp; The idea of a Small Product Lab, also seems like something that be done across APIs, help API consumers put multiple APIs to work, in the name of a single objective. This kind of approach seems in line with a lot of the micro service, and micro app discussions I am seeing going on across the landscape--when you learn to tackle projects / products in smaller chunks, the chances for success go up (failure hurts less too). Lots of good lessons to be learned along the way! Anyways, just shedding light on what is going on in the space, and putting the seeds for other ideas out there.

			<p><em>16 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've long advocated that an API Status page&nbsp;should be&nbsp;a required building block for any API operation. As I work on monitoring for my own master API stack, and as I read stories like&nbsp;Pingometer Keeps Your Uptime In The 9&rsquo;s With Twilio SMS, I'm thinking we need more that just a simple status report for our APIs. From an API provider standpoint, we should have a more nuanced view of our API availability, beyond just up or down--something popular API integration service providers like Runscope and API Science have been saying for a while. If our APIs are publicly available, I'm going to even suggest providers start actively sharing their API monitoring strategy, and resulting data with the ecosystem--something I'm going to also be advocating for inclusion in the APIs.json index. From an API consumer standpoint, you are going to want a real-time awareness about the availability of all the APIs you depend on, and much like the provider standpoint, this view needs to be more nuanced than just whether a service is up or down. Developers need to be making tactical, run-time decisions based upon API monitoring, as well as be able to make longer term strategic decisions about which APIs they depend on, based upon API monitoring exhaust.&nbsp; I like Twilio's style for showcasing Pingometer as a solution. I'm thinking every API provider should cozy up with an API monitoring service provider for their own needs, while also establishing an approach they can also share with their API consumers, to meet their needs as well. I'm currently adding API Science and Runscope as default building blocks for my API Stack, something you will find indexed as part of each of my services APIs.json file.

			<p><em>16 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am partnering with APIMATIC to help establish a common set of complete, and validated API definitions for the almost 1000 APIs I track on as part of my API Stack. I am using my Questions API to identify what work is needed to be done, by asking basic questions about companies, via their APIs.json definition, resulting in quick tasks I can accomplish that help us achieve our goals. A portion of this work, involves making sure that the APIs in my stack are also linked to their SDKs.io profile. If an API in my stack doesn't have an SDKs.io icon, I know that I either need to search and find it in SDKs.io, or I need to publish a copy of the Swagger definitions I have to APIMATIC, and publish it to SDKs.io--then record the default SDKs.io page in my system, and republish. #hakunamatata Right now you will only find a handful of SDKs.io on the main listing(AngelList, Google, Eventbrite). I am just declaring that I will be doing this as part of the process moving forward. So keep an eye out for the SDKs.io icon, because it means that SDKs.io is in sync with the API Stack (or shortly will be). For all of my own internal APIs I will be actually generating SDKs using APIMATIC--for the APIs I profile as part of my API Stack work, I'll just make sure things are in sync with SDKs.io. Another problem you'll notice in this work, is the company vs. API aspect--meaning that some companies have the SDKs.io icon as one of its resource links, while some have it on the API itself. Look at AngelList and Google to see what I mean. This reflects the micro aspect to API definitions I've talked about before. It is common to look at a single API for each company, but through this work, I am trying to distill it down to the smallest possible unit of valuable...[<a href="/2015/06/16/add-sdks-io-url-for-companies-and-apis-that-i-track-on-via-the-api-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have been working hard to establish some sort of minimum viable definition for a complete Swagger definition is, and I think I finally have got to a point where I have it--at least enough to work through the next 100 or so APIs I'm targeting for completion.&nbsp; I originally identified almost 30 separate questions specifically targeting Swagger, but for my minimum viable definition I've isolated it to just 19. I automated asking of these questions, using my Questions API, and to test things out I applied it to my API API: API&nbsp;(APIs.json) Is there a Swagger definition? yes Is there a Swagger API title? yes Is there a Swagger API description? yes Is there a Swagger API host? yes Is there a Swagger API base path? yes How many Swagger API paths are there? 24 Do all Swagger API paths have tags? yes Do all Swagger API paths have summary? yes Do all Swagger API paths have description? yes Do all Swagger API paths have operation id? yes Do all Swagger API paths have parameters? yes Do all Swagger API paths have responses? yes Do all Swagger API response have references to definitions? yes Does Swagger APIs have security definitions? yes Do all Swagger API paths have security references? yes Is there Swagger API definitions? yes Do all Swagger API definitions have properties? yes Do all Swagger API definition properties have a description? yes Do all Swagger API definition properties have a type? yes &nbsp; In theory, I can run this on any APIs.json file, and it will return answers for any API that has a valid Swagger file present. My goal is to provide me with a quick action todo list for any API in my API Stack.

			<p><em>14 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have been talking about virtualized API stacks for a while now, slowly evolving my own view of whats next for the world of APIs, based upon what I'm seeing happen across the sector. I am working hard to convert my own master stack of APIs, in 25+ separate container driven APIs, which I can then orchestrate into other collections for my own use, as well as the needs of my partners, and wholesale API clients.&nbsp; The post&nbsp;Running DreamFactory as a Docker Containers came across my monitors this weekend, which for me is a sign we are getting closer to a version of the API economy that I think will actually scale. The days where you launch one API platform, with one or many APIs, and you only sell that service via a single platform domain, have peaked. The technology, business, and politics of your API operations will have to be flexible enough to be deployed anywhere, by any partner you wish to give access, in a way that maximizes the same innovation we've seen popularize the API movement. As John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) of Runscope says: Containers will do for APIs, what API have done for businesses over the last 15 years. In 2015 all your APIs need to be modular, and containerized using common approaches like Docker, alowing your API infrastructure to be deploy-able anywhere, anytime. Hopefully by now you have your API management and service composition house in order, and the business of your APIs can also scale to meet this new, containerized landscape. If you are worried about discovery in all of this, you better start talking to me about APIs.json, and making sure you use a common API definition formats like Swagger or API Blueprint&nbsp;across all of your APIs. Just like the early API providers like SalesForce, Amazon, and Twilio were able to out-innovate, and out-maneuver their business competitors using APIs in the last decade, companies who can containerize the approach...[<a href="/2015/06/14/dreamfactory-deploying-apis-in-docker-containers-is-how-the-api-economy-will-scale/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I work to chase an elusive answer to the question, what is a complete API Swagger definition, I'm also faced with what I know John Musser (@johnmusser)&nbsp;would agree is the age old question, what exactly constitutes an API? Is it the Twitter API, or is it the Twitter account, status, friends, media, etc. APIs? While this has been a tough question, facing anyone who considers API discovery, I think it is a question that is evolving as part of the current microservices conversation.&nbsp; One layer of the microservices onion is focused on breaking down services into their smallest possible unit of value (at least this is one of my takeaways). Doing this is an enabler all the other orchestration, devops, voodoo magic that represent the other architectural layers of the microservices onion. As I work to define Swagger definitions for the almost 1000+ companies in my API Stack, I'm working to employ this line of thought, and actively breaking down each API I profile, into the smallest unit possible, using Swagger. An example of this in the wild, is with the messaging API from TigerText, which could easily be a single API Swagger definition called TigerConnect API, but after breaking things down I'm left with six separate Swagger files: TigerConnect Events API TigerConnect Group API TIgerConnect Message API TigerConnect Metadata API TigerConnect Roster API TigerConnect User API Ultimately this is more work for me, but from an API discovery perspective, I'm looking to identify the small, most unique unit of value possible, which allows me to discovery, and organize APIs into extremely precise, yet powerful API menus. Right now this is a very manual process, but I'm developing tooling that will help me to "explode" existing Swagger definitions based upon unique API paths--we will see how that goes. Now I can evaluate TigerText's approach to user APIs, or metadata APIs, without wading through the actual messaging side of the coin.

			<p>I am working through each of my 25 APIs right now, tackling a list of changes that include some adjustment for an&nbsp;evolution in my service composition, generating Postman collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors--for each API. I was talking through the process of setting up my API monitors, and how I will be generating status pages for each API portal,&nbsp;with John Musser (@johnmusser), and he reminded me of the&nbsp;HTTP Archive (HAR) format.&nbsp; HAR is all about providing an archival format for HTTP transactions that can be used by a web browser to export detailed performance data about web pages it loads, which got me thinking about how we can use the existing format to record and quantify the exhaust from our increasing API activity. There are some areas of the HAR specification that wouldn't apply to this, but for the most part, it provides an existing format for collecting, evaluating, and potentially understanding the value we generate (or not) via our APIs in real-time. As I work through each of the stops along my API lifecycles (Postman Collections, SDKs, monitors, etc), I'm working to make sure the input and output from the stop is indexed as part of the APIs.json collection. In short, you will be able to find the Postman Collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors via the APIs.json index for each of my 25 APIs. Right now APIMATIC SDKs and API Science monitors just link to HTML pages for getting at details, but eventually I am looking to make this detail machine readable as well--this is why John and I started discussing HAR. To help me wrap my head around possiblities, I wanted to elevate myself and look at the the role HAR could play in the index of my APIs, and potentially the wider industries that I am building APIs.json collections for.

			<p>As I work to create Swagger API definitions for the almost 1000 companies in my API stack, I'm chasing an elusive definition of a complete Swagger definition for any API. Only a small portion of APIs I am defining using Swagger will reach an 80-90% completions status, in reality most will never be complete for reasons that are totally out of my control. When it comes to crafting API definitions for public APIs, I may be able to get the API definition complete in the sense that it has all the paths, parameters, responses, definitions, and security configurations, but if the API itself is missing pieces--the API definition will always be incomplete (in perpetuity). As I work to automate the questions I ask of Swagger definitions, helping me get to a more coherent definition of what is a complete Swagger definition, I can't help feel the need to offer API design tips to the API providers I am profiling. Honestly I have never considered myself a high quality API designer, I've been more business than tech, but I can't help pointing out the obvious stuff.&nbsp; I am still using my API definition tooling for my own goals around defining the API Stack, but because I'm building it all as APIs, I intend to open it up to others for analyzing their own API definitions, determining how complete they are, and potentially offering up tips on what could be done to improve them. A kind of self-service, API design tip API, that helps with some of the most common elements that are missing from API designs. In 2015, API definitions are opening up a buffet of services that are courting API providers ranging from mocking and deployment, to monitoring and security. I don't see why API definitions couldn't also allow for professional API designers to help API providers evolve their APIs in a more constructive ways, from the outside-in.

			<p>
When I started API Evangelist, I knew I didn't want to use WordPress or other common CMS, so I developed my own API, and page and blogging CMS. During the latest migration of my internal API infrastructure, I'm rebuilding everything as a single stack of APIs that I &nbsp;can use to operate API Evangelist. Part of this process is breaking down legacy systems, into the small possible unit of value, something I consider deeply as I rebuild each API.
It started with my link system, which I broke up into link, curation, keyword, and linkrot APIs. Now I'm eyeballing my legacy blog API, which historically I also use to publish news pieces to API.Report, and sections that I syndicate to white papers I have published. My goal with my blogging API is to get it down to its simplest possible functionality--publishing posts to my blogs.
With this in mind I forked my newer blog API, and labeled it my news API. Right now, my news API behaves very similar to my blog, but it already has new features like automated pulling of press releases, extraction of proper nouns, and a few other bells and whistles that make my news management workflow as painless as possible. Over time I may share some of the features with the blogging API, I think my news and analysis worlds will remain separate beasts, from here forward.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was recently reading about&nbsp;Google moving its corporate applications to the Internet, and as my brain works, began applying this ine of thinking to the world APIs. I am big advocate for companies being more transparent, and acknowledging that more and more of our ever day business occurs on the open Internet, and we should start treating it like we are. I think one statement in the Google paper says it well: The new model &mdash; called the BeyondCorp initiative &mdash; assumes that the internal network is as dangerous as the Internet.&nbsp; As the Internet penetrates more of our personal and business lives, the concept of a private, localized, and secure network, is fading. Even if a system is only accessible via a local area network, if any node on that network has Internet access, and delivers resources to web, mobile, and increasingly devices via DNS--it is operating on the open Internet. I am not saying that we need to put all our private information out on the open Internet, but I know too many organizations who feel pretty confident in their security through obscurity strategies, and that if things are kept hidden, and lightly secured, you are fine. Inversely they also claim that if you push directories of infrastructure out on the web, that you are just giving a map to the bad guys. This all just feels way out of balance to me. Ultimately I feel like an API first approach for all digital resources is the way to go. Acknowledging that all of these resources will use the open Internet as a transport, and require all systems, web applications, mobile applications, and devices to use the same API--proving a single surface area that a company can secure. With it being publicly available, but secured properly using a sound identity and access management approach, companies can easily bring in external service providers to audit and help secure.

			<p>I have had Cloud Elements under my API aggregation research for some time now, keeping an eye on what they are up to via their blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. Cloud Elements takes a handful of top API driven platforms, which they organize into their Elements Catalog, aggregating them into a single API driven platform. API aggregation is something I've been a big supporter of, and API reciprocity as with companies like Zapier, is something I feel compliments how we operate on the open Internet. Today, Cloud Elements made an interesting move forward with the ability to map new elements, via an API, which in my book moves them more into API reciprocity space, than it does aggregation--meaning you could in theory launch a specialized Zapier, using Cloud Elements.&nbsp; One additional thing that Cloud Elements does that I think is significant, is they aggregate API driven platforms (elements) into meaningful buckets like documents, messaging, CRM, social, and finance. Things that actually mean something to end users. With the Element Mapper, you now map to any API driven resource you need, all via the API, to solve precise business solutions, for specific business groups. Zapier has an API, but it focuses on the creation of new channels, and opening the potential for recipe development. What I like about Cloud Elements is they bring in the organizational aspect of it all as well, helping you establish some order. Establishing a stack of the APIs you depend on for your business, while organizing them in a meaningful and coherent way--all via an API. #Wining It makes me happy to see a provider like Cloud Elements doing what they do.

I wanted to create a simple walkthrough for my readers, but my primary goal was to break down the moving parts of a Swagger file, and try to quantity what elements I would need before I could call a Swagger definition "complete".

As part of this last round of work, I'm fine tuning my service composition strategy a little more. If you aren't familiar with API service composition, it is just about creating different levels of access to your APIs, and using my 3Scale API infrastructure I can easily break this down. The most common approach to API service composition you see out there is public and private, with maybe an additional partner tier. I'm taking a slightly different approach to defining my layers, and so far, her is what I have: Open - The completely open layer to my APIs that doesn't require any keys at all, like my website, but JSON. Retail - The retail storefront to my API operations that anyone can sign up for, and begin consuming my resources. Trusted - Same access to resources as my retail layer, but given higher rates of access to be able to make more calls. Wholesale - APIs from my stack, but running in someone elses infrastructure, alongside their own APIs. Partner - Access to almost all of my APIs, giving higher levels of responsibility for my partners in crime. Platform - The highest level access, giving my systems and applications the ability to get the resources they need. Personal - A private access level, giving me a layer across all my systems that is only for me to access. Almost all of my API consumers will begin as a retail user, and either stay there, or evolve into one of the other tiers. In the end I can custom tailor access to any of my users, and their applications, but I prefer establish specific layers for users to exist in--giving me clear security groups, that are also in alignment with my business goals.

			<p>As I go through the research from APIMATIC regarding automatically generating client code using Swagger, and I prepare to crank out Swagger definitions for almost 1000 companies in the API Stack, one big question I face is, what exactly is a complete Swagger definition? An incomplete Swagger definition does you little good. I've gotten away with just mapping out some API endpoints, verbs, and parameters, to add another dimension to my API monitoring, but without authentication details, status codes, and the underlying data model, you can't do much else that is meaningful with them--as the APIMATIC research demonstrates. We need to start refining not just a definition about what is complete, but tooling and services that can help us get to complete as fast as we can, and automate the certification of any API, using Swagger. I extracted version definition of what is a complete Swagger definition from APIMATIC's research that I recently wrote about: Valid JSON Correct BaseURIs Authentication Information Endpoints Verbs Parameters Schemas Satus Codes Data Models I would add that the basic elements of a Swagger specification, while maybe not critical to generating SDKs, are important to discovery, and other aspects of API operations.&nbsp; Name Description Tags Next I would say there is always the human element: API Designer Review - Sign-off from an API designer who compared the API definition to the actual API, while also rounding off any missing elements, and just giving the API design the love it needs. API Provider Review - Sign-off from the actual API provider. This will not be possible for all APIs, but having this is definitely a major score for the overall completion score. Then I guess we also need some sort of code level validation an API is complete. I guess this can be done manually during the human API design review, but ideally it would be something a little automated, and potentially generating some output from an API monitoring service provider...[<a href="/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">Read More</a>]</p>

If you aren't familiar with APIMATIC, they are a API code as a service provider, that generates high quality client code in several languages, if your APIs are defined using common API definition formats like Swagger (they are also the people behind SDKs.io).&nbsp;APIMATIC is as passionate about high quality Swagger definitions as I am, and have shared some really valuable research to help push forward the API definition conversation. In May, APIMATIC wanted to compare the quality of automatic code generation tools, using common Swagger specifications they found on Github. To set the bar for their research, APIMATIC established some basic operational parameters: Code generator must support Swagger file format Only client-side bindings are considered Must create complete libraries rather than just code snippets Only the following languages are considered: C#, Java / Android, Objective-C, PHP, Python Ruby While this research focuses on Swagger, I think the findings can be applied when thinking about other API definition formats like API Blueprint or RAML, but kicking things off with a focus on Swagger is wise. With a basic framework defined, APIMATIC picked four of the leading code generation tools out there currently: Swagger CodeGen REST United Restlet Studio APIMATIC As part of the decision to look at Swagger CodeGen, REST United, Restlet Studio, and their own APIMATIC solution, they provide a little detail on the code generation engines behind each solution: Swagger.io is the official host for open source Swagger CodeGen project REST United uses a customized version of Swagger CodeGen project and performs better than the official branch Restlet Studio uses Swagger CodeGen for Objective-C, but has its own CodeGen engine for Android and Java APIMATIC has its own CodeGen engine for all languages They took a sampling of Swagger specifications out of the thousands they found, and did a side by side comparison...[<a href="/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I recently added a new tool to my hacker storytelling toolbox, that allows me to easily assemble walk through, that help me guide my readers through a scripted series of steps around any of my research areas. I first did it to walk through what I'd consider to be my minimum viable developer portal, and now I decided to apply to my Swagger research.
I am working on a set of APIs that help me quantify whether a Swagger definition is "complete" or not, to help me tackle my goals around my API Stack research, and establish a rich set of complete, open API definitions that the community can put to use. What better way to quantify all the moving parts of Swagger, than to actually create a 101 walk through of its moving parts.&nbsp;
I added the Swagger walk through to my Swagger research, and will keep refining, and adding more information to it. I've managed to further evolve my definition of what constitutes a complete Swagger definition, allowing me to work towards a somewhat automated, API driven service that will help me understand how complete each Swagger definition in my API stack is, and where the work is that needs to be done.&nbsp;
The goal here is to get all the APIs for 900+ companies in my API Stack fully defined using APIs.json and Swagger, while also establishing a pretty robust set of tools and services for certifying Swagger definitions. If you want to get involved, there is a lot of work to be done, just visit the API Stack, and get involved via the Github repo.

			<p>3Scale and I have been working hard to craft APIs.json files for the top public APIs out there, including machine readable Swagger definitions, ever since we launched the open source API search engine APIs.io. We will keep working to define, and index the API space, but it is a lot of work ahead, and we could use some help. Over the last couple months I've had several conversations with folks about the need for Swagger and API Blueprints for popular APIs, so that the community can build valuable tooling and services on top of commonly used APIs. Two companies who I've been talking to are&nbsp;SDK generation service APIMATIC, and API spreadsheet integration provider BlockSpring. APIMATC wants see better quality Swagger definitions emerge, so they can build client SDKs that work, and make available via SKDs.io. BlockSpring wants to be able to integrate popular API content, data, and functionality into Google Spreadsheets, using their slick plugin. These are just two examples of services that are emerging to deliver much needed functionality on top of APIs -- if we can establish a rich, open, machine readable repository of API definitions, it will open up the flood gates for even more API tooling and services. #win I've added some new information to the API Stack to support this effort. So far I have&nbsp;917 companies, in 223 areas, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions. I want all 917 companies to have all their APIs fully defined using APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprint by the end of the summer, as well as any important companies that are not listed. It is a lofty goal, but I think with some help, we can do it. As a working group, we have several challenges, that we are hoping to work out in real-time via the API Stack Github repository. First we have to actually do the heavy lifting of generating APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprints, but we also have to...[<a href="/2015/06/05/join-apimatic-blockspring-and-apievangelist-in-completing-api-definitions-for-1000-companies-in-the-api-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>Darrel Miller(@darrel_miller) reminded me of the desktop development platform Electron the other day, with his story on Moving Beyond the Browser with JavaScript and Hypermedia. I had been eyeballing Electron as a potential candidate for my perfect API design editor, something I honestly don't have the bandwidth to build, but is something I enjoy pushing forward in thought. If you aren't familiar with Electron, it is what powers popular desktop version of the apps that I use most--Github, and Slack. The open source desktop framework, developed and maintained Github, allows you to deliver simple, easy to maintain desktop experiences, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--powered by Chromium and Node.js. Electron is appealing to me because it allows me to use the tech that I am most fluent in, to deliver high quality desktop apps, but also as Darrel mentions in his story, it has the potential to improve on the quality of JavaScript apps we build--giving us C grade JavaScript people a framework to live within. ;-) I have a pretty clear vision in my head of the API design editor that I would like to see developed. I doubt this will be something I will have the time to develop personally, but I would like to encourage others to develop API design editors using Electron, and encourage a focus on it being extensible, allowing 3rd party, API driven API design features to be added--keeping the editor simple, with almost every feature living as an extension. I think the API workflow and life-cycle will be different for each API provider, and we need to be able to have the features that we need most, right at our fingertips. Through my profiling of 917 companies, in 223 business sectors, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions so far, I intend to provide API design tips and dictionary functionality based upon popular / successful API designs.&nbsp; Anyways, back the actual work at hand.

			<p><em>04 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>Helping people understand the potential you see around a particular approach to API design, is hard stuff. Providing easy to follow stories, and implementations that the average person can follow is something I've dedicated myself to at API Evangelist, and something I'll keep working on when it comes to evolving API approaches like hypermedia.&nbsp; Hypermedia has long suffered from an image problem, something I feel can be remedied through a little hacker storytelling on the part of hypermedia API media type owners, API providers who bake hypermedia into their practices, and the developers who are crafting meaningful hypermedia driven experiences. In 2015 I feel like we are getting closer to fixing this, but as I said, this stuff is hard, and takes a lot of work. Until there are easy to follow stories, and examples of hypermedia in practice, only us in the know are going to care. I see a lot of potential ideas for hypermedia hacker storytelling in my head, but getting these out into stories, and into practice takes a lot of work, and massaging of ideas. One idea that was just moved forward for me, was derived from a post Audrey sent to me today,&nbsp;a story from Eater, called One Night Kachka. This approach to storytelling, provides me with a potential blueprint for evolving how I can tell stories using hypermedia APIs, and Single Page Apps (SPA). The Kachka story is full of rich structured data and content, providing a compelling timeline breakdown of a nights activity at a restaurant. There are so many interesting objects here that could be defined and woven together with a hypermedia core--then simply presented via a hypermedia client (aka Single Page App).&nbsp; Additionally you could generate an administrative SPA, allowing a user to be walked through the process of telling a story, adding the timeline elements, people, pictures, videos, and data around sales and activity--then point user towards the SPA client that allows them to...[<a href="/2015/06/04/storytelling-and-the-future-of-hypermedia-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>I wrote about a simpler example of API to SPA the other day, continuing my journey for apps, services, and tooling that easily deploys a Single Page App (SPA) or light-weight web and mobile clients from a single API, or many APIs. One of the reason I am so transparent about my ideas, is because I depend on my audience to help educate me about what is out there--one of my readers, who is always schooling me, pointed me at&nbsp;Project ReaCall.&nbsp; Jean-Jacques Dubray's (@metapgmr), Project ReaCall combines React.js and Swagger to make it easier for API providers to develop and evolve API Client SDKs (ACS). This is definitely the direction I'd like to see client SDK and SPA deployment space go. I will have to play with ReaCall more, and I do not have any experience with React.js apps, but it looks pretty easy to bind your API endpoints to specific components in a React.js generated app. Where this will get even more powerful, is when there are ready to go templates, and starter kits for developer to reverse engineer, and better understand how it works. I see that&nbsp;VIMOC Technologies' Landscape-Computing Architecture, and ambient computing API for city infrastructure employes ReaCall for their client deployment. Some more examples, demonstrating common API uses, and real-world client deployments would go a long way in on-boarding people with the approach. The API Evangelist network operates as almost 100 separate Jekyll driven sites / apps (some have more functionality than others), that run on Github Pages. I can easily envision other operators managing hundreds or thousands of sites, sub-sites, web, mobile, and devices based applications that are generated, maintained, and version-ed using the Project ReaCall approach. I'd also like to play around with defining web, mobile, or device application stacks using APIs.json, bringing together many disparate APIs into a single collection, and use ReaCall to deploy the application--essentially using APIs.json as the index for where each of the Swagger...[<a href="/2015/05/29/generating-single-page-apps-in-react-js-from-your-swagger-defined-api-with-reacall/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>My first emotion after reading the brief filed by the US Solicitor General, is that the federal government's stance is so wrong, antiquated, and shows how behind the curve our government actually is when it comes to the unfolding API economy around us. Then as with each moment in the past, associated with this very important legal case, I become tangled in the web that is politics and intellectual property (IP) law in our country--leaving me confused, betrayed, and embarrassed for the industry that I take pride in being a champion for. It is easy to get caught up in the page view buzz, emotion, and hype of each of these episodes, but in the end I will just keep fighting for open API patterns, and Oracle's damaging stance, and the fact the federal government is a revolving door for industry, really is just par for the course--business as usual. This is not the first time, nor will it be the last time, that someone who does not understand APIs will be making laws that regulate how things work in industry. What is really frustrating is that this isn't just a single court case, it sets a very dangerous precedent that will impact every business sectors. Think of the role the web plays in our lives in 2015, and how important companies like SalesForce, eBay, Paypal, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Facebook have been to the economy--you just dealt a potentially lethal blow to the next wave of these companies even existing, good job US government. The Solicitor General has no idea of the separation in the API layers, but most of the API industry doesn't see it as well, so why would I be surprised that the government isn't up to speed.

At their worst, terms of service sound like an invitation to live in a police state. At their best, a terms of service document can reflect the personality of its brand (and Slack certainly has personality!). Until today, my favorite notable example has been Aviary&#39;s, who innovated around humanizing abstruse legalese into something much more friendly readable. 
The best APIs, like any good products, express the joy of the people who build them — bravo to Slack for breaking out of the mundane and making their ToS take a stand.

			<p><em>27 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>I enjoy playing with simple, meaningful ways of leaning about APIs. The other day, during the regular monitoring of the API space, I came across a simple dice rolling API, which I decide to map out using Swagger. Shortly after I did &nbsp;this, I saw Mike Amundsen post an ALPS representation of the Dice Rolling API. Around the same time, I then imported my Swagger into my Postman client, and exported a Postman collection. Once I had the three formats, I sat back to consider what each of these representations mean to me: Swagger - A map of the surface area that is dice rolling. Postman - A single representation of actions that can be taken--now. ALPs - A representations of the what it means to roll the dice. I am constantly working to evolve how I view the available API formats that are emerging throughout the space. I will be spending more time generating machine readable definitions for APIs in my stack, trying to push these definitions through these valuable filters. I do not think any single approach provides me with a definitive view of the resources I am describing, but at least give me with various lenses to look through, during my journey. Swagger left me feel like I am mapping out a vast expanse, but alone doesn't do much for me without more tooling to interpret the map. Postman left me feeling like I could do one thing, linked to the surface area I mapped with my Swagger, but was very confined to just that specific instance, within the world I have drawn with Swagger. ALPS left me feeling like I described something meaningful, closer to the actual experience of rolling a dice.&nbsp; Ultimately I do not see any of the emerging approaches to defining API driven resources as 100% the solution, or in black and white terms as wrong or right. I see Swagger as very much a bridge to a...[<a href="/2015/05/27/rolling-the-dice-swagger-postman-and-alps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>One of my areas of research that got boost of energy at Gluecon last week, was the area of Single Page Applications, aka SPAs. SPAs are one huge area of potential growth for the API space, but like many other areas, they haven't seen the wider, more meaningful deployments, or adoption, that I had hoped for early on. I think up until now the definition of what an SPA is has been heavily dominated by the technical side of things, as opposed to the delivery side--SPA are still mostly about providing solutions for developers, over solutions for the end-user or business owner. When it comes to SPAs, I stay away from the more established frameworks, opting for a simpler design--minimal platform or framework adoption. Not that solutions like Angular and Backbone don't do amazing things, just at this point in my career, I'm looking to avoid the adoption, and resulting dogma and dependency that can often come from drinking a specific frameworks kool-aid. I guess the overall footprint needs to be small, before I will allow something to creep my day to day operational world. While at Gluecon, I was given a demo of a new product, which i won't go into detail about now, but I feel moves us closer to the vision than I have in my head. Many of the existing SPAs employ APIs, but I envision a world where you can design, deploy, and manage APIs, which alongside you can also deploy and manage simple, useful SPAs driven by your valuable API resources. I keep an eye on the SPA space, so I can be in tune with anything that emerges--hopefully my stories and research will also stimulate other solutions in the space as well. To help you understand the potential for APIs in the SPA space, I am talking about deploying a simple, and I mean as simple as you can SPA deployment, using an API that is defined using...[<a href="/2015/05/27/a-cleaner-simpler-example-of-api-to-spa/">Read More</a>]</p>

My goal is to not flame the haters, but educate everyone involved, both the people looking to learn about microservices, and those who are practicing microservices, so I'm hoping you will forgive me--my goal is not page views. I'm sticking to my goal of not making microservices a regular thing I talk about, but I wanted to share some observations after listening to folks talk at Gluecon last week--a week that was full of microservices love (and hate). In the past, I mentioned that I received a handful of emails, and DMS from folks letting me know I'm not doing microservices, and after Gluecon I think I have a beginning list of why I think people generally are telling me I'm doing it wrong. Tooling - People tend to identify with the tooling they use, and deeply associate the function with the tool. So if I don't use Puppet or Chef, I'm not orchestrating. If your not using Jenkins, your not doing continous delivery, and so on. This is dangerous for microservices storytelling, but also is something that will continue. Vendor - This is probably the most egregious reason I see people telling others they are doing microservices wrong, and is somewhat akin to the tooling item, but is really just rooted in selling you something. You will never do it right, unless you are their customer, so don't worry about it. Scope - You just aren't doing it at the scope someone else is doing it. Microservices is something large enterprises do, not small companies, or individuals. You have to be operating across many availability zones, many servers, etc. Horseshit. Microservices can be done at any scope, don't listen to them. Completeness - You are only doing some of the aspects of microservices. Maybe you don't need to orchestrate across many operational zones, and your traffic looks very different than some of the usual suspects.

			<p><em>26 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am going on five years of API Evangelist this summer, and I've been doing some reflecting about what the next five years will be about. While listening to my friend Mike Amundsen (@mamund), I had an idea, that I think I will evolve more during the operations of the next five years of API Evangelist (yes, sorry I'm not going anywhere). First, I want to clarify that when I started API Evangelist in summer of 2010, I spent a lot of time trying to create a logo, resulting in me creating this temporary (5 years) logo, that you have seen on my t-shirts for the last five years. After listening to Mike spin his yarn, I'm convinced that the next wave of growth for API Evangelist has very little to do with me, and my brand, than it does with the rest of the API community. I've spent a lot of time sharing stories, but for us to get to the next level, it has to be about the community sharing its stories, or we will never get to the scale all of us API delusionaries envision.&nbsp; To support this vision, I'm going to play with a new logo for API Evangelist, and print up a round of t-shirts with this evolution of the logo. I know I'll get a lot of flack from the restarfarians, and hypermedia folks about the design, but it is more about the storytelling, than it is about being technical, but in my opinion, they both work in concert. I've often answered, when people ask me what is scale for API Evangelist, that it is about having hundreds of people doing what I do, across many business sectors, around the globe--this new design reflects that. While this is a marketing effort for my brand, it realyy is about the next phase of growth for the space.

			<p><em>26 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I look at a lot of API documentation, something that until recently has been pretty static--pun intended. As an API consumer I really appreciate standardized approaches to documenting an API, like using Swagger or API Blueprint, but I also really enjoy when people go the extra mile to add little details, that make the experience a little more fun.
A recent example of this is from the Spotify API team. When it comes to the search endpoint for the Spotify API, they put in this little addition:
The field filter tag:new can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums released in the last two weeks. The field filter tag:hipster can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums with the lowest 10% popularity.
I love shit like this. It makes the often mundane world of APIs, a lttle more bright. It shows that there is a human beneath the very technical story that is often being told as part of API operatoins.&nbsp;
I don't about you, while I enjoy the self-service nature of APIs, where I don't have to deal with people and sales teams to be able to put a valuable resource to usee--I also enoy knowing there is a human behind the scenes. Especially if it someone who cares enough about an API enough to have fun, and enjoy themselves along the way.

			<p><em>23 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>While at Gluecon this week, one of the events I particpated in was the Swagger API Meetup, Tuesday evening. There was a small group of Colorado Bros (TM) there, admittedly there "just for the beers", who asked what is Swagger? Valid question, and something I'm always willing to help onboard folks with. First I made sure they knew what an API was, then simply stated, "Swagger lets you see the girl in the red dress" -- making a Matrix reference, hoping to onboard them with the concept of Swagger, via a familiar movie analogy.&nbsp; As I've spent time hand crafting the Swagger definitions for my 25 APIs, which includes almost 350 endpoints, the surface area of my operations have slowly come into focus. Before this, the only visual assistance I had was via any client UI I crafted on top of my APIs. My APIs are so much more than just the single client I had built for them, but this was the reality I had constructed. Swagger allows me to see my API, beyond just the 0s and 1s flying by on my screen, giving me a reference that helps not just see my own APIs, but also potentially share with others, and have a conversation around what is possible with my APIs. I'll keep working on this Matrix analogy to help people understand what Swagger is. If nothing else it will just open up a deeper conversation about what APis are, and the Swagger brings to the table. The ironic thing about this, and I know that my friend Mike Amundsen (@mamund) will agree, is that the girl in the red dress doesn't exist, and in fact API definitons are just a mental crutch, assisting us down a longer road, towards a deeper understanding of how we define our digital self, and the increasingly digital world we live in--I apologize, I get ahead of myself, let me keep with the stories at hand,...[<a href="/2015/05/23/swagger-allows-you-to-see-the-girl-in-the-red-dress/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have written many times before about the right way to onboard with an API, as well as how not to onboard with an API. I see a lot of APIs, and can tell you which APIs have put thought into the process, and those who haven't. Helping companies smooth out the sharp edges on their API onboarding is something I spend a lot of time doing, so I work hard to make sure the topic shows up regularly in my writing. Today I want to highlight a slight different onboarding email I received from Weather2020: Hi there Mr. Lane!First off I'll get my lil bit of gushing out of the way. &nbsp;I really enjoy what you're doing out there in the world. &nbsp;I love your commitment and passion to the growing world and need for APIs and your focus on the narrative vs. straight technical details. &nbsp;So even if you find some reason to hate what we have going on here just please keep up the great work.But now without further delay, I generated a key that grants you an unlimited number of calls. &nbsp;That key is: c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3eeThe structure of our API calls are:http://api.weather2020.com/[APIKEY]/[LAT],[LNG]So a sample functioning call for us here in Kansas City is:http://api.weather2020.com/c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee/39.099727,-94.578567Just because you're obviously just a bit of an enthusiast I'll let you know I have 2 other call structures that deliver the forecast data based on zip codes and city names. &nbsp;I use them strictly for our internal purposes but I've enabled your API key to work with them as well. &nbsp;Just in case you want to play around with them. &nbsp;They're not that super impressive but involved a very different kind of internal data mapping so I'm mildly proud of em.http://api.weather2020.com/zip/c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee/90210http://api.weather2020.com/city/c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee/Portland,ORI plan to have some documentation at the root API domain very soon ( ie. here: http://api.weather2020.com ) . &nbsp;So hopefully none of the returned data is too much of a mystery. &nbsp;If you have any questions just...[<a href="/2015/05/15/a-unique-and-personal-api-onboarding-experience/">Read More</a>]</p>

In the lead up to&nbsp;talks about Swagger next week at Gluecon, in Colorado. I'm pretty impressed with this work at UCSB, and while I am processing it, I wanted to share with you, and hopefully stimulate others to share what they are working on behind the scenes, using Swagger--I've gotten some pretty cool submissions so far. We use Swagger in a series of on going research projects at the&nbsp;RACELab&nbsp;of UC Santa Barbara.

The base Swagger standard covers all the crucial syntactic features of the APIs. We extended the base Swagger specification to include some simple axiomatic semantics (API preconditions and postconditions). We use this syntactic and semantic information to measure the similarity between different API alternatives. In EAGER (Enforced API Governance Engine for REST), we use the base Swagger 1.1 standard to describe all APIs deployed into the cloud. We auto-generate Swagger descriptions from Java (JAXRS) source code at the compile-time using a custom Maven plug-in. Once uploaded to the cloud, we use Swagger descriptions to validate APIs, enforce policies on them and establish the backward compatibility between different versions of the same API.

			<p>I am preparing to head to Colorado next week for Gluecon--one of my can't miss events in the API space. Gluecon is always a great place to be, to discuss the API space with the folks who are leading the charge, but this year is shaping up to be a particularly important one. There are number of things happening this year, primarily focused around API definitions, that stand to have a pretty significant impact on how the space operates. To help showcase the goings on next week, I wanted to walk through my schedule, which I think speaks for itself. Starting next Tuesday, May 19th, we have two events: APIStrat, API Definitions, Design, and The API Lifecycle Workshop from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM Swagger API Meetup from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM Then on the afternoon of Wednesday May 20th, I am moderating the API session track on the main stage: 1:30-1:45 -&nbsp;Track introduction, Kin Lane (@kinlane) 1:45-2:15 -&nbsp;API Readiness: Visualizing and Virtualizing -- Lorinda Brandon (@lindybrandon), SmartBear 2:15-2:45 -&nbsp;How REST APIs Can Glue All Types of Devices Together -- Jerome Louvel, (@jlouvel) Restlet 2:45-3:15 -&nbsp;Roll-your-own API management platform with nginx and Lua -- Jon Moore(@jon_moore), Comcast 3:15-3:30 -&nbsp;Discussion (with audience) led by Kin Lane (@kinlane) 3:45-4:15 -&nbsp;Building a Node.js API with Swagger -- Jeremy Whitlock (@whitlockjc) 4:15-4:45&nbsp;- Architectural Patterns for Scaling Microservices and APIs -- Lori MacVittie (@lmacvittie), F5 Networks 4:45-5:00&nbsp;- Track conclusion by Kin Lane (@kinlane) Then after the session I am doing a keynote on the main stage on the Tech, Business, and Politics of APIs in 2015, where I'll conclude the latest talk I've been doing around where I see the space going, rooted in stories out of the evolution of my own infrastructure.

Today I came across the Roll Dice as a Service API, a simple resource for rolling dice, while reading Today in Tabs. I love simple, micro API designs like this, and in addition to adding it to my database, I wanted to make sure I documented the API using Swagger.

You never know when an API will go away, so I wanted to capture a snapshot of the API as a machine readable API definition. The code behind is also open source, so I went ahead and forked the Github repository as well.
I would like to see more APIs like this. I think they are fun, and potentially very useful, depending on their function. I'd like to see a push button deploy on Heroku, and in Docker containers, so people could build little, localized API stacks.

			<p><em>11 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>I get hypermedia at a high level, but have no real experience designing or deploying a hypermedia API or client. For the longest time I just watched the hypermedia conversation from afar, but in the last year I have spent time learning about the different approaches, but I still have not gone as deep as I'd like. I'm looking to change this over the summer, and begin to add some hypermedia thinking to my own API design. To get started I've targeted my curation API for the addition of a hypermedia layer, and I'm choosing Siren as my hypermedia format. Siren spoke to me over some of the other approaches, but once I get my bearings I will look at tackling one or two more implementations. As I do with my other work, I'm just looking to share my thoughts in real-time, as I go along. First, the process is really helping me tight down my API design. This is something I feel going with an API first design approach using Swagger has helped me, but adding the Siren format to the design of my API is taking this to a whole new level. I still have a longs ways to go in crafting the Siren responses for my curation API, but so far the process of defining the entities, actions, and links is really helping me think through the overall API design--leaving very few loose ends. Second, the actions and links are also helping me really craft a more meaningful workflow around an API resource that I depend each day. This link curation API that I use in my daily, weekly, and monthly monitoring of the API space has an ever evolving workflow associated with it, but ultimately its been something I've kept in my head, or visualizing in the minmium viable (half-assed) clients I have built to help manage my world. This hypermedia learning process is forcing me to think it through, as...[<a href="/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am spending a small amount of time each week, adding a new hypermedia layer to my link curation API. My goal is to better understand hypermedia, while also improving the designs of the APIs that I depend on for my own operations. During todays work, I was looking for a more extensive example of Siren being used by an actual API provider, taking me beyond what Kevin Swiber (@kevinswiber) provides in his examples.&nbsp;
The example I found that has really helped me go from 0-60 when it comes to Siren (well maybe more like 0-15), was the TV and streaming video API platform Wurl. The API has a pretty robust example of Siren being used in the wild, allowing me to reverse engineer the design patterns and apply in my own way--this is one way I learn things, through breaking down other people's work.&nbsp;
Wurl has 11 entities defined, demonstrating the really versatile power of Siren in defining the resources an API is serving up. They have some really nice workflows around each video episode, allowing them to be organized into series, bundles, and providing user management and search. For me it is a great introduction into what hypermedia is, and more specifically what Siren offers, in a working, real-world example.
I only have so much bandwidth to spend on this work, but after getting my feet wet adding a hypermedia layer link curation API using Siren, and playing with the Wurl API, I've got a lof of new thoughts floating around my head around how I can improve my own API designs, and better present the large amount of information, visualizations, and other information available within my API curation lifecycle.

			<p>I had a great conversation with Chris Taggart (@countculture), the CEO of OpenCorporates, after his keynote at APIDays Berlin / APIDays Europe 2015 last week, about how they get the data they need, to make the change they want to see in how we do business globally. Us technologists get excited about the potential around the ingestion of large data files published by companies and governments, and the scraping of data where we can. All of this is definitely be part of the open data lifecycle, but often times the whole open data thing, comes down to the human variable. Almost every open data project I've embarked on, always has a portion of the process which involves me rolling up my sleeve, and cleaning up, and validating of data--there is just no way around it. Of course I do everything I can to automate the harvesting, mounting, processing, and cleaning up of data, but in the end most of the data I come across is just messy. This is just way things are, and while I'd love to not have to get my hands dirty, it is always a requirement to achieve my goal. This is why it made me happy to talk through some of OpenCorporates processes with Chris, and learn that they have pretty similar approaches. They can definitely automate the extraction of files, and large of amounts of data, but when it comes to normalizing it, they often have to depend on putting the data into small batches, publishing to Google Spreadsheets, and rely on humans to do the detail work--yes, humans still have a purpose, when it comes to open data! OpenCorporates tries to do as much of the heavy lifing as they can, but they still require on individuals, with as minimal amount of training as possible, to look at PDFs, HTML docs, and other files, and enter specific values into associated columns, and validate data that has been harvested--these...[<a href="/2015/05/05/sometimes-open-data-just-needs-that-human-touch/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was taking a look at a new healthcare API recently, adding it to my stack, for deeper review at a later date. Whenever I add a company to my monitoring and review system, I go through the site to make sure they have some of the characteristics of a modern API. I am not interested in many of the APIs that I come across that are older web services, or just poorly done APIs. I want to make sure APIs have self-service registration, some web API characteristics, code libraries, support, and a minimum viable set of building blocks.
The API I was looking at is&nbsp;Validic, which bills itself as a "Digital Health Platform". I'm coming across a number of new API driven, healthcare platforms, like Validic lately. As I was adding it to my database I noticed the legal section in the footer, which had five elements:&nbsp;

Data Security Policy
Service Level Agreement (SLA)
Support Policy
Privacy Policy
Terms &amp; Conditions

Three of the five elements, I have as building blocks that I recommend for platforms. I'm taking note of two of the two that I do not have recorded, a data security policy, and support policy. While I think the stakes are a little bitter higher in healthcare, an industry that would require this added level of protection for the platform, developers, and users, I think these building blocks could be something I may include for all API providers.
I think having a support policy sets the bar, for how a platform will support its developers. I also find the data security policy very intriguing, setting the bar for how a platform will secure users data on the platform--something every online platform should step up and do, no matter what industry you are in. As I review the platform more, I will break down these potential new building blocks, and add them to my master list.&nbsp;

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE This is a review of the communication API platform CallFire, crafting a snapshot of platform operations, from an external viewpoint, providing the CallFire platform team with a fresh take on their API from the outside-in. The criteria applied in this review is gathered from looking at the API operations across thousands of API providers, and aggregating best practices, into a single, distilled review process. This review has been commissioned by CallFire, but as anyone who's paid me for a review knows, money doesn't equal a favorable review&mdash;I tell it like I see it. My objective is to help CallFire see their platform through a different sense, as developers might see their platform. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees, and I find the API review is a great way to help API providers see the bigger picture. I prefer to share my API reviews in a narrative format, walking through each of the important aspect of API management, telling the story of what I see, and what I don't see. Here is the story of what I found while reviewing the communication API platform for CallFire. OverviewCallFire makes for an easier review than some API operations, because the API is the product. As soon as you land on the homepage of the website, you begin your API journey as a potential API consumer. The first thing you read is "Over 2 Billion Messages Delivered&rdquo;, so you immediately understand what CallFire does, and the next thing that grabs your eye is &ldquo;Signup For Free&rdquo;&mdash;way to not miss a beat, CallFire. Next you see five simple icons, with simple text, breaking what CallFire does down: Text Messaging, Call Tracking, Video Broadcast, Cloud Call Center, IVR. Within the first five seconds you fully understand what is being offered, and given the opportunity to sign up. If that is not enough, you are also...[<a href="/2015/05/03/a-review-of-the-callfire-communication-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>In 2010 I started API Evangelist, as part of my effort to better understand the world of APIs. I was looking to not just the technology of how it was done, I saw there were plenty of people doing this. I wanted to better understand the business of APIs, and how popular APIs were finding success with their business models, developer outreach, and other aspects of API operations--going well beyond just the technology. API Evangelist started simply as a blog. I was not a big fan of WordPress, as I knew it can be quite a security target, and as a platform, for a programmer like me, can be more difficult to get even the simple things done. With this in mind I started the first API Evangelist API, by following the same advice that I would be giving to my potential audience. api.apievangelist.com/blog/ Quickly I needed some additional APIs, to keep track of some of the players I saw emerging across the landscape. In 2010, the most important piece of the puzzle, when it came to the business of APIs (after the APIs themselves) was the growing number of API service providers, who were popping up to deliver much needed services to API providers. To support my work I added a couple more API endpoints. api.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/ api.apievangelist.com/apis/ Tracking on APIs wasn't that critical, as it was something ProgrammableWeb already did, but I still preferred to track on some addition details for my own needs. When it came to deploying my own APIs, I kept the as simple as possible, using the backend that I knew best -- the LAMP stack. I was already running several websites on Amazon Web Services, so I chose to deploy my servers and database using Amazon, using a pretty proven formula for delivering a backend stack. LAMP Stack - MySQL (RDS) + PHP / Linux (EC2) PHP may not be the choice of API champions, but I was fluent...[<a href="/2015/04/29/the-technology-business-and-politics-of-apis-via-a-community-driven-api-life-cycle/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>After recovering from an amazing week in Berlin for APIDaysBerlin / APIStrat Europe 2015, and catching up on some work, which included a 20 hour push to get the last weeks API.Report completed, I am now preparing for API Days Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th in Barcelona, Spain. The event is billed as "The Independent Conference on APIs, NLP, and Language Technology", and brings together may of the leading API minds, but also the cross-over with APIs and language technology--something you won't see anywhere else. While the main event is next Wednesday and Thursday, things kick off the night before, on Tuesday, May 5th with some pre-conference workshops and partying at 3Scales office: 17:30 - Practical 3scale API Management Crash Course at 3scale's office (register) 19:00 - API Meetup Barcelona: Marketing APIs: Do's and Dont's and APIdays warm-up party at 3scale's office (register) Then starting Wednesday, the main event kicks off with many of the usual suspects, who don't just lead in the API industry, but also work very hard traveling the world evangelizing API best practices: Mike Amundsen (@mamund), CA Technologies - From Stacia to Hyperion and Back Again: A Hypermedia Hero's Tale Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik), Hypermedia Evangelist - JSON API: your anti-bikeshedding weapon Bruno Pedro (@bpedro), Redbooth &amp; API Changelog - How to Automate API Discovery Andy Thurai (@andythurai), IBM - Machine Learning with IBM Watson and Alchemy API Tyler Singletary (@harmophone), Klout - Topics as an Engine For Insights Tony Blank (@thetonyblank), Context.io - The True Value Of Email Data Manfred Bortenschlager (@manfredbo), 3scale - What does it take to design and run a successful API program? It doesn't stop there. What really makes me happy about APIDays, is the increasing number of local, and regional API talent the event attracts. I see a number of other talented API prfoessional, doing some very interesting talks, ranging from the business of APIs to hypermedia.

			<p><em>27 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am still coming off the high that was&nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe this last April 23rd through 25th in Berlin. There were a number of talks that I enjoyed, ranging from open data, to 3D printing, to hypermedia--too many to list. I love the German view of technology, data privacy, and generally on what is going on in the United States.
Other than the wifi issues, the conference was a success. We sold out the event, with 450 people in attendance (goal was 400), and even with the final day being on a Saturday, the turnout was very impressive. Each session I ran, was full of questions, with an IoT session, and another architecture session running 10 minutes over, because there were so many good questions, I didn't want to stop.

We are processing the videos from the conference, which I will spend time watching each one--telling stories along the way. So keep an eye out on API Evangelist, and on the @APIStrat blog for each video release, as we will be trickling them out as each video comes off the production line over the next couple of weeks. &nbsp;
Thank you to 3Scale, APIDays, and Commerce Tools to for making sure this amazing event came together. I'm just now getting my brain back in gear, so look for more &nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat stories over next couple weeks!

Thank you so much Berlin! I look forward to coming back for the next event.

			<p><em>21 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>In addition to helping be the MC for the API event, one of the conversation I am facilitating at&nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe this Friday in Berlin, is an open data discussion on the main stage. What better place to discuss the world of open data and API, then in Germany. The country has some of the strictest laws when it comes to protecting the privacy of German citizens, and when it comes to API access to data, I couldn't think of a better place to have an open discussion in 2015. I have invited two data specialists to the stage Friday afternoon: Ali Jelveh (@jelveh),&nbsp;CEO &amp; Founder Protonet GmbH and Free Your Data - &nbsp;Ali Jelveh is Co-Founder and Chief Revolutionary Officer of Protonet. Protonet builds Personal Severs for small and medium sized teams. The German-Iranian software engineer has been amongst the first developers at XING after dropping out of his college career. He is on a mission to transform the internet from centralization in the cloud to a state of distributed infrastructure and independent users. Jonathan Voigt,&nbsp;Digital Strategy Advisor / Country Representative of UN Influx -&nbsp;Jonathan Voigt is a startup founder, corporate entrepreneur and digital strategy advisor. Following a master&rsquo;s degree in innovation management, he co-founded a digital marketing start-up and is now supporting Germany's leading agency for digital transformation. In an honorary capacity, Jonathan is the German representative of UN Influx , a charity that organizes hackathons to help the UN and the public engage better with one another. I am looking forward to hearing what Ali and Jonathan have to say about open data, from a European perspective. To help stimulate the conversation, I've also invited one of our keynotes to join us: Chris Taggart (@countculture),&nbsp;EO &amp; Co-founder of OpenCorporates -&nbsp;Chris Taggart&nbsp;is the CEO and co-founder of OpenCorporates: The Open Database Of the Corporate World, which has worked with the open data community to build a database of over 25 million companies,...[<a href="/2015/04/21/my-open-data-panel-at-apidaysberlin-and-apistrat-this-friday-in-berlin/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I wrote a post the other day laying out what I'd consider a minimum viable footprint for API operations. My vision of just exactly what an API is, has gone beyond just the technical, ever since I started API Evangelist back in July of 2010. Early on I saw this was more than just about the API endpoints, and documentation, code samples, and many other building blocks were essential to the success (or failure) of any API platform, area, or ecosystem. This recent post was an attempt, here in 2015, to quantify what I would consider to be a minimum definition for API operation. After writing it I wanted to take another stab at actually creating a portal, that would stand up to the API rhetoric that I regularly produce. What better place to start, than my own personal master API stack, where I am&nbsp;working to get control over my own infrastructure. Once I got a version 1.0 definition, I forked it, and setup a default API portal that I am calling my demo APIs.json driven portal. I have published to Github, a version of my minimum API footprint, which I'm using APIs.json an engine. After looking at 10,000K+ APIs, I have a pretty good idea of what I like to see. This is my interpretation of all that monitoring of the space--a distillation of what I've seen while reviewing APIs. It isn't perfect, but neither is the space that we have, and my portal is just an attempt at quantifying what I'm seeing. I'm going to create a minimum viable Internet of Things (IoT) version of this portal as well, and use APIs.json to deploy different interpretations of what constitutes a minimum viable API presence. If you have anything you'd like to see in my base template, let me know. If you want to fork and add to, then submit a pull request, even better.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm very fortunate to be the API Evangelist, as I get to spend my days discussing, some very lofty ideas, with extremely smart and entrepreneurial folks from across many different business sectors. An ongoing conversation I have going on with Bret Tobey (@batobey), the CEO of Carvoyant, is around the big data generated around the Internet of Things. Many companies that I engage with are very closed about their big data operations, where Carvoyant is the opposite, they want to openly discuss, and figure it out as a community, out in the open--something I fully support. In reality, the Internet of Things (IoT) is less about devices, than it is about the data that is produced. If someone is exclusively focusing on the device as part of their pitch, it is mostly likely they are trying to distract you from the data being generated, because they are looking to monetize the IoT data exhaust for themselves. Carvoyant is keen on discussing the realities of IoT data exhaust, and not just from Internet connected automobile perspective, but also the wider world of Internet connected devices. If you want to join in the discussion, of course you can comment on this blog, and via Twitter, but you can also come to Gluecon in May, where 3Scale, API Evangelist, and Carvoyant will be conducting an IoT big data workshop, on this topic. If you aren't familiar with Carvoyant, they are an API-driven device that you can connect to your vehicle, if it was manufactured after 1996, and access the volumes of data being produced each day. Carvoyant's tag line says "Your Car, Your Data, Your API" -- I like that. This is why I enjoy talking through their strategy, because they see the world of APIs, connected devices, and big data the way I do. Sure there is lots of opportunity for platforms, and developers to make money in all of this, but if there is user generated...[<a href="/2015/04/17/thinking-through-how-we-handle-the-internet-of-things-data-exhaust-and-responsible-api-monetization-with-carvoyant/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was reading&nbsp;Obama administration agrees with Sunlight: Agencies should disclose what data they keep private, which is a topic I follow closely, as I'm passionate about government opening up their data inventory, but also because worked as a Presidential Innovation Fellow on helping agencies open up their data. I completely agree that agencies should have to disclose lists of even their private enterprise data repository, to help establish a clear picture of just exactly what is public or private government data. While reading the post, I noticed the statement that, "most agencies seem to have accepted and understood the need for this change, but some concerns have been voiced": The Department of Commerce, which holds a very sizable amount of data, has cited &ldquo;certain technological issues that are creating major barriers to creating the PDL as described [in OMB&rsquo;s guidance].&rdquo; This is a concern, but Commerce appears to be working through these issues with relevant officials in the General Services Administration and OMB. NASA has expressed significant concerns with the new process, specifically citing pushback and time constraints from its FOIA office and legal team. They claim that &ldquo;identifying and indexing our open data is our priority,&rdquo; and indexing its non-public data will take valuable capacity away. Fortunately, NASA has bought into the public process and are engaged in meaningful conversation about the agency's concerns on the Project Open Data Github. It is interesting that agencies cite the technology challenges in complying with open data mandates. In my experience working on opening up government data, right after the education of the average government employee, challenges imposed by the technology they use is one of the biggest hurdles. To make my point, you can't find "Export Spreadsheet to JSON" as a Microsoft Excel option. Most systems encourage the output of PDFs from core systems, which when it is combined with lack of open data export capabilities, makes opening up of inventories extra work.

			<p>I see a lot of software come and go. I adopt applications, tools, and online services for a variety of reasons, with some of these tools remaining a regular part my operations, with others coming and going with time. I'm currently abandoning Evernote, in favor of my own home brew note tool, while I'm also adopting a handful of new HTTP Client tools like Paw. There are a number of reasons these tools go away, sometimes the reason I needed them shifts, other times they evolve to a point where they are no longer useful to me, and other times they go away after an acquisition, or running out of money, and not being able to keep the lights on. In the end, when i find tools I believe in, and deeply integrate them into my life, and want to better understand how I can help ensure they will be successful. One tool that I am using as part of my daily operations is Known. If you are unfamiliar,&nbsp;Known it is a simple, social publishing platform for your blog or website. I'm am personally invested in helping the Known founders find the customers they need to be successful, and as part of this effort I wanted to practice explaining Known to my readers, while I also expand my own understanding of the role Known can play in my own operations. Reclaim Your DomainFor me, Known is about reclaiming my domain. Rather than posting tweets to Twitter, I post to Known, and using the Twitter API, Known publishes a copy of the Tweet to Twitter. I maintain the original copy of my Tweet. When I write a wall post I can publish to LinkedIn, as well as Facebook, with the original content staying in Known.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I get a number of folks contacting me about their API ideas, and email or call me, looking to schedule a meeting or briefing to discuss the API ideas. This is something I always reply with a request for existing links to the portal, blog, Twitter, and Github accounts of those involved. Even when companies are doing something interesting, I prefer to approach it like any random Joe or Jane would, from the public portal, with very little information up-front. Your overall approach to API, the value it delivers, and ease of integration should speak for itself, in my opinion. I am sure there are plenty of companies still who would prefer a briefing, meeting, call, or other personal touch, sales or pitch like engagement, but increasingly in an API driven world, a self-service, pull approach is preferred. A well done API shouldn't have to rely only on traditional marketing. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have these mechanims in place, but by pushing this approach on media, developers, and other potential consumers, you are doing yourself a disservice in many situations--going backwards, not forwards. There is also another group of people who contact me, who really don't have a thing yet. They are just looking for validation, and potentially stimulate discussions that will get them more attention from would be investors. As with the previous group, I think the "just do it" approach works best. You are going to stimulate much more meaningful discussions amongst investors if you are actually doing something, and generating real buzz amongst developers. Additionally you never know, you may be able to bootstrap and make it happen, without attracting major investment. I know many of you traditional busines folks are used to a push approach to getting your business out there, but when you are looking to make inroads in the API economy, your majority investment should be about creating a platform that people can visit, and pull the...[<a href="/2015/04/17/a-healthy-api-strategy-does-not-involve-scheduling-a-briefing-to-discussjust-do-it/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have been slowly adding Postman Collections to many of the APIs indexes&nbsp;for my new master stack. I index each API using an APIs.json file, as well as provide a master APIs.json which brings together all of the APIs, into the single portal I've published to Github. Within some of the APIs, you will see a Postman icon, allowing you to easily import the API definition into postman, directly from each APIs landing page. When I first published that I was publishing these Postman collections on my Alpha API Evangelist blog, someone from the donation API platform Just Giving said they also prepare Postman collections for their developers, and publish them to Github for their API consumers:&nbsp; At JustGiving we give our API consumers a set of collections to import to make their jobs even easier, we also use the "Environments" feature to substitute different values depending on whether you're using our Sandbox or Production environment - it's a real time saver and also helps when supporting our API consumers. I feel pretty strongly that Postman is a measurable unit for transactions in the API economy, and I feel it goes a long way in helping API consumers onboard with each new API. As a developer, if I can import a Postman Collections into my client, within just a couple clicks, and be up and running with an API--I am going to be a much happier camper, and be that much closer to integration. I'm considering adding Postman collections as a building block under API on-boarding, and encourage API providers to follow JustGivings lead. Postman Collections is kind of the new API explorer, allowing developers to quickly test drive an API they are going to integrate with. With my own platform, I'm also going to play with publishing Postman Collections, complete with API keys that I refresh regularly, allowing immediate, but limited access my APIs, for anyone who stumble across them.&nbsp; Like Swagger, Postman is...[<a href="/2015/04/16/preparing-postman-collections-ahead-of-time-for-developers-like-justgiving-does/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have had Steve Willmotts of 3Scale's response to the announcement that Twitter was cutting off firehose access for over a week now, and bringing the higher level access completely in house via their Gnip acquisition. You can read the response from Gnip via their blog post&nbsp;Working Directly With the Twitter Data Ecosystem, and from DataSift in their&nbsp;The Twitter/Gnip Gap: Data Licensing vs Data Processing. Steve and I are in agreement with the points made via his How Not to be a Platform: Twitter&rsquo;s Firehose Mistake post. Where I really struggled with over the last week, in producing a official response, was after responding How To Be A Platform: Making Tough Partnership Choices, from my friend Tyler Singletary.&nbsp; You see, I agree with everything Tyler pointed as well. He's right. Twitter has probably made the right decision for Twitter, and based upon their goals and understanding of the Twitter API ecosystem, did exactly what should be prescribed. I have lots of opinions around the Twitter ecosystem, and how&nbsp;Twitter Continues to Restrict Access to Our Tweets. However, when I step back, and put on my API operations hat, everything Tyler points out, is valid in my opinion. Twitter gets to decide who has access, and in respect to their goals, chooseing the Gnip offering over the DataSift offering makes sense. It's all about the winning solution, and where the ROI is when it comes platform operations? Life is good when you are on the winning team. However #winning != #good, and #winning != best outcome. I also guess, that #open != good, and #open != best outcome either. There are no absolutes in API land--sorry. Where Tyler stance really begin to lose its shine for me, is when you zoom out. You see Tyler, you are on the winning team. You have access to the firehose, and you operate squarely within in the #winning conversation (I know you don't have direct firehose, and rely on Gnip)....[<a href="/2015/04/16/on-twitter-gnip-datasift-and-making-the-hard-platform-decision/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been monitoring an emerging slice of the API, that has been dubbed "microservices" for some time now, and you've even heard me explore its use, when describing my architectural approach to redesigning more core API stack for my internal systems. I&rsquo;m slowly redesigning my internal API stack, keeping them as small as possible, throughout all aspects of operations, deploying each endpoint in a single dockerized container, that contains the OS, database, web server and all server side API code. I'm also using Github, in conjunction with APIs.json to assist me in my orchestration, throughout every aspect of these APIs lifecycle from design to testing&mdash;all a new approach for me when managing my APIs. Is defining my APIs in this way, so that the definition is much more than just the actual API endpoints, but also include the entire backend, and lifecycle workflow Microservices? Fuck if I know. One thing I do know, is I've had enough conversations with folks who are doing microservices, resulting in me saying&nbsp;several times that the micro services definition is something very personal. Something which the first 10 times I said , sounded very positive, but after experiencing multiple people telling me what I'm doing isn't microservices, I can tell the term definitely will continue to be very personal&mdash;very much in the same way conversations around REST or Hypermedia has gotten personal on forums, and HN threads. You know what this tells me about microservices? Is it is more about power, control and influence, everything from enterprise architects stating their endorsement of the concept, down to the individual architects, who love to make sure you know that the way you are doing it, is WRONG! I don't think there is a single definition of "microservice", and much like REST, I think we'll hear plenty of &ldquo;right&rdquo; definitions, by the enterprise justifying what they are doing, and those who are selling something to the enterprise. Is there anything wrong with this?...[<a href="/2015/04/10/on-apis-and-microservices/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>This is something I talk about often, but it has been a while since I&rsquo;ve done a story dedicated to it, so I wanted to make sure and take a fresh look at what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable footprint for any API&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care if it is public or not. This definition has grown out of five years of monitoring the approach taken by leading API providers, and is also baked into what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable APIs.json definition&mdash;which provides an important index for API operations. What do I want to see when I visit a developer area? More importantly, what does your average developer, or API consumer need when they land on your API portal? Let&rsquo;s look at the basics: Portal - A clean, easily accessible, prominently place portal landing page. This shouldn&rsquo;t be buried with your help section, it should be located at developer.[yourdomain].com. ' Description - As soon as developers land, they need a simple, concise explanation of what an API does. Actually describe what the API does, not just that it provides programmatic access to your products and services. Getting Started - Give everyone, even non-developers as place to start, helping us understand what is needed to get started with API integration, from signing up for an account to where do I find support. Documentation - Deliver, simple, clean, and up to date documentation, preferably of the interactive kind with a Swagger or API Blueprint behind. Authentication - Help developers understand authentication. There are a handful of common approaches from BasicAuth, and API keys, to oAuth--provide a simple overview of how authentication is handled. Self-Service Registration - How do I sign up? Give me a link to a self-service account signup, and make it as easy for me to create my new account, and go from idea to live integration as fast as possible&mdash;don&rsquo;t make me wait for initial approval, that can come later.

			<p><em>10 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>Somewhere during my weekly monitoring I found the Fiber Locator API, which like all APIs, especially the ones that ask me to &ldquo;request access&rdquo;, I signed up for the service. Understanding where telecommunications companies have laid fiber optic cable, for me, equals a potentially valuable API resource&mdash;sure I would consider integrating these resources into my applications, and systems. I&rsquo;m never a big fan of APIs, who make you request access vs self-service registration, but if the API has value, I jump through hoops, so I can can better understand what an API does, which according to the Fiber Locator site: FiberLocator offers an application programming interface that gives you access to our database of over 265+ carriers, over 272,000 carrier lit buildings locations and 3,000+ data centers. We created our API services so that client companies can augment their own systems and analyses with our unique data sets. I filled out the form, providing my name, email, phone and company name, the provided the additional details: I am the API Evangelist, and I&rsquo;d like to write a story about the Fiber Locator API. Something I do a lot. Within 24 hours I received: Then I got this: Both of these emails I replied with the same additional details I included with my request for API access. I received a third solicitation, but felt it didn't add any value to the conversation. From what I can tell, the Fiber Locator API is simply a lead generation form, which routes to sales people&mdash;I see no evidence of an API. Maybe there is something really there, if there is, this is not how you on-board people. I may just be writing a story about the API, which you should probably encourage, but that is just me, but if you really want developers to integrate fiber location into their applications and internal systems, you should probably let us kick the tires, see what the service is all about.

			<p><em>10 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>APIs are very much a virtual concept, something that is very abstract, often difficult to explain, and is something that very much lives in the online world. Spending much of my daily life in this world, I&rsquo;m always excited to come across APIs that bridge this digital world, with our existing physical worlds. At first read, you might think I&rsquo;m talking about the recent growth of Internet of Things APIs, that are connecting physical devices like our thermostats and smoke alarms, to our mobile devices, using APIs. This is part of it, but for this post I&rsquo;m referencing APIs that don&rsquo;t just connect to objects in our physical world, but they actually bind to existing experiences, processes, and other aspects of our personal and professional worlds. The Link Creation Studio from HP, is this. Using the web interface, or the API, you can create QR codes, and images with digital watermarks, which can be printed, then any user with a mobile device can snap a picture, which then triggers an action, that then takes the user to a specific location online--providing a bridge from a printed object in our physical world, to an online extension of that object. This bridge comes with the ability to manage the action that is embedded in print, and the resulting online link destination. You can print the QR code, and digital watermarks, and over time see analytics for each user that traverses the bridge, from print to web page. Link Creation Studio users can also manage this experience, and change it over time to get the resulting experience, that both the publisher, and users desire. The Link Creation Studio is a simple, but very powerful tool for building bridges between our physical and online worlds. The fact that it has an API is extremely significant, allowing these bridges to be built in real-time, from any system, whether that is a classic business print situation like business cards and product...[<a href="/2015/04/10/bridging-our-virtual-and-physical-worlds-with-the-link-creation-studio/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve had an increasing number of conversation with folks about in the last couple months, and a friend of mine Tweeted in response to today, resulting in this lovely rant. This is about two very separate problems, in which the solutions are what I'd consider significantly overlapped. I&rsquo;m talking about the need to make sure the valuable metadata, as well as underlying resources made available via an API is accessible to search engines, while also making sure the it is all Section 508 compliant, providing critical access to people with disabilities. In response to my recent post, on "Why The New API Blueprint Sharing Button From Apiary Is So Important&rdquo;, said: I'm heavy user of @apiaryio but disappointed with discoverability features of the product. Google just ignores them. https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd &mdash; Kristopher Kleva (@klevland) April 9, 2015 First, this is another reason why the API Blueprint being more open is important, anyone can now come along and not just build an SEO API documentation solution, they can get access to Apiary.io users who desire such a solution. Ok, that might seem bad for Apiary, but in situations that Apiary is not concerned with, this allows the community to step up and serve the long tail, and if it is something that concerns Apiary, it lights the fire under their ass to consider adding to the road map (sorry Jakub &amp; Z, I know I"m a pain ;-). Second, it allows the community to step up and serve what I'd consider the critical long tail&mdash;like Section 508. In our rush to deliver the latest in technological innovations, we often forget about significant portions of our society who, well, aren&rsquo;t like us. How many leading apps and platforms that you use are Section 508 compliant?

			<p><em>09 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was just doing on of my regular check-ins with Pratap Ranade (@pratapranade), the CEO of Kimono. We try to make time to catchup on what each other are up to, and find where we can work together to incite API evolution. Pratap sees the space like I do, that APIs are more than tech, possessing huge potential when it comes to empowering folks to make change within their companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and the wider industries and countries they exist in.
Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t go into too much detail about the projects we are working on until they are ready, but I just spend over an hour talking through some pretty interesting use cases that have occurred via Kimono Labs, in which Kimono users are scraping data and content from existing websites, and crafting some pretty interesting APIs. I&rsquo;m not just talking about the fun things like March Madness or World Cup going on over at Kimono, I&rsquo;m talking about influencing elections, addressing disaster recovery issues, and providing timely data that can influence how financial markets are working (or not).
The best part about these stories, is the work is being done, in many cases by people who don't have traditional programming skills, they are more hackers who have identified a problem, and used Kimono to scrape the data, and generate simple APIs, that help provide a new way of delivering API-driven solutions to the problem being targeted. Pratap said they are quickly becoming a big data company as well as a structured data API solution, because of the number of folks stepping up to address the long tail of data.
I just wanted to provide a taste of what we are working on. I&rsquo;m always left pumped up about potential of APIs, after hearing what Kimono is up to. If you want a taste of some of the stories I'm talking about, check out the Kimono blog.

			<p>This is another story that came to mind while listening to the last episode of Traffic and Weather. As John and Steve were talking about the API definition format Swagger switching from Reverb to SmartBear (thanks for shout-out about my Swagger post), they were discussing how Microsoft is using Swagger as part of platform operations, and made sure and reminded us listeners that all this has been done before. Bringing up a never-ending theme &nbsp;in the world of APIs, that we just can't seem to shake loose. When people bring this up, what do they mean? Yes, modern API definitions like Swagger, are very much like earlier incarnations of WSDL and WADL. Ok. What now? We shouldn&rsquo;t do it? It won&rsquo;t work? Don&rsquo;t even bother with Swagger? We should learn from history, and earlier efforts, and make sure we don't same mistakes? We should be scared of Swagger, and run for the hills, hide in a bunker? We should all switch back to SOAP and use WSDL? You just like to tell me I'm wrong, and has nothing to do with technology? Why I bring this up, is because more often than not, most of these conversation lean towards the first response &mdash; don&rsquo;t even bother, except you don&rsquo;t really know because people who state &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve already done this&rdquo;, often leave it open ended, offering no constructive criticism. Some even close it with, this is nothing new! Ok, so what then? How does that impact my decision making, now. I guess, for me, I step back at look at how this applies to the rest of my world. Do we do this with all other trends in our lives? We already did short skirts, why do we gotta do them again?

			<p><em>09 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
Yay! Another story generated by listening to Traffic and Weather&nbsp;(blame John and Steve). I do enjoy sharing my random thoughts while listening to those two. This one is around the SDK discussion during the latest episode, but as they noted, they&rsquo;ve talked about SDKs a lot in the past. This particular reference was again, during the their discussion about Microsoft using Swagger to generate code&mdash;a topic which brought up the usual grumbles from John about SDKs. He loves to hate on SDKs, obviously suffering from severe SDK PTSD.
I agree with his feelings about SDKs, they are well founded, but auto-generating code from Swagger doesn&rsquo;t always involve with the generation of full-blown SDKs. I save a huge amount of time, auto-generating different types of code and scripts from Swagger, which I further clean up and make work for my specific needs. My experience with generating code from Swagger, is more about saving time, than it is about producing production ready SDKs.
Maybe my development world is unique, but I find I still have to get my hands dirty, even when I generate server or client side code using Swagger, requiring me to still play with HTTP and understand response / request details. I get what John is saying, and he is right. I'm increasingly frustrated by companies producing platforms that are more SDK than API, something IoT engineers excel at.
I just wanted to point out there are many layers to the discussion, and that there are no perfect solutions when auto-generating code from API definitions, but it can sure save time in both API deployment, as well as API consumption, and unlike SDKs I still understand the inner working of my apps, integrations, and the APIs they are depending on.

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I had one of my followers ask me if there as a &ldquo;gold standard for API deprecation policies&rdquo; out there. I&rsquo;d say that deprecation policies are a little different than some of the other legal building blocks of an API, where the legal is a small portion of it, with the majority really being all about communication.
To answer the question, I recommended Google. Not cause their deprecation policy itself is all the great, it is just because their overall approach to API deprecation is pretty robust&mdash;something I&rsquo;m sure is derived from their experience so far. (wink wink)
API deprecation at Google starts with some pretty clearly stated policies, but goes much further with:

Deprecation Policy
Deprecation Schedule
Data Deprecation Details
Blog Communication

These are just a handful of the building blocks that Google employs as part of their approach to API documentation. This post is just result of a 15 minutes of Googling around, to respond to the question. Now that I have written this post, and put the topic of API deprecation back on my radar, the next step is to dive deeper and develop a complete picture of how Google approaches API deprecation, as well as other leading players in the space.
At first take, it appears to me that the legal details of API deprecation that are present in terms of use, or as standalone documents is only the start. The winning examples of API deprecation involve making sure deprecation details are always readily available, regularly communicated, and are comprehensive enough to cover the API, data, and other things that matter to developers and end-users.

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>If I find a new company during my research, it takes me about a minimum of 15 minutes to lightly profile what they are up, and add to my system, and if I do a full profile, it can take several hours. All of this adds up to a lot of work, time that would be better spent on actually writing stories, hacking on the APIs, and publishing of the longer form research papers on what I&rsquo;m seeing. In an ideal world, each of these APIs would have an APIs.json in the root of their domain, with details about the company and people responsible for API operations, and as much information about each API as possible. With a single click, I could import the entire profile of a company, and its valuable API resources into my monitoring system, ready for publishing to relevant areas of the API Evangelist network, as well as some of my partner sites like APIs.io--the beauty is, so could anyone else. ;-) If API providers used APIs.json, I could be connected to their Blog via RSS, their platform Twitter account via the Twitter API, and their Github profile or organization using the Github API. Not only would I have relevant metadata about a company like their name, description, logo, and details about APIs, I would also be connected to a real-time heartbeat of API operations via the platform blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. This is just the start--there are numerous other building blocks you could wire up with an APIs.json file, to keep potential consumers up to speed. I know it can be hard to se the potential for APIs.json, because there is limiting tooling available currently, beyond the open source search engine APIs.io, Even before the next wave of tooling like the internal enterprise search engine, visualizations, browser plugins, and other tooling are available, you can realize the benefit of being listed on APIs.io, and make sure you are fully...[<a href="/2015/04/08/the-work-it-takes-to-connect-and-keep-up-with-each-valuable-api-i-come-across/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>This story is derived from listening to the API podcast, Traffic and Weather. One of the things John Sheehan (@johnsheehan), and Steve Marx (@smarx) discussed during the recent show, was a post Steve wrote as part of his role as product manager, called "How many HTTP status codes should your API use"? I think the story is extremely useful to read, helping us all think through how we use HTTP status codes in our own platform, but personally I think the real story, is Dropbox talking out loud about their strategy. John and Steve pointed out on the podcast that someone had tweeted that the story was not in sync with the way Dropbox actually did their HTTP status codes. To which Steve replied, that is why he wrote the story, to talk it out, and solicit feedback. This is how you should be thinking through your API road map, out loud, on your platform blog. When I mention to API providers that the blog is the most important tool in their toolbox, this is what I mean. Your blog isn&rsquo;t just for broadcasting your platform message, it is also about you thinking through thoughts, sharing those thoughts with your API consumers, and potentially getting feedback, which you can consider as part of the overall decision making process. I am addicted to thinking through my ideas publicly on my blog. For me, a thought isn&rsquo;t fully formed, until its published. I also depend heavily on the feedback from my audience to my stories, in their public comments on Disqus, and Twitter, as well as privately via email and DMs. Talking things through, publicly on your blog, teaches you to think outside the box, let the sunlight in on your thoughts, and forces you to (potentially) properly form your ideas (not always), at least enough to share with the public--even if you don&rsquo;t end up getting feedback, that process alone, is highly valuable.

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>As my Internet of Things (IoT) research continues, I&rsquo;m applying much of my API thinking from the mainstream API space to the world of IoT. A couple weeks ago I stumbled across the 3D Robotics Drone API, which to my surprise, was documented using a Swagger specification, providing a machine readable definition of the API, which helped me quickly get up to speed on what the Drone API delivers. I haven't put much thought into the detail for any drone APIs, something that has been adjacent to my mainstream research for over a year now, but I did have some basic opinions about what a drone API could have. So, when it comes to potential resources, I have to say the 3D Robotics Drone API delivers in all earlier areas I had been considering--with five main endpoints: The Vehicle API - Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of vehicle, and retrieving single vehicle, including airspeed, ground speed, and battery. The Mission API -&nbsp;Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of mission, and retrieving single mission. The Administrator API - Access to administrative resources including debugging, logging, and flight simulation. The User API - Access operations for browsing and searching lists of user, and retrieving single user. Authentication - Session operations for logging in and out, and identifying user. The vehicle stuff I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the resources around logging, and specifically the mission API. When it comes to transparency, and accountability around drone activity, I feel pretty strongly that these types of resources will be essential, and eventually will be mandated by government entities. I&rsquo;m glad that 3D Robotics is ahead of the game, in providing API driven resources that deliver in this way. What I didn&rsquo;t expect, when I stumbled across the user and mission management APIs, was the social, online layer. As part of the 3D Robotics Drone API platform, the company offers DroneShare, where you can...[<a href="/2015/04/08/considering-the-3d-robotics-drone-api-as-potential-blueprint-for-the-drone-industry/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was dedicating some time to researching APIs in the Internet of things (IoT) space, and stumbled across the Myfox API, serving the Myfox home security products. While the developer portal for the Myfox API doesn't have everything I'd like to see in an IoT developer portal, it is one of the better one's I've seen. If you think web or mobile app developers suck at providing a simple, and a coherent developer portal and experience, device platform providers are even worse. The Myfox API, has the essential building building blocks, with a simple overview, authentication info, simple Swagger driven API documentation, application management tools, and a clear terms of service for the platform. Additionally, there is a clear link between the primary Myfox website, the developer portal, and a myfox.me user portal, for device consumers and would-be developers to easily on-board with everything. I haven't fully profiled that Myfox platform, but at first glance it is clean, well laid out, and most importantly the link between the website, API, and user accounts is clear, and easy to navigate. As I think this through, and after recently finishing a white paper called Building an API-driven Ecosystem for the Internet of Things, for the now defunct GigaOm, I can't help but think the IoT space is going to need to agree on some sort of standard approach for not just managing how they design, deploy, and manage APIs, but also how they deliver developer and user portals. To help you visualize what I mean, consider the number of Internet connected devices any single household will own, all with their own portal, and on-boarding process. #FUN In short, developers, and end-users will get IoT account fatigue pretty quick. I don't think that we are going to standardize everything across the space, I am not delusional, but I can't help but think that the sharing of some common blueprints, could go a long ways in reducing friction for...[<a href="/2015/04/08/a-little-standardization-around-how-we-do-internet-of-things-iot-apis-and-developer-portals-could-go-a-long-ways/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>API design service provider Apiary, quietly launch a new sharing button for API Blueprints, in their interactive API documentation, the other week. They added a setting in their account area, which allows users to be more open with their API designs: "Start sharing your API blueprint with other API enthusiasts, by enabling this feature within your API settings. Simply toggle the &lsquo;Public Blueprint&rsquo; setting on and you&rsquo;re ready to start sharing your API blueprint.&rdquo; also stating that, &ldquo;this is just the beginning of being able to socialize and learn from other public API blueprints." Now we you are visiting the Apiary driven API documentation for common platforms like: Akamai Imaging API Relayr Definition API Loader.io From SendGrid CloudBreak From SequenceIQ The machine readable API Blueprint definition, driving the documentation now has the potential to be accessible. This may not seem like much, but it is actually fundamental to the health, and growth of the overall API industry. Developers cannot learn from other developers, and from leading API platforms, and share best practices for API design across the space without it&mdash;we need this to grow, and evolve. This is one of the reasons Swagger has seen such wide adoption, because it isn&rsquo;t just an open format, it is also because the API definitions that these public platforms generate are also available to share, and learn from. You can still lock down the valuable resources made available via an API, but the interface patterns we apply to our APIs should be shared as widely as possible, for everyone to see. This is why I&rsquo;ve been fighting so hard to push back against Oracle in their API copyright case against Google&mdash;API designs do not need to be locked up. I&rsquo;ve been able to find API Blueprints on the open web, and on Github for some time now, but this opens up the playing field to be able easily discovery, and engage with existing Apiary, and API Blueprint driven...[<a href="/2015/04/07/why-the-new-api-blueprint-sharing-button-from-apiary-is-so-important/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my travel in 2015, and focus on some important research, coding, and writing. I apologize to all the events I&rsquo;ve said no to over the last couple months, but I hit a wall last year with speaking, and trying hard to make 2015 a much more healthier, and balanced year.
With that said, here is where you can find me this spring. I have three places you can find me in April and May:

Berlin, Germany&nbsp;- You can find me in Berlin, putting on @APIDays / @APIStrat, April 24th &amp; 25th
Barcelona, Catalonia - I will be speaking at APIDays Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th, in Barcelona
Broomfield, CO 

@APIStrat Tech Un-Workshops @ Gluecon May 19th (1:00-5:00 PM)
Leading the Swagger conversation at Swagger API Meetup @ Gluecon May 19th (7:00-9:00 PM)
Gluecon - I will be at Gluecon 2015, May 20th, and 21st, speaking



That is all the speaking I&rsquo;m doing this spring, with one tentative date early in June at BYU. I won&rsquo;t be traveling again until the fall, when we do @APIStrat again, and of course @DefragCon!
I&rsquo;m excited to be in Berlin and Barcelona, two of my favorite European cities, and of course Broomfield, CO (specifically the Taproom). I am also excited to not be traveling as much, and able to focus on my wider research, coding, and writing. #thanks

			<p><em>07 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the developer portals of API providers. I see a lot of things, both the good and bad, while navigating these portals, and while some of the bad stuff I see are way too big for me to doing anything, there are many little things I see that I could help do something about. Sometimes it is just spelling mistakes, sometimes broken links, and other times I want to rewrite API descriptions, and add to the resources that are available for an API. During these travels, I got to thinking...what if API providers published their developer portals to Github? Just like I do with my API Evangelist sites. Then I could fork their portal, and submit pull requests with rewrites of the description of what your API does, adding little tweaks, here and there, helping polish the portal--potentially making things easier for developers. I&rsquo;m sure this thought scares the hell out of some companies, who can&rsquo;t imagine, allowing outside input like this, but if you sit down and think about it for a while, it just might make sense. When I was in Washington D.C., I created a default portal template that runs on Github. I might upgrade this, and make it available for API providers to use as a forkable template, to seed any API developer portal. Doing this makes it easy to provide a base set of building blocks that every API provider should start with, allowing them to delete the elements that they don&rsquo;t want. I am also considering making a default one, that can be used as a starter developer portal for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. I thoroughly enjoy the pull requests that I get for spelling and grammar mistakes I made on API Evangelist, from some of my favorite grammar trolls. Running all of my websites on Github Pages has changed the way I tell stories, and interact with my audience.

			<p><em>02 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>The one thing I've learned in five years as the API Evangelist is that us technologists and developers don't always see the world like everyone else. We focus on the perfection of the technology, our own desires for the future, and often miss the mark on what end-users actually need. This is one of the hallmark success of APIs over SOA, is that by accident, APIs jumped out of the SOA petri dish (thanks Daniel Jacobson - @daniel_jacobson), and was use solve everyday problems that end-users face, using the technology that is readily available (aka HTTP). While I think us API folks have done a great job of delivering valuable resources to mobile applications, and a decent enough job at delivering the same resources to web applications, and I guess we are figuring out the whole device thing? maybe? maybe not? Regardless, one area we have failed to serve a major aspect of the business world, is delivering valuable API resources to the number #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet. We have done a decent job of providing resources to data stewards, helping them deploy APIs using spreadsheets using services like API Spark, but other than a handful of innovative implementations from companies like Octoparts and Twilio, there are no solid API consumption resources that target the spreadsheet environment. Meaning there is no easy way for mainstream spreadsheet users to put common API driven resources to work for them within the spreadsheets that they live in daily--that is until today, with the launch of the&nbsp;Blockspring launched their Google Spreadsheets Add-On. Yeah I know, making APIs work in spreadsheets has been done for a while, via Google Spreadsheets and Excel Spreadsheets, but nobody has standardized it like Blockspring just did. So let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the implementation. I went to the Google Chrome App Store, and downloaded the add-on. &nbsp; &nbsp; Then using a new spreadsheet, I click on add-ons &gt; Blockspring, and logged...[<a href="/2015/04/02/blockspring-shifts-the-api-client-conversation-with-their-google-spreadsheet-api-addon/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was introduced to StreamData.io the other day, by Gabriel Dillon (@gjdillon) of Readme.io. StreamData.io provides a caching, and push layer for apps to take advantage of, that can be deploy on top of existing APIs. I haven&rsquo;t implemented StreamData.io yet, I am still evaluating it, and at first glance it looks like an interesting new real-time layer, that you can use on top of APIs, to improve application performance and user experience.
I&rsquo;m going to add StreamData.io to my real-time research right now, however once I start playing with I may add as an API deployment resource as well. I have some verification to do, but I&rsquo;d love to test out the potential for StreamData.io to deliver cache and sync layer for common APIs, doing for APIs, what StreamData.io is doing for apps&mdash;delivering on one of my ongoing ideas for caching high use APIs.
When I was working in Washington DC, I had the pleasure of working during the federal government shutdown, where I wrote a piece asking if we can depend on our federal government APIs, and talked about caching APIs with AWS cloud formations, or Open Shift. My objective is to ensure there redundant sources for APIs coming out of government, providing developers with a more stable solution, they can depend on. I even added this thinking into the early APIs.json design, allowing you to define cached indexes of APIs.
I&rsquo;ve added StreamData.io to my real-time research, and I&rsquo;ll get in there and play with more, as I have the time. Then I&rsquo;ll get a better understanding of what you can do with the API caching and syncing, seeing if it is possible to deliver this layer for my APIs as well as my apps&mdash;something that is even more appealing in this age of Docker containers. #FoodForThought

			<p>I was reading Are You Or Your Customers Leaking Your API Keys? from Daryl Miller (@darrel_miller) the other day, which spurred me to float up a story in my Evernote, from a couple months back. My thoughts are only related to Daryll&rsquo;s because it is about API keys, and their accessibility&mdash;the similarities stop there. Daryl is talking about a very different layer of key management, which we should all be thinking deeply about. API key management is an API provider issue, as much as it is an API consumer issue. As an API provider I need to have an easy way to manage all the keys I provide to developers. As an API consumer, I need to have an easy to manage all the API keys I get across the API providers that I depend on. In short, key management isn&rsquo;t easy, and there are no clear solutions that serve both ends of the key management coin. As an API provider, I use 3Scale API Infrastructure to manage my API keys. Using my API portal, developers can sign up for their own accounts, manage their apps, and the keys that are issued. 3Scale does all the heavy lifting for me, all I have to do is manage my API service composition, and keep an eye on dev usage, as well as keep an eye on my own app usage. I use all my own APIs for my apps too! Sometimes my apps are the bad actors, it not always the developers who abuse API access.&nbsp; As an API consumer, I&rsquo;m working hard to pull my API key world together, using a home brew format I&rsquo;m calling simple api-keys. I&rsquo;m am using Github for all of my API and microservice related projects, so I&rsquo;m beginning to centralize how I store keys, and how I manage them across all my apps.

			<p>This post is extracted from a deep dive I've been doing into the Swagger ecosystem, as part of regular conversations I have been having with Tony Tam (@fehguy), trying to understand how we can better tell stories about Swagger. I've been tuned into things for a while now around the Swagger community, and there is a lot going on, but from the outside, some of this can be hard to see. Seeking a better understand what is the Swagger community, I wanted to take a walk through the sites, forum, and Github repositories. First let&rsquo;s start with the basics, what is Swagger? Merriam Webster defines Swaggers as: : to walk in a very confident way : to walk with a swagger. ;-) Seriously though, Swagger is a machine readable format (either JSON or YAML), for describing an API, providing a description of API operations, in a way that other applications can read, and understand. Even though Swagger is machine readable, and designed for other applications, it has also become a language for humans to describe and collaborate, around a shared, quantifiable, vision of what an API can do, throughout all stages of the API life cycle.&nbsp; If you want to learn about Swagger yourself, you can tune into these channels to learn more: Website Twitter Github Google Group My goal with this post is evolve my understanding and awareness of what Swagger is, and hopefully along the way I can help increase yours as well. In my experience, many people have a very distorted, and limited understanding of what Swagger is, and I&rsquo;d like to take some time to evolve that. When I started this research, my objective was to help Tony deliver a new website, and on-boarding materials for Swagger, assisting people of all skill levels in finding all things Swagger.

			<p><em>30 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I've been tracking on the potential for voice APIs since Siri was first announced, a topic that often meant telephony like from Twilio, or audio transcription from Popup Archive and Clarify. When I close my eyes and think about the the future of APIs and voice enablement, it is more akin to the Siri example, where the digital world is (supposedly) just a voice command away.
Imagine making all your employee directory, company calendar, or product catalog available via voice commands. How do you do this? You do it with APIs, and a voice enablement platform in-between the application developers, and the available API resources. Much like all other voice enablement, I think we have a huge amount of work to get anywhere close to the pictures we all have in our head, when if comes to voice enablement.
It is my mission to find these signs across the API landscape, and keep an eye on what they are doing. One platform that is now open for beta is Amazon Echo. Amazon says, "Echo is designed around your voice. It's always on&mdash;just ask for information, music, news, weather, and more.&rdquo; APIs are how we will deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of this equation. The difference between Apple Siri, and Amazon Echo at this point, is Amazon will let you (API providers) help deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of Amazon Echo discovery equation.
I&rsquo;m signing up for the beta, and if I get access, I will share more stories. I encourage you to sign up as well, and if you have any work your doing with Amazon Echo, or know of other API driven voice-enablement platforms I should be paying attention to, let me know.

			<p><em>28 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am evolving my own personal microservices definition, something that is constantly changing, as I work on my infrastructure, read other people&rsquo;s own definitions (no shortage these lately), and continuing having conversations with smart folks across the space. I had the pleasure of having Mike Amundsen over the other night for dinner, and after having some interesting discussions about community, and potential micro services design, I&rsquo;m adding a couple of elements to my microservice definition list.
In my last post&nbsp;on this, I listed seven criteria I congress as part of my micro services definition:

minimal surface
minimal on disk
minimal compute
minimal message
minimal network
minimal time to rebuild
minimal time to throw away

I wanted to add two elements to my list, considering some of the other elements I&rsquo;ve noticed at play when it comes to API bloat:

minimal ownership
minimal dependencies

Minimal owners is a pretty easy one for me, as I&rsquo;m the owner of all my microservices&mdash;the buck always stops with me. However, It is a good reminder to make sure all of my services have a vCard applied to their APIs.son file index. It is important to easily known who is responsible for any public or private API, and with APIs.son and Swagger, this is easy to do.
When it comes to minimal dependencies, this gets a little tougher for me. My world isn&rsquo;t too bad, because my systems are small, and I&rsquo;ve been the only developer.  The down side is I&rsquo;ve been the only developer, and I&rsquo;ve bee lazy about how many dependencies an API might have, and also been fairly sloppy about how I integrate with 3rd party APIs. Adding this item to my list will help me keep an eye on how I establish dependencies between services, keeping them minimal, and well documented.
That is it, I just wanted to add ownership and dependencies to my list of considerations&mdash;I just like making a production out of everything.

			<p><em>27 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
There are many areas I track on as part of my research. Things that do not show up on my weekly API.Reports, or in my analysis on API Evangelist. One of these is the area of drones. I&rsquo;m fascinated by this potential area in the area of Internet of Things, but until now it was more of a side note, or one possible path for APIs and the Internet of Things.
Amongst the numerous drone stories I curate, I'm seeing more shift in the space towards a developer focus. It isn't just about the drone itself, its about customizing, developing and using the drone as a platform. One recent story I noticed was 3D Robotics (3DR), one of North America's largest consumer drone manufacturer, announcing the release of a new DroneKit, which includes an API for drone app development.
DroneKit has a web API defined using Swagger, which is the first Drone API I have actually added to my system. I am sure there are more out there, and now that I&rsquo;m tracking on closer, I'm sure I'll find them. The number of drone related stories that flow through my feeds is getting pretty out of control, and I'm thinking the space needs some standard approaches to APIs identified, to help develop better drone solutions, but also potentially inject some transparency into this growing layer of IoT.
 

Now that I have an API blueprint for a drone API, in Swagger too! ;-) I will be able to start thinking about what some of the API patterns for drones might look like, and what some of the common building blocks might be for managing the technical, but also business, and political side of drone operation. I&rsquo;m thinking that when it comes to drone operations, APIs might not just be a nice to have, they might be something that becomes mandatory in trying to bring this fast growing, not well defined space, under some control.

			<p><em>27 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>There was a quick post from Mashable the other day about a conversation with WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton, called WhatsApp cofounder: Sorry developers, no API for you. Its pretty common argument you hear from business leaders, regarding why they won&rsquo;t open up APIs. It has been a while since I railed on this line of thinking, so I am taking the opportunity to share why this is such an un-informed, short-sighted view of APIs. I wasn&rsquo;t at the conference, so I a completely dependent on Mashable for this, but apparently someone in the audience asked: "We have done a lot of transactional messaging using traditional email and SMS, and we've recently moved into the international market," the engineer explained to the audience, who clapped and hollered. "We're desperate to communicate with our members where WhatsApp would be a wonderful platform. We're good developers." Acton stated that they had no current plans to, adding: "We don't want to inundate users with messages they don't want," Acton explained of the choice. "I am very empathetic to your cause. I receive emails on a regular basis from people who want to run their business or want to run something using WhatsApp as the backbone for communication, but we're balancing that with the user experience." Before I point out how narrow this thinking, let&rsquo;s focused on why I use the word un-informed to describe this perspective. Let&rsquo;s say the motivation for not opening up an API at WhatsApp is purely about UX, let&rsquo;s explore some of the options on the table, for API providers to strike the balance they are looking for in this area. API Management Service Composition With modern API management services, you have a critical concept called "service composition", where you the API provider, can carve up different levels of access to valuable API resources, deciding exactly who has access to what. API do not equal firehose to the public, where anyone can build whatever they...[<a href="/2015/03/27/whatsapps-reason-for-not-opening-up-api-is-just-not-informed-and-shortsighted/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>When I started API Evangelist, I was all about the Business of APIs, something I still focus on, but increasingly over the last couple years I am focusing more on what I call the politics of APIs. In my opinion, the politics of APIs can be anything from terms of service and privacy policies, to rate limits, pricing, and security, all the way up to court cases, patents, and government regulation. Today I want to focus on the very top of that spectrum&mdash;government regulation. The government isn't just getting into the API game, by deploying their own APIs, they are going to also increasingly be getting more involved with private sector APIs. In my weekly monitoring I'm seeing more chatter across several industries, like the UK treasury getting involved in banking API standards, and a push in the healthcare industry for more interoperability via APIs--just to highlight two recent stories. This isn&rsquo;t anything new, governments been defining API standards and pitching them to industries for a while now. I personally have been involved in healthcare and energy related standards, as part of Blue Button and Green Button data services. In coming years, what is going to increase, is the number of industries that the government is helping define standard, as well as beginning to get a little more heavy handed about mandating APIs as part of the regulatory process.. Personally I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of government regulation, something I feel gets abused on both sides of the tracks, but I understand it is a necessary actor when it comes to balance in markets. To help address some of the abuse that occurs, I think APIs could significantly help bring much needed transparency, and self-service access to the process, for both the public and private sector. I feel the conversation in coming years will move beyond the government just defining industry API standards, but also pushing for real-time interoperability, and execution by companies who operate...[<a href="/2015/03/27/politics-of-apis-talk-of-api-driven-regulation-is-increasing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>After reflecting on API management and the Apigee IPO, I&rsquo;m thinking deeper on how the API space has come to be a &ldquo;thing". To kick off this story, you have to start with the API itself, something very abstract, hard to see, let alone convey to the average person. A single API is difficult to quantify, let alone an entire sector, or the companies rising up to service this perceived sector&mdash;think of the argument from early API management service providers like Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee had to make to their VCs. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the API space has always been a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to me, but along the road from 2010-2015, there has been plenty times, where I question the way things are. I have to give it to Mashery, they saw it early on, then 3Scale and Apigee joined in, and in 2015 we have a real industry, with 35 API management service providers, in addition to the expanding number of service providers catering to API design, deployment, management, discovery, integration, and other evolving layers of the API lifecycle. In 2015, I feel like the API sector is a real thing. Not because 3Scale is still growing, Mashery was acquired by Intel, Apigee is IPOing, or that there is over 35 API management service providers, including a number of open source solutions. The API sector is a real thing because there are many other companies, in many supporting area who have emerged, and the overall awareness around the potential of API, by business leaders has grown significantly. How did this happen? It happened because people were telling the story of APIs, whether it was marketing for their products services, or stories on ProgrammableWeb and API Evangelist&mdash;working in concert to create an industry (something). Within the same thought, I try to grasp how it was that I created API Evangelist. There sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t any strategy to do it. Early on I had a...[<a href="/2015/03/27/how-do-you-make-something-something-the-api-edition/">Read More</a>]</p>
