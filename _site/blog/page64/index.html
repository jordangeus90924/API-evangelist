        <a title="Atmosphere" href="http://atmosphere.soa.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/atmosphere-api-management.png" alt="" align="right" /></a><a title="SOA Software" href="soa.com">SOA Software</a> just launched a new API management platform called, <a title="Atmosphere" href="http://atmosphere.soa.com/">Atmosphere</a>.
<p></p>Atmosphere provides a secure, platform that companies can deploy to manage their APIs for either a private or public developer community.
<p></p>The Atmosphere platform gives API providers a management interface to define APIs using a wide range of messaging types and formats including REST/XML, REST/JSON and SOAP. The platform also provides paging and caching mechanisms to improve app performance.
<p></p>Atmosphere also provides security capabilities that allow API providers to control and monitor app's usage of the APIs. While also protecting internal applications from overload, as well as provide customers with service-level guarantee through QoS management for SLAs and quotas.
<p></p>These tools for monitoring and managing consumer contracts and traffic can also be applied to enable monetization of APIs.
<p></p>The Atmosphere API Management can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud, or a combination of the two. Providing the flexibility and scalability needed by many providers.
<p></p>The <a title="Atmosphere API Management platoform" href="http://atmosphere.soa.com/">Atmosphere API Management platform</a> is one of the newest players in the API management space, a growing playing field of providers targeting the enterprise.

The new <a title="YouTube Twitter API Channel" href="http://www.youtube.com/twitterapi/">YouTube Twitter API channel</a> will contain interviews, tutorials and other video content that is produced in support of the <a title="Twitter API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-detail.php?API_ID=1831">Twitter API</a>.<p></p>
Its a great idea.  Perfect way to organize videos and presentations in a central location, as they are produced.  Then users can come back at anytime and learn.<p></p>
A YouTube channel for an API community could also be a great way to build community, by soliciting feedback on what type of content users want to see, or even accept submissions from your developers.<p></p>
I added a <a title="Youtube channel to my list of innovative building blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=157">YouTube channel</a> to my list of <a title="building blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks</a> that API owners are using.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/14/the-usa-today-api-matures/">The USA Today API Matures</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="USA Today API" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://www.editorsweblog.org/usatoday.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>Back when I first started doing API reviews on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I did a review of <a title="USA Todays first release of their API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/27/usa-today-api-review/">USA Today's API</a>.<p></p>
At first I almost didn't post the review.  It was such a simple API, with nothing innovative to speak of.  It just didn't seem worth covering.<p></p>
When they first launched the <a title="USA Today API" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today API</a>, it provided services for <a title="best-selling books" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/bestselling_books">best-selling books</a>, and <a title="Sports Salaries" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/salaries">sports salaries</a>.  It wasn't very exciting.<p></p>
Fastword 10 months, and their API is looking much more robust.  Now they also offer <a title="Articles" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/articles">Articles</a>, <a title="Book Reviews" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/book_reviews">Book Reviews</a>, <a title="Breaking News" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/Breaking_News">Breaking News</a>, <a title="Movie Reviews" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/movie_reviews">Movie Reviews</a>, <a title="Music Reviews" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/music_reviews">Music Reviews</a>, and <a title="Snapshots" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/snapshots">Snapshots</a>.<p></p>
Most recently, USA Today also added<a title="US Census Data" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/Census">US census data</a> to their API offerings.<p></p>
Looking back it was easy for me to criticize the big media company for releasing such a simple API, but in reality they are doing what I feel everyond should do, start simple.<p></p>
USA Today looks like they are getting their footing with packaging up data sets and making available via their API.  This data is probably very usable by their internal teams as well as makes USA Today a potential integration partner with other applications.<p></p>
I think other news and media organizations can learn a lot by following in USA Todays footsteps, and deploy very simple APIs, learn, and slowly tackle more as you find the right approach to your API community.<p></p>
Also, I'm sure USA Today was able to tackle so successfully with the help of <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>.

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/evolution-of-distribution/IMG_0504.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Many API owners depend on their APIs for identifying new types of business models, turning their API ecosystems into research &amp; development platforms.
<p></p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/edwinaoki">Edwin Aoki</a> of Paypal and Ebay APIs also feels they can also be used by human resources(HR), to nurture and identify new developer talent. At the <a title="Mashery Evolution of Distribution" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/02/mashery-evolution-of-distribution/">Mashery Evolution of Distribution</a> event, Aoki mentioned how Ebay and Paypal use their API ecosystem for talent acquisition.
<p></p>If you think about it, your API provides a fertile ground for developer to learn about your APIs, how to code with them, and understand your companies way of doing business.
<p></p>Hopefully within your API area there are ways for developers to excel and showcase their work. Submitting code samples, applications and forum participation all give them an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/4-developers.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />And If your company, eats your own dog food and uses your APIs internally, hiring developers from your API community can provide immediate benefit to internal projects.
<p></p>Beyond internal projects, developers can also be identified and used for partner projects. Identifying rockstar developers you feel comfortable referring to your partners, is another great use of your API community.
<p></p>Another place to look for talent, is at Hackathons. Hackathons can also be fertile ground for identifying fresh new developer talent. It is place to watch developers in action, showing their skills in real-time, and demonstrate how well they work with other people.
<p></p>An API provides many ways to attract, groom, and identify talent for your company. Have you ever hired someone from your API community?

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hunch/hunch-logo.png" alt="" align="right" />Having a <a title="privacy policy on your API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=165">privacy policy on your API</a> is an important part of making it clear to developers and end-users, where your company stands in regard to their data and personal privacy.<p></p>
Just having a privacy policy is not enough, make sure it truly reflects your companies values, whats important to your users, and is in line with how you deploy your technology.<p></p>
One shining example of this in the API space, is <a title="Hunch" href="http://hunch.com/">Hunch</a>.  Hunch's provides a  'Taste Graph' of the entire web, providing information on what people like;  anything, from books to electronic gadgets to fashion or vacation spots.<p></p>
Hunch is combining algorithmic machine learning with user-curated content, with the goal of providing better recommendations for everyone.  The information they provide through their web application and API, is extremely valuable, as well as potentially very private.<p></p>
<a title="Hunch's API Privacy Policy" href="http://hunch.com/developers/v1/docs/privacy/">Hunch's API privacy policy</a> articulates their position very clearly:
<blockquote><em>Hunch takes our users' privacy very seriously. When using the API, Hunch returns predictions for users within the Taste Graph. Certain API calls can be made for any user, while other calls require the user to Hunch Connect before predictions will be returned. Our guiding principle for this distinction is whether the user's likes or facts about themselves are already made public on the internet.</em></blockquote>
Obviously the privacy of their users is very important, and they back this up by using <a title="OAuth" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=184">OAuth</a> as it is meant to be used.  Giving users granular level control over who has access to their sensitive data,  while still providing other, non-sensitive, rich data without authentication.<p></p>
Hunch has a clear vision of API and data privacy in a space, where there is a lot of potential for abuse.  An example that many other API providers should follow.<p></p>
Also make sure and check out the <a title="privacy policy on their main site" href="http://hunch.com/info/privacy-policy/">privacy policy for their main site</a>, they really lay it out honestly, and in plain english. I wish more technology providers would approach privacy this way.<p></p>
<strong>Update: </strong> From my girl <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a> @ <a title="RWW" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com">RWW</a>: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/chris_dixon_hunch_taste_graphs_the_link_between_le.php">Dixon made it clear that despite Hunch's ability to predict users' tastes that the company would never sell that data. "We have never made a data deal," said Dixon. Furthermore, people can only get predictive information about themselve</a>s.

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2011</span>
        <a href="http://appstores.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/Appstores.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>When I review a new API, I take a look at the technology they provide, but I tend to focus on the business of their API.<p></p>
One area I look at, is what tools they use to deliver the <a title="building blocks that make of their API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks that make up their API</a>.  Did they build it themselves?   Did they use <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a> or <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a>?  Are they using other open-source tools or a software as a service (SaaS) provider?<p></p>
I'm always on the look out for new open-source tools or services providers that can be leveraged for APIs in this way.  My goal is to find an open-source solution or service provider for <a title="each one of the building blocks i have defined" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">each one of the building blocks I have defined</a>.  Some examples are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="API documentation with SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/api-documentation/">API documentation with SDK Bridge</a></li>
	<li><a title="API forums with Get Satisfaction" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/30/api-forums-using-get-satisfaction/">API forums with Get Satisfaction</a></li>
	<li><a title="Application Showcase with AppStores.com" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/08/a-white-label-api-appstore-platform/">Application Showcase with AppStores.com</a></li>
</ul>
I like to have an open-source tool available for each building block, but having a solid company that can deliver specialized services for a API, and have them up and running instantly is even better.<p></p>
Some characteristics I look for in a service provider are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Self-service </strong>- Instant registration and activation of services.</li>
	<li><strong>Branding</strong> - The ability to brand and make look like your API area.</li>
	<li><strong>Tiered Pricing </strong>- A pay as you go model allowing small companies to try out first, then grow as needed.</li>
	<li><strong>DNS</strong> - Ability to point subdomain at service, to keep with a single company domain.</li>
	<li><strong>Support</strong> - Quality support from self-service forum to someone you can talk to.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus</strong> - Delivering a high quality service ina  single area, and not trying to be everything to everyone.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Portability</strong> - The ability to take <strong>ALL</strong> of your data with you when you are ready to leave is critical.</li>
</ul>
These are just a few of the key strengths I look for when finding <a title="API Tool" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/category/tools/">API tool</a> and <a title="service providers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/category/services/">service providers</a>.<p></p>
As an example, take a look at <a title="AppStores.com" href="http://appstores.com/">AppStores.com</a>, they have almost everything I look for in a <a title="building block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building block</a> service provider.  They are still working on the self-service and tiered pricing aspects, but its at least on their roadmap.<p></p>
Do you have any open-source tools or software as a service providers that you use to deliver your API?

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/12/api-proxies-connectors-and-addons/">API Proxies, Connectors, and Add-Ons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2011</span>
        I'm working through some 100K views of the API service provider arena, and trying to evolve my perspectives of <a title="Whats Next for APIs" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/whats-next-for-apis/">Whats Next for APIs</a>.<p></p>
This is all a work in progress, so I'm publishing here on <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://www.kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> instead of on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>.<p></p>
I wrote the other day about the <a title="Battle for Your API Proxy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/11/the-battle-for-your-api-proxy/">Battle for Your API Proxy</a> between the API service providers.<p></p>
This included a tier of "proxy" API service providers that run all your APIs through proxy before hitting your API.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/proxy-connector/APIProxy.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /><p></p>
Next there are the group of "connector" API service providers that provide you with a connector to put in your API and provide the same services that a proxy would.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/proxy-connector/APIConnector.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /><p></p>
Based upon what I'm seeing with Mashape and other indicators, I tried to show the playing field in a slightly different, and evolved way.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/proxy-connector/Proxy-PerfectWorld.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /><p></p>
My vision of the future of APIs involves several key areas of evolution. These are based upon movements I'm already seeing, and where I'd like to see things go.<p></p>
In this vision API service providers don't just provide proxy, connector, management, developer area tools, and API marketplaces. They also provide actual API frameworks for APIs like Mashape provides, as well industry wide developer opportunities.<p></p>
Developers can build code against a single API, or multiple APIs, they can build tools for API owners to deploy in their own management, developer areas as well as within the "proxy" or "connector" layer too. Service providers will provide developers with distribution opportunities to other marketplaces and API owners.<p></p>
API Owners will not be locked into a single API service provider for their API, Management, Proxy, Connector, Developer or Marketplace needs. They will have a buffet of add-ons they can choose from to enhance every aspect of their API ecosystem.<p></p>
One key difference is that API owners can choose to proxy or connect their API, or both if necessary for different services.<p></p>
This model provide sadd-ons at every layer of the API ecosystem. If a developer builds a set of tools for video streaming, it can be deployed at the proxy / connector, management, API, and developers area. Billing for a video API might look radically different then billing for a print API.<p></p>
This will provide the type of innovation that is needed at this stage of the game. A nice selection of tools for API owners to choose from, with service provider and developers making money.<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Jun 2011</span>
        Every Web API is designed to receive requests from and respond to the outside world.<p></p>
Every day an API can receive thousands or potentially millions of calls. Before the API can process these requests and returns a response, it has to potentially tackle a huge laundry list of functionalities:
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/traffic-lights.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Identity / Authentication</li>
	<li>Traffic Controls</li>
	<li>Rate Limiting</li>
	<li>Performance</li>
	<li>Security</li>
	<li>Scalability</li>
	<li>Filtering</li>
	<li>Encryption</li>
	<li>Logging</li>
</ul>
Once all these items are handled, then the API can do what it is designed to do -- process its payload and return a response.<p></p>
Many API owners tackle all these layers of the API themselves. But there are also several service providers out their looking to do this for them.<p></p>
The first group of API service providers in this area use what I call the Proxy Flow Through, and this includes <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a> and <a href="http://www.apigee.com/">Apigee</a>.  Mashery and Apigee deliver these service by routing all calls to an API through their proxy.   Each call actually is made to <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a> and <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, then they route the request to the actual API for a response.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ProxyFlowThrough.png" alt="" width="500" align="center " /><p></p>
The second group of API service providers in this area, use what I call the Proxy Connector, and this includes <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/04/mashape-api-service-provider/">Mashape</a>.  <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and <a href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> deliver these services by providing a connector your API can use to communicate with the proxy during each call.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ProxyConnector.png" alt="" width="500" align="center " /><p></p>
<a href="http://www.apigee.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/apigee-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>All of these service providers end up delivering a similar set of services.  This proxy, whether flow through or connector tackle the needs listed above, but then also provide much needed data on API operations.  Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale provide you with tools for monitoring and analyzing this operational data.<p></p>
There is a lot at stake here.  The next wave of Internet growth will pass through these proxies. More API owners are turning to these providers to deliver this layer, where all usage of the API from web apps, mobile apps, and other devices developed internally, by partners and the public will pass through these proxies.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.mashery.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Mashery-Logo.gif" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>These proxies are becoming brokers in the API economy.   Each service provider is competing, for the ability to proxy your web API and be your broker in this new economy.<p></p>
Mashery, Apigee, and 3Scale all provide some very robust services via their proxy, Apigee even offers their proxy technology as an on-premise appliance.<p></p>
Newcomer Mashape does not provide a full suite of services via their proxy, like the others, but Mashape is taking a different approach, by introducing an add-on layer within their proxy.   There are only two add-ons available (billing, rate limit) currently, but this concept opens up an entirely new type of marketplace for the entire API industry, not just a single API.  Developers can now build specialized tools to sell, and push forward whats possible within a proxy.  This proxy add-on layer also has potential for allowing a more a la carte set of services available to API owners.<a href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/3Scale-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><p></p>
The demand for API proxies is growing, and each service provider is pushing the definition of what it means to proxy your API. Mashery, Apigee, 3Scale, Mashape and others are working hard to define the space, push it forward, while also winning market-share.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.mashape.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>One might compare this playing field to the competition between database service providers of the last two decades, where companies like Microsoft and Oracle battled it out for market share. There are many differences for sure, but with the amount of information and value running through APIs, the parallels to database choices are there -- except I still don't see the MySQL of API proxies as of yet.

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2011</span>
        <a href="http://seevl.net/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seevl_logo1.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>I was having a beer with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/terraces">Dr. Alexandre Passant</a> of <a href="http://seevl.net/">Seevl</a> the other day, we were talking about music, APIs and the <a href="http://developers.seevl.net/">Seevl API</a>.
<p></p>A while back I wrote a piece about Seevl titled, <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/27/with-seevl-music-discovery-the-website-is-the-api/">With Seevl Music Discovery, the Website is the API</a>. When building the Seevl API, instead of providing a separate API to access information, Seevl relies on content negotiation principles to deliver alternative representations of web pages.
<p></p>As I was talking with Passant, I kept thinking about how RESTful APIs are often deployed separately from the web site or application. Both are using HTTP, and often deliver the same information, they are just intended for two different audiences and potential uses.
<p></p>This is not a new idea. Flickr delivered the Flickr API this way in the early days, and web applications like <a title="Tumblr" href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> offer their <a title="API" href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api">API</a> and application side by side.
<p></p>You can visit my Tumblr blog at: <a title="http://kinlane.tumblr.com/" href="http://kinlane.tumblr.com/">http://kinlane.tumblr.com/</a>
<p></p>Simple add /api/read to the same URL: <a title="http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/" href="http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/">http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/</a>
<p></p>And you you get back an XML representation of my Tumblr blog.
<p></p>Add /JSON to that URL: <a href="http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/json">http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/json</a>
<p></p>And you get back a JSON representation of my Tumblr blog.
<div>
     <p></p>In most cases, it does not makes sense for a web site or application and its RESTful API to be separated, for some reason many developers still see them as two completely separate things.
     <p></p>In my opinion, if the HTML, XML, and JSON representations of information are deployed side by side. And users know they can simple adjust the URL to get other formats, the type of users that hack on, embed, and redistribute information from APIs will grow beyond the developer community.
     <p></p>

        <a href="https://posterous.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/posterous/posterous-logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a>In a <a title="single announcement yesterday" href="http://technology.posterous.com/announcing-a-new-api-for-developers-to-plug-i">single announcement yesterday</a>, the blogging service <a title="Posterous" href="https://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> went from Software as a Service (SaaS) to Platform as a Service (PaaS), with the introduction of a full set of APIs.
<p></p>The new set of RESTful APIs give developers access to methods and actions that were formerly available only to the core Posterous engineering team including the ability to create new sites, manage users, posts, comments, custom themes and other data for those sites.
<p></p>Beyond just exposing the core posterous technology via as a simple set of RESTful APIs, Posterous has delivered their API documentation as an interactive set of tools allowing developers to see every available method, interface with these methods and experiment bydynamicallychanging the paramaters and inspecting responses, all within the browser.<a href="http://posterous.com/api"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/posterous/Posterous_API_Reference.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p></p>Posterous has merged the concept of <a title="API documentation" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=120">API documentation</a> and <a title="API Explorer" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=209">API explorer</a> into a single set of interactive developer documentation. This steps up the game, in that not only should your documentation be simple and complete, but also functional.
<p></p>The new <a title="Posterous APIs" href="http://posterous.com/api">Posterous APIs</a> have evolved Posterous from a service where users can come and setup blogs, to a platform that companies can use as a backbone for their own blog and site managment systems.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/lessons-in-api-deployment-from-netflix/">Lessons in API Deployment From Netflix</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="Netflix API" href="http://www.netflix.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/netflix_logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a> I've heard this story several times now, but I think its a story worth telling over and over.<p></p>
It is the story of the <a title="Netflix API" href="http://developer.netflix.com/">Netflix API</a> and the lessons they learned along the way.  Not every API owner will be operating at the scale of Netflix, but the lessons are universal.<p></p>
It all started when Netflix set out to build an API, where the original charter was:
<blockquote><em>Expose Netflix metadata and services to the public developer community to "let 1,000 flowers bloom".  That community will build rich and exciting new tools and services to improve the value of Netflix to our customers.</em></blockquote>
The concept of 1,000 flowers refers to the public community Netflix was targeting with the API, where ideas and applications would flower from each developer.<p></p>
Fast forward a couple years, and the API has been successful, with growth looking something like this:
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/netflix/growth-of-netflix-api.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" />
However the innovation did not come from where the original charter identified.  The API delivered the greatest value from these groups (in order of importance):
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Internal Engineering Teams
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Netflix Product Owners</li>
	<li>Netflix Developers</li>

Even with over 18K public developers using the API, it accounts for less than .5% of the traffic to the API.  With internal teams and external device manufacturers accounting for the largest consumption.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/netflix/netflix-api-usage-by-audience.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" />
With these lessons in mind, the new charter for the Netflix API goes something like this:
<blockquote><em>Build and maintain an infinitely scalable data distribution pipeline for getting metadata and services from internal Netflix systems to streaming client apps on all platforms in the format and / or deliver method that is most optimal for each app and platform.</em></blockquote>
And moving forward, any future architecture will focus on supporting the key target audience first with a trickle down of features to the other audience segments.<p></p>
Key lessons you can take away from the Netflix API deployment:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Understand the target audience of your API</li>
	<li>Design for your most critical audiences first</li>
	<li>Internalize the API as part of your companies engineering DNA</li>
	<li>if you build a public API, make sure and help them bloom</li>
</ul>
Its easy to get caught up in the <a title="Hype and buzz around a public API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">hype and buzz around having a public API</a>, where you should be focusing on consuming your API internally, then sharing that value with key partners, and then when ready, take what you've learned and try growing thousands of flowers.

        <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />The <a title="Dwolla" href="https://www.dwolla.com">Dwolla payment service</a> just <a title="launched a new payment network called Grid" href="http://www.dwolla.org/blog/grid-is-here-cash-just-got-more-secure-than-plastic/">launched a new payment API called Grid</a>. Before you can understand grid, you need to understand Dwolla'sphilosophyon payments.
<p></p>Every time you want to do seemingly simple things, like buy a coffee, pay for lunch, or buy gas, current providers are requiring you hand over your name, credit card number, and expiration date, leaving trail of personal and financial data behind you.
<p></p>With an opportunity to start fresh, Dwolla wanted to change this, and thats what they are doing with Grid.
<p></p>Grid provides third party developers tools to create a seamless in-app purchasing experience with no more credit card numbers. Creating a new kind of payment network, one that doesn't leave behind personal information.
<p></p><strong>Why is this huge for consumers?</strong>
<p></p>This new network puts consumers, not networks, in control of who can access, their payment information, allowing users to revoke and modify who can access their payment network.
<p></p><strong>Why this is huge for merchants?</strong>
<p></p>Merchants can get paid online without the recurring costs associated with other networks, and accept payments with Dwolla's regular merchant account and pay no special account fees.
<p></p><strong>Why this is huge for developers?</strong>
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/internet-payment-transactions.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />For the first time ever, developers will have access to a payment network to innovate and build on top of, that removes a lot of liability that is typically associated with credit card networks.
<p></p>I tend to only focus on stories around innovative approaches to the business of APIs, which usually means how an API is delivered. Another area that I enjoy covering is how businesses are using APIs to change entire industries. Dwolla fits this profile.
<p></p>Dwolla is taking on an industry that is extremely complex, full of holes and was not build with the Internet in mind. Providing a simple web interface, an API, and flat pricing model, they are reinventing how we do payments from the ground up.
<p></p>Dwolla provides a REST and SOAP API, and employ OAuth for authentication. You can find more about their API in their <a title="developers area" href="https://www.dwolla.com/dev/">developers area</a>.
<p></p>Dwolla is free for anyone to use, and charges a flat .25 per transaction. Thats it.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apple/iCloud-Steel.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /><a title="iCloud" href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a> storage APIs allow IOS application developers to store documents and other data to a central location so userscan view or edit from any device without having to sync or transfer files.
<p></p>There are two ways that applications can take advantage of iCloud storage:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Document Storage - Enabling storage and sharing of information in document form.
     </li>
     <li>Key-Value Data Storage - Enabling storage and sharing small amounts of data.
     </li>
</ul>Most applications will use iCloud document storage to share documents, which is a feature that users think of when they think of cloud storage. Users care about whether photos, videos, and documents are accessible across devices while the key-value data store is not something a user would never see.
<p></p>Key-value storage will be used for small amounts of data such as storing application state, settings, and other important information that delivers a better user experience. Although not as apparent to the end-user, key-value storage will be just as important as document storage.
<p></p><img class="aligncenter c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apple/iCloud-Storage-APIs.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" />
<p></p>All iCloud storage is managed centrally by the iCloud service, which handles coordination of documents and key-value stores. The iCloud service handles storage searches, change notifications, version control, conflicts, and security for applications that integrate with a user's iCloud storage account.
<p></p>Neither document storage or key-value storage in the cloud are anything new. But when it is implemented as part of the IOS platform, it becomes much bigger. Apple is solving everyday problems users face when using their smart phones, by storing data centrally in the cloud.
<p></p>ICloud APIs will enable developers to build rich applications on the IOS platform, and continue to grow IOS market share.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/Appstores.png" alt="" align="right" />The goal of any API evangelist is to encourage its community to build mobile and web applications around their API.
<p></p>When you and your community have several web apps, mobile apps, plugins or other tools you are proud of, showcase them.
<p></p>Whether you call it a showcase, directory, gallery or store...having an area that highlights the applications built upon your API is critical to continued API adoption and success.
<p></p>Application showcases do several things:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/SimpleGeo-app-showcase.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">

        <span class="post-date">07 Jun 2011</span>
        Google Calendar has a <a title="new feature for managing appointment slots" href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=190998">new feature for managing "Appointment Slots"</a>. These appointment slots are a great way to let others know preferred times when you are available.<p></p>
Open office hours are becoming a common way for API providers to communicate times when developers can connect with someone in person or online via chat for support. Google Calendar appointment slots area great way to manage API office hours.<p></p>
<strong>Creating API Office Hours
</strong>To get started, set up blocks of time you'd like to offer as API hours. Simply click anywhere on your calendar and then on "appointment slots. From there, create a single block of time or automatically split a larger block of time into smaller appointment slots if applies.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-1.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
<strong>Publishing API Office Hours</strong>
Every Google Calendar has its own personal appointments sign up page; you can embed it on your website or give the URL directly to registered API developers. You can find the URL for your appointment page at the top of the set-up page, which you can access via the edit details link.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-4.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
<strong>Signing Up for API Hours</strong>
When someone visits your sign up page, their calendar is overlaid for convenience and they can sign up directly for any available appointment slot.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-2.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
When they sign up, Google Calendar conveniently creates a new shared event on both of your calendars.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-3.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
Making yourself available to developers is important.  API office hours can be used for premium support, limited time support, or just open time to share a pint with your developers and other people in the industry.

     iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for all music, photos, books, documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.
</p>
<p>
     Although this line of thought is nothing new, with Apple going all in…it means the cloud has gone mainstream.
</p>
<p>
     Get ready for some major growth in the cloud as Apple pushes it further, and other existing cloud providers try to compete.

Kandaswamy offered some practical advice for retail companies that are deciding how and where to start with their API deployments.  His suggestions included the following areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Product APIs</strong>- Make your product catalog available via your API is fundamental.</li>
	<li><strong>Store APIs </strong>- Give local store information including location and product availability is powerful.</li>
	<li><strong>Review APIs </strong>- Deliver practical product reviews in a usable way to help consumer make purchasing decisions.</li>
	<li><strong>Commerce APIs</strong> - Provide seamless purchasing and product fulfillment through at-home delivery, in-store pick-up, partner e-commerce sites, and web-based applications.</li>
</ul>
Those four areas just make sense, as they seamlessly bridge the physical retail and online retail consumer experience and extend the Best Buy brand in entirely new ways.  While there may be other innovative ways that retailers can utilize APIs, these are a great place to start.

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Daniel Jacobsen" href="http://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">Daniel Jacobson</a>, Director of Engineering for <a title="Netflix API" href="http://developer.netflix.com/">Netflix API</a> who walked us through how APIs are allowing them to stream video to over 200 devices, resulting in Netflix dominating in their space.
     </li>
     <li>

     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Adam Kleinberg" href="http://twitter.com/#!/adamkleinberg">Adam Kleinberg</a>, CEO of <a title="Traction" href="http://www.tractionco.com/">Traction</a> and Mashable.com Tech Writer demonstrated why brands need to focus on having an open API for developers and not get lured into distractions like building apps for single devices.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Edwin Aoki" href="http://twitter.com/#!/edwinaoki">Edwin Aoki</a>, Chief Architect of PayPal/eBay explained how APIs enable you to be more agile, and accelerate new forms of business development, even when your building a global commerce platform where 18% of the worlds online transactions are conducted.
     </li>
</ul>I would say the one point I heard repeated over and over was the importance of understanding who the target audience of your API is. Designing and delivering your API in a way that caters to this audience will help keep development costs focused, network overhead as low as possible, and deliver exactly the tools and resources the most important segments of your audience will need.
<p></p>These were just some of the interesting insights given, into how some of the most successful brands in the space, are using APIs to enable better distribution to consumers, partners and expand their brands globally.

        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/trojan-horse.gif" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I'm processing all my notes from the 2011 <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/">Glue Conference</a>, which has been one of the most thought provoking events I've been to this year.<p></p>
The best part of events like Gluecon is you get to hang with some really smart and extremely experienced people.<p></p>
I'm working to understand a new perspective I was exposed to while listening to Mark Suster talk about the Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years.<p></p>
In his talk, he outlined three potential types of platforms:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Platform as a Service </strong>- Platform around core application or business as an API, allowing others to build businesses on top of, and make money.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform as an Extension</strong> - Platform around a core application that offers APIs as an extension for others to build on bringing value back to the core business.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform as a Trojan Horse</strong> - Platform that allows others to build on, taking the risk, and the core business benefits from any value created.</li>
</ul>
As I work my way through the hundreds of available APIS I will definitely be applying what I'm learning...<p></p>
What is the motivation of each of these API platforms?

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">Open vs. Closed APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/open-closed-sign.jpg" alt="" align="right" />With all the buzz around APIs these days, its easy to get swept up in all the hype around open APIs, and miss the mark with your own API deployment.
<p></p>So what do I mean by Open APIs? Open APIs are like Twitter, Twilio and many of Google APIs that are available for anyone to register for a key, and start programming against.
<p></p>Discussions around APIs tend to start here. People often hear about the popularity of these APIs and want to emulate that.
<p></p>If you don't directly have experience with API deployment, I recommend getting your feet wet with a more closed API deployment.
<p></p>Immediately, calling APIs closed sounds bad. Sounds like you are being selfish or exclusive and don't want anyone touching your APIs. Because of this closed APIs don't get the press coverage and discussion they deserve.
<p></p>In reality very few APIs find success in being open. Most API projects will get traction in sharing data and resources with business partners, and even internally between departments within a company.
<p></p>Closed APIs enable you to serve a very limited audience, maintaining control over your data and resources, which is a common concern with API deployment.
<p></p>Within this closed or controlled environment you can get your feet wet with API deployment, gain some experience, then maybe someday the right opportunity for an open API will come along.
<p></p>It's not about Open vs. Closed, its about doing what makes sense and possibly doing both in the long run. I would also like to see more open discussion around best practices with closed API deployment in the press an blogosphere.

        <span class="post-date">30 May 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Get Satisfaction" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/get_satisfaction/get_satisfaction_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Get Satisfaction" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">Get Satisfaction</a> is one way to build API forums that enable productive conversations between an API owner and the developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>Simply engaging your customers in conversation won't earn you the respect of your community  and make your customers happy. Conversations are just a start, it's what you do with them that matter. Get Satisfaction was built on the idea of not simply creating conversations, but creating value from conversations.</p>
<p>Get Satisfaction focuses on outcomes in order to create value, as opposed to the confusing and ineffective taxonomy of traditional forums, it is focused on conversations around four simple, outcome-oriented topic types. This helps keep conversations focused and productive.</p>
<p>Working together with an API community to build a dynamic, social knowledge-base helps developers find answers to their questions on their own time, and often times much faster through traditional support channels. Every answer is publicly searchable, so there's never a need to answer the same question twice. This results in a dramatic reduction in the cost of API support, while greatly improving customer satisfaction at the same time.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/get_satisfaction/get-satisfaction-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Different topics inside of forums are full of opinions, wishes and wants. Opening a community conversation about your API roadmap can help you gather valuable market data you can quickly fold into your API development cycle, communications strategy or program schedule.</p>
<p>Another area often overlooked, is that opening an forum and inviting discussion about your API deepens user engagement, increases the amount of user generated content, and benefits your  search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. (Hopefully you have one?)</p>
<p>Direct interactiion with your developers through open and transparent forums increases satisfaction, loyalty and builds community. This community will give prospective customers a peek behind the curtain of how your API treats developers, make them feel like they belong, and creates a 2-way street of communication your entire ecosystem will benefit from.</p>

<p></p>The <a title="Open Data Protocol" href="http://www.odata.org/">Open Data Protocol (OData)</a> is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock data and free it from silos that exist in many applications.
<p></p>OData frees data by applying and building upon existing web technologies like <a title="HTTP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>, <a title="Atom Publishing Protocoal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub)</a> and <a title="JSON" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/27/api-technology-json/">JSON</a> to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.
<p></p>OData emerged from experiences implementing AtomPub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several years. OData is currently used to expose and access data from relational databases, file systems, content management systems and custom websites.
<p></p>OData works to be consistent with the way the World Wide Web works, adhering to HTTP standards just like RESTful APIs. This reuse of core Web principles allows OData to provide data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools.
<p></p>OData is released under the <a title="Open Specification Promise" href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx">Open Specification Promise</a> and allows anyone to be involved with OData implementations.

<p></p>This is nothing. If you want a glimpse into the future of APIs, take a look at <a title="Evrythng" href="http://www.evrythng.net/index.html">Evrythng</a>.
<p></p>Evrythng allows you to create online presence for any sort of object - products, business assets, vehicles, trees, buildings, and beyond.
<p></p>Evrythng then gives you a management system to organise and operate an online presence forobjects, storing active profiles and updates, controlling access, and tracking usage. Evrythng creates a unique online identity for every object, providing a presence on the Web through a globally accessible URI.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Evrythng-Sensors.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Now this is where it really gets good. Evrythng also provides a RESTful API toolset and secure software �infrastructure' to share, manage and access real-time information about physical things.
<p></p>Using the Evrythng API, you can directly connect real world objects and databases to Evrythng, allowing developers to mashup object information, add and exchange information with other objects, then combine and coordinate information and interaction across multiple applications and interfaces.
<p></p>Evrythng wants to be the �Facebook for Things', giving physical things an individualdigital profile, and share real-time object information in a managed way.
<p></p>If you think there are a lot of web APIs now, wait until every object on earth can potentially be accessed through APIs.

     </li>
</ul>I don't feel the need to defend Google here, I wish to only defend APIs against people blaming them for what is the fault or responsibility of developers and API owners. I see this same line of attacks on APIs anytime an API company makes a change in their strategy, and developers freak out!
<p></p><strong>First</strong>, let's start with the claims that developers are having the rug pulled out from under them, and you can't build a business on APIs!
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/TweetDeck-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />This week I was fortunate enough to hear <a title="Mark Suster" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04AG3UHUIJE">Mark Suster of GRP Partners</a> talk at <a title="Glue Conference Mark Suster" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Gluecon on Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years</a>. One important point he made about business platforms and startups (ie. TweetDeck) is <strong><span class="c2">you need to have multiple data sources</span></strong>. Without expanding to LinkedIn, Buzz, and Facebook TweetDeck would have been left with only a single data source, and left completely vulnerable.
<p></p>This is a pretty basic concept when it comes to business. If I start a corner deli, and buy my food from a single food distribution company that delivers every Thursday by truck. Then one Thursday the truck doesn't come, and i'm left for the weekend without any food for my restaurant. Is it valid for me to claim that food distribution companies are no way to build a restaurant?
<p></p>Even in the case of TweetDeck, using a very unique API (ie. Twitter), they had to diversify with other services. If your building a business around Google Translate API, what sort of plan B and C do you have built into your code? Are you using any of the free or paid solutions out there like <a title="Translated.net" href="http://www.translated.net/en/translation-api">Translated.net</a>, <a title="Wordlingo" href="http://www.worldlingo.com/en/products/worldlingo_api.html">WordLingo</a>, <a title="Microsoft Translator" href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/dev/">Microsoft Translator</a>, <a title="Apertium" href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium_web_service">Apertium</a>, or <a title="ICanLocalize" href="http://www.icanlocalize.com/site/">ICanLocalize</a>?
<p></p>Please don't blame APIs because developers don't have a business strategy, or because bloggers are looking for a sensational headline.
<p></p><strong>Second</strong>, let's take a look at Google's approach to Google Translate API. The primary reason Google gave for depracting Google Translate API was:
<blockquote>
     <em>Due to the substantial economic burden caused by extensive abuse, the number of requests you may make per day will be limited and the API will be shut off completely on December 1, 2011.</em>
</blockquote>I can't help but think, this problem could have been curbed, by bringing Google Translate API under metered billing using the <a title="Google Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google Console</a>,as other APIs appear to be heading. This would give a low ceiling of free daily calls on the API, then make users pay for more access.
<p></p>Except I really don't think Google wants to make its money from translation services, they are focused on where translation supports their core business. World Domination! Wait, no maybe it is search.
<p></p>If you notice translation is still available in other areas like Google Docs API for translating documents on upload, and in Gmail for translating emails, and Chrome for translating web pages. And of course you can still use the <a title="web interface for Google Translate" href="http://translate.google.com/">web interface for Google Translate</a>.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-translate.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />So you will still see Google Translate in use where it supports Google's core business. I can see just about any other business making a similar decision.
<p></p>Also, Google did reach out to communicate the impending deprecation, they called my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>, and briefed her on the plan. I assume they reached out to others as well.
<p></p>I would add, that Google could do a better job of communicating their roadmap of various APIs and how they will work to support the core Google set of services, or be offered as a service by themselves. As I watch the Google API ecosystem being pulled together and organized, I still can't quite tell whether the vision is to purely serve the primary Google vision, or provide a wide set of APIs that developers can build businesses on, as recent moves with Google Console might suggest.

        <span class="post-date">27 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Seevl" href="seevl.net"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seevl_logo1.png" alt="" align="right" /></a><a title="Seevl" href="seevl.net">Seevl</a>, a music discovery service that provides anew way to explore the cultural and musical universe of various artists, just launched an API with the assistance of <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.
<p></p>When deploying the API, Seevl approached it a little differently than most. Instead of providing a separate API to access data, Seevl relies on content negotiation principles to deliver alternative representations of web pages.
<p></p>This means the entire Seevl website is the API and you can get JSON representations of almost every page in the site.
<p></p>Seevl relies on HTTP headers to let developers request data using a particular content-types, and authenticate using three parameters:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Accept</strong> - The content-type required
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>X_APP_ID</strong> - Developer application ID
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>X_APP_KEY</strong> - Developer application Key
     </li>
</ul>Here is an example search results for beatles using curl:
<p></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/996079.js?file=Seevl%20API%20Request" type="text/javascript">
</script>
<p></p>This approach is meant to make it easier for to developers focus on the development and let the Seevl client libraries handle the content-negotiation.
<p></p>The <a title="Seevl API" href="http://developers.seevl.net/">Seevl API</a> provides everal methods to search and pull specific data about individual bands and artists and related information.
<p></p>While this approach is nothing new, its an interesting way to provide users with HTML views and developers with the JSON representations of information stored in a database.

        <span class="post-date">27 May 2011</span>
        Google has had a busy year when it comes to APIs. So far this year they've launched 6 new APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Google Tasks API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/index.html">Tasks API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Books API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/books/">Books API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Pagespeed Online API" href="https://code.google.com/apis/pagespeedonline/index.html">Pagespeed Online API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Places API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/places/">Places API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Prediction API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/predict/">Prediction API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Fusion Tables API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/fusiontables/">Fusion Tables API</a>
     </li>
</ul>As they add APIs to their directory they have also provided <a title="Google Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google Discovery Service</a> to help developers find APIs, <a title="Google Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google Explorer</a> to start working with APIs, and <a title="Google Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google Console</a> for developers to manage the APIs they integrate with.
<p></p>With the addition of new APIs, some of the older APIs are rendered obsolete with new versions of the API, while others are just shutdown for not getting traction.
<p></p>The following APIs are now deprecated but have no scheduled shutdown date:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Code Search API
     </li>
     <li>Diacritize API
     </li>
     <li>Feedburner APIs
     </li>
     <li>Finance API
     </li>
     <li>Power Meter API
     </li>
     <li>Sidewiki API
     </li>
     <li>Wave API
     </li>
</ul>While these APIs will be shut down per the deprecation policies outlined in their documentation:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Blog Search API
     </li>
     <li>Books Data API
     </li>
     <li>Books JavaScript API
     </li>
     <li>Image Search API
     </li>
     <li>News Search API
     </li>
     <li>Patent Search API
     </li>
     <li>Safe Browsing API (v1 only)
     </li>
     <li>Translate API
     </li>
     <li>Transliterate API
     </li>
     <li>Video Search API
     </li>
     <li>Virtual Keyboard API
     </li>
</ul>Google provides lengthy deprecation periods as long as 3 years in some cases, along with alternative APIs in other situations. The move is part of a larger effort to free up resources for other projects and make the overall Google API ecosystem a much more organized world.

        <span class="post-date">26 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Loggly" href="http://www.loggly.com/">Loggly</a> recently changed the structure for their cloud-based logging service from a tiered pricing, to a <a title="user-defined variable pricing structure" href="https://www.loggly.com/pricing/">user-defined variable pricing structure</a>.
<p></p>Users can define their own pricing tier using two key variables:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Daily Log Volume - 200MB to 8 GB
     </li>
     <li>Log Retention Time - 1 Week to 180 Days
     </li>
</ul>The pricing change was in response to a growing user base, and demand for volumes greater than 2GB/day.
<p></p>Loggly still offers a free plan which supports 200MB/day and retention of 7 days. There is also a beginning paid plan that starts with 200MB/day, but has retention of 15 days, starting at $8/month.
<p></p>Loggly is also adding support for secure syslog (TLS), HTTPs on web inputs, and log archives on all account levels including the free plan.
<p></p>This is a great example of Software as a Service (SaaS) and API service providers innovating around monetization and trying to find the best approach that fits their customers needs and the services they offer.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Games.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Tomorrow I'm participating in a session at <a title="Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers</a>.
<p></p><a title="Justin Tormey" href="http://twitter.com/#!/justintormey">Justin Tormey</a> of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.
<p></p>Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched <a title="facebook + Games" href="http://www.facebook.com/fbandgames">Facebook + Games</a>, a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.
<p></p>I wrote about the the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/17/beyond-partners-and-developers-with-your-api/">Journalist on Facebook</a> page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.
<p></p>This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/gluecon.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I'm preparing for another talk tomorrow at the <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/">Glue conference</a> in Colorado. Glue is a conference that assists architects, developers, administrators and integrators in solving problems around web application integration.
<p></p>Glue is about all of bits and pieces, APIs and meta-data, standards and connectors that will help us to glue together the varying applications of the new platform.
<p></p>I'm on a panel at Glue called, <a title="Whats Next for APIs" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Whats Next for APIs</a>?. I'm stoked to be invited along with some major players in the API space:

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Querly's aggregation of social media profiles" href="http://qwerly.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Qwerly-A-Data-API-for-the-Social-Web.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>The modern Web API got its start in CRM with <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, and in E-commerce with <a title="Ebay" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">Ebay</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, but it really found traction with social platforms like <a title="Flickr" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/">Twitter</a>, and <a title="Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/">Facebook</a>.
<p></p>If we want a glimpse of whats next for APIs we need to look at the areas where web APIs have been applied for the longest. We need to look at examples like<a title="Amazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/06/amazon-affiliate-is-integrated-with-product-api/">Amazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API</a>, and <a title="Querly's aggregation of social media profiles" href="http://qwerly.com/">Qwerly's aggregation of social media profiles</a> into a single API.
<p></p>The social space is an area where the future of APIs is being played out right now. Since the social arena has reached a critical mass in the number of platforms, users, mobile apps, and available Web APIs, the sector has matured beyond other industries, and offers great insight into what the future holds.
<p></p>I've talked about <a title="unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/02/unified-apis-or-api-standards-the-race-is-on/">unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface</a>, and the <a title="potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/discovery-services-for-common-apis/">potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas</a>, but Qwerly's approach offers another view.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/qwerly.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Qwerly" href="http://qwerly.com/">Qwerly</a> aggregates social profiles across many networks into a single dead-simple data API for the social web.
<p></p>With Qwerly you can get data about a user by querying the API with an email address or a social identifier, like a Twitter handle, a Facebook username or a Facebook ID, and the Qwerly API returns:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>the person's name
     </li>
     <li>their location
     </li>
     <li>a short description, like a Twitter bio
     </li>
     <li>their social networking profiles and usernames across the web, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks
     </li>
     <li>a score of their online influence among their peers, like <a title="Kout" href="http://beta.klout.com/home">Klout</a>
     </li>
</ul>Qwerly API responses are delivered in JSON, and you only pay for what you use. The API combines information from web crawling, public web directories, other APIs with powerful heuristics and spam-detection algorithms, delivering high quality results.
<p></p>Other industries and sectors can benefit from such data and service discovery APIs, deployed in a RESTful way, using a pay for what you use API pricing model.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">Open Source API Billing and Traffic Control</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-1.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I was writing a story for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console.<p></p>
I hadn't properly covered the <a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API Console</a>, <a title="API Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">API Explorer</a> here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each.<p></p>
I noticed something while reviewing Google's recent efforts to organize their family of <a title="88 APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?company=Google">88 APIs</a>, and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers.<p></p>
Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3Scale.net">3Scale</a> does for other API providers.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a> provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch.<p></p>
Beyond expertise, they provide a set of <a title="common building blocks every API should offer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks every API should offer</a>.  These are tools like forums and blogs you can find elsewhere, but these API service providers deliver in a neat bundle ready to go for your API.<p></p>
But the real value they bring to the table, that you can't really find anywhere else is:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Billing</li>
	<li>API Traffic Controls</li>
	<li>API Metrics &amp; Analytics</li>
</ul>
And Apigee has one other piece that Mashery and 3Scale do not.  They have an <a title="API Explorer" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
<a title="Google provides an API explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google provides an API Explorer</a>, and they have open sourced the code, and <a title="made it available at Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-apis-explorer/">made it available at Google Code</a>.<p></p>
Next the <a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a> delivers billing and traffic controls, if this set of tools were made open source, this would be huge for the API community.<p></p>
I've been a big proponent of the need for <a title="open source building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open source API building blocks</a>.  I say this not to devalue what Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale bring to the table.  Their stuff rocks.  However there are many other API owners out there who aren't ready for a service like theirs, or can't afford, and a set of open source building blocks is needed.<p></p>
That leaves metrics and analytics.  I think an open source set of API analytics would be the biggest benefit to the industry.   Some APIs don't need billing tools, but everyone needs to measure and control traffic.    I have talked about the need for an <a title="open source set of aPI metrics and analytics" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">open source set of API metrics and analytics</a> before.<p></p>
So I guess I'm saying to Google, Please open source your API Console, like you did the API explorer.  It will benefit the community a great deal, we will deal with API analytics next.

        The <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/" target="_blank">Google APIs Explorer</a> is is a tool that helps you explore various <a title="Google APIs" href="http://code.google.com/more/" target="_blank">Google APIs</a> in a web interface without writing any code.<p></p>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Explorer.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Google APIs Explorer allows you to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Browse quickly through available APIs and versions</li>
	<li>See methods available for each API and available parameters</li>
	<li>Execute API requests for any method and see actual responses in real time.</li>
	<li>Make pubic or authenticated API calls</li>
</ul>
The GoogleAPIs Explorer currently supports only JSON for responses and request payloads, even though some APIs support other data formats like XML and AtomPub.<p></p>
The Google APIsExplorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.<p></p>
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.<p></p>
Google APIs Explorer supports the following APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google Buzz API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/" target="_blank">Buzz</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Custom Search API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/" target="_blank">Custom Search</a></li>

The discovery service delivers a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document"for each of the supported APIs that includes:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>List of API resource schemas based on JSON Schema</li>
	<li>List of API methods and available parameters for each method</li>
	<li>Available OAuth 2.0 scopes for each API</li>
	<li>Inline documentation of methods, parameters and available parameter values</li>
</ul>
Developers can use the Google APIs Discovery Service to build client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools that interact with supported Google APIs.<p></p>
The Google APIs Discovery Service delivers two things for each supported API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>APIs Directory Resource</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Identification and description information, including name, version, title, and description.</li>
	<li>Documentation information, including icons and a documentation link.</li>

The Google APIs Discovery Service is part of a larger effort by Google to get a handle on their growing number of APIs.  Developers find themselves potentially using multiple Google APIs across many application or client projects.<p></p>
The Google APIs Discovery Service allows developers to find new APIs available in the directory and programmatically discover how the API authenticates, what methods, and parameters are available.<p></p>
Not many companies have the number of APIs that Google has, and would need an API discovery service.  But with the recent growth in web APIs there will be more of a need for API discovery services within specific areas or industries.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google APIs Console</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google_apis_box_sdk.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The <a title="Google APIs Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/#project:111046942866">Google APIs Console</a> is an interface for developers to manage and view traffic data, authentication, and billing information for up to 15 Google APIs, and more coming soon.<p></p>
Developers can bundle a collection of APIs into a project, and manage the following project information:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Activated APIs</strong> - APIs can be activated to enable traffic monitoring, filtering, and billing, and API-specific project pages.</li>
	<li><strong>Traffic information </strong>- Console reports show traffic information for each activated API, and allow for capping or filtering of usage for each API.</li>
	<li><strong>Billing information </strong>- APIs now can have billing activated, allowing them to exceed the courtesy usage quota. Usage fees are billed using Google Checkout and charges are invoiced monthly.</li>
	<li><strong>Project keys</strong> - Each project can be identified by either an API key or an OAuth 2.0 token. Using this key/token in API requests will identify the project, and enable the recording of usage data, filtering restrictions, and bill usage to the proper project. Within the Console developers can  generate or revoke API keys or OAuth 2.0 certificates for specific application.</li>
	<li><strong>Team members </strong>- Team members can be established with read, write, or ownership access to each project's Console page.</li>
</ul>
The Google APIs Console supports fifteen separate Google APIs:

The Google APIs Console provides a pretty comprehensive set of tools for developers and companies to manage their projects that integrate with various Google APIs.<p></p>
The traffic control and billing tools provide a peek into the future of how billing and monetization will occur for APIs as they become more of a utility in our every day lives.

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Discovery-Service.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I just wrote about the potential of<a title="open source billing and traffic control" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open source API billing and traffic control</a> building blocks, if Google would open source their <a title="API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a>, like they did with the <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
I started bundling in thoughts on <a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/index.html">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> into that post, but then realized it is a separate issue, needing its own blog post.<p></p>
First, Google isn't about to open source Google API Discovery Service.  They issue developers of the Google APIs Discovery Service a <a title="patent license" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/patent-license.html">patent license</a>.  I couldn't find any more details tonight, but I'm assuming it puts this service in a different category than the rest.<p></p>
I wrote an <a title="overview of the Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">overview of Google APIs Discovery Service</a>, but essentially it is a way to discover and describe Google APIs using an API.  Think <a title="Web Application Discovery Language (WADL)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, with a API to access, and focused only on supported Google APIs.<p></p>
As the number of web APIs grow, the need for a discovery APIs and a standard description language will only grow.  We wil see services like Google APIs Discovery Service popup within specific industries and API areas.<p></p>
You see potential for this with <a title="Mashery's API Netowrk" href="http://developer.mashery.com/apis">Mashsery's API Network,</a> and even more evidence with <a title="Mashape's Marketplace" href="http://www.mashape.com/index">Mashape's Marketplace</a>.<p></p>
There aren't many companies with the number of APIs that Google has, so you won't see any single company building an API discovery service like that.<p></p>
However, I'd like to see API discovery services for cloud computing, social media, location-based, and telcommunication APIs appear making it easier for developers to discover, build code libraries, and integrate with common APIs.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-warehousing.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />With the growing number of 3D models used in 3D printing there is a building need for warehouse space to store these virtual products, and parts.</p>
<p>Of course this is virtual warehouse space, but it has a lot of the same characteristics of warehousing for physical products.</p>
<p>Google provides a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/">3D Warehouse</a> for users of its <a title="SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a> softare, and <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> provides a marketplace and warehouse in the form a <a title="Gallery" href="http://www.shapeways.com/gallery">gallery</a> for its creators.</p>
<p>Cloud Storage will definitely have a role to play in warehousing the growing number of 3D modeling files using platforms like <a title="Google Docs" href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>, <a title="Box.net" href="http://Box.net">Box.net</a>, and <a title="Dropbox" href="/admin/blog/www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>3D Warehouses need to provide search-able, sharable and collaborative spaces that are affordable for designers to store and retrieve their work.</p>
<p>As 3D printing becomes a larger part of the global manufacturing supply chain, virtual warehousing across the globe will also become necessary to provide localized storage solutions.</p>
<p>3D printing offers significant advantages over traditional manufacturing when it comes to warehousing, but it still will be a critical part of the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-creators.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />3D printing starts with someones idea.  Someones idea to recreate an existing object, or a vision of an object they hold in their head.<p></p>
The evolution of 3D modeling software and 3D printers is creating a whole new generation of designers and creators.<p></p>
These 3D creators come from many walks of life; architects, product designers, graphic designers, artists. and beyond.<p></p>
Creators can build entire finished products, ranging from dinnerware to architectural components.<p></p>
Creators can also build parts and pieces of finished projects from nuts and bolts to replacement parts.<p></p>
3D designers and creators are often independent hobbyists and freelancers, but there are also a growing number of agencies and larger shops that are evolving along with 3D printing.<p></p>
Creators are just the first link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.

<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</a></strong> - SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">Stereolithography (SLA)</a> </strong>- Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer resin and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</a></strong> - FDM works on an additive principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing">Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM)</a></strong> - LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are four of the common 3D printing methodologies and since the introduction of metal, 3D printing has moved past prototyping and art and has become a viable manufacturing technology.</p>
<p>3D printing processes and materials are the link that  allows virtual to become physical in the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

<p><a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> and <a title="Google SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/">Google SketchUp</a> provide integrated warehousing and marketplaces for 3D designers to showcase their work.</p>
<p>As 3D printing grows, public and private marketplaces will evolve to provide services to showcase 3D products and parts to potential consumers.</p>
<p>Marketplaces will also go beyond showcasing 3D models, and actually act as marketplaces where items can be bid upon, creating virtual economies around 3D manufacturing.</p>
<p>These 3D economies will allow consumers to buy individual or bulk printed versions of 3D models.</p>
<p>3D marketplaces will provide competitive arenas, that creators and designers can find success by offering cheaper, unique and innovative 3D print products.</p>
<p>Marketplaces will represent a re-invented way of buying and selling products that feed an  evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

<p><a title="3D Printers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printers-printers/">3D printers</a> do most of the work, but it takes someone who knows the machine, materials and process to bring these 3D models to life.</p>
<p>Many industries will adopt 3D printing, increasing the need for specialized talent understanding the needs of each sector, and how the printers, process and materials serve these sectors.</p>
<p>Creators will understand objects in a virtual format, and makers will understand them in a physical form.</p>
<p>3D printing is still a relatively new technology and will require constant improving as it evolves, makers will feed this evolution, and provide the knowledge to move the industry forward.</p>

<p>File formats often depend on the type of 3D modeling software used, but there are many common formats:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>.<strong>stl</strong> - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.</li>
<li>.<strong>iges</strong> - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems.</li>
<li>.<strong>obj</strong> - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format.</li>
<li>.<strong>3ds</strong> - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software.</li>
