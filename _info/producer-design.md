In the design phase, you invest in informed design of the surface area of each API, shaping how it works, the protocols and standards it uses, and how each API will conform to wider rules across the organization. Investment in the design of each API, as well as the overall practice of design across operations, fine-tunes your operations and brings operations into alignment.

Design is often discussed in terms of RESTful or web APIs, but this is a universal look at design that can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous APIs. Design is applied across a variety of API patterns, so you should define a common way to eventually describe and discuss design across all APIs.
