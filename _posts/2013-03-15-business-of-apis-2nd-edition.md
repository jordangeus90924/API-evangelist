{% include JB/setup %}<p>In May 2011 I released a book called the Business of APIs.The book was intended to be an introductory walkthrough for non-technical people, to the world of APIs.I wanted to educate business, organizational and governmental leaders about the space, and the important role of APIs in having a healthy digital strategy.Its coming up on two years later, and Im finally getting around to updating the Business of APIs.After a nice long walk on the strand with @audreywatters, we have the outline for the next version: What is an API?</p>
