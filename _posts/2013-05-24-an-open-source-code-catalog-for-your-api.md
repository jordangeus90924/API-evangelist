{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im working through the wave of API innovation coming out of our Federal Government recently.During normal days at API Evangelist, Im pulling private sector API usage examples and crafting them into stories to help the Federal Government execute on their API own strategies.Today, Id like to showcase something the Federal Government is doing, in hopes that more companies in the private API sector will emulate as part of their API strategies.The GSAsÂ Digital Services Innovation Center has launched the Mobile Code Catalog, an open source catalog of web and native applications that government agencies can use to jump-start their projects.Think application showcase, but all the applications are open source and allow for your API developers to download, fork and re-use code.</p>
