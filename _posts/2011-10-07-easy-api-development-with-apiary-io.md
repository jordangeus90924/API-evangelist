{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im spending a lot of time lately evaluating the various API management service providers like 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery,and Mashape.One thing that I have to explain a lot to people about these API management services…is they are API management services.Not API deployment services.The only one provider that has a solution to deploy your API is Mashape, but now there is a new provider gearing up, called Apiary.io.</p>
