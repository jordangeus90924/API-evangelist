{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im a member of a Google group called API Craft.There are some really smart API folks talking about everything from API deployment to API business strategies there.  The other day someone in the groups asked: How does someone measure success in developing and deploying a public–facing Web API?Scott Regan (@scottregan) of Apigee gave a great response, and I wanted to share with everyone here.Scott’s suggestions for measurements were: Revenue - For public APIs, could be affiliate program revenue, ad revenue, or if incremental traffic from apps to the website has a known monetization rate Reach - Incremental new user accounts or unique users Partnerships - Number of new partnerships established around your API Apps - The number of new apps developed using your API Traffic - Apply percentage of incremental traffic (our API channel is now X% of total internet traffic) Brand - Measuring increased brand, but only if the company has an really established way to do this Scott goes on to say: When it comes to business metric tracking one thing ive seen work well is when the API team publishes a dashboard widely and regularly - tracking actual results to estimates - because it helps PM focus the roadmap on what moves the business needle as agreed and avoid getting the team pulled in different directions.</p>
