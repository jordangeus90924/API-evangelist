All of us programmers have a preferred programming language. It is the language that we identify with and prefer to build projects in.
<p>When it comes to delivering an API area, one of the most important <a title="building blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks</a> for getting programmers up and running are <a title="code language libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">language libraries</a>.
<p>Data API provider <a title="3Taps shows how to deliver their API code libraries" href="http://3taps.com/developers">3Taps shows how to deliver their API code libraries</a>, in just one click.

<p>As soon as I click on "Developers" off the main menu, I get all the top languages front and center.
<p>I can immediately click on my language of choice, fork or download the repository from <a title="Github" href="https://github.com">Github</a> and get to work.
<p><a title="3Taps" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/3taps_wants_to_democratize_the_exchange_of_data.php">3Taps</a> demonstrates how to deliver API code libraries in a way that will really speak to developers.
