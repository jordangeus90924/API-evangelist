In addition to the [growth in number of APIs][1], and the evolution of[BizDev 2.0][2], there is a rise in self-service application platforms accompanying APIs, within many cloud platforms.

Platforms such as [Google Apps][3] and [Box.net][4] are adding these self-service application development environments within their API ecosystem.

Each platform has its own approach to this type of self-service architecture, but there are many similar characteristics:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/self-service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

  * **Applications** \- Interface for defining new application characteristics.
  * **OpenID / OAuth / User Resource Access** \- Secure and granular access to users profile and resources.
  * **Development Environment** \- Controlled, secure environment for developers to build applications in.
  * **Application Branding** \- Branding of application and its profile on a platform.
  * **Application Approval Process** \- Approval process for bringing applications live.
  * **Marketplace Environment** \- Public or private marketplaces for developers to publish applications and platform users to browse / add applications.
[Salesforce][5] is building in-roads into the enterprise using this model, and [Facebook][6] has found success with social gaming using a similar approach.

APis have opened up new business development opportunities, self-service application platforms takes this development to a new level.
