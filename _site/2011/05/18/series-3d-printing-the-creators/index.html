The evolution of 3D modeling software and 3D printers is creating a whole new generation of designers and creators.<p>
These 3D creators come from many walks of life; architects, product designers, graphic designers, artists. and beyond.<p>
Creators can build entire finished products, ranging from dinnerware to architectural components.<p>
Creators can also build parts and pieces of finished projects from nuts and bolts to replacement parts.<p>
3D designers and creators are often independent hobbyists and freelancers, but there are also a growing number of agencies and larger shops that are evolving along with 3D printing.<p>
Creators are just the first link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.
