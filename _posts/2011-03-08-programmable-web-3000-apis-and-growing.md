{% include JB/setup %}<p>Congratulations to ProgrammableWeb for hitting the 3000th API in their directory.The ProgrammableWeb API directory has seen some amazing growth: 1,000 APIs: over 3 years 2,000 APIs: less than 2 years 3,000 APIs: about 9 months Three other noteworthy trends, the ProgrammableWeb team notices: API as a Company - More companies launching just as API.REST and JSON - Simplification of APIs through REST and JSON.Internal Usage - More companies consuming their own APIs.Some might say the recent explosive growth is part of a bubble, but if you look at the numbers its been a long 11 year road since Salesforce first launch their API in February of 2000.</p>
