I am looking to better understand what people are doing with the specification, and parsing the words people use to describe their open source project is a good way for me to quickly pull together a list of what matters. If people are building a tool to solve a problem, and publish that on GitHub, it is a good sign that it is an itch needing scratching--here is the tag cloud from this list of what people are doing with both Swagger and OpenAPI.</p>

<p class="p1">Semantically they all don&rsquo;t jive, but it does paint an interesting picture of what is happening in the OpenAPI community. I am going to be working on this list to establish a more solid reference for the OpenAPI community. I am looking to profile all of these tools as part of the OAI demand generation work I am doing, but I am also interested in continuing to map the API lifecycle and keep mapping how open source OpenAPI tooling fits into the picture. We have built up a lot of momentum over the years, but this landscape is still pretty fractured and disorganized, making it difficult to navigate&mdash;I am looking to change that.</p>\n
