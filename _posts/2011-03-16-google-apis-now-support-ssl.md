{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google will start supporting the use of SSL in many of their APIs.SSL will improve API security by encrypting all data communications between 3rd party applications and Google, protecting data from interception by a malicious third party.Google Web Search, Google Maps, Gmail and Google docs all currently support SSL for API access.They are working to introduce SSL support in other APis as well as update existing client libraries and code samples to support SSL.Beginning September 15, 2011, Google will require that all users of Google Documents List API, Google Spreadsheets API, and Google Sites API use SSL connections for all API requests.</p>
