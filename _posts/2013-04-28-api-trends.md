{% include JB/setup %}<p>I study the API space.I want to understand how we got where we are at, and try to understand where we are going with our usage of APIs.To do this I monitor the best of the existing and new APis, using the blogosphere, Twitter, LinkedIn, Github and the open web looking for examples of how people are using APIs in different ways.Currently I monitor the blogs of 804 API related companies and 205 blog feeds from other news and blog sources, as well as around 1000 API twitter accounts.As I read and curate this every day, I tag items according to a process Ive evolved over 3 years of operation.</p>
