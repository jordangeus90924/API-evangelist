Apigee, Salesforce, Google, Microsoft, and Infochimps have all deployed REST API Explorers to support developer integration.
Facebook has now joined in....well a sort of. Facebook employee Simon Cross developed a <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="https://www.simoncross.com/fb/graph/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for developers to use when working with the <a title="Facebook Graph API" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Graph API</a>.
The explorer lets developers specify and endpoint, and generate a JSON response, with or without an user login access token.
Developers can also use the <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/16/the-semi-unofficial-facebook-graph-api-explorer/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for working FQL, which is the Facebook Query Language.
Interesting that a Facebook employee was the one to develop and deploy the explorer, I'm sure its something Facebook will officially integrate into the Facebook developer area soon enough.
