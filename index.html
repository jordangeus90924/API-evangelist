<h2>What Is An API?</h2>
<p>An API -- Application Programming Interface -- at its most basic level, allows applications to talk to other applications. In this way, an API allows anyone to open up any content, data, and digital functionality to other developers, other businesses or even between departments and locations within your company, organization, agency or institution. It is increasingly the way in which companies exchange data, services and complex resources, both internally, externally with partners, and openly with the public.</p>
<h2>What Are APIs Used For?</h2>
<p>APIs are launched primarily to give partners that are outside the company firewall, access to internal resources, but recently, APIs are also being used by more of the general public, including non-developers to move information around the web. As APIs' ease-of-use and popularity increases -- and as APIs demonstrate their value and deliver efficiencies -- many companies have begun to consume their own APIs to build internal systems, websites, mobile apps, and even Internet enabled devices, using the same APIs that they make available to third-party developers and to the public.</p>
<p>APIs are a single endpoint, for programmatic access to a resource, that can be secured and tailored for different uses. APIs originally were used to enable integration with distributed sites and systems by companies like SalesForce, Amazon and EBay, but newer companies quickly realized APIs would enable new types of relationships, making the web much more social and distributed.</p>
<p>Alongside this evolution in API usage, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/"></a>one of the early pioneers Amazon, was working on a new approach to using APIs to deploy infrastructure</a>, now known as Cloud Computing. These APIs have forever changed how we build applications, just in time for a new way to use applications via our mobile phones.</p>
<p>In 2014, the number one reason APIs are deployed, is to support mobile development. While APIs can be used for commerce, payments, social, cloud computing or for any other reason, mobile phones and tablets are the biggest driving force for providing APIs and consuming them. As we draw near the end of 2014, the Internet of Things, often referred to as Iot is picking up steam, and by 2016 or later is predicted to eclipse API deployment for mobile use.</p>
<h2>Why Do You Need An API?</h2>
<p>An API is the cornerstone of what is widely seen as the next iteration of business development, where having a well-developed API is poised to be the way in which business relationship are established and maintained in a online, 24/7 digital economy. A decade ago, businesses were still working to understand the importance of having a website for doing business. Today, businesses are working to understand the similar importance in having an API.</p>
<p>Whether your API provides programmatic access to information that is already on your website like company directory or product catalog, providing secure access to trusted partners, an APIs is becoming essential for operating in current markets, and effectively competing.</p>
<p style="page-break-after: always;">You currently put products and services on the Internet for your human consumers to access in the form of websites and applications. APIs are the wholesale version of a web presence, allowing others to access and integrate your data and resources into their public or private sites and applications.</p>
<h2>A 101 View Of The API Landscape</h2>
<p>API 101 stories dominate my blog, and it is important to me that any new user to the world of APIs can land on my home page, and find an introduction to the world of APIs. At the same time I want my expert readers, and everyone in between, to be able to find what they are looking for. I'm always working to expand my content beyond just my linear blog, and this section is looking to provide a 101 path through the API Evangelist network.</p>

<p>As with everything on my site, this API 101 material is a work in progress, and as each section becomes available I will link to it from here. My goal is to provide enough overview of the entire space, that anyone can get up to speed in 60 minutes or less, in very bite size chuks.</p>
<p>Let me know if there is something you'd like to see here, and would help you better understand the world of APIs.</p>
