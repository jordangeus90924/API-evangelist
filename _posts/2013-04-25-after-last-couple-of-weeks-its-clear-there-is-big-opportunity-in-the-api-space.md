{% include JB/setup %}<p>There was a lot of buzz in the API space over the last two weeks.Im not a big on being first with news from the world of APIs, I leave this approach to the tech blogs like Techcrunch, RWW, GigaOm, The Next Web and others.Id rather simmer on things for a bit, think beyond the press release, and craft a post that offers value beyond the initial announcement and the churnalism.To get everyone up to speed, four major things happened in the API space over the last two weeks: Intel Buys Mashery Computer Associates Buys Layer 7 Technologies MuleSoft Acquires ProgrammableWeb 3Scale gets $4.2M in Funding There is no arguing that these are some pretty significant signs the API industry is picking up the pace, especially when you have companies like Intel and Computer Associates taking notice and making investments.</p>
