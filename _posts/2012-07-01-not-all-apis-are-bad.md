{% include JB/setup %}<p>When covering the API space, it is easy to talk about the APIs that are doing it wrong.When Twitter gets ready to screw over developers, Facebook breaks something or Google changes their approach--the blogosphere and twittersphere eats it up.What is harder, is finding the stories about success in the space.I see a lot of comments on recent posts about how developers are fools for every believing in APIs, and what positive outcomes have their been with APIs?Has there been a great success story of building a company around an API/platform (not an OS) you dont control?</p>
