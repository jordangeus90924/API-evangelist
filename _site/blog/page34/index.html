			<h3><a href="/2011/10/08/learning-management-systems-lms-integration-with-instructure-canvas-api/">"Learning Management Systems (LMS) Integration with Instructure Canvas API"</a></h3>
			<p><em>08 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     I had a great response to my Learning Management System (LMS) APIs round-up last week after Startup Weekend Seattle EDU. After posting I quickly updated with another LMS suggestion I got for Sakai. Then a couple days ago the PR director for Instructure introduced me to their LMS platform, Canvas.


     Canvas is a open-source LMS created by Instructure and released under the AGPLv3 license. Instructure also provides a cloud version, with all the features of the open source version of Canvas, but comes with hosting, mobile apps, services integration, and automated provisioning.


     


     The Canvas LMS includes a REST API, using OAuth for authentication, enforces SSL, with all API responses in JSON. The API is currently under development and many areas of the application are still unavailable via the external API, but there are still quite a few methods available for the LMS already, and more to come.


     The Canvas solution appears to have all the latest features of a modern software as a service platform. They provide an open-source version, as well as a hosted platform.  Its built with Ruby, on a PostGres database, and runs on the Amazon Cloud.  The API is simple, and they intend to expose all features of the core LMS via the API, with all documentation hosted at Github.


     When the API is complete, I’d definitely say that the Instructure Canvas and API is the most robust LMS solution I’ve come across so far. When they finish their API, and pull together a community around the API, they will definitely be a strong force in the LMS space.

Factual has launch a new application gallery to showcase the diverse number of applications built using data provided by Factual.
You can search for apps, browse by category, and filter by open source, paid or free apps. &nbsp;Looks like there are about 18 apps in the directory currently ranging from augmented reality to daily deals.
The Factual App Gallery isn&rsquo;t a particularly unique launch, we are seeing app showcases popup within many APIs, but it shows that Factual is gaining steam, and I think it shows the appetite for building apps around datasets is growing.

			<p><em>08 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
I just added four new API to my API stack series.  I&rsquo;m considering breaking the API Stack series into a separate feed, they kind of clutter the main feed.  Anyways, the four new APIs are from 3Scale:

Service Management API
Account Management API
Analytics API
Billing API

These four APIs offer the essential building blocks to control, manage and monetize the distribution of data, content and services via a web API. &nbsp;3Scale has had their Service Management API for a while, but recently added the account, analytics and billing services, making a complete set of API management APIs.
3Scale already has two significant differentiors from other API managerment service providers:

Proxy-Less - 3Scale is different than the other service providers in that they don't proxy your APIs.  3Scale only uses a "connector" to integrate the services you want into your API. 
Self-Service - 3Scale is the only self-service API management service with a freemium model.  Well, except for&nbsp;Mashape, they do to, but are in beta currently. 

Adding a set of APIs, definitely sets 3Scale apart from the other API management service providers.  You can sign-up, connect 3Scale services to your API, without routing your API through a proxy, and seamlessly integrate 3Scale service, account and billing management into your existing systems, complete with analytics.

Using 3Scale you can operate for free up to 50K calls per day, and start paying after your API grows or once you are looking to monetize your API and begin billing users.
Since 3Scale has a freemium model, I can play around with a lot of different deployments, until I find the configuration I'm looking for.   I think I'll launch an API for API Evangelist using 3Scale.  See if I can integrate 3Scale service and user management into my existing CMS, and deploy some API analytics.  I don't have anything at the moment I'd feel good about billing for, but maybe some day.

3scale provides scalable API Infrastructure as a Service to control, manage and monetize the distribution of data, content or services for devices, mobile and web applications.
The 3Scale Service Management API allows you to authorize access to your API, monitor calls and report traffic seamlessly in your applications.
The 3Scale Service Management API provides a RESTful API, using a key for authentication, and responses in an XML format.
3Scale provides a freemium account with 50K calls per day, and other packages for higher volume calls.
The 3Scale Service Management API for API service management is a perfect tool for the API Stack.

			<p><em>07 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>I attended Mashery's Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco last week. There were a lot of great API presentations, but I thought one really told a great story in-line with the focus of the event, which is the Business of APIs. Tyler Singletary(@harmophone), Developer Evangelist at Klout, told a story around how they are continuing to grow, control and monetize Klout, while also ensuring Klout continues to have meaning and deliver value. Klout's value lies in brand awareness, integrity and the meaning, usefulness and value of the Klout Score to consumers and businesses. To continue offering value and maintaing the integrity of the brand, they are creating a dynamic way to manage their API community, incentivize postive usage of the API, while controlling negative usage. To build awareness of the Klout brand, and increase value, Klout depends on properly displaying of Klout Score and Klout Logo, and linking back to Klout profiles. The more value an API user delivers to the Klout brand the more relaxed Klout can be on quotas, rate limits and even pricing. Not all API users will deliver the same value to the Klout brand, competitors may access data, and application may use scores in a more programmatical way, and not have the desired awareness generating value of other implementations. In these cases Klout can impose tariffs, implementing much stricter quotas, rate limits and charge more for accessing the API. Through a dynamic terms of service, branding guidelines, and pricing, Klout can adjust these business controls based upon how much value an API user brings to the Klout brand, establishing a desired balance within their API ecosystem. Finding that sweet spot where they are delivering the desired units of value to their consumers, while protecting, growing and building value in the Klout brand, even generating revenue it where it makes sense. I really like Tyler's transparent way telling the story of how Klout is defining its business model, and employing...[<a href="/2011/10/07/the-business-of-klout039s-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>At Mimeo we have demo Fridays where anyone can demo what they&rsquo;re working on. For demo Fridays I tend to build prototypes showing different ways to integrate with the Mimeo Document Printing APIs. As my schedule has gotten busier this fall, with more developer support, and attending hackathons and conferences, I don&rsquo;t always have time to polish a prototype for Friday demos. So this Fridays demo I started showcasing some of the ideas I&rsquo;m brainstorming with other developers, and the potential ways they might use our APIs. Here are the four I demoed today: Cabana - Very sexy, GUI mobile application development environment I saw demo at BAPI. I want to understand more about how they will integrate APIs into the mobile building environment. Breezy - Breezy launched their mobile printing network last month, allowing you to print to Fedex Office, local print shops, coffee shops and hotels from your mobile device. I am brainstorming how to print common business documents using Mimeo and have delivered next day using Breezy. PicPlum - Let&rsquo;s you email or upload photos into a queue and when ready add contacts and have photos printed and delivered to your family and friends. Chute - A centrally located backup, syncing and photo sharing platform. Its currently in beta, but I got a look at the back-end, and its a very powerful photo management and distribution platform. Not all of these projects I demoed are guaranteed to go anywhere. Some of the photo products at Mimeo, still need APIs exposed before I can offer some of the more specialized photo printing services. However showing the types of projects developers are engaging me on, creates more awareness within the company about what developers want, and opens up the floor for comments and valuable feedback. Internal API evangelism is an ever increasing part of my API evangelist role.

I'm spending a lot of time lately evaluating the various API management service providers like 3Scale, Apigee,&nbsp;Mashery,and&nbsp;Mashape.
One thing that I have to explain a lot to people about these API management services&hellip;is they are API management services.  Not API deployment services.
The only one provider that has a solution to deploy your API is Mashape, but now there is a new provider gearing up, called Apiary.io.  Apiary.io wants to make developing and implementing APIs a quicker process.
Apiary.io site says they will also help you describe, test, manage and share your API with developers.
I feel that API deployment services is a huge opportunity in this space, its good to see a provider step up that will help API owners deploy their APIs, as well as manage them.
Apiary.io is still in private Beta, so I can't take it for a spin yet.  It will be interesting to learn more about what this latest API service provider can bring to the table.

			<p><em>06 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>I finished up the Mashery, Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.  After a days rest and reflection on the event I wanted to capture my thoughts on BAPI - SF.   The turnout was impressive.  I got to see a lot of familiar faces, was introduced to some new APIs and met a few new folks looking to transform their businesses using APIs.   On the 16 presentations I saw, here are some of my thoughts: Daniel Jacobson - I have seen Daniel talk several times, so I'm familiar with his talk, but he adds new slides each time.  Always love seeing how they are solving internal and partner needs with their APIs, as well helping them achieve world domination using APIs and the Amazon cloud. Adam Trachtenberg - There were three things I took away from listening to Andy.  1) Your API should get all the same love and attention as your primary business.  2)  Hold Hackathons within your own company to encourage innovation 3) LinkedIn is a model of how any API should employ embeddable buttons and widgets around their API. Steve Citron-Poust -  I need to watch his pitch again.  His speaking style was engaging so I was drawn in by his perspective of ecosystem management, and didn't take good enough notes.  He offers a very realist perspective of managing your developers, and the differences in managing a private-label, partner API platform. John Musser - John always has a very concise view of the entire API industry, showing the growth, and helping us understand the scope and depth of this growth.  ProgrammableWeb recently hit 4K APIs in its directory, showing some phenomenal growth in number of APIs, but also by industry, and varying ways companies are monetizing their APIs. Neel Ketkar - Neel from Rovi talked about the advantages of an open API, and the importance of providing a feedback framework for your developers and incorporating feedback into your roadmap....[<a href="/2011/10/06/business-of-apis-conference-in-san-francisco-wrapup/">Read More</a>]</p>

          Reeve S. Thompson - Co-CEO, at Cabana
     


     


     That is a whole lot of API experience. I went to BAPI last year, and the talks were great and I connected with a bunch of other API experts, during the half-day event.


     BAPI is from 1:00 – 5:30 at the Julia Morgan Ballroom in San Francisco. The San Francisco BAPI is the first of three events, with a New York event October 19th and a London event October 25th.


     Registration is still open for all three events. I highly recommend getting to at least one of them if you can.

With over 100 APIs, and an army of developer advocates, Google is one of the top API ecosystems in the world, alongside Twitter and Facebook.
Google is stepping back and rethinking how they interact and support their developer community and are looking for feedback from the developer community.
They want to know what inspires you as a developer, what does being a Google developer mean to you, and how Google can make your experience as a developer better.
Facebook has made a tremendous effort to better engage their developer community with Operation Facebook Love, and its really good to see Google make a similar attempt.  We&rsquo;ll see what comes from it, to voice your opinion, you can submit a video or write to Google.

			<p>At Mimeo I get approached by a lot of customers who use various learning management systems, and ask if they can print training and classroom materials from their LMS. I ask them the name of their LMS system, then set out to research what is possible. I've researched almost 30 LMS systems so far (according to my notes), and I've come across 3 that have APIs. I'm in talks with a fourth, Schoology, that has an API as a premium feature, but information is limited and they are super busy with the new school year. Here are the three LMS platforms that I've come across that have APIs: BrainHoney – A learning management system providing course authoring, learning objective management, and gradebook management Haiku Learning System – Learning management system providing website design and development, listserve hosting, assignment dropboxes, and more for teachers to take classrooms online Litmos – Litmos is a SCORM-certified, learning management system, that enables developers to connect their applications to the Litmos training engine, providing deeper integration of training data generated in Litmos with any other systems I find it pretty disturbing that only 3% of the learning management systems have APIs. APIs are essential not only to providing data portability for your customers, but can open up entirely new sales channels for an LMS provider. A web API can enable other content systems and applications to incorporate your LMS into their application. An API will not give away your content or intellectual property, it will open it up and allow you to build new types of revenue channels with customers who might not have adopted your platform by itself, without seamless integration with their existing systems. My research into the education and learning management space is still in its infancy. If you know of any tools I should evaluate, please let me know. Whether its K-12, Higher Ed, or corporate learning, education is one space that dramatically benefit from the...[<a href="/2011/10/02/learning-management-system-lms-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Historically APIs are deployed to provide data and resources to business partners. However, in the last 5 years we have seen a shift in focus to also delivering more open, publicly focused APIs, based upon the success of popular services like Google Maps, Twitter and Twilio. In the last year, many companies are also seeing the benefits of deploying and consuming APIs internally, in addition to partner driven, and open public APIs. 3Scale, Apigee and&nbsp;Mashery all advocate for evaluating the deployment of APIs for internal and partner consumption as well as carefully weighing the value of a public facing API ecosystem. As an API evangelist I aslo have found the need for equal distribution of resources when it comes to evangelizing the benefits of APIs as well. Internal API Evangelism - I spend â of my time educating internal departments from IT to marketing about the benefits of APIs. I want everyone to understand that APIs will make our company more flexible and nimble, and help us out-maneuver our competitors. APIs also will assist us in delivering mobile content and applications within our company and to our customers. Partner API Evangelism - I spend â of my time educating our partners about the various APIs we have, how they can be used, and provide as much material as I can about our web services. I also evangelize about other APIs that compliment our services and can provide benefits to our partners. Its not just about selling our partners on our services, its letting them know we are invested in their success. Public API Evangelism - I spend â of my time blogging, tweeting and generating code samples, prototypes and any other materials that will help get the word out to the public about our APIs. Public API evangelism is not just about SEO content, its about social engagement.

Klout just updated their API area. The Klout API was originally released in 2009, but the new API area has several improvements including faster response times for the API, better documentation and improved terms of service.
Using the Klout API developers can pull someones Klout Score, which is the measurement of their overall online influence using social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+.   It provides a way of essentially high-grading users on your network, and rewarding or engaging users differently based upon their overall network influence.
I categorize the Klout API as a &ldquo;partner API&rdquo;, meaning that can add value to just about any existing API community and application.  For example, with my Mimeo Connect Document Printing APIs, a print application could offer lower pricing to a user based upon their Klout score.  If you are building a poster, flyer or book printing application and you offer lower pricing to people who are influencers, you can probably bet they&rsquo;ll talk about your app within their network.
The Klout API opens up a lot of opportunities for web and mobile app developers to enrich their understanding of their existing user base, identifying the users that are the biggest influencers, and may contribute to a larger network effect around their application.
Klout has delivered their API using the Mashery API platform, you can register for an API key and learn more about the platform at developer.klout.com.

			<p>One of the things I do here at API Evangelist is review APIs for their owners and provide suggestions for how they can improve the technology, ecosystem and better monetize their API. When it comes to monetization many of the API owners seem to have a good grasp of how they are covering the base costs of operating their API, but are looking for ways to expand their revenue, and actually make their API profit engine. Just like with web and mobile applications the first way people think about monetizing their API is using advertising. Though I don&rsquo;t always agree with employing advertising as part of an API ecosystem, it makes sense that many owners are considering it. Advertising has been a primary revenue generator for web sites and applications, and has become a staple for mobile applications, using mobile advertising platforms like AdMob. With this growing demand, I see a huge opportunity for someone to step up and provide a plug-and-play advertising network that API owners can deploy as part of their API ecosystems. An API advertising network could provide broad or specialized sponsored content that could be delivered within existing API content. An API advertising network would have different ways to filter and tailor content so advertising would not be intrusive and blend with the content already being delivered as part of an API, whether its delivering text, images, audio or video. API advertising networks would have revenue sharing for developers built in. As an API owner I could choose to share advertising revenue with my developer ecosystem in any amount I wanted. Advertising would be pushed to all API calls made by developers, but they could be given an option to register for the revenue sharing program, and the system would track all ads delivered through a developers site or application, and pay out associated revenue. Web advertising models like Google Adsense are great for website and application development, and mobile advertising...[<a href="/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>Audrey introduced me to a very cool gaming company the other day called Tiny Speck. The company, the latest project of Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield, has released its first game to the public today: Glitch. Glitch is a web-based massively-multiplayer game. The game allows you to choose how to grow and shape the world: building and developing, learning new skills, collaborating or competing with everyone else in one enormous, ever-changing, persistent world. Glitch is a visually stunning game environment, delivered using a flash client (although the startup does state other clients will be available someday). There's a lot that's familiar about the game, particularly to fans of MMOs and social games -- Glitch is a combination of the two, arguably. But where Glitch really strikes me as doing something new is with its back-end. Glitch uses a low level Java back-end with game logic scripted in JavaScript, built on a suite of APIs, allowing for maximum flexibility and easy deployment. No surprise, it's this API piece that strikes me as compelling and different from other games. I do have a list of game-related APIs to evaluate, I just haven’t had the time to dive in too deeply. But at first glance most game APIs tend to only deliver meta-information about games, profiles, and the communities around games. Though I don’t doubt APIs drive a lot of game development, most developers I’ve talked to don’t think much about it, let alone make the APIs public or showcase them. Glitch could be a “game-changer” in that Tiny Speck has built its game around the API, as well as exposing these same APIs to its developer community, enabling them in turn to build web, iOS, and Android games around the Glitch universe. The Glitch API uses JSON over HTTP or HTTPS, in an RPC style, allowing parameters to be passed via GET or POST vars, with an available JSONP callback. The API provides access to players, skills, avatars,...[<a href="/2011/09/27/tiny-speck-is-changing-how-games-are-built-using-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I wrote about the need for more Transit APIs a couple weeks ago, and the opportunity for some company or organization to step up and coordinate transit APIs on a global, country, regional and local level. Also the opporunity for developers to provide local resources for building applications, "acquiring" of local data, understanding local constraints, and be the overall contact for a specific locale. To me, there appears to be a hunger for transit data, and there is a major gap in how this "public data" is being made available for developers to build websites, web and mobiles apps, that businesses and commuters can use. The opportunity is so big, that tech savvy commuters are stepping up, scraping data, and building transit APIs and applications themselves. I had a lot of people contact me after my post, but one clear player emerged, that appears to be just the company I was looking for. That company is Jeppesen, a Boeing funded company that has a new service called the Jeppesen Journey Planner API. Jeppesen has developed a very robust set of transit APIs, providing: Public Transit Journey Plans - Request multimodal public transit journey plans Polyline Trip Details - Draw the journey plans on a map Stop Locations - Locate all the public transit stops within an area Stop Timetable - Obtain a list of departures (or arrivals) from a public transit stop Walk Journey Plans - Request walking journey plans between locations Service Provider - Identify the public transit service providers in an area Fares - Find out the cost of the journey (when transit fare information is available) Trip Timetable - Discover all the stopping points for a specific trip Jeppesen is aggregating data from transit agencies around the world, including 23 regions in the US, and locations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK, into a single set of web services.

			<p>During TwilioCon last week I covered the release of Twilio Connect in two posts, starting with, "Twilio Introduces Twilio Connect, Its New In-App Billing Model" on ProgrammableWeb, and on API Evangelist with, "Twilio Connect is OAuth for API Billing". Twilio Connect is a new billing solution that enables developers to offload charges for Twilio API usage to their application users, rather than their own Twilio accounts, and billing customers separately. Twilio Connect is modeled after OAuth in that it uses a &ldquo;two-legged&rdquo; process for application users to setup and authenticate a payment relationship with Twilio, that a developer can leverage within their app using a token. I mentioned lightly in my post on API Evangelist: &ldquo;OAuth 2.0 allows for designation of which account resources a developer can access, enabling users to approve at a very granular level, which could very easily be used for billing access as well.&rdquo; Then yesterday I got called out on Twitter by Travis Spencer (@travisspencer), stating that because Twilio did not use OAuth 2.0 to implement Twilio Connect, it was a step backwards, and I was irresponsible for not calling Twilio out on this. He is totally right, and I humbly admit to not covering this story well enough. In most cases OAuth is implemented for basic user account authentication, but with the introduction of OAuth 2.0 you can use for authenticating access in a very granular way for any user resources that you choose. So it could be very easily used for billing authentication, and its irresponsible of Twilio to not embrace industry standards, and developing their own, proprietary, one-off implementation. OAuth has a reputation for being tough to implement, both from a provider standpoint as well as working with as a developer, but with each version it is getting easier to use, and since its being widely accepted as an industry standard it is all of our responsibility as API owners to make sure it is used properly,...[<a href="/2011/09/25/twilio-connect-is-not-oauth-for-api-billing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I&rsquo;m working on reviewing various APIs as part of my database industry overview, where I&rsquo;m trying to understand the different approaches to delivering database platforms using web APIs as the primary interface.
One of these database platforms is Database.com.  I really like what SalesForce.com is doing with Database.com, but I take issue with their section declaring Database.com as an open platform.  SalesForce.com claims because you can access Database.com from any language, any platform, and any device through standards-based APIs, it is "open".
I think many folks in the enterprise space truly believe this makes something open.  All it means is, if you have the money and approved credentials, you can access.  If I launch a database on Database.com it is open for "me" to access, and those I give access to.  And yes, since it uses REST I am "open" to access via any language or platform I choose.  But I'm sorry, that does not make it "open".
I recommend SalesForce.com take a look at Freebase.  All the data contained in Freebase is licensed by a Creative Commons Attribution License, which means that it's free for you to browse, query, copy, and even use the data in your own systems or software, even for commercial use, all you have to do is attribute it back to Freebase.
Anyone has access to use and contribute to Freebase, as well as use any programming language or platform to access the data available on the platform.  Access to data is only one aspect of "open", developers must also be freely open to use and contribute to it, as the community sees fit.
As much as I love and evangelize the power of the API, an API alone does not make systems or data open.

			<p>I was reviewing the Recovery API yesterday, which gives you a RESTful API for exploring where all the money went as part of our governments Recovery Act. I have a sort of obsession with this kind of government data, and began playing with, and tracking on where the stimulus money went in my home state of Oregon. I started hacking on the API by manipulating the query string variables to get different types of responses on how stimulus money was spent by city, county and project types like roads, education and the environment. Since I’m a developer I’m very comfortable with hacking on the URL query string like this, but I noticed they also had a tool they called the, “Advanced Recipient Data Search Widget”. The advanced recipient data search widget allows me to adjust the same fields, but using an actual form. Using the widget anyone can easily build requests against the Recovery API without being a developer, and I even found it allowed me to explore and understand the API quicker and easier. The widget even displays the final request string you can copy and paste and see the XML results in the browser or just as results grid on the screen. And you can also choose to download the results as a CSV when done. The form could be better. It does not provide drop-down values for each of the fields, and the pop-up window is a little clunky. It still is a very useful tool helping not only developers get up and running, but allows the average user to come in and use, understand and export results from the Recovery API. I’m a big fan of API explorer and console tools, but they still often are built for developers, by developers to explore and understand how an API works.

			<p>Twilio just announced a new API billing solution called Twilio Connect.  The new billing solution enables developers to offload charges for Twilio API usage to their application users, rather than their own Twilio accounts, and billing customers separately. Twilio Connect is modeled after OAuth in that it uses a “two-legged” process for application users to setup and authenticate a payment relationship with Twilio, that a developer can leverage within their app using a token. To start, developers put a Twilio Connect button in their application.  Application users then click the button and are taken to a secure Twilio page that allows them to setup a new Twilio account, requiring only the minimal needed information:  name, billing info, and email.   Upon successful setup, the application is then issued a token, which combined with a Twilio developers key, enables that application to consume Twilio API services, and bill to the users account. If you think about it, it makes perfect sense.  What OAuth has done for user account authentication,  Twilio is doing for developer billing authentication.  OAuth 2.0 allows for designation of which account resources a developer can access, enabling users to approve at a very granular level, which could very easily be used for billing access as well.  However the complexity of OAuth 2.0 can often scare away businesses looking to implement oAuth, and developers looking to build around an API that authenticates with OAuth.  Twilio is taking the best features from OAuth, while keep the developer implementation dead simple. Not all APIs would benefit from a billing authentication model like Twilio Connect.  It would work best for APIs that truly have a “cloud utility” model for their pricing, allowing developers to pay for only what they consume.  This would allow for the burden of billing to be lifted from developers, enabling them to do what they do best--code applications.   One problem I see here is that developers who rely on marking up underlying API...[<a href="/2011/09/20/twilio-connect-is-oauth-for-api-billing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>
Not even a week after Google rolled out the long awaited Google+ API, they launched the Google+ Hangouts API, enabling developers to build collaborative apps that run inside of a Google+ Hangout
The Google+ Hangout API will provide developers with the ability to manipulate the UI, interact with hangout participants and respond to the different events that occur within a hangout. &nbsp;The functionality is reminiscent of the way Google Wave gadgets and robots could interact with a wave and its participants. &nbsp;I wonder if we are seeing some of the Google Wave code being recycled?
To use Google+ you have to register your application with Google, and specify any other Google+ users on your team that will be able to load the application into their hangout. &nbsp;Since the Google+ Hangouts API is only in developer preview, this is temporary requirement.

Once registered, apps behaves like a normal web app, but it also can take part in the real-time conversations within a hangout using the API. &nbsp;Google+ Hangout apps will use whats called a &ldquo;shared state&rdquo; among all instances, notifying users of changes by other application users in real-time.
The decision to release the Google+ clearly was a strategic move against Facebook, which I understand, but I still feel strongly that a empowering developers with a fully write enabled API from the beginning, is very important to setting the tone for the Google+ API ecosystem.
Many developers, including myself were not happy with the limited functionality of the initial Google+ API release. &nbsp;However, I could tell that Google was being cautious in their API roll-out, and there is potentially much more behind the scenes. &nbsp;I expect Google will be rolling out new APIs as they feel confident, or maybe when they feel it will give them a strategic advantage, like this week during the Facebook F8 conference.

			<p>Code libraries have been a staple of open API communities for quite a few years now. &nbsp;API owners provide developers with working samples of code in a variety of programming languages, to get started working with an API. &nbsp;Sample code helps developer get up and running quicker, and increases the chances a developer will actually adopt an API. I was reviewing how Google approached the release of the Google+ API this week, and noticed their download section not only contained the usual code libraries, but also contain whats called "starter projects". &nbsp;These starter projects provide a complete framework with everything you need to get start with OAuth, and to start building an application on top of the Google+ API. Does this reflect the future of what API owners should be providing for their developers? &nbsp;Should we be providing web and mobile app starter projects to help get developers up and running with our APIs? &nbsp;These kits could assist them in moving from idea to integration, but starter kits might go even further than that. &nbsp; By providing starter applications projects to our developers we can go beyond faster integration, and also help steer the quality of how applications are designed, ensure they using best coding practices, following security standards, and ultimately delivering better applications that are in line with the goals of the API owner. Companies don't just want developers using their APIs, they want them building quality applications around them, that reflect positively on the API. &nbsp;Starter projects, may be just the way to steer how developers build around an API, and guide them in a positive direction. Starter projects do this from a functional perspective, but another example of this from the UI and branding perspective, can be seen with Twitter's Bootstrap toolkit. &nbsp;Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites, and includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation and everything developers...[<a href="/2011/09/17/providing-code-libraries-is-not-enough-for-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was happy to see Google launch an API for Google + this week. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not chomping at the bit to build anything social on it, but I&rsquo;m glad they made it public.&nbsp; I wanted to take some time to review the API from a technology standpoint, and look at what possibilities it opens up for developers. The Google + API provides a RESTful interface for the newly launched Google social network, Google +, &nbsp;and provides access to profile data and activity streams. &nbsp;The API uses OAuth for authentication and JSON for its request and response formats. That&rsquo;s it. &nbsp;Pretty underwhelming from a developers perspective. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be able to make some badges or widgets, maybe stream my activities in the sidebar of my Wordpress blog. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is my photo access (wait that is in Picassa), or my video access (wait that is in Youtube), &nbsp;or my social events (wait that is in Google Calendar)? Ok, forget about about other content, what about my write access? &nbsp;I want to be able to write to my activity stream and update my profile. &nbsp;I want other apps that I authorize to be able to publish to my activity stream. &nbsp; I'll stop there. &nbsp;Without write access, there is no use railing about lack of application platform, access to circles, and true data portability and ownership via the API. In short, I think Google could have come out of the gate with a little more. &nbsp;Maybe linking up some of my other Google systems via my Google + profile, like Picassa images, and Youtube video. &nbsp;But more importantly developers should have write access. &nbsp;OAuth, plus write access to my social profile and activity stream should have been part of this release. &nbsp;&nbsp;It would have sent the right message to developers.

			<p><em>14 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve come across several APIs lately that rely on getting their data from web scraping. &nbsp;These API owners have written scripts that spider page(s) on a regular schedule, pull content, parse it and clean it up for storage in a database.
Once they&rsquo;ve scraped or harvested this data from the web page source, they then get to work transforming and normalizing for access via a RESTful API. &nbsp;&nbsp;With an API they can now offer a standard interface that reliably pulls data from a database and delivers it in XML or JSON to any developer. &nbsp;
These API owners are still at the mercy of the website source that is being scraped. &nbsp;What if the website changes something? &nbsp;
This is definitely a real problem, and scraping is not the most reliable data source. &nbsp;But if you think about it, APIs can go up and down in availability, making them pretty difficult to work with too. As long as you have failure built into your data acquisition process and hopefully have a plan B, the API can offer a consistent interface for your data.
Web scraping is not an ideal foundation for building a business around, but if the value of the data outweighs the work involved with obtaining, cleaning up, normalizing and delivering the data--then its worth it. &nbsp;&nbsp;And this type of approach to data APIs will continue.
There is far more data available via web pages today then there is from web APIs. &nbsp;This discrepancy leaves a lot of opportunities for web scrapers to build business around data you might own, and you make available online, but haven&rsquo;t made time to open, control and monitor access to it via an APi.
The opportunity to build businesses around scraping will continue in any sector until dependable APIs are deployed that provide reasonable pricing, as well as clear incentive and revenue models for developers to build their businesses on.

     Last week I covered Centralized Geo Data with New InfoChimps API, and talked about how I felt it was a Look at the Future of Data.  After writing I started thinking about other data that is ready for the same type of treatment that InfoChimps is giving geo data.
     
     I was reading Audrey’s post today on O’Reilly today called, A new look for weather data, where she talks with WeatherSpark co-founder Jacob Norda about his company's approach to weather data and visualizations.
     
     Norda talks about where the problems with traditional weather information are, how WeatherSpark gets its data, and how weather data can be improved overall.
     
     It seems weather data suffers from all the same problems as geo data, such as multiple sources, varying schemas, huge datasets that are not easy linked with other sets of data.   Weather data has huge legacy system usage as well as massive growth in generation and consumption with the introduction of sensors and mobile devices.
     
     Norda concludes the interview by saying, “We're considering offering a unified API, but it's in the pre-roadmap stage at this point.”  Seems like a common theme with data and APIs, lately.
     
     What other areas of data are reaching this point, where developers could benefit from a unified API?

          As the API Evangelist for Mimeo, I spend a lot of time looking for other print related APIs. I spent some time today to update my list, and here what I found:
     
     
          
               Enthusem API - Provides card printing services.
          
          
               Google Cloud Print - Enables printing to any cloud-connected printer.
          
          
               Lulu Publishing API - Provides book publishing services.
          
          
               Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API - Provides printing of common business documents like bound, single sheet, poster, cards, binders and booklets.
          
          
               Mimeo Card Printing API - Provides card printing services.

               Mimeo Spiral Notebook Printing API - Provides spiral notebook printing services.
          
          
               Mimeo Poster Printing API - Provides poster printing services.
          
          
               Moo.com - Provides printing of MiniCards, StickerBooks, Postcards, Business Cards and Greeting Cards.
          
          
               Newspaper Club API - Provides access to a layout tool created for building classic looking newspapers designed for print.

               ZetaPrints - Provides web-to-print services for many document types.
          
     
     
          Let's take inventory of what types of printing services are available.  First Google provides a web-based framework for registering, access and printing to any web-enabled printer.  And The Newspaper Club API provides newspaper layout tools.  Those really are print related, but not necessary produce print as a final product.
     
     
          When it comes to actual printing, there are an assortment of business documents including books, binders, newsletters, booklets, cards, spiral notebook.
     
     
          Some big name photo printing services, and nice high end minicards, stickerBooks, postercards, business and greeting cards with Moo.com.
     
     
          If you know of any other print or publishing APIs I should add to the list, let me know.

			<p>I believe that REST and JSON are breaking up the web, into smaller more understandable, re-usable, mashable pieces that potentially anyone can use, even non-developers. I have written several posts on how tools like API explorers and standards like oEmbed are making APIs accessible by non-developers.  And I’m always on the look out for new ideas, for new ways to arm the masses with tools that take advantage of APIs. Evolving on a piece I wrote a couple a months ago about a Widget Builder Environment for APIs, I was envisioning taking Yahoo Pipes to the next level, add in better API support with OAuth, and make it much more simpler to use.  I did not get much time to think about it before Audrey introduced me to if this then that (ifttt).   ifttt allows you to creates tasks.  Tasks are defined like this: when something happens (this) then do something else (that). this (triggers) - The this part of a task is the Trigger. Some example Triggers are "if I'm tagged in a photo on Facebook" or "if I tweet on Twitter."  that (actions) - The that part of a task is the Action. Some example Actions are "then send me a text message" or "then create a status message on Facebook."  Triggers and Actions come from Channels. Channels are the services and devices we use every day, such as:  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, Phone Call or Weather. You can put one channel's trigger together with another channel's action to create a task that runs every 15 minutes and can be turned on and off. Channels are made possible because these services have APIs.  ifttt does a remarkable job at simplifying this in a way, I never even imagined, and allows any user to take advantage of two APIs, apply meaningful business logic, and automate the task to run regularly.   What really makes it cool is you can save tasks as “recipes”...[<a href="/2011/09/13/api-automation-for-the-masses-with-if-this-then-that/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     At TechCrunch DISRUPT, this week in San Francisco, the Weather Underground launched a new Weather API platform that provides developers with real-time access to in-depth weather data.


     The Weather Underground Weather API provides access to data from more than 19,000 users contributing local observations from personal weather stations, providing up-to-the-minute weather conditions for the most finely targeted areas.


     The Weather API is RESTful with responses available in a JSON format, with access free for developers making 500 requests per day, and paid tiers for requests starting at 5K requests per month up to 1M requests per month.


     "Weather Underground already distributes its weather data to many of the world’s leading media companies, weather applications and smaller web properties," said Alan Steremberg, President and co-Founder of Weather Underground. "Our new self-service API platform will open up our data to thousands more developers working on web and mobile programs, big and small."


     The Weather Underground provides a very robust developers area allowing developers to signup, manage their keys and choose the appropriate pricing plan. They provide the necessary API documentation and code samples to get up and going, and even throw in some analytics showing your access and usage of the API.

			<p>The response to Sundays post about the Need for More Transit APIs was impressive.  I receive quite a few emails and tweets about other APIs, and it started a good discussion on Hacker News. Adding more targets for my public transit API research. While doing my research, I just finished looking at OneBusAway, a provider of real-time transit information for the Puget Sound region.  The API was started by University of Washington students to support research on improving the usability of public transportation. At first look, OneBusAway seems like the start of a great model for other city and regional transit API initiatives to follow.  First they start with a RESTful API providing data about transit agencies, routes, arrivals, stops and tripping planning, using an application key for authentication and all the documentation and tools you need to successfully integrate with the API. Next OneBusAway provides a very complete list of tools to make it easier to use public transit Web - A map-based web interface for finding stops, routes, and real-time arrival information. Phone - A touch-tone phone interface for real-time arrival information. SMS - A text-messaging interface for real-time arrival information. iPhone - A native OneBusAway client for iPhones, with location-aware features. Android - A native OneBusAway client for Android phones, with location-aware and notification features. Windows Phone 7 - A native OneBusAway client for Windows Phone 7 phones. Mobile Web - Real-time arrival information optimized for mobile web browsers and text-only web browsers. Explore - The Explore Tool lets you search for nearby restaurants, businesses, parks, and other amenities that are easily accessible by public transit. In addition to providing a API and a full set of interfaces for accessing data from the API, they open-source it all, which means they release all the code that powers OneBusAway, for anyone to use.   That includes their iPhone and Android mobile applications, letting other developers take advantage of all the work that's been put into OneBusAway.

			<p>I’m working on some more stories around municipal data APIs, based upon two stories I found recently, where developers took it upon themselves to scrape data, launch APIs, and build mobile tools around local municipal transit data: Madison Transit API - Greg Tracy of Madison, WI has a great story on his journey to build a simple SMS app and ended building an entire API.  Greg wanted an SMS app that could deliver real-time arrival estimates, to meet his needs as a commuter.  After much pain scraping the Madison Transit site for data, he felt he should prevent others from having to do the same, and published an API around his data.  But Greg also wanted to find a way to contribute to the larger mission of opening up a public dataset to make it more accessible, opening up opportunities for his communities to operate more efficiently. Swedish Train API - Erik Pettersson did the same thing in Sweden.  In his frequent travels as a freelancer, Erik was frustrated by the lack of information available, leaving him often sitting at a station wondering when the next train was.  From this frustration, Erik created a simple SMS service where travelers can text their train number, and receive updates on delayed arrivals, departures or even track changes at given stations.  His data was scraped from the Swedish Transport Administration, and in a year of operation, the API has spawned other applications for iOS, Android and Windows Mobile.   I still haven't fully flushed out my stories around both these municipal APIs, but it sure smells like an opportunity for some tech companies to get involved.  You a captured audience of commuters across the globe, needing more information about their daily bus, train and subway.  This need is so great, tech savvy commuters are scraping and building their own systems to meet this need.   I know Google is stepping up to serve this space with Google Maps...[<a href="/2011/09/11/the-need-for-more-transit-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I followed the Jonthan&rsquo;s Card Socal Experiment closely. The whole time I had an entry on my to do list, to write a story about it. I never successfully found an angle I could get behind, then Audrey said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just write about he tech behind it?&rdquo;. Great idea! Jonathan&rsquo;s Card is interesting as a social or marketing experiment, but I am more interested in the technology that was used to make it happen, not just the social experiment. It all starts with an image of Jonathan&rsquo;s Starbucks Card. But it took the mobility of the smart phone to be able to display the image of his sard and purchase a coffee at your local Starbucks. An image and your smart phone are essential technology in this experiment, but none of this would be possible without the Starbucks Card program. Starbucks allows anyone to purchase and add money to the balance of the card as long as you know the card number, and the site also allows you to see charges made against the card. The Starbucks Card is the central ingredient in this experiment, but Twitter also plays an important role. Jonathan uses Twitter as a central messaging channel, and ultimately an API for the Johnathan&rsquo;s Card Experiment. He wrote a bot that scrapes the Starbucks site for the card balance and posts it to Twitter, whenever anything is charged to the Starbucks Card. Twitter is also being used by the community participating in this &ldquo;social experiment&rdquo;. Twitter allows them to tweet at @jonathanscard adding to the Twitter data stream. Also, some innovative developer particpated by adding graphing apps on top of the @jonathanscard Twitter stream, that provided visualisations for the experiment. Additionally, to provide easier access for developers, Jonathan whipped up a simple read only API providing insight into the experiment in the following ways: Balances - Returns the card balance for every minute of the day Latest Activity - Returns...[<a href="/2011/09/10/beyond-the-social-experiment-jonathans-card-is-the-new-gift-card-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

APIs Drive the New Touch.Salesforce.com Platform - Last week at the Dreamforce event in San Francisco, Saleforce.com unveiled its new mobile platform called touch.salesforce.com. Built with HTML5, touch.salesforce.com will allow users to access salesforce.com apps on iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. At Dreamforce, Saleforce.com acknowledged that the future of the enterprise is both social and mobile, and the Salesforce.com APIs are a driving force.

			<p>Someone asked me about APIs dealing with water and utilities a couple weeks ago.  So I dove in to see what I could find related to APIs for city, county and state water management. First I came cross, what sees like a pretty good model for city water services with the Wellington NZ City Water Service Pipes.  The Wellington Water Service API provides programmatic access to water and drainage data to assist in planning works that are in proximity to water and drainage infrastructure. Next the Emery Water Conservancy District in central Utah provides sensor data from weather, canal, reservoir, pond and river monitoring sites via the MetriDyne API.  The MetriDyne API provides immediate access to data from these sites, leading to better and timely information leads to better water management. Then in Canada there is a pretty interesting initiative to create an open source web platform that will aggregate, federate, and connect water data and information enabling users to access, mashup, analyze, model and interpret water data, information, issues and opportunities, called the Water and Environmental Hub. That was really it, when it came to water related APIs.  They are all three really great models when it comes to looking at the future of water management using APIs. I would throw in another API i found from NASA called the MODAPS Web Services which provides an API to access the data products provided by the Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), providing programmatic access to atmosphere, weather and ocean data. There are also some software solutions for water, energy and utility management that include APIs: ArcFM Solution Overview - maintenance of electric, gas, fiber optic, water and wastewater facility WaterObjects.NET - Gives you complete and programmatic access to Bentley’s water modeling technology, from numerical methods and water modeling capabilities to mapping, data management, and result presentation features Beyond data and software for water management, there is the water, weather and environmental...[<a href="/2011/09/09/a-flood-of-apis-just-waiting-to-happen/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Have you ever tried to get data from a government agencies website? &nbsp;Often, when you find what your looking for, its in a PDF format. &nbsp;Not really a data friendly format. &nbsp;If your lucky, you will find a spreadsheet, but usually they are laid out in a report format and not meant for actual data portability.I have a personal obsession for finding, crunching and making sense out of local, state, and federal government data. &nbsp;I'm willing to do a lot of work to derive meaning about how our government works. &nbsp;I personally feel its my duty to lend a hand, but while doing so, I often get overwhelmed parsing PDF files and often have to rearrange data by hand, or just give up on my project entirely.I've always blamed the the "government bureaucracy for this--it is some sort of conspiracy to hide what is really going on. However, recently I'm beginning to change my tune. &nbsp;I'm getting a feeling that maybe it goes deeper then with government operations. &nbsp;Its the technology they are given. &nbsp;While trying to understand more about the technology our government uses, I came across a post by Matt MacDonald. &nbsp;Matt is trying to get data from his local town of Watertown, MA. &nbsp;After looking around he encountered the same issues. &nbsp;All he could get were PDFs and Excel "reports", which seems to be the common language of government when comes to data portability.After not getting what he was looking for he went to the source, the company that built the tools his town used, TylerTech. &nbsp;TylerTech builds systems for municipalities to manage services ranging from property taxes to school information systems.Matt reached out to TylerTech, and asked whether or not they had an API for their systems available for their town, but he&rsquo;s just gotten a couple cookie cutter responses, and no real information. &nbsp;&nbsp;I reached out to TylerTech for comment on this story, and have not received a response.As I...[<a href="/2011/09/06/every-city-county-and-state-should-have-an-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Mashape, the upcoming, self-service marketplace for APIs, which provides a platform to distribute, consume and manage cloud based APIs, has just closed $1.5M in seed funding. The round was led by NEA, with Index Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Ignition&nbsp;Partners participating, and on the angel side of things, Jeff Bezos and&nbsp;Eric Schmidt&rsquo;s Innovation Endeavors, as well as Erik Rannala, Russell Siegelman and&nbsp;Rick Webb jumped in.Mashape is one of the most recent additions to the API management space, providing an end to end solution allowing you to deploy, manage and market your API from within the Mashape platform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mashape provides API management tools that can be found with other providers like Mashery, Apigee and 3Scale, but where they stand out is they also provide you with a library to deploy your API, auto-generate the code developers will need to integrate with your API, and a social API marketplace to generate attention and drive adoption around your API.&ldquo; We have a very long term vision, we believe APIs will play a major role in theworld of Information Technology for the years to come - the interesting partis that even companies not related to Internet as a core business, are nowintegrating APIs into their products, such Toyota or Nike.&rdquo; Mashape&rsquo;s CEOAugusto Marietti says.&ldquo; If we take a look into those startups that have more than 30 people, we notice that most of them are hiring 2 new positions: API evangelist and API engineer. Thosepositions would never have existed 3 years ago. A new market is coming.&rdquo;Mashape steps into a space that is already dominated by heavy-weights like Layer7 and SOA Software, and has new players like Apigee, Mashery and 3Scale offering business and enterprise API solutions. &nbsp;But Mashape brings a fresher, more social offering, that will appeal to the API hacker in all of us, and with a little more money in their pocket, maybe they can give the other players some serious competition in this new API...[<a href="/2011/09/06/api-marketplace-mashape-raises-1-5m-seed-round/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Even though I cover the entire industry around APIs here on API Evangelist, I also am the API Evangelist for Mimeo Connect. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mimeo is a printing API that allows you to print a wide variety of business documents, using your Mimeo.com account. &nbsp;Its pretty powerful stuff, if you think about it, an API that is connected to 3 print facilities. &nbsp; The API seems pretty straightforward at first glance, but developers seem to be encountering three major obstacles: Mimeo.com Accounts - Users don&rsquo;t like having to get a developer account as well as sandbox and live Mimeo.com accounts to work with the API Mimeo Documents - Developers don&rsquo;t really have time to build and define the documents before integration, they just want to print a specific document, and pass some settings to change it up. Sandbox and Live Environments - It is great that Mimeo has sandbox and live environments, but developers were expected to maintain two separate environments, just to use the system. These three areas proved to be the difference between some users adopting, and others walking away. &nbsp;There was too much work in navigating the world of Mimeo accounts and documents. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t hard if your already a Mimeo web to print user, but if your a developer you just want to print. &nbsp;So I created four virtualized print APIs. &nbsp;&nbsp;I took a REST framework and deployed four separate &ldquo;document printing APIs&rdquo;: Poster Printing API Flyer &amp; Brochure Printing API Card Printing API Spiral Notebook API Then using 3Scale self-service API management solution I deployed an API area to handle documentation, forum and developer registration and API key management. &nbsp;Each API has seven methods for ordering print documents: Proof (POST) Proof (GET) Quote (GET) Shipping Options (GET) Order Quote (GET) Place Order (POST) Order Status (GET) All a developer has to do is register for a set of keys, grab a code sample and get to work. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t have to setup...[<a href="/2011/09/05/virtualized-document-printing-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

I was out growing what I could do with Wordpress, and had too much data and other research I need to link together to show the bigger picture of whats going on with APIs.API Evangelist has always been a hybrid Wordpress blog and custom CMS system system I wrote. &nbsp;Over the last couple months I rewrote my CMS, and re-lauched with 7 new systems:

Blog
Industries
APIs&nbsp;
Building Blocks
Service Providers
Tools
Events

These content systems each have their own database, and are linked together by a central tagging system, and I have established relationships between each of the databases as necessary.v2.0 allows me to store data I gather from around the web in a more structured way, &nbsp;one that allows me to identify patterns and trends easier and also opens up more opportunities for discovery here on the site.I have a whole bunch of APIs, tools, services etc. to put into the system, but I couldn't wait anymore and wanted to launch the new site. &nbsp;If you see any problems, let me know please.&nbsp;

			<h3><a href="/2011/09/03/uk-national-archives-launches-api/">"UK National Archives Launches API"</a></h3>
			<p><em>03 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     The National Archives has published a new API, as part of an ongoing program to get more public records online, according to ComputerWeekly.com.


     The National Archives API provides programmatic access to over 11 million records from the discovery service catalogue, broken down into a seven-level hierarchical structure:


     Department - Government department, agency or body that creates the records
     
     Division - Administrative section of a department
     
     Series - The main grouping of records with a common function or subject
     
     Sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     
     Sub sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     
     Piece - A piece can be a box, volume or file
     
     Item - A part of a piece. It can be a bundle, a single document, a sub-file, etc.
     


     Access is provided without restriction or charging for content, but costs $3.50 per document to retrieve the same records online through the website.


     Aleksandr Drozdov, architect for the National Archives, said they have been speaking with academic historians to help them find ways to use the API in their research, and they are very interested in access to the archives in a programmatic way.


     According to Computer Weekly the National Archives is also working an e-commerce system. Since private companies have been paying the National Archives 52M since 2002 for the digitization of paper records they could then resell through websites, the API and associated e-commerce system are a perfect fit.


     The move by the National Archive may prove a great model for other institutions to not only open up access to their collections, but provide new ways to derive revenue from collections, and allow for commercial use of images, documents and other items that have been historically very hard to access.

			<p><em>01 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API that brings together geographic data from multiple sources, connects it with a standardized schema, and delivers it to developers through a single API. When pulling geo data from APIs, developer may not always get the most complete data, but they just deal with it, because we don't always have the time to pull data from multiple APIs. InfoChimps does this for developers, making it possible to have the best data from many sources. Once InfoChimps downloads the data from multiple sources, they tie the data together, making relationships and connections between disparate data, using the Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS). So no matter what the original data source is, there is a consistent, complete and expressive description of a collection of related data its associated assets. InfoChimps doesn't stop at downloading and standardizing access to this geo data, they also tackle displaying potentially large volumes of data. When you look at data from a large geographic region, the amount of data to display for users can very large. Developers are faced with questions of how to group and summarize for display. The Infochimps Geo API provides a summarizer feature that will group data based on intelligent clusters, making the data easier to display, and more meaningful. Next InfoChimps also provides multiple ways to query geo data, allowing developers to query based upon latitude and longitude, as well as other geographic locators like street address, bounding box or any dimension that can be mapped back to a location. This type of geo data querying opens up a whole new ways for developers to empower their users to discover. Then if aggregating from multiple sources, providing a standardized schema, intelligent summaries, and multiple query options wasn't enough, they are also pushing the traditional notions of what is geo data. They've included Wikipedia articles as sources, and opened up the possibility for tying any data set to a location, using the Infochimps...[<a href="/2011/09/01/centralized-geo-data-with-new-infochimps-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Sep 2011</em></p>
			<p>I finally made some time to write up a review of the new Infochimps Geo API, and I think their approach gives us a glimpse at the future of data APIs.
With the new Infochimps Geo API, Infochimps provides some very important features for developers:

Aggregation of data from multiple sources
Tying together with a simple schema
Intelligent clustering and summarization
Provide a flexible query interface
Allow linking with other data sets

These are all problems developers face when working with Geo data, but they are also problems that are encountered when working with other data sets.
The future of delivering data via APIs is not just about providing access to the data via a simple RESTful interface (though that is a great start). It is also about actually solving the common problems developers face when integrating the data into their applications.
I think InfoChimps approach provides a model for other data APIs, and shows they have a viable business model that makes them more than just a data marketplace.

Along with the SSL switch they are letting developers know they will also be eventuallydeprecatingBasic Auth for the Twitter Streaming API, and encouraging everyone to use OAuth.
SSL and OAuth are fast becoming standards for APIs, and it seems wise to implement with the first version of the API, rather than having to force developers to switch down the road.

			<p><em>25 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Back in May Googledeprecatedthe free version of the Google Translate API, and pissed off a lot of people along the way. I talked about building your business around Google or any other APIs, and even suggested that Google offer a paid version of the API instead of just shutting down.
Today Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API that provides a programmatic interface to access Google's machine translation technology, supporting translations in over 50 languages.
The paid version of Google Translate API costs $20 per million (M) characters of text translated (or approximately $0.05/page, assuming 500 words/page), and allows up to 50 M chars/month.
Google has give a limit of 100K chars / day until 12/1/2011 for developers who had already created projects in the API console that used the Translate API version 2 prior to today.
It sounds like Google has decided on a solid business model that will keep the translation API alive, and allow developers to commercially integrate the service into their applications. Google Tranlsate API is now integrated into the Google API Console, and is now one of four Google APIs that have pricing / billing frameworks to support them.
Google could have done a better PR job by deprecating the free version of the API at the same time as offering a paid version, but I think Google is trying to figure out how to manage and monetize their APIs just like the rest of us.

			<p><em>24 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I was just reading a post at Mindtouch on having conditional documentation using MindTouch TCS. MindTouch TCS is a social knowledge-base, that can be used in building help systems and support communities.
The post made me think about the API space and smart API documentation like Posterous, and Masherys new I/O docs for APIs. These are all approaches to making documentation more intelligent and personalized to whoever is reading the documentation.
Masherys I/O docs, and smart API documentation allow developers to make API calls from within the documentation, making learning about APIs more interactive. This is a great approach to help developers learn about APIs, but I think we can go even further.
Can we make API documentation even more personalized? Can my API documentation know which language I'm using? Can code samples be in my native language? Should the documentation automatically know whether I'm making a web or mobile app?
The information needed to make the documentation smarter could be gathered when developers apply for an application key. Then documentation can then be dynamically tailored specifically for each application.
Quality API documenation is a huge stumbling point for many developers. How can we make documentation better meet developers needs? Where else can we personalize the APIdocumentationexperience?

			<p><em>24 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I just finished the NYTimes article, United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals. This follows Alaska Airlines adopting the iPad, and Delta Airlines testing the iPad as a viable alternative to on-board manuals.
I don't think of the iPad as enterprise tool. It is a consumer tool, so this type of large scale adoption of the iPad at United, Alaska and potentially Delta says a lot. These major companies have made decisions that tablets, more specifically the iPad, and mobile applications are the future of their business operations.
These applications are driven by APIs. APIs provide the flight, weather and other real-time information that drive these mobile applications, and make the iPad a viable tool in the cockpit.
The growth in APIs over the last 6 years has been driven by social media and cloud computing, and more recently the iPhone and Android led mobile revolution. A large portion of these movements are driven by a grassroots, consumer dominated user base, outside of the traditional IT ranks. Mainstream enterprise and business IT are just now waking up to the potential of the social, and mobile Internet operating in the clouds, and the role APIs play in this.
It shows that the enterprise are coming around, and APIs aren't just the latest trend, and more companies will be deploying systems and devices that depend on APIs, to get business done.

			<p><em>16 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>We hear about the struggles of newspapers, magazines, and book publishers to stay relevant in the digital age on almost a daily basis these days. Many of these publishers are sitting on a treasure chest of content, but are unable to understand how to unlock them -- to make the content accessible in a way that allows them to retain control, adhere to existing licensing agreements, and make money in a world quickly being dominated by the iPad and Kindle. For those of us who live and breathe APIs, its easy for us to understand the power of a simple RESTful interace when it comes to content, but for publishing dinosaurs, it is much harder. I wrote a post back in May about the publishing company Pearson, looking to unlock their content with a new API platform. Pearson made good on their promise, and launched the Pearson Plug &amp; Play Platform at the end of July. The platform includes three content APIs: DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide API: Provides information about hotels, restaurants, bars and shops in London, plus insider tips on everything from where to find the best markets and traditional pubs to great attractions for children. Financial Times (FT) Press API: Provides access to over 500 articles on business, management, marketing and science from award winning authors who deliver timely and authoritative content. Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API: Rich multimedia dictionary containing over 230,000 words, phrases and meanings plus examples and pronunciations as MP3 and pictures. At first glance these APIs may not seem like much. There are other travel, business, and dictionary APIs available already. But for a publishing power house like Pearson, this is a big move. These APIs will provide a model for how the publisher prepares, gives access, controls and monetizes content for any new material as well as their vast archives, in the future.

			<p><em>13 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm always on the lookout for innovative data sets and examples of APIs that provide value in ever-day life. APIs are often a very geeky thing, and I'm always trying to find examples of APIs that make sense to my mainstream audience, and help me explain what APIs are, and the value they can deliver.
I found a story from John Mertens of Code for America, about building a Famers Market API, which I think tells a great story about how anyone with a need, can take a valuable dataset and make it available using an API.
Like many of us Mertens loves getting his fruit and vegetables from a local Farmers Market. He was new to the San Francisco area and was unsure how to find the local Farmers Market. After Googling he found the USDA web site which has a great web application to search for Farmers Markets in the United States. It is a great tool, and they also allow you todownload a spreadsheet of the data, but there is no API to build an application on.
So being a data geek (I totally understand), Merts felt compelled to liberate this data using an API, which he build using a couple of freely available technologies:

     Exported the Famers Market dataset using the USDA export to excel
     
     Normalized the data using Google Refine
     
     Uploaded it to a free couchdb instance
     
     Added a map using the open-source geocouch-utils CouchApp
     
Mertens did all this for free. The data was freely available, the tools he used are free, and the hosting of the API is free as well. I'm not sure I'd depend on his API for commercial purposes, but it is a great demonstration how take a data-set and publish as an API, to fill a specific niche.
Now anyone can build an application around Farmers Market data using his Farmers Market API.

			<p>Google just put up a new Google+ Platform blog today, to support the growing demand around their new social platform.
Developers have been waiting for the release of the Google+ API, so they can get to work building Google+ applications. While Google did put up aGoogle+ developers signup form, there has been no other word about access to the Google+ APIs.
Apparently, todays launch of games on Google+ represents the first wave of developers using the Google+ APIs. Google chose to release the Google+ API to a small number of gaming partners so they could experiment, gather feedback and work the kinks out of the Google+ APIs before releasing it into the wild.
It shows they are starting to allow developers into the Google+ APIs, but I am sure they are prioritizing their partners, and unless your a Zynga or a Popcap, I doubt you'll get early access.
It seems wise of Google to open up access to game developers first, after the major success of the Facebook API platform was around gaming.

			<p><em>10 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>With all of the technology available to us, the way we express ourselves online and interact between web applications is still in its infancy. The two most common examples of online interaction are the share and like, which are like grunts and groans in online expression. However they are a very ubiquitous form of showing how you feel about a news article, discussion, event, song, video and many other things we interact with every day. On my blog I can give users a couple of basic actions to interact with my posts: share, link, favorite, vote up and down. These are pretty basic actions in the grand vision of the Internet. Because of the popularity of Facebook, the like has become a common expression for the web. So how do we evolve beyond this homogenized, like based world we've created? Google and Mozilla are trying to evolve the actions available to us with the concept of Web Intents. Both companies are building this spec into their browsers, but Google seems to be taking it a step further with their Web Intents API. This web platform API will provide the same benefits of Android Intents, but better suited for web applications. With Web Intents, you will be able to connect your web app or site to a service with a couple lines of code, and the browser will handle the rest. A web intent based application will let users request a generic action like share or like, triggering this action, and the user is presented with a list of registered apps that can handle the requested intent. When selected, the action is triggered, information passed, and the intended action is fulfilled. Web Intents will start with the usual of intent actions like edit, view, and share, but it will create a framework allowing new types of web intents to evolve.

			<p><em>09 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Factual just launched a new API that will centralize how physical places are represented within Factual data-sets, and across 3rd party APIs, dubbed the Factual Crosswalk API.
Data about physical places is notoriously messy, and with number of providers, and the growing value of location based data, its only going to get messier. Factual is aiming to normalize places data across the web by providing a central ID to link individual entries across multiple data providers.
Using the Factual Crosswalk API you can retrieve a place by providing its Factual ID or any associated URL, either way you get a complete record from the Factual database, and URLs to its associated IDs and locations. The Factual Crosswalk API can be used to link to data across the Internet, as well as cleaning and standardizing local data sets.

Taking the lead in providing centralized storage and API for data-sets will help make Factual the goto place when looking for places data, and it will also make them a source when discovering multiple sources for places online.
The Factual Crosswalk API is free for now, and is only available in the United States, but they are looking to roll-out the service for 40+ countries in the near future. Factual has partnered with multiple data providers to create this centralized resource, and they are welcoming other providers to participate.

			<p><em>08 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Hackathons are becoming a popular vehicle worldwide for identifying talent, sharing ideas, tackling big data, building apps, and providing a forum for developers, graphic designers and business minds to network.
Hackthons were born out of the Silicon Valley start-up scene. During these events, companies bring together a group of developers, give them a coding target, allow them to break into teams where they build a plan and hack together apps, mobile apps, and other web services that meet the criteria of the event.
Hackathons are now being held in Seattle, Los Angeles, London, Paris, New York and beyond. Other start-up groups and incubators have seen the value in holding these coding events and bringing together the best minds in their community, hoping to bring attention to their event on the world wide tech scene.
The success of hackathons as an innovation vehicle is spreading beyond general coding and the start-up community. There are hackathons coming up for photos, water, sustainability, health, government and I just finished covering Hacking Education, an event hosted by DonorsChoose.org, to challenged developers to create apps and data visualizations with the its API that would engage the public and have an impact on education.
Its exciting to see Hackathons being used outside of Silicon Valley. I would like to see the Hackathon format evolve and be applied to other areas, like manufacturing, real estate, mining, livestock, farming and beyond. Hackathons hold a lot of power in bringing together talented minds and ideas, and creating a fertile environment for innovation to occur.
It's important to remember that the technology produced at Hackathons is not always the most important outcome of these events. It's about bringing together the right minds and sharing ideas that can result in people going back to their everyday life with a new perspective and can encourage them to make a real impact in their daily lives.
What industries would most benefit from holding Hackathons?

			<p><em>05 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I've written about the essential building blocks necessary for a successful API, and there are other great posts like, What Developers Say About API Documentation from Peter Gruenbaum of SDK Bridge.
Everyone seems pretty unanimous that a RESTful API, with simple and complete documentation, qualitiy code samples in the popular languages, and real API support from the owner and the community are the ingredients for a successful API.
Iparticipatedin a chat about APIs on Twitter, where amix of API influencers, owners, advocates, evangelists and developers hung out for about an hour, answering questions posed by @retailigence. Overall there were about seven questions asked, but the second one was simple, and thought provoking:
What is the most important characteristic of an API?
The common building blocks were rattled off (by myself included): REST, quality documentation, code samples, while other said more innovative things like API explorer or Masherys I/O Docs. Then @infochimps said reliability &amp; usefulness.
This started some side conversations and got me thinking. Does the overall value an API deliver and its reliability trump its RESTfulness, documentation and available code samples?
I would say definitely, yes! It is true that a RESTful API, with simple and clear documentation, and code samples are a must have. But if your API doesn't offer clear value and reliably deliver on this value, no amount of documentation or code samples is going to work.
These are all pretty basic concepts at first glance, but it is a reminder where to focus your resources when it comes to your API.

			<p>I was just working on a piece for ProgrammableWeb about the new Yahoo WebPlayer, which is amedia player that can play video and audio from any site or service, and be distributed across the web.
While browsing around the Yahoo WebPlayer site I came to the Terms of Service, which I found three items that stand out:
Yahoo! can update and change this Agreement and TOS by posting a new version without notice to you.
You understand and agree that the Player may allow for advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Yahoo! to provide the Player for your use.
Yahoo! Media Player is free, but Yahoo! reserves the right to charge fees for future use of or access to the Player at Yahoo!'s sole discretion.
I think these are pretty standard rules of the road that us publishers and developers are getting used when integrating with APIs and deploying gadgets, widgets and other embeddable tools. But they don't give us much build upon, as a content publisher, or developer trying to build a business.
I cannot see into the future, and I understand the problems providers face, but these terms seem pretty wide open, in favor of the provider. What can we do to make terms of services (TOS) for APIs and other tools more in support of the community a provider is targeting with these services?
I don't have the answers, just asking the question. This bizdev 2.0 stuff is a lot harder than we anticipated.

			<p>Each day Federal agencies publish documents in the Federal Register. These documents include proposed rules, final rules, public notices, and Presidential actions. The print-based version of the Federal Register can be difficult to read, process and access, so the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), who all joined forces to launch the FederalRegister.gov website, also deployed an API. The goal of the initiative was to make it even easier for developers to build new ways of interacting with Federal Register data, making it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in the Government decision-making process. The Federal Register API is RESTful, with no keys required for authentication and responses in a JSON format. They even provide a simple JSON interface for callbacks. All data in the Federal Register is updated daily by 6 a.m., and is published Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, and consists of four types of entries: Presidential Documents - Executive orders and proclamations Rules and Regulations - Policy statements and interpretations of rules Proposed Rules - Petitions for rulemaking and other advance proposals Notices - Scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public, grant applications, administrative orders, and other announcements of government actions The Federal Register API is meant to deliver print-based material in machine-readable formats, to make the Federal Register more searchable, accessible, easier to digest, and easier to share withother systems. The Federal Registers, encourages every citizen to become more involved in the workings of their government and to make their voices heard on the things that matter to them, from the smallest to the largest issues.

			<p><em>02 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>Last week at OSCON, I wrote about Mashery's release of their new I/O Docs. Mashery I/O Docs are a combination of API documentation and an API explorer, allowing developers to make requests on an API inline while browsing the API reference materials.
I/O Docs provides an interactive documentation system for RESTful web APIs. By defining APIs at the resource, method and parameter levels in a JSON schema, I/O Docs will generate a JavaScript client interface. API calls can be executed directly from the documentation interface, proxied through the I/O Docs server, producing formatted responses.
Mashery has open-sourced a version of the I/O Docs on Github, for any API owner to deploy for their own documentation. This version of I/O docs runs on Node.js and uses Redis as a data store.
Last year Apigee launched their API console which allows users to also make calls against an API, and earlier this year they made it freely available for any API owner to deploy. The API console is a popular tool with developers to get up and going using an API, and build an understanding how an API works. Apigees move to make free was a significant market play, and definitely built awareness of their platform.
Masherys approach to API exploration reflects an alternative view from Apigees, one that integrates API discovery with API documentation, as opposed to being an entirely separate tool. Masherys move to open-source their I/O Docs on Github, is great to see. I'm sure it will definitely attract more attention to their platform and tools.
You can download or fork the Mashery I/O Docs on Github, and find necessary installation info and documentation.

			<p><em>01 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I had a discussion yesterday with Audrey Wattersabout the infamous junk drawer(s) that exists in every house. That end of the counter drawer that seems to accumulate everything from around our house that we think we may some day use. Junk drawers possess those small items that hold our lives together. Nuts, bolts, fasteners, knobs, hinges and handles as well as the tools we use to assemble the futon, bikes, shelves and other household appliances. We keep all these items because we don't want to throw them away. We will use them some day right? We all live with this delusion. I have no hard data on what we actually use from the junk drawer, but we all have them, and I'm sure many of us have just taken that entire drawer to the Goodwill, sold at a yard sale, or worse.....thrown away. Instead of having a junk drawer, what if we could take a picture of each object with our mobile devices. The mobile app would use image recognition or some sort of image scanning to identify the object. The mobile application would scan potentially millions of parts and pieces to identify this little piece of treasure in our lives. Once identified it would pull all meta data related to it, identifying it as a screw, faster for a futon or drawer handle from IKEA. We could create a virtual junk drawer of all these items. Once cataloged in our virtual junk drawer, we could properly dispose of in a recycling bin, Goodwill donation bag, or items in garage for the big yard sale that will make us rich. No more physical junk drawer. We could access our virtual junk drawer at any time, in an online environment. When that magical time comes, and we actually need the exact same screw, knob, fastener or obscure alan wrench we could search in our virtual junk drawer and pull up the item. Then we could either...[<a href="/2011/08/01/my-3d-printed-junk-drawer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I just finished reading two great posts about battles within API ecosystems.Convoluted TOS and "Open" APIs Will Be the Death of Us by Shion Deysarkar and Topify to Go Dark as Twitter Claims Another Dev Victim by Louis Gray. I recommend you read, and form your own opinion. I'm totally behind Shion in, ..arguing that the breaching parties (i.e. the developers holding the API key) should not be held in contempt of court, as it were. When it comes to terms of service disagreements, there needs to be more discussion. I also feel Topify's pain in their decision to, ..shut down the service, rather than chasing after Twitter's continued meandering API road-map. This makes it very difficult to build a business on Twitters API. I am the biggest advocate for the developer when it comes to these ecosystems battles. API developers often deliver on the promise of an API, but seldom see the reward. However I also feel the pain of API owners. How are you supposed to have an API that delivers true value, is sustainable, makes all your developers happy, and have terms of service and a roadmap that is all knowing and sees into the future, and promises never to step on your developers toes. I see both sides of the argument, however I feel much of the trouble Twitter and other API owners run into, is the result of not properly sharing its roadmap with developers. If Twitter shared its road-map earlier, and more consistently with its developers, and also allowed feedback periods before launching, I think there would a lot less backlash--even if the community didn't always win 100% in the resulting decision. How "open" an API owner is with their road-map obviously is entirely up to them. They have trade secrets to protect, and many other considerations when managing a roadmap. However you should identify a consistent time frame in which to give the developer community a heads up...[<a href="/2011/08/01/how-open-should-we-be-with-our-api-roadmaps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>One of my Google Alerts picked up on something interesting today. A PHP code library for the Github Gist API, for sale on the code marketplace CodeCanyon for $2.00.
I almost just closed the window, but then thought a little more about it. I think its the first time I've seen a code libraries for sale like this. I've seen more robust integrations and API clients for sale, but never a simple library for working with an API.
The Github Gist API is well documented and there is a PHP library for the Github API available for free on the site. It doesn't look like it has Gist API support yet, but is well written, and shows you how to exend the PHP class.
Seems like there is a narrow window where you could build an API code library and make money off selling it before a free library is available, or is it also possible to sell them even when there are other free libraries available?
I will keep watching for other API code libraries for sell on CodeCanyon and elsewhere, see if this is a growing trend. I prefer to just open source mine on Github, for the entire community to put to use.

			<p><em>31 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>I was reviewing the image recognition API from Moodstocks, for a story on ProgrammableWeb today, and discovered another API management story I feel should be told. Its a story about bootstrapping your API management using existing free and low cost services.
Before users adopt your API, it can be hard to justify costs around using paid API management services to support your developer ecosystem (because at that stage the ecosystem often doesn't exist). Moodstocks approach to its API community was a great example of bootstrapping API management until you can afford more.
For managing its documentation, code libraries, articles and FAQs, Moodstocks turned to Github for help. Github provides these tools for free, and are great for delivering these API management essentials.
For developer support, Moodstocks uses Vanilla Forums for its forum, and Campfire for chat support. Moodstocks uses a nicely skinned copy of Wordpress for its blog, and has a solid social media approach using Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube.
With this bootstrapped approach, it was up to Moodstocks to deliver its own API processes: rate limiting, security and other reporting features. But when it came to management the startup chose a nice selection of free and low cost services to delivery services to its API community.

			<p><em>28 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Layer 7 Technologies introduced a new OAuth Toolkit, ageneralized framework for handling a broad range of OAuth scenarios across cloud, web and mobile applications.
OAuth is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data, and is a popular method to allow secure API authorization, enabling websites to provide a more streamlined user login experience with the additional benefits of enhanced privacy and security.
The Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit is the first solution of its kind that enables enterprises to control policy and identity aspects of many different OAuth token operations, a capability that is particularly important as enterprises increasingly use OAuth to authorize access to APIs in cloud settings, said Phil Walston, vice president of products at Layer 7 Technologies. By allowing enterprises to seamlessly manage their OAuth implementations as the standard evolves, the toolkit simplifies operations while providing rigorous security and control.
Features of the Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit are:

	Policy and identity controls to handle HMAC-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signature methods, SAML and OAuth WRAP
	Mix and match implementations of OAuth with SAML
	Ability to drop in new signature and credential methods without changing APIs

Layer 7's new OAuth Toolkit supports a variety of standards, including OAuth 1a, OAuth 2.0, SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, WS-Trust, REST and JSON.
Layer 7 will be demonstrating its OAuth Toolkit at the Layer 7 Hospitality Suite at Gartner's Catalyst Conference at the San Diego Hilton Bayfront, Aqua Room 311, from 6:00 - 9:00 p.m., July 26-29.

			<p>INRIX�, an international provider of traffic information, and driving services, announced a commitment of $37 million in funding led by Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers' (KPCB) Green Growth Fund and August Capital. The investment will be used as part of a continued global expansion and R&amp;D efforts focused on the company's in-car, location based services (LBS) and mobile applications businesses. With over 150 industry-leading customers across 8 different distribution channels, a profitable business, and nearly 90 percent compound annual revenue growth over the past 3 years, INRIX did not need to raise capital, said Bryan Mistele, president and CEO of INRIX. However, given new market opportunities including the rapid adoption of our premium traffic services, increasing demand from automakers for global solutions and the explosion of LBS on mobile devices, we're accelerating several investments designed to firmly cement our global leadership position. The investment by KPCB Green Growth Fund and August Capital show the growth of the LBS data market, and resulting APIs that gather and deliver this data to mobile applications. Traffic congestion costs the U.S. economy upwards of $155 billion dollars annually. Last year alone, US drivers wasted 3.9 billion gallons of fuel sitting idle in traffic, and the US is a small part of a much larger and growing global traffic problem, commented Michael Linse, partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers. We believe that INRIX is uniquely positioned to help improve the efficiency of our cars in ways that reduce fuel consumption and improve sustainability for all. We are experiencing a convergence of automotive and mobile efforts that leverage the latest smart devices, data analytics and connectivity technologies that improve how the world's one billion drivers travel from place to place.

Somewhere I could apply all my strengths, and stay relevant and at the forefront of a fast changing tech landscape. As part of this effort, I spent some time considering what areas dominated the past 5 years of my career. Looking at my resume, social media and cloud computing were the two major themes. Then I put some thought into what technology is dominating right now, and will continue growing in the next couple years. The answer was mobile technology. Looking to apply what I know, but also be relevant and competitive in the future, I wanted to find a common thread. What did all of these areas have in common? It was clearly application programming interfaces, or more specifically, web APIs. APIs drove the social media revolution from Flickr to Twitter, reinvented IT with cloud computing, and is a driving force behind mobile applications. I found an area to focus my energy, but do I have the skills needed to work with APIs. What is needed to be successful with an API? I set off to study all the top APIs out there and answer this question. After much research, success with an API seemed to boil down to equal parts technical, business, and marketing. It sounded like a fit for my skills. Successful APIs like Amazon, Twilio and Google all had one thing in common. They had developer advocates or technical evangelists. This is what I wanted to do. What skills are required to be an API developer advocate or evangelist? Hacker - You have to have a love of hacking.

Regardless, more of my world is living in the clouds. The file open dialog box just doesn't have the same meaning in the clouds. Its a desktop, localized tool. When we open it, we see that local desktop mess we've created and maintained (well sort of). When we open a web dialog, we don't see much.

Beyond the fuzzy plans for how API owners intend to make money, even more API owners don't have a clear vision of how they will reward their developers, and share revenue with its API ecosystem. There are examples of leadership from API owners. Qwerly gives discounts on API costs for high volume API users and YellowAPI pay developers for high volumes of traffic originating from their applications as well as sharing advertising revenue with developers. The Bluevia API is another innovator in the space with its straightforward business models provided for its development community. Bluevia lays out four business models developers can choose from: Downloads - Earn 70% of downloaded apps that developers publish to Movistar and O2 App Stores Subscriptions - Earn 70% of recurring revenue stream fees of ongoing subscription of apps that developers publish to Movistar and O2 App Stores Mobile Advertising - Earn 50% of advertising revenue when developers integrate Telefonica's ad network Messaging Sending and Receiving - Earn 10% of SMS and MMS that are sent from a developer app Bluevia provides a step-by-step process for walking developers through obtaining an API key, certifying an application and API key, publishing to the store, and collecting revenue from one or all of the available developer business models. This type of straightforward approach represents the future of how API owners can clearly communicate how a platform intends to generate revenue, and share revenue with the developer community so that they too can be successful in building businesses around an API platform. It sets clear expectations with the developer community, allowing developers to understand the risks and benefits with building a business around an API.

			<p>A lot of innovation occurs at hackathons. Seems like every hackathon I attend, there are discussion about how to better harness the talent available at these events, and develop a way to track what gets generated.
The last hackathon I attended one of the ideas pitched was actually a web application that tracks what gets produced at hackathons. It would track the participants, and provide repositories for any code created. The application would provide access to ideas and projects from any participating event.
It's a pretty good idea. I think a lot of good ideas and code goes to waste from contests and hackathons. Evening winning ideas may never go anywhere.
Today I came across a Google project called Melange. Melange is an open-source web application that Google uses to track the Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in programs.
The goal of the project is to create a framework for tracking open-source contribution programs. Google is able to manage Google Summer of Code programs, and other similar programs with the web application.
Melange is part content management system, part issue tracking system, and part customer relationship manager. It is written in Python and runs on Google App Engine.
At first glance it looks like Melange is setup to track all the users, ideas, projects and code for a hackathon environment. It might take a little customization, but Melange may work as a platform for tracking hackathons and contests.
It would be great to have access and visibility to projects and code that gets generated from event to event, and information about the smart people were involved.

			<p><em>20 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>It is hard for me to imagine why someone would launch a web application these days, without immediately launching an API, or at least having plans for an API shortly after release.
There always is some data that can be liberated, and make it available in a JSON format. Simple data APIs can easily drive widgets and other embeddable tools, providing viral marketing tools that drive awareness and SEO.
So when I am playing with new web applications, if there is no clear API strategy, it always gets me thinking about the possibilities. This happened when I was playing the new infographic builder and marketplace Visual.ly today.
There is no evidence of an API at Visual.ly. I see an RSS feed of infographics, but no API. So I started thinking about a simple API and embeddable strategy for them.
I would start with infographic and designer services providing JSON responses for searches on the infographic marketplace and graphic designers.
Visual.ly only provides tools for sharing infographics. You can't actually embed them, I believe this is how they plan to monetize. So you wouldn't have full copies of infographics via the API. You'd provide smaller representations of parts and pieces, or other relevant visualizations.
For every infographic, a designer would create a handful of small images, and the API could serve up these images and all the meta data for each entry in the marketplace.
This would open up possibilities for embeddable buttons, widgets and gadgets that anyone could copy and paste, and virally promoteinfographics without actually giving away everything.
The Visual.ly API wouldn't be complex to begin with, just allow basic access to infographics and designers, and provide an assortment of embeddable tools for users to syndicate content. A more advanced API, providing more complete access to infographics and the builder, can come later.

			<h3><a href="/2011/07/19/partial-response-and-updates-with-google-apis/">Partial Response and Updates with Google APIs</a></h3>
			<p><em>19 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Last year google launched support for partial response and updates to a couple of the Google APIs. The goals was to significantly reduce network, memory, and CPU resources needed to work with Google APIs.
Now Google is adding support for partial response, and an improved version of partial update, called patch, to a number of newer APIs including:

	Google Buzz API
	Google URL Shortener API
	Google Tasks API

All APIs available in the Google APIs Discovery Service and the APIs Explorer supporting partial response and updates.
The partial response algorithm works by supplying a fields query parameter to any API call that returns data, you can request specific fields.
Here is an example request that returns only titles and timestamps of a user's public Buzz activities: https://www.googleapis.com/buzz/v1/activities/[email&#160;protected]/@public?alt=json&amp;pp=1&amp;fields=items(title,updated)
A full response for Buzz activity would be around 53KB and the partial response is 3KB, a reduction of almost 95%!
You can try out both partial response and patch algorithms in the Google APIs Explorer. In partial responses, the fields parameter is available for most methods. You can easily tell which are partial update methods by the .patch in the method name. Both the fields parameter and the patch method on the tasklist resource in the APIs explorer.
Partial response and updates are a great way to make APIs more efficient for devices with limited connectivity, as well as making API platforms operate as efficiently as they can by delivering only what information is needed.
Google is in a unique position with the number of APIs they offer, volume of API calls they manage, and wide audience they deliver to. We can all learn a lot from watching them organize their APIs, and apply elements of their approach to our own API ecosystems.

			<p><em>19 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>As I'm reviewing APIs, I spend a lot of time considering the viability and business use cases for an API.
While considering this, I keep having thoughts about the perfect API stack. In my opinion, these are APIs that do one thing and do it well, makes a developers life easier, and have clear business value.
The first one that comes to mind is Twilio. When I think of Twilio, I think of two clear use cases: voice and SMS.
Voice and SMS are two critical tools to have in your developer toolbox. These are services that have clear value, that would take a lot of effort to duplicate yourself, making it a no brainer to pay for as a service.
In an effort to define the perfect API stack, I'm going to start blogging about APIs that fall into this category as I find them. They will be short posts that introduce you to these services, and when I get enough I will launch a landing page showcasing the perfect API stack.

			<p>WebServius provides a self-service tool for deploying, managing and monetizing datasets using an API. WebServius provides users with the ability to integrate and store data, and enable access to the data via a REST API with XML and JSON responses. There is support for planning, development, implementation and ongoing management of APIs generated from data sources. WebServius offers two service levels: Self-Service - Tier for technical people who can handle the setupthemselves, using the WebServius self-service interface. The self-service plan is free up to 50 API subscribers, with up to 10,000 total API calls per day and 5 calls per second at peak times. If you go over any of the limits of the self-service plan, it costs $1 for every 30,000 API calls. Full-Service - Pricing level if you are planning to create a commercial-grade data API. Service is custom fit to exact needs, starting from data integration, to API download page, to user management. Pricing varies based upon needs. There is also a 20% charge of all revenue made through an API whether it is on the self-service or full-service pricing structure. Using WebServius you can proxy an existing REST API or connect directly to a data service provider, including Amazon SimpleDB. Once data is integrated, WebServius allows you to create custom details, plans, promotions, policies and pricing for the data API you wish to publish. Each published API on WebServius is given a detail page for subscribers to access. There are also options for custom site integration and private label deployment solutions. Users can then register, and subscribe to specific plan for any published API,then access data via the API or a full data download. All subscribers are given API keys and WebServius provides tools for validating API keys, and throttling of API requests. WebServius handles all the security, performance and reliability of the API platform, and also provides a reporting suite for monitoring API activity in real-time.

			<p><em>17 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>One of the new features that Twitter rolled out with the new Twitter developer area was an enhanced search tool powered by Apache Solr. The new unified search provides an engine for searching across all areas of the new developer area, including the mailing list historical archives.
Many of us API owners have to cobble together our developer areas from several tools like Wordpress, Google Groups, and other tools we can leverage to quickly provide communication and support for our APIs. There is nothing wrong with this approach, however one side effect is that we end up with information available in separate silos, making information harder for developers to find.
Providing a single search interface, that allows developers to search across all systems, delivering comprehensive and relevant search results can make a significant difference in whether or not a developer finds the details they need to successfully integrate.
Apache Solr is one indexing tool you can deploy as part of your API area, but there are also lower impact solutions such as Google Custom Search that can be deployed as an external service, without investing in costly equipment or software.
Don't underestimate the power of having a single search interface that developers can use to find the information they are looking for when integrating with your API.

			<p><em>17 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time looking through various APIs. One common problem I see, are with, what on the surface appear to be public APIs, but once I start looking to get access as a developer, I get walls thrown up. Often times, information about the API is public. I can browse the documentation, code samples and more, but when I want to play with the API I have to ask for access and wait for approval. This is different than a private API, where you just want to give API access to a private audience. I can tell these API owners have a good idea, want to open it up to the public, but they are very concerned about who has access to their API. These businesses are concerned about what people will do with their data and resources. They have concerns for their brand, and legal issues to wrestle with. What will developers do? How will it affect customers? Will it damage the companies reputation? There are a lot of unanswered questions when launching an API. None of us have all the answers, and can predict what the future holds, and managing public developers can be a lot of work. What you need is a quality API management platform, with tools for providing visibility into how developers are using your API. If you can't build the tools you need yourself, make sure and check out the API service providers like 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery, Layer7 or Atmosphere. Next you need an agile process and attitude for evaluating API usage and feedback, then be able to quickly evolve your API to satisfy your business objectives, adding the most value to your brand, while also building a healthy and vibrant developer ecosystem. One of my goals withAPI Evangelist, is to pay attention to the industry as a whole, understand the best practices for API management and share this knowledge with other API owners so there...[<a href="/2011/07/17/fear-and-uncertainty-around-a-public-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>According to Reuters, Twitter is preparing to launch an Advertising API, targeting larger advertisers, allowing them to tailor, automate, and publish ads in bulk directly into Twitter users' streams. Access to the Twitter Adverting API, which Twitter plans to begin in the fourth quarter, will initially be rolled out as a test involving a limited number of partners, according to Reuters. The Advertising API is a sign that Twitter is pulling together its business model and looking to further monetize its network in the same way as Google does with its Adwords and Adsense, and Facebook with its Ad Network. Right now you have to submit a form, and talk with a sales person to run ads on Twitter, the new API would create an automated advertising marketplace on top of the Twitter ecosystem. According to Reuters, Twitter's advertising API will initially let advertisers automatically deliver ads in two formats: Promoted Tweets - Allowing an advertiser to sponsor any 140 character messages via Twitter Promoted Accounts - Enabling advertisers to promote its own Twitter account to other users A marketing research firm eMarketer, estimates that Twitter is expected to generate about $150 million in ad revenue through its ad network in 2011. Evolving the Twitter advertising network to a self-service system, and adding an API for programmatic integration, will significantly increase the volume of advertising that runs through the network, putting it on par with Google and Facebook's offering. This kind of system is well-suited for larger advertisers that need to buy ads in bulk and run large-scale online advertising campaigns that involve thousands of different versions of an ad. "They can just flood the system with ad types and almost in real time they can figure out which ads are working, which are most successful, which are getting the clicks at the right price," says Debra Aho Williamson, analyst at eMarketer.

			<h3><a href="/2011/07/16/tumblr-releases-api-v2/">"Tumblr Releases API v2"</a></h3>
			<p><em>16 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Tumblr just released version 2.0 of the popular blogging platform API, in an effort to make developers lives a little easier when integrating with the Tumblr platform.
The previous version of the API made distinctions between read and write operations and pushed different activity to two separate domains, the www.tumblr.com and the blog subdomain.
The new API version consolidates all API access to api.tumblr.com and exposes two major resources in the URI: /blog and /user. Consolidation under one domain will allow Tumblr to effectively measure and balance traffic using DNS.
The new URLs will follow a pattern, making them intuitive, allowing developers to easily discover and experiment with the API without having to rely exclusively on documentation.
Instead of adhering to strict RESTful practices, Tumblr is looking to create simple URLs that enable manipulation by the average human.
For example, to pull the avatar of my tumblr blog I use the following URL: http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar
The API returns the default avatar image, and if I want a larger size, I just append the size to the URL: http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar/512
In the first version of the Tumblr API, all data was available in XML, with JSON support added largely as an afterthought. Now Tumblr has just decide to eliminate XML, and focused on dialing in their JSON implementation. A common approach for API owners.
The new API implements OAuth 1.0a for authentication and they are looking at upgrading to OAuth 2.0 in the neear future.
I like how Tumblr has consolidated under a single domain, and I favor their approach to intuitive URL's over a strict RESTful implemntation.
The Tumblr API v2 is definitely an improvement, I will see how it sizes up against the new Posterous API launched last month.

			<h3><a href="/2011/07/16/facebook-removes-application-directory/">"Facebook Removes Application Directory"</a></h3>
			<p><em>16 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Many Facebook developers have been confused about what it means to submit to the Facebook App Directory, and frustrated by the length of time it took to get their applications approved.
Facebook has stated that the Facebook App Directory actually drives less than 0.5% of all application installations, with the highest number of installations actually coming from Facebook search.
And until now, to be visible in search, you had to submit your app to the App Directory.
In light of this data Facebook is removing the App Directory and depending on search for application discovery on the Facebook platform.
For an app to show up in search, developers now need to go to the application detail page, and click the Submit to Search link in the left sidebar while editing the application.
When submitted, applications are automatically available in search and there is no longer an approval process to go through. When any changes are made to application settings, it will automatically be updated in the listing.
Obviously this approach doesn't apply to all API application directories, but some interesting data to consider from one of the larger development platforms, when deploying your own API application directory.

The new dev.twitter.com is built using the Drupal platform and focuses on providing core building blocks for its developer community:

     
          Forum - Retiring of the old mailing list with a new dicussion forum that includes hot topics, email category subscriptions, and Dev Teatime, a section to focus on the social side of the Twitter developer community.
     
     
          Blog - A new blog to learn about important API announcements, events, tips and how-tos, case studies, product insights, and featuring content from different teams at Twitter, as well guest blog posts from community members.
     
     
          Documentation - The new Twitter docs have better structure and searchability, so they are easier to update, and easier to find the most up to date information about the API.
     
     
          Enhanced Search - The new developer area search is powered by Apache Solr, providing a unified search engine with filters and more relevant search results including from the group mailing list historical archives.
     
Twitter focuses on the most important aspects of a developer area, while also providing many other important API building blocks:

     Getting Started
     
     Application Management
     
     Embeddable Tools
     
     API Status
     
     Authentication Overview
     
     Developers for Hire
     
     Videos
     
     Terms of Use
     
     Branding Guidelines
     
     API Explorer (Apigee)
     
The new API developers area looks very complete and provides a unified front for the Twitter developer ecosystem, right down to the comprehensive search.
Its obvious they are working to turn over a new leaf in developer relations by providing improved resources, and most importantly develop communication tools. The new discussion forum features an Introduce Yourself and gives developers the ability create threads as well as reply to threads, which will definitely initiate discussion within the community. The forum is already filling up with introductions and comments.

			<p><em>09 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Foursquare is sunsetting their APIv1, and recently spent some time sharing the lessons they learned during APIv1 and the decisions that went into APIv2. Here are some excerpts: JSON - This was a no brainer. Its flexible and understood by everybody. OAuth2 and HTTPS-Only - OAuth2 is straightforward to implement on the server and client, and offloading encryption to HTTPS makes it easy to get it right. REST Lite - It makes sense to use resourceful URLs for certain key objects, like users/USER_ID or venues/VENUE_ID, with actions and connections hanging off of them. Also avoiding deeply nested URLs like users/USER_ID/tips/TIP_ID, instead using tips/TIP_ID, leads to much simpler URLs. Finally, they avoided using the extended set of HTTP verbs beyond POST and GET, putting the action into the endpoint name, such as tips/add. Documentation - Quality documentation combined with an API explorer is a win. Also theimplementationof a simple documentation generation system, made it easy for Foursquare engineers to keep API documentation up to date. Timestamps as Seconds Since Epoch - Renders timestamps not readable by humans, but extremely easy to parse. Versioning - The hardest part of designing an API is that you're stuck with a bunch of decisions you can't take back. But in some cases they needed to take them back anyway, so they came up with the idea of clients sending back a version like 20110708 and promising to be compatible with all changes up to the date. Object Level detail - It's always hard to decide how much detail to include in an object, and Foursquare lets the clients dictate what to include where. In APIv2, they introduced compact and full JSON representations of resources. Envelope - The decision to wrap all responses in { meta: { � }, response: {...} } was well received, along with the error details included in the meta block. They provide a lot more wisdom in their blog post,APIv2: Woulda, coulda, shoulda. Some of the...[<a href="/2011/07/09/wisdom-shared-from-the-foursquare-api-team/">Read More</a>]</p>
