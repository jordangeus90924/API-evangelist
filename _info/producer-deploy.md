Once an API is ready for deployment to a staging or production environment, there should be a repeatable set of elements at work to move enterprise operations forward at scale. The deployment orchestration of APIs across teams helps optimize the API factory floor across enterprise domains, making every step forward deliberate and repeatable.

Deployment means different things to different organizations. What is important is that there is always a source of truth, a repeatable build process, and a standard set of releases, stages, environments, and plans to deploy APIs consistently across teams and domains.

Like the software development life cycle (SDLC), the API life cycle should be well-defined and repeatable. The big difference is the API lifecycle should also possess a handful of nuances that help reliably deliver API infrastructure using API gateways, policies, and observability practices.
