{% include JB/setup %}<p>Not even a week after Google rolled out the long awaited Google+ API, they launched the Google+ Hangouts API, enabling developers to build collaborative apps that run inside of a Google+ Hangout The Google+ Hangout API will provide developers with the ability to manipulate the UI, interact with hangout participants and respond to the different events that occur within a hangout. The functionality is reminiscent of the way Google Wave gadgets and robots could interact with a wave and its participants. I wonder if we are seeing some of the Google Wave code being recycled?To use Google+ you have to register your application with Google, and specify any other Google+ users on your team that will be able to load the application into their hangout. Since the Google+ Hangouts API is only in developer preview, this is temporary requirement.</p>
