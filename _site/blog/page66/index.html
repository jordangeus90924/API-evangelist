        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/">RESTful Business Architecture</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, <a title="Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.
<p></p>His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: <em>software and networking</em>.
<p></p>He identifies that software research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.</em>
</blockquote>While networking research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.</em>
</blockquote><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/parthenon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software. He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.
<p></p>The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.
<p></p>As Fielding states:
<blockquote>
     <em>REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</em>
</blockquote>As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/api-evangelism-vs-developer-evangelism/">API Evangelist</a>, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.
<p></p>When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like? Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software? When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?
<p></p>Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.

<p>BlablabLAB setup an interactive art installation on the streets of Barcelona, which allows users to stand in a structure surrounded by three Kinect sensors.</p>
<p>The sensors capture a 360-degree video of the person, then sends details to a low-resolution 3-D printer, which spits out a small thermoplastic figurine.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/social-impact-graph.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />One of the reasons I believe <a title="APIs Are Growing so Popular" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">APIs are growing so popular</a> is they are getting easier, and easier to use.<p></p>
The main reason they are getting easier to use is due to the adoption of RESTful approaches when delivering APIs.<p></p>
Many APIs that use REST can be easily hacked by just changing values in the URL query string, instantly making APIs accessible by a wider audience<p></p>
Once users get past the confusing acronyms and jargon us programmers use, and realize whats going on, they can start accessing the data and functionality that's behind the curtain.<p></p>
RESTful APIs open up data and functionality to anyone, and we are starting to see a new breed of hackers from many disciplines including journalism, social media marketing, and government, to name a few.<p></p>
As technology becomes increasingly important in our every day lives, people can't wait for IT or programmers to deliver, savvy users start hacking on their own.<p></p>
A very innovative example of this I saw lately was by Social Media Strategist, <a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.  Tom wrote a great post called, <a title="Using Tools &amp; APIs to Track Your Social Media Strategy" href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-track-your-social-media-strategy">Using Tools &amp; APIs To Track Your Social Media Strategy.</a>
<img src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/users/30546.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
Through a need to understand the impact of his social media efforts, he learned that he can query top social sites using their API to quantify the impact of his site(s).<p></p>
Then using Google Docs, along with with the power of <a title="Google App Scripts" href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/">Google App Scripts</a> he pulls counts for shares, likes, etc for his site using Social Media APIs.<p></p>
Using RESTful Social Media APIs, and Google Docs, he is able to hack these APIs, get the data he is looking for, store it in a spreadsheet, and then visualize it.<p></p>
His efforts truly represent the power of APIs, and how important it is that we deliver simple, RESTful interfaces that developers and non-developers can use in our every day business.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-business.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I have found a voice through my blog, API Evangelism.<p></p>
I get asked why "API Evangelism" instead of "Developer Evangelism"?<p></p>
I see a significant difference:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer Evangelists</strong> spread awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer community.</li>
	<li><strong>API Evangelists</strong> spreads awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer and business community.</li>
</ul>
Developer evangelists are generally focused outwards, staying within the developer community and often times are, or have been developers themselves.  They understand the problems their developers face and provide resources, so they are successful using an API.<p></p>
As an API Evangelist I focus on everything a developer evangelist focuses on, but I also find myself selling the API and its benefits both externally and internally.<p></p>
If I see a potential use for an API, one that enhances the core business, I will build a prototype and get to work selling the appropriate department(s) on the benefits.<p></p>
In addition to selling internal business leaders on benefits of a specific API, I spend a lot of time educating external business leaders on the benefits of APIs in general.  Using a specific API (hopefully my own) for building the business case.<p></p>
We need more developer evangelists, but we also need armies of API evangelists who will teach the business masses of the benefits of APIs, and prepare them for the coming <a title="API Economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.

        <a title="Google Apps" href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> is an online email, document, and collaboration platform in the clouds.<p></p>
<a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a> provides a directory of custom third party applications in various categories for Google App users to add, to their available services.<p></p>
Google Apps Marketplace also provides a self-service platform for application developers to build applications and deliver for free, or for pay, via the Marketplace.<p></p>
Any developer can register for a vendor profile, and:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Apps-Marketplace.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

	<li>Add screenshot or logo</li>
	<li>Provide screencast or how to video</li>
	<li>Add version information</li>
</ul>
All applications must support Single Sign On (SSO) for Google Account integration.<p></p>
Developers can then build applications in the language and platform of their choice.<p></p>
Once the application is production ready, the Marketplace requires developers to submit applications for approval, providing quality control for the marketplace.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Apps-Marketplace.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />APIs have been influential in ushering in a new era of business development, dubbed <a title="BizDev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">BizDev 2.0</a>.   APIs empower new types of relationship to be built between a business and its partners or openly by public developers.<p></p>
Self-Service application platforms move this business development forward and introduces a third player into the game, platform partners.<p></p>
Platforms like <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a>, and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> not only deliver APIs, they provide a <a title="Self-Service Application Development Environment" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environment</a>, a place where third party businesses can access their users, and add value to their platform.<p></p>
Forward thinking businesses can bring their own APIs, and communities development power to these environments and create applications tailored specifically for Box.net or Google Apps Business, Government, Education and Non-Profit users.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/box-net-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
In some cases businesses can even create white label applications that other service providers quickly deploy their own branded applications on Box.net OpenBox, or Google Apps Marketplace.   Adding a potentially new wholesale layer to these API communities.<p></p>
APIs with a<a title="Self-Service Application Platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Platform</a> introduces new forms of business development where businesses can leverage their own APIs, the APIs of others, even bundle them together to build applications that can reach entirely new audiences via platform partners.

Platforms such as <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a> and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> are adding these self-service application development environments within their API ecosystem.<p></p>
Each platform has its own approach to this type of self-service architecture, but there are many similar characteristics:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/self-service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Interface for defining new application characteristics.</li>
	<li><strong>OpenID / OAuth / User Resource Access</strong> - Secure and granular access to users profile and resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Development Environment</strong> - Controlled, secure environment for developers to build applications in.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Branding</strong> - Branding of application and its profile on a platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Approval Process</strong> - Approval process for bringing applications live.</li>
	<li><strong>Marketplace Environment </strong>- Public or private marketplaces for developers to publish applications and platform users to browse / add applications.</li>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/opportunities-in-api-deployment-pdf-apis/">Opportunities in API Deployment, PDF APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Tag-Cloud-API-PDF.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I'm spending time evaluating different types of APIs in various categories.
<p></p>I want to see how each provider delivers their API in similar categories, and potentially look for opportunities within those categories for new API services.
<p></p>I'm starting with PDF APIs.
<p></p>There are quite a few web APIs providing services to generate and work with PDFs.
<p></p>The first main group of APIs I notice are HTML to PDF conversion APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocRaptor" href="http://docraptor.com/documentation" target="_blank">DocRaptor</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Doculicious" href="http://docs.doculicious.com/api" target="_blank">Doculicious</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="html2PDF" href="http://webservice.htm2pdf.co.uk/htm2pdf.asm" target="_blank">htm2pdf</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Joliprint" href="http://joliprint.com/api/" target="_blank">Joliprint</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="HTM2PDF" href="http://www.html2pdf.biz/api.php" target="_blank">HTML2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Web2PDF" href="http://www.web2pdfconvert.com/pdf-api.aspx" target="_blank">Web2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF My URL" href="http://pdfmyurl.com/support/support.jsp" target="_blank">PDF My URL</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Crowd" href="http://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf-api/" target="_blank">PDF Crowd</a>
     </li>
</ul>Next there are a couple of other PDF conversion tools:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/PDF_red.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Anything to PDF" href="http://api.danielprocter.com/" target="_blank">Anything to PDF</a> - Convert base 64 encoded data to PDF
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Alchemy" href="http://www.pdfalchemy.com/" target="_blank">PDF Alchemy</a> - Word to PDF
     </li>
</ul>Beyond document conversion I found two APIs for commenting and annotating PDFs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Crocodoc" href="http://crocodoc.com/api/" target="_blank">Crocodoc</a> - PDF commenting and collaboration
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Annotate" href="http://a.nnotate.com/api-reference.html" target="_blank">A.nnotate</a> - PDF annotation
     </li>
</ul>Then there was a single provider of PDF document signatures:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocuSign" href="http://www.docusign.com/developers-center/developers-center-overview" target="_blank">DocuSign</a>
     </li>
</ul>There are two clear leaders that provide more advanced PDF document management services:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Doxument" href="http://doxument.com/en/developer" target="_blank">Doxument</a> - HTML to PDF, OCR, Split PDF pages in separate images
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Docs " href="http://code.google.com/apis/documents/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> - File Conversion to PDF, OCR, translation
     </li>
</ul>With the ubiquitous nature of PDFs, and a wide range of desktop and web based PDF tools, I think there is a huge opportunity for new types of APIs in this area. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf-ocr.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> There are dozens of code libraries in various languages for manipulating PDFs. I would suggest some savvy developer:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Identify the most viable business uses for PDF APis
     </li>
     <li>Select the strong set of PDF language libraries
     </li>
     <li>Wrap in a RESTful wrapper
     </li>
     <li>Deploy on Amazon EC2 with PDF storage on Amazon S3
     </li>
</ul>PDF APis is one category of APIs that has huge opportunity for growth in the next couple of years.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        When deploying an API, the interface is just the beginning. You need tools and resources to support the API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/building_blocks.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> There are <a title="Common Building Blocks Used by APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks that are used by many existing APIs</a>, such as documentation, forums, code samples and other tools developers have come to expect from APIs.
<p></p>When selecting which <a title="Building Blocks to Use for an API Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks to use for an API area</a>, there are many things to consider. There are many opinions on which are essential, and this can vary from industry to industry.
<p></p>One thing everyone agrees is that <a title="Metrics and Analytics for an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">metrics and analytics for an API</a> are a must have.
<p></p>Beyond the common building blocks, many API owners are providing new innovative tools such as:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Application Showcase" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">Application Showcases</a>

     </li>
</ul>If you are planning an API and do not have much experience with API technology, or what building blocks you will need, you should talk to experienced API service providers such as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, or <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>. These providers have a lot of experience, tools and services you can access to plan, develop, deploy, and manage your API.
<p></p>Even with the growth in the number of available APIs, and the number of service providers I do not see much in the way of open-source API building blocks available on the market yet. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> We need more innovation around development of open API building blocks. Think what <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> has done for blogging, and <a title="Heroku" href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> has done for cloud computing.
<p></p>The availablility of open API building blocks delivering the common, innovative and essential tools needed for APIs, would give a much needed boost to the entire industry.
<p></p>There is a lot of learning, exploration and trial and error to occur within the API space. Leaving this to occur within the hands of a few API service provider, or following the lead of major API players like Twitter and Google limits the opportunities for everybody involved.
<p></p>I would like to see more discussion and collaboration around building a community of open source API build blocks this year.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-social-coding-words.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.
<p></p>The site also provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and a network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.
<p></p>Github provides two main tools that can be used in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Github Repositories" href="http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/">Github Repositories</a></strong> - Git code repositories for various supporting areas of an API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Gists" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong> - Gist are a simple way to share snippets of code
     </li>
</ul>There are several ways to use Github repositories and Gists in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation</strong> - Display example calls, requests, and responses using Gists
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Samples</strong> - Display code samples using Gists, and package up entire sets of code samples using Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Package up official and community generated API code libraries as Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Prototypes</strong> - Publish API prototypes as Github repositories
     </li>
</ul><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-round.png" alt="" width="160" align="right" /> Github provides a way for API owners to manage a large number of code samples, libraries and prototypes, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community.
<p></p>The social spects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github.
<p></p>Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/php.gif" alt="" width="125" align="right" />An important tone of my blog is not to ever say any API owner should, or developers have to do anything. My role as API evangelist is to observe, discuss and explore the business of APIs.
<p></p>I was discussing best practices around API ecosystems with a prominent developer the other night an a O'Reilly Web 2.0 event. He had an interesting perspective on how to build community around an API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/ruby-logo.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> Building your API community can start with your code libraries.
<p></p>His recommendation was that API owners should focus on building a simple and standardized API that provides true value, and do not build your own API code libraries.
<p></p>Let your community build, and contribute code libraries in their preferred programming language.
<p></p>His argument was that if an API owner releases an official set of libraries, the innovation stops there. Nobody will build any further code libraries and possibly improve on them. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/python.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> By allowing the community to build API libraries it gives you a chance to put the spotlight on developers, increases the chance for competition, spurs innovation and developers will rise to the occasion.
<p></p>In some cases an API owner may even contract with a developer to build the API code libraries, but do not endorse them as official. This way developers see opportunity to build upon them and improve them, if they feel so inclined.
<p></p>I found this a very innovative approach to empowering your developer community, encouraging innovation, and building community within your API ecosystem.

        NPR announced their new <a title="NPR News Application for Android 2.0" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/04/01/134951191/android-2-0-rebuilt-redesigned?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">NPR News application for Android 2.0</a> today.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/npr/npr-android-20-mobile-app.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
Normally I wouldn't cover just any new app or feature release, but there is more of a story here than just a new mobile app.  I am interested in the way they went about designing it.<p></p>
Last summer they submitted designs for the new Android application to the <a title="NPR open source community" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">open source community</a> to discuss how to best move forward with designing the mobile app.<p></p>
They gathered feedback from users and built in what the community said was most important, such as new player, universal navigation, as well as adding programs with live streams and the ability to favorite stations.<p></p>
They are working to <a title="publishing the source code back to the community repository" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">publishing the source code back to the community repository</a>, keeping the project open source.<p></p>
Of course this is NPR, a public entity, but their approach to mobile application design using their API is  a model that can be used by other API providers.

Think about the possibilities when you have signs, billboards, and other types of display that either respond or dispense something when you interact via your mobile phone and an API.<p></p>
Opens up a whole lot of possibilities when you have devices that monitor APIs for specific triggers, respond accordingly, and then developers build software on top of those APIs.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/intents-summary.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Since the <a title="Twitter OAuth Apocalypse" href="http://twitter.com/#!/SNFLabs/status/16426051477">Twitter OAuth Apocalypse</a> integrating tweets into a web page requires writing an OAuth application for even the simplest of Twitter integrations, like replying, retweeting and favoriting.
<p></p>Twitter just released a new <a title="Simpler API Called Web Intents" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents">simpler API called Web Intents</a> that makes Tweets more interactive when you display on the web.
<p></p>The Twitter Web Intents API provides a JavaScript interface for adding Reply, Retweet, and Favorite links to a specific Tweet:
<p></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/896788.js?file=Twitter%20Web%20Intent%20API" type="text/javascript">

<p></p>Twitter Web Intents API is an example of a growing trend of simpler tools that make APIs accessible beyond the developer community.
<p></p>REST has simplified APIs making them hackable by journalists, data scientists, and any other tech savvy users that may not be able to program but can understand manipulating a URL query string to get the data they are looking for.
<p></p>More API providers are considering development of simpler APIs, snippets, widgets, and embeddable code that expand their API ecosystem to a wider audience.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-analytics.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I document a lot of the <a title="Common Building Blocks Used By API Providers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks used by API providers</a>. These are common tools used across many industries and types of APIs to build their ecosystem.
<p></p>I hesitate to ever say any of these common building blocks are essential, because every API potentially has different requirements.
<p></p>However, one building block that is essential for <span class="c1">every</span> API, is metrics and analytics.
<p></p>API owners should me measuring every aspect of their API and its community, and be constantly reassessing their strategy based upon what is going on in real-time.
<p></p>API analytics is what service providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> and <a href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> bring to the table. Mashery and Apigee proxy your API to deliver analytics, while 3Scale provides a plug to gather data for reporting on.
<p></p>All three of these providers charge you per transaction for this service. <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Google-Analytics-Charts-Stack.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> To my knowledge there is no provider of an API analytics tool that is free, and plug and play.
<p></p>With the current explosion of APIs being deployed, there is a huge opportunity for someone to provide a free API analytics service that gathers and measures API usage.
<p></p>Think Google Analytics for APIs. A single line of server side code, with a variety of language kits, that will measure all requests on an API, its community, and provide a rich set of reports for API owners.
<p></p>This could probably be done with the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/home.html">Google Analytics API</a>, I will have to play with more.

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I just finished reading two more posts on the recent changes to the <a title="Twitter API Terms of Service" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">Twitter API terms of service</a>.  There are a lot of opinions on whether Twitter was right or wrong in their approach to reign in their developer community.<p></p>
I understand Twitter wanting to take back some control over its ecosystem and monetize its world.<p></p>
I do not understand why people are demonizing Open APIs or the developer community.  Both made Twitter what it is today.<p></p>
I wanted to put some thoughts down on how I'd engineer a more sensible approach to the Twitter API ecosystem.<p></p>
<strong>Brand Control:</strong> Twitter needs to keep expanding its <a title="branding resource area" href="http://twitter.com/about/resources/logos">branding resource area</a> where users can come to get CSS, HTML, images, widgets, borders and many other higher quality assets that can be used by the community and maintain a quality level of brand control for Twitter.<p></p>
API access and usage.  Let's create some free and paid access levels:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer</strong> - A free low volume access level that allows developers to play with the API, but only allows a minimum number of API calls per day.</li>
	<li><strong>Professional</strong> - A slightly higher level of access meant for API consumer that may be building an application, but probably used just for professional purposes.</li>
	<li><strong>Business</strong> - API access for businesses that use Twitter for their own brand, and require a higher level of API requests, but are willing to pay for it.</li>
	<li><strong>Commercial</strong> - A pay-for-what-you-use model, in true cloud computing fashion, with the possibility of volume discounts.</li>
	<li><strong>Academic</strong> - A free research-based access account for scholars to use in their academic projects.</li>
</ul>
With clearly defined Twitter API access levels, Twitter can start making money and controlling usage of their API.<p></p>
<strong>Ad Network</strong>:  The next approach to monetization and control over the Twitter ecoystem could be a Twitter advertising network modeled after Google Adsense and Adwords.<p></p>
Let's call it the Dickbar Advertising Network.  Require all client and web interfaces to have some sort of advertising network deployment.  You could have Dickbars, Dickboxes, and Dickheaders in all shapes and sizes for developers to deploy.<p></p>
Twitter can still advertise, make money, and control their network.  Developers could make money too.  There would be added incentive for developers to build quality applications, and be able to be sustain their work through advertising revenue.<p></p>
With a sensible terms of service, branding guidelines, tiered API access levels, and an advertising network, Twitter could retain control over its network, protect its brand, monetize and ensure a higher quality user experience.<p></p>
This could all be done while still respecting and harnessing the passionate developer community of the Twitter ecosystem that made Twitter what it is today.

<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a></li>
	<li><a title="Salesforce" href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003IjwLEAS">Salesforce</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google API Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google</a></li>
	<li><a title="Windows Live" href="http://rex.mslivelabs.com/">Windows Live</a></li>
	<li><a title="Infochimps Data Explorer" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">Infochimps</a></li>
</ul>
These REST API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a web interface.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a> even allows you to Authenticate with APIs using Basic Auth or OAuth.<p></p>
The simplicity of REST has contributed to the extreme growth in the number of Web APIs in the last year, and API explorers are going to fuel this growth in 2011 and beyond.<p></p>
API explorers put the power of Web APIs in the hands of non-developers, allowing journalists, students, politicians, and any tech savvy Internet user to access the data and functionality available via APIs.<p></p>
Once a couple of these providers adds an export JSON to Google Docs or download to Excel, its a whole new ballgame.<p></p>
With an API explorer any user will be able to pull data from one or many APIs, export to a Google Spreadsheet and build visualizations to extract their own meaning from the data they've gathered via any REST API.

<p></p>Infochimps is taking large data sets in areas like<a title="Census Data" href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/Census">census</a>, <a title="Housing" href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/Housing">housing</a>, and <a title="Education" href="http://www.infochimps.com/search?query=education">education</a> and making them available via an API.
<p></p>Also Infochimps is bundling these data sets and RESTful APIs with their API Explorer. This allows even non-developers to play with large data sets.
<p></p>Some new API calls they've built are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Qwerly" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/qwerly-profile-search">Qwerly</a> -</strong> You know when you Google someone's name and through some SEO magic, you can find all of that person's social media profiles? Imagine being able to easily integrate these presences into your applications. Query a person's Twitter handle and the Qwerly API call will return any of his or her social media presences (Facebook, Friendfeed, Flickr, etc) that it can find.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter People Search" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/twpeoplesearch">Twitter People Search</a> -</strong> Let's face it. Finding new cool people on Twitter can be a bit taxing. Query any word using Twitter People Search and find any user who uses that word in their bio. Looking for other data lovers? Check. Looking for people who like the Green Bay Packers? Check. Looking for Bieber lovers on Twitter? You'll have no problem there. ;-)
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="British National Corpus" rel="wikipedia" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-frequencies-from-the-british-national-corpus">British National Corpus</a> -</strong> Word lists are very popular on our site and we couldn't pass this one up. This API call allows you to access the British National Corpus, a 100-million-word text corpus of samples of written and spoken English from a wide range of sources. The corpus covers British English the late twentieth century from a wide variety of genres with the intention that it be a representative sample of spoken and written British English of that time.
     </li>
</ul>Infochimps is not just liberating data via APIs, they are making it more accessible through their API explorer and data marketplace.
<p></p>You can search for data that is free or paid, available for download or through their API, alphabetically, or by upload date.
<p></p>Infochimps is also looking for suggestions for new APIs and datasets, you can submit ideas using the <a title="Infochimps UserVoice" href="http://infochimps.uservoice.com/forums/55516-infochimps-api-data-sets">Infochimps UserVoice</a> page.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/03/22/twitter-lendle-and-the-state-of-the-open-api-ecosystem/">Twitter, Lendle and the State of the Open API Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />As such, there has been much discussion recently about Open APIs and whether or not third party developers are wise or foolish to build their businesses on someone else's platform. The concern stems from a number of reasons, least of which being Twitter's pronouncements about the <a title="&quot;Rules of the Road&quot; for Its Ecosystem" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">"rules of the road" for its ecosystem</a>, and now <a title="Lendles announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API" href="http://lendle.me/">Lendle's announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API</a>.
<p></p>The reactions to both Twitter and Amazon have been pretty strong. And while I do think Twitter is making some serious mistakes with its approach to its API and developer ecosystem, we might be making some mistakes of our own if we lump the Lendle/Amazon issue in to concerns about Twitter. Is Amazon shutting down apps that are poaching on its ecosystem? That's not clear.
<p></p>As it stands, everyone seems to be stirring the pot and feeding the hysteria around the perils of using Open APIs, or rather, the dangers of relying on them for your businesses..
<p></p>But it seems to me that there is much more going on here. While APIs may be the focus -- the way in which apps and websites are connecting to a larger platform -- we're also looking at larger conflicts with new business models, whether those are publishing and DRM in the case of Amazon and Lendle or whether those conflicts are around a startup still struggling to monetize its core business. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> This isn't to say that there aren't precautions that people should take when building on an Open API. But when I hear some of the FUD lately, much of this echoes what we were hearing (and still hear, I suppose) about cloud computing.
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your server or storage could disappear at any moment, because its virtualized!</strong> Sure, as would any server or storage, that's why I have plan A and B, and in the clouds I have C &amp; D as well. I plan for failure no matter where my infrastructure is located.</em>
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <strong><em><strong>Your data is not secure in the clouds!</strong></em></strong> <em>Security is a concern everywhere, make sure and have thorough security plan that is revisited regularly.</em>
</p>
<p></p>The naysayers are now making their arguments about APIs
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your API access could be shut off at any time!</strong> I don't think this is any secret about APIs. This is why there are terms of service that you must read and follow. Your application needs to take this into consideration with ALL the APIs it uses -- whether they're from developer-friendly companies or not, and then operate accordingly.</em>
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>An API owner could decide to poach business from its community at any time!</strong> Again I don't think its a secret. APIs are a form of R&amp;D for companies, this is open territory for everyone to innovate. In perfect world an API owner communicates openly with developers and partners about opportunities in the ecosystem, plans to monetize, and where partner opportunities exist.</em> I'm not saying these dangers aren't real. They are. What I'm saying is that none of this should come as a shock. You build and plan around these potential issues just as you would with any other technologies you invest in. What if Google Apps goes down? What if your supplier goes out of business? What if FedEx doesn't arrive on time?
</p>
<p></p>Open APIs aren't really the problem here. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/lendle-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /> If a company is built entirely around a single API ecosystem, maybe the owners should consider diversification into other areas, expanding their business. The fault is with the business strategy; it's not the fault of the API.
<p></p>If an API ecosystem grows large enough where business opportunities develop that are ripe for picking by companies or poaching by the APIs owners, then the responsibility is on the API owner to establish a partner strategy that considers and includes ecosystem developers. It's not the fault of the API.
<p></p>Technology is transforming a lot of industries right now. Open APIs are at the heart of this. <em>This is a good thing</em>.
<p></p>Open APIs drive developer and business innovation, and as this occurs there are going to challenges with monetization, business strategies, licensing, ownership, security, and privacy.
<p></p>Let's not blame the API or scare people off from using APIs by freaking out about the dangers. Let's identify the pitfalls, understand their value and establish healthy ways to integrate with APIs, to build healthy business and vibrant ecosystems around them.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/terms-legal.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I wanted to establish a base <a title="Terms of Service" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=150">Terms of Service</a> for my API area.
<p></p>So I went and read the API terms of service from 15 top APIs
<p></p>I found the opening paragraph says a lot about how a company approaches their API.
<p></p>Here are the opening paragraphs for the top 15 API terms of service I came across:

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/idea-management.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />Silicon Valley is full of ideas.<p></p>
APIs provide the data and functionality that many of these ideas are built on.<p></p>
If you have an API, hopefully you have lots of ideas on what developers can do with it -- ideas that you can share with your API community in order to inspire them to create.<p></p>
Many innovative APIs are building tools for managing ideas within their communities.<p></p>
Google uses <a title="Google Moderator" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#0">Google Moderator</a> for <a title="idea management in Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://productideas.appspot.com/#15/e=17fe36&amp;t=181990&amp;f=25f853">idea management in their Google Apps Marketplace</a>.<p></p>

Moderator also has an API for deeper integration into other applications of these topics, submissions, and votes.<p></p>
<a title="Google Moderator" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#0">Google Moderator</a> can be a low cost way for deploying an API idea management system and in turn help cultivate innovation within an API community.

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/npr-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Twitter has been working hard lately to <a title="define the rules of the road for the Twitter API" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">define the rules of the road for the Twitter API</a> ecosystem.<p></p>
When it comes to monetizing content and media, there are many differing opinions and by extension there are many approaches to managing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
NPR's approach is innovative, <a title="making incremental changes in technology and business rules" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/03/17/134259537/the-npr-api-an-engine-rebuild?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">making incremental changes in technology and business rules</a>.<p></p>
<a title="National Public Radio" href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> is improving its API technology to be easier to use, run faster, and deliver all types of content better.<p></p>
NPR is also innovating around digital rights management, to support their <a title="Ingest System" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2010/04/22/126205655/building-the-ingest-system">Ingest System</a> which allows partners to publish content into the NPR system.<p></p>
Managing digital rights and content has its own challenges, but you throw in APIs -- the ability for partners to publish and developers to access this content -- it can't be easy.<p></p>
It's good to see NPR openly talking about the challenges they face, and their ideas on how they are going to keep improving the <a title="NPR API" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR API</a> ecosystem.

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-ssl.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google will <a title="start supporting use of SSL in APIs" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/improving-security-of-google-apis-with.html">start supporting the use of SSL in many of their APIs</a>.<p></p>
SSL will improve API security by encrypting all data communications between 3rd party applications and Google, protecting data from interception by a malicious third party.<p></p>
Google Web Search, Google Maps, Gmail and Google docs all currently support SSL for API access.<p></p>
They are working to introduce SSL support in other APis as well as update existing client libraries and code samples to support SSL.<p></p>
Beginning September 15, 2011, Google will require that all users of Google Documents List API, Google Spreadsheets API, and Google Sites API use SSL connections for all API requests.<p></p>
SSL will further legitimize the integration of Google APIs into third party applications.<p></p>
As applications become more distributed, SSL will become a must have layer to all APIs.

Even though the <a title="OAuth 2.0 Specification" href="http://wiki.oauth.net/w/page/25236487/OAuth-2">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> isn't 100% finalized, Google has overhauled all of their APIs in Google Code to support it.<p></p>
OAuth 2.0 is much easier for developers to implement, and simplifies OAuth consent for application users.<p></p>
Google's support for OAuth 2.0 is a big boost for developers integrating with their API, as well as big vote of support for the future of OAuth 2.0 as the standard for API authentication.<p></p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In March, 2006&nbsp;<a title="Amazon Launched New Web Service" href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/03/13/announcing-amazon-s3---simple-storage-service/">Amazon launched a new web service</a>, something completely different from the&nbsp;<a title="Amazon Bookseller and E-Commerce" href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon bookseller and e-commerce</a>&nbsp;site we've come to know. This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>&nbsp;provides a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 or Simple Storage Service was initially just an API. There was no Web interface or mobile app. It was just a RESTful API allowing PUT and GET requests with objects or files.</p>
<p>Developers using the Amazon S3 API were charged $0.15 a gigabyte per month for storing files in the cloud.</p>
<p>With this new type of API and billing model, Amazon ushered in a new type of computing we now know as cloud computing.</p>
<p>This also meant that APIs were no longer just for data or simple functionality. Now they could be used to deliver computing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Less than three months later, it had one million users.</p>
<p>Kevin Systrom the founder of&nbsp;<a title="Instagram" href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a>&nbsp;focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.</p>
<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application.</p>
<p>In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and built his own&nbsp;<a title="Unofficial Instagram API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/">unofficial Instagram API.</a></p>
<p>By January&nbsp;<a title="Instagram shut down the rogue API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/">Instagram shut down the rogue API</a>&nbsp;and announced it was building one of its own.</p>
<p>Then in February of 2011,&nbsp;<a title="Instagram released the official API" href="http://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api">Instagram released the official API</a>&nbsp;for the photo platform.</p>
<p>Within days many&nbsp;<a title="Instagram Photo Applications" href="http://instagre.at/#/by/knorrstein/35938336">photo applications</a>, photo -sharing sites, and mashups built around the API started showing up.</p>
<p>Instagram became a viral iPhone app sensation, but quickly needed an API to realize its full potential.</p>

He's right.  The pace of <a title="API Development Skyrocketed in 2010" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/03/08/3000-web-apis/">API development skyrocketed in 2010</a>, and will continue in 2011.<p></p>
Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.<p></p>
When companies consider an API for their brand, they should start with the basics
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Product Information" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-apis-starter-product-data/"><strong>Product Informatio</strong>n</a> - Core information about your products.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Supporting Product Information" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-api-starter-supporting-product-data/">Supporting Product Information</a></strong> - Additional supporting information about your products like documents, videos, reviews, etc.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Location and Geo" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-apis-starter-location-geo/">Location and Geo</a></strong> - Location of where to get your products.</li>
</ul>
With proper API terms and conditions, brand guidelines, and requiring all developers to register a company can monitor and protect the quality of their brand.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/start.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
By starting small, companies can get familiar with having an API and supporting the community that goes with it.<p></p>
I recommend engaging with an API service provider like <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>, <a href="http://apigee.com/">Apigee</a> or <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> when planning an API.<p></p>
If you have your own in-house developers and want to keep development internally I recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a>.<p></p>
Brands have to start somewhere.  By starting with an API that serves up your core product data, you can take control of what information is available for your brand, while also learning more about building an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Community</a>.<p></p>
Once you have a simple <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> API that provides product and location information, an API support area, and an awareness of what your developer community wants;  you can then start innovating more around your brand API.

I suggested companies get their feet wet in the API space by starting with a basic <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> API that servers up data about their products.<p></p>
With a functioning API and API area, a company can think about whats next?  More product data of course!<p></p>
There has to be more information about your products that you can make available?  Product documents, videos, reviews, testimonials, case studies and other news or information. What information do you provide on your web site?<p></p>
Provide any supporting product data you think might provide benefit to developers and their application users.<p></p>
The more information about your products you can provide, the more resources potential partners and developers will have to build rich web and mobile applications.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/brand-tools.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I have been thinking about<a title="Adam Kleinberg" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkleinberg">Adam Kleinbergs</a> recent posts,<a title="Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers" href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/brand-open-api-developers/">Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers</a> and<a title="Digging Deeper on Brand APIs" href="http://www.tractionco.com/blog/63-digging-deeper-on-brand-apis">Digging deeper on Brand APIs</a>.<p></p>
He's right. The pace of<a title="API Development Skyrocketed in 2010" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/03/08/3000-web-apis/">API development skyrocketed in 2010</a>, and will continue in 2011.<p></p>
Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.<p></p>
I suggested companies get their feet wet in the API space by starting with a basic <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> API that servers up data about their products.  Then once a company is confident in supporting their API they can consider delivering more supporting product information.<p></p>
Whats a good next move?   Location and Geographic Data.  Where can your products be found?  Retail and Wholesale.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/SimpleGeo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
Provide quality, up to date information about who sells your products.   Provide as much detail as you can, names, addresses, specific products and even geographic coordinates.<p></p>
There are plenty of <a title="Geo and Mapping API" href="http://simplegeo.com/">geo and mapping API</a> resources to provide additional data that enriches your retail and wholesale store information.<p></p>
Providing rich, real-time location data about products, retails, wholesalers, and partners through an API will enable web and mobile developers to build applications around your company and its products.

        <img class="aligncenter" style="padding: 10px;" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/api-growth.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Congratulations to <a title="Programmable Web hits 3000th API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/03/08/3000-web-apis/">ProgrammableWeb for hitting the 3000th API</a> in their directory.<p></p>
The <a title="Programmable Web API Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb API directory </a>has seen some amazing growth:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>1,000 APIs: over 3 years</li>
	<li>2,000 APIs: less than 2 years</li>
	<li>3,000 APIs: about 9 months</li>
</ul>
Three other noteworthy trends, the ProgrammableWeb team notices:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>API as a Company</strong> - More companies launching just as API.</li>
	<li><strong>REST and JSON</strong> - Simplification of APIs through REST and JSON.</li>
	<li><strong>Internal Usage</strong> - More companies consuming their own APIs.</li>
</ul>
Some might say the recent explosive growth is part of a "bubble", but if you look at the numbers its been a long 11 year road since <a title="Saleforce Launches API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce first launch their API in February of 2000</a>.<p></p>
This is just the beginning of the coming global <a title="API Economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2011</span>
        Just days after Apigee made their <a title="Apigee API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/apigee-api-console-is-now-free-for-everyone-to-use/">API explorer free and embeddable</a>, Google has <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/introducing-google-apis-explorer.html">announced a new API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
The new Google API Explorer is an interactive interface for playing with Google APIs.<p></p>
<a title="Google API Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google API Explorer</a> currently supports:<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PidOKEWFRR8/TXE0FTOPL8I/AAAAAAAAAJA/zZlx-KoWeXw/s400/2011-03-04-google_apis_explorer.jpg"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PidOKEWFRR8/TXE0FTOPL8I/AAAAAAAAAJA/zZlx-KoWeXw/s400/2011-03-04-google_apis_explorer.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Google Buzz API</li>
	<li>Google Custom Search API</li>
	<li>Diacritize API</li>
	<li>Moderator API</li>
	<li>Shopping API</li>
	<li>Translate API</li>
	<li>URL Shortener API</li>
</ul>
The API Explorer interface provides public or private access to APIs, with the private access handling the necessary <a class="zem_slink" title="OAuth" rel="homepage" href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a> authentication.<p></p>
By selecting an API you wish to explore, you can see all the available methods and parameters along with documentation. Just fill out the parameters for the method you want to try and click execute.  The Google Explorer composes the request, executes it, and displays the response.<p></p>
Google provides some real-life examples anyone can execute:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Expand a goog.gl URL" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/#_s=urlshortener&amp;_v=v1&amp;_m=url.get&amp;shortUrl=http://goo.gl/jN3IJ">Expand a goo.gl URL</a> using the URL Shortener API</li>
	<li><a title="Translate a phrase to French" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/#_s=translate&amp;_v=v2&amp;_m=translations.list&amp;q=APIs%20explorer%20is%20awesome!&amp;target=fr&amp;source=en">Translate a phrase to French</a> using the Translate API</li>
	<li><a title="List Personal Buzz Posts" href="List your personal Buzz posts">List your personal Buzz posts</a> using the Buzz API (requires private access)</li>
</ul>
The Google Explorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.<p></p>
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.

<p>Guided by a computer-aided design program, a laser fuses together several layers of finely powdered metal, nylon or plastic.</p>
<p>The laser melts the powder, which solidifies according to a chosen pattern. Then more powder is added, melting and solidifying to add layer upon layer until the object is fully formed.</p>
<p>Its just a prototype of whats possible with current <a title="3D Printing and Manufacturing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3D printing and manufacturing technology</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://apigee.com/about/img/create_console_screen.png" alt="" align="right" />Apigee has <a title="API Console Release" href="http://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_to_go/">released its API Console as a free</a>, publicly available tool for use by any API provder.<p></p>
The <a title="API Console" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API Console</a> allows developers to view an API, authenticate with the API and begin making requests and seeing responses from an API.<p></p>
The new publicly available API console lets API owners create their own API console, skin it to match brand, and embed within any API area.<p></p>
The API console assists developers with authentication by handling <a class="zem_slink" title="OAuth" rel="homepage" href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a> 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 access to APIs.<p></p>
Once authenticated, developers can begin exploring an API and making calls.  It allows developers to begin using an API and understanding how it works without any programming.<p></p>
This type of exploration is critical for API adoption.   If users can play with all aspects of an API, understand how it works, they can begin visualizing how they will integrate with the API.<p></p>
Apigee's API Console is a must-have building block for any API service provider.

        I have spent time reviewing <a title="100+ Most Popular APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">100+ of the most popular APIs</a>.   I am trying to determine a common set of building blocks that are essential to API adoption.<p></p>
Here is a list of what I consider are the most common <a title="Building Blocks for API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks for API</a> areas:
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building blocks.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Overview</li>

	<li>Blog</li>
	<li>Forum</li>
	<li>FAQ</li>
	<li>Pricing</li>
	<li>Terms and Conditions</li>
</ul>
The most successful APIs also provide self-service developer tools:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Registration</li>
	<li>Application Registration</li>
</ul>
API pioneers like <a title="Ebay" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">Ebay</a>, <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, <a title="Flickr" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>, and Google have established a common set of essential API building blocks through trial and error over the last decade.<p></p>
Other API providers can learn from this <a title="API History" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/10/history-of-apis-birth-through-social/">API history</a> and experience, and make sure they start with the essential API building blocks for sucess.

        <img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ClearCode-API-Design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In the last 20 years we've seen the how the Internet has altered the role of the developer from a desktop software developer to a<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">web application</a> developer.<p></p>
It started with web sites, the need for talented graphic designers who could also assemble some HTML to deliver static web sites.<p></p>
With languages like <a class="zem_slink" title="VBScript" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript">VBScript</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/javascript/">JavaScript</a>, and Coldfusion, websites began evolving into Web applications, requiring developers to master more dynamic Web programming lanugages.<p></p>
Then smart phones began making the Internet <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> and pushing developers to start programming for platforms like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/">IPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/android/">Android</a>.<p></p>
The next phase:<strong><em> the API developer</em></strong>.<p></p>
