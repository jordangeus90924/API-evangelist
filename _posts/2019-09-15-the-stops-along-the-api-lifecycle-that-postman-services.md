<p>I&rsquo;m currently processing <a href="https://www.postman.com/use-cases/">the common Postman use cases</a>, and overlaying what the platform offers in context of historically what I&rsquo;ve called my API lifecycle research. I plan on brining my vision more in alignment with Postman&rsquo;s approach because I want to be telling consistent API lifecycle stories across API Evangelist and Postman, but also have things be in sync when I&rdquo;m out speaking in public. I spent some time going through the Postman website and application and documented all of the stops along the API lifecycle they service, and then I took that and mapped it to the vocabulary I&rsquo;ve been using to describe these areas as part of my own API lifecycle research. Providing me with a bulleted list of stops, not in any particular order, but demonstrating for me the scope of the impact Postman is making right now.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong> - Postman imports RAML, WADL, Swagger, and OpenAPI while also investing in their own API definition format called Postman Collections.

<p>I am sure there will be other dots I connect between what Postman delivers and my API research, but this gives me a good checklist to be thinking about when it comes to the overlap in my world(s). I&rsquo;m going to be bringing more of my storytelling into sync with their blue print use cases methodology, but no doubt I will also be influencing how we evolve these API lifecycle blue prints to match what I&rsquo;ve been seeing over the last nine years, but more importantly, the realities on the ground within the Postman ecosystem. This is why I am doing all of this work. I want to use the resulting common vocabulary to describe what is actually happening on the ground at companies, institutions, organizations, and government agencies. I don&rsquo;t want Postman or API Evangelist to be defining the API lifecycle, I want us to be responding to what we are seeing on the ground, and helping establish a common vocabulary for describing what we are seeing.<br /><br />This list represents why I joined Postman. It is the most coherent snapshot of what I&rsquo;ve been calling API lifecycle tooling and Postman has been calling an API development environment (ADP). It is the most coherent vision I&rsquo;m seeing when it comes to delivering across multiple stops along the API lifecycle out of an API service provider. However, more importantly, Postman is a Swiss army knife of API lifecycle capabilities that can be implemented by developers in the trenches. My mission is to help map out how API providers and consumers are using Postman across their teams. I&rsquo;m looking to help create API blueprints of the common patterns I&rsquo;m seeing, and make it dead simple to apply only what developers desire and nothing more. Making the API lifecycle a buffet of things that COULD happen, but it is up to developer to decide how, when, and why they are putting Postman to work.</p>
