[The Noun Project][1] is [soliciting feedback on their upcoming API][2]. If you aren’t familar with The Noun Project, it is a innovative visual language project, that is creating a library of icons that will enable people to visually communicate and interact around the globe. Direct from [The Noun Project about page][3]:

> _Humans have been using symbols to communicate for over 17,000 years because they are the one language everyone can understand. Symbols can transcend cultural and language barriers and deliver concise information effortlessly and instantaneously. They allow people to communicate quickly, effectively, and intuitively. And for the first time ever, this language is being combined with technology to create a social language that unites the world._

The Noun Project wants [our feedback on what a Noun Project API might look like][2] and what we would use it for.  So, I wanted to take a moment and share my thoughts, about what I would use The Noun Project API for, and some thoughts about what the endpoints might look like.

**Embeddable**
Normally an embeddable strategy for an API is in the background, relinquished to just one of the tools in the toolbox. With the Noun Project I think a healthy embeddable strategy would be front and center, providing a wide array of buttons, badges, widgets and other items users could syndicate across the web. The library of embeddable tools should be open for submission, much like the core of the Noun Project. Designers could generate custom button sets, badges and other embeddables for users to choose from. The Noun Project's embeddable strategy would make the Noun Project API accessible to everyone, even non-developers.

**Builders and IDE**
A Noun Project API would enable a next generation of mobile and web application apps, as well as other visualization and big data analysis tools to integrate consistent imagery. Makers of integrated development environments (IDE) could provide button, icon and other UI components with a wealth of meaningful icons, that could become the new default in modern apps. Think how Twitter bootstrap is raising the bar in overall app user interface quality? Love it or not, Twitter Bootstrap has made things look better, and consistent use of the Noun Project images could go even further.

**Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words**
The Noun Project API would enable a wealth of text to image visualization possibilities, allowing developers to accompany and represent everyday text in much more impactful ways. Imagine if in addition to titles and summaries, you always had a Noun Project icon to reference when reading on the web and via your favorite applications. A couple examples might be:
