<p>While <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/23/a-great-time-at-api-days-san-francisco/">I was at API Days this weekend in San Francisco</a>, I managed to catch a handful of talks Saturday afternoon after I landed at OAK. While listening to each talk, I kept hearing one technical API building block, over and over--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">webhook</a>.
<p>Webhooks are a common way for API providers to make API integration a two ways street for consumer. Developers, or even non-developers, can setup webhooks via common API platforms, and receive notifications about different events and activities that occur.
<p>Webhooks are also a common tool for <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API automation and reciprocity platforms</a> like <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=38">Zapier</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=39">IFTTT</a>.  Users can setup webhooks, that respond to just about any action across multiple, API driven platforms.

<p>After hearing webhooks mentioned so often, I wondered if anyone out there is offering web hook as a service (WHaaS) (LOL).  Sure enough, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) pointed me to <a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank">webscript.io</a>.
<p>Webscripts are short scripts, written in Lua, that run in the cloud servers, and can respond to any HTTP requests.
<p>Exactly what I was looking for. I had heard of webscript.io before, but for some reason it didn't stick in my mind.  It is precisely the simple approach I was looking for, and has many common examples like sending emails, counters, parsing RSS and Tweeting.
<p>I really like dead simple implementations like <a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank">webscript.io</a>, that solve real world problems in such granular, yet powerful ways.  Nice work <a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>.
