API service provider [APIphany][1] followed [some of my advice][2] this last week, and added [support for Github, Facebook and Twitter in all of their developer portals][3].

Using oAuth from Twitter, Facebook and especially Github for API providers, just makes sense in this online world. As a user, I donâ€™t want to create yet another login--I want to pick from my preferred social network.

It is good to see [APIphany][1] make sure their customers deliver friction-less onboarding for their developers, who are building mobile and web applications on top of their APIphany powered APIs.
