I woke up thinking about something Abhinav said recently, â€œWhat GitHub did to code, I imagine Postman will do that for APIs, shortening the cycle from using an API to building things with it." Yes! That is how I see Postman. GitHub changed my relationship with code in many ways. Github plays a significant role in how I produce, manage, and evolve the code that I produce for my own side projects and businesses, as well as the code I engage with as part of my job and the projects I work on. This blog post is my mental exercise of thinking through what GitHub has given me when it comes to code, which in my world translates pretty nicely to what I do with APIs. First, I published my thoughts about what GitHub did for code, and now I want to explore what Postman is doing for APIs.

### Distilling All of That Down

As I sit here thinking about what GitHub has done for me with code, and what Postman will do for me with APIs loaded in my head I can comfortably sit back and ponder on the shift we are going to need in the API universe. I see a little over 10 years of GitHub and 5 years of Postman in my head. I can think about the fundamental shifts in how I work because of both GitHub and Postman. I am spending tie thinking about what I want, but also other what business and technical leadership is going to want from their own API infrastructure and their service providers. Most importantly I want to also make sure I tune into what developers on the ground within the enterprise, small business, and other independent shops will want when it comes to their API operations. Here is what I distilled all this brainstorming down intoâ€¦

*   **About the Organization and People** - Postman has to address the organizational shift that has been set into motion with APIs, helping strike a balance between the business and human needs and motivations that exist across an organization or even an industry.
*   **Stabilizing Private, Partner, and Public** - Private, partner, and public APIs has long been used to describe the critical ways in which organizations do aPIs, and Postman has to help draw definitive lines, provide enterprise grade access control, and whatever is needed to navigate these layers.
*   **Bringing Consistency and Reliability** - Doing APIs well is difficult at scale, and Postman has to help API providers achieve more heightened levels of consistency and reliability across operations by helping standardize and test APIs across the entire API life cycle.
*   **Discoverable and Tangible by Default** - The number of APIs are growing and we are all going to need help making sure what we are building is tangible, meaningful, and discoverable, otherwise it will get lost in the noise of the API factory floor that is perpetually moving forward in tomorrow.
*   **Everything is Portable and Executable** - Postman has to make not just APIs, but the infrastructure we use to deliver them as portable, executable, reusable as possible helping API providers build out their API factor floors in a way that evolve in the same ways we are enabling our web, mobile, device and network apps.
*   **Security and Privacy Baked Into DNA** - Keeping our infrastructure secure is only going to get harder, and API providers and consumers. need as much help as they can get when it comes to identity, authentication, scanning, standards, vulnerabilities, dependencies, and everything else plaguing the digital world.
*   **Healthy Observability and Accountable** - Postman provides a wealth of existing outputs from the enterprise factory floor that can be harvest and used to make sense of what is going on, introducing healthier levels of observability and accountability across how APIs are doing what they do.
*   **he Tooling for Orchestrating it All** - The Postman platform provides all of the desktop, web, and open source tooling for delivering APIs throughout over time, helping API providers make sense of their ever evolving enterprise landscape, while also empowering API consumers to keep up with the pace of change.
If Postman is going to do for APIs what GitHub has done for code, I feel like it has to be rooted in these areas. I was using Git long before GitHub came along. It was their very public and social usage of Git that shifted my behavior. GitHub provided me with tools to help address the growing need to do business on the open web, as well as within the enterprise. GitHub helped play a role it breaking down the proprietary enterprise software monolith by applying a more modular, open source, versioned, and human way of moving software forward. Postman needs to ensure that many of the nutrients that allowed the GitHub community to flourish out in the open as well as on-premise within the enterprise firewall exists. However, Postman also has to help lead the conversation when it comes to API at this level because we are in uncharted territory and the GitHub blueprint doesnâ€™t provide us with everything we need to drive the conversation in the next decade, but it can help inform us.

That was a pretty fun exercise. I do not do this because I think it holds all the answers. I donâ€™t do these because I think anyone is going to read it all and understand where I am coming from. I do it because it helps me see the entire chess board. It also provides me with a game to play in my head while trying to relax. I donâ€™t see this as work. I like thinking about the moving parts of the API life cycle. If nothing else I am just more equipped for my next conversation with a customer about APIs, and all of these nuggets are on the tip of my tongue, ready to be spoke.
