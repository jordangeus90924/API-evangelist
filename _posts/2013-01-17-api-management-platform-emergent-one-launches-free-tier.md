{% include JB/setup %}<p>Emergent One, one of the newest API management players on the block, just announced a new free development tier.The Emergent One platform provides simple, cloud-based tools for connecting to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and quickly generating an API from your database.I didn’t sign up for their service when they first launched, because they didn’t have a free tier, and I’m unwilling to put in credit cards and commit to brand new services.This is something I have problem with from running development and IT teams who use a wide variety of cloud services.I would spend a great deal of time each month chasing down charges and other issues from cloud services that were being experimented with.</p>
