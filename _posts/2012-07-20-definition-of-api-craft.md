{% include JB/setup %}<p>The current API development space is very self-ruled, in that web API developers have freed themselves of earlier SOA attempts to rigidly define and ultimately constricted API growth, into a more grassroots, community-owned approach to RESTful API design.You can see this happen in real-time on the public Google Group called API Craft.API Craft was started by Apigee, as an open forum for sharing and developing knowledge and skills around APIs, where you can find the latest throughts, from the smartest people in the space.Â  I thoroughly enjoy the online version of API Craft, and just experienced my first offline version of API Craft at OSCON in Portland this week.Several API folks got together for beers and API Craft discussion at the White Eagle Saloon creating an awesome real-time, face-to-face extension of the online API Craft group--an experience I intend to initiate whenever I am in new cities around the country, and I encourage you to do the same.</p>
