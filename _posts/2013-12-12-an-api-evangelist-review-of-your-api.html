<p>
     Over the last 3 years I have looked at all the APIs available in <a href="https://bitly.com/10rGRbg+">ProgrammableWeb API directory</a>, with about 2500 of which I monitor regularly. Throughout this process I've evolved an eye for what building blocks go into a successful API program.
</p>
<p>
     When I review an existing API area or program, public or private, I spend as little or as much time as I need to look at an API initiative through the following 20 lenses:
</p>
<ul>
     <li>
          <strong>Overview</strong> - The general look, feel and initial impression of an API at the high level.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Endpoints</strong> - Review of API endpoints, looking at the detail.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>On-boarding</strong> - How easy is it to get up and going? Where is the friction?
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation</strong> - General API documentation review and critique.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Authentication</strong> - What is involved with authentication and security.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code</strong> - A look at all available code libraries, SDKs, apps and language or platform availability.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Mobile</strong> - Is there a mobile fit and how does an API address this world.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Support</strong> - What do direct and indirect support practices look like and what are activity levels.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Communications</strong> - How are communications handled, and is it done in a transparent way.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Change Practices</strong> - How are updates, changes, and communication around the roadmap handled.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Business Model</strong> - What is the business model of an API, how does it make ends meet.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Resources</strong> - What resources are provided from how-to, case studies to videos and workshops.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Research &amp; Development</strong> - Does an API reflect a research &amp; development group.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Legal Department </strong>- Covering the legal areas of terms of use, privacy and branding.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Embeddable</strong> - How portable and embeddable are aspects of the API? Can it be distributed easily?
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Environment</strong> - A look at the underlying environment of the API, sandboxing, testing, monitoring, etc.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Developers</strong> - What does this look like for a developer? What tools do we get to ensure success?
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Consistency</strong> - How consistent are API endpoints and the support resources, and the overall operations.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Openness</strong> - If the API is public, to what degree of open are API efforts? 
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Evangelism</strong> - What does outreach around the API look like, regarding events, social, storytelling, etc.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     You can look across the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html" target="_blank">building blocks I have listed for API management</a> to get a better idea of the detail I'm looking for across API operations. These building blocks have been assembled through over 3 years of reviewing APIs, and can provide a good checklist to use when applying the above lenses.
</p>
<p>
     Each review involves visiting an API area, applying the above 20 lenses, register and often times hack on an API. When done I write up a review report, which in many cases will be privately shared with a company and key stakeholders for review and discussion.
</p>
<p>
     In some cases, when approved, I will publicly write up a review, providing a more polished view of an API area based upon final review report, and publish on my API Evangelist network of blogs.
</p>
<p>
     The goal with a review is to better understand the balance of technology, business and politics going on within an API ecosystem, providing feedback that will help a company better achieve balance and success with their API initiative.
