			<p>I&rsquo;m doing some big data work. Ok it isn&rsquo;t really, but feels like I should use that label. What I&rsquo;m actually doing is analyzing the Twitter activity of top APIs. I have the twitter handles of 100 of the popular web APIs. I have been pulling and analyzing the Tweets from each of these accounts via the Twitter API for some time now. It is time that I scale this to about 500 API twitter accounts, and also start monitoring mentions of each of these APIs on Twitte, while also performing searches for some keywords associated with each API or a group of APIs. At this stage of growth, it was clear I was outgrowing the regular Twitter API and since what I&rsquo;m doing is more big data, than twitter client app, I am looking at the two approved Twitter resellers Gnip and Datasift. First I went to Gnip, looked at their product and it looked like what I needed. I saw at the bottom of the page, &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;. I recognize that language, clicked on it and filled out their form and I get a &ldquo;Thank You, Someone Will Be In Touch&rdquo;. Ok...so I move on to Datasift. I look at their product and it too, looks like what I need. I see on the page, &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;. I recognize that language, clicked on it, logged on with Twitter, added my email and password, and boom--I&rsquo;m dropped into a dashboard. I am able to build streams from Twitter using different keywords, Twitter users, etc. I get freemium access, with the ability to put in my credit card and be billed for more. Next, I got a quick email from a nice fellow at Gnip asking what I was looking to do, and if I had time in the next couple days to talk on the phone. &nbsp;I will definitely talk with them, but by the time I get on the phone with them I...[<a href="/2012/06/01/self-service-vs-sales-oriented-web-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Jun 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Many "public APIs" are launched with well, very "public" intent--to extend the reach of the brand and platform. Many of these APIs are setup to pull data, enabling developers to use it in their applications for free or paid, with the understanding they&rsquo;ll properly attribute the source.
Many of these APIs like Amazon E-Commerce, eBay, Google Places and Foursquare are engineered to publicly extend the central platform, all feeding back back to the &ldquo;mother ship&rdquo;, either through linking or other type of attribution.
As the Internet evolves, and the era of "big data" takes hold, and as the need for processing data and deriving meaning out of the flood of data available to us online grows--so does the demand for API access that isn&rsquo;t marketing centric.
As a big data developer I may be comparing product pricing from Amazon to auctions on eBay, and I may need to use Google Places data to identify best places to sell my products, and Foursquare to identify local demand.  The needs of big data API developers are going to be radically different than maybe your originally intended developer audience.
Hopefully you are already carefully targeting your developers and grouping them by their usage patterns.  Have you identified any users that are actively using your APIs, but not necessarily following regular patterns? &nbsp;Have you reached out to them?
It might be the case that your API won&rsquo;t be of interest to big data developers or quite possibly that this isn&rsquo;t a market you're interested in.  However it is a question every API owner should ask--is my API big data ready?

			<p>As a follow-up to the Executive Order 13571 issued on April 27, 2011, requiring executive departments and agencies to identify ways to use innovative technologies to streamline their delivery of services to lower costs, decrease service delivery times, and improve the customer experience--Barack Obama has directed federal agencies to deploy Web APIs. The Whitehouse CIO has released a strategy, entitled "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People", providing federal agencies with a 12-month plan that focuses on: Enabling more efficient and coordinated digital services delivery Encouraging agencies to deliver information in new ways that fully utilize the power and potential of mobile and web-based technologies Requiring agencies to establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt new standards for making applicable Government information open and machine-readable by default Requiring agencies to use web performance analytics and customer satisfaction measurement tools President Obama has set the timeframe for roll-out and accountability at: Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, create a page on its website, located at www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy, to publicly report progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format. implement the requirements of the Strategy within 12 months of the date of this memorandum and comply with the timeframes for specific actions specified therein Ok, can I call 2012, the year of the API now? Of course this announcement makes me extremely excited! This is something I didn't think I'd see in the next 5 years, but of course I'm super skeptical too. Is this something that these agencies are capable of? Is there enough political will to make happen? I sure hope so. I've seen some good coverage of this news on popular tech blogs, but we'll have to wait 90 days and see ho many agencies have publicly reported on "progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format", and ultimately how much momentum this actually gets--or...[<a href="/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
In my effort to better understand API access, I&rsquo;m studying how API owners control access to their APIs, with most recently being around Rate Limiting. The other day I asked,&nbsp;why do we limit API access for developers, and even&nbsp;explored rewarding developers for heavy usage.
As I continue to understand the impact of rate limits on developers it&rsquo;s becoming clearer that for an API to successfully impose rate limits, you should also be offering rate limit release valves in the following ways:

Increase Request Form&nbsp;- There should be a formal, self-service way to request rate limits either for valid uses that you hadn&rsquo;t considered bumping up against rate limit ceiling, or quite possibly for non-commercial purposes.
Utility Pricing&nbsp;- Providing a pay as you go model, where users meet the "courtesy limit", they can put in their credit card and pay for what they use above and beyond the default rate limit.


There are many points of friction for developers trying to integrate with an API. In my research, one of the ongoing complaints of developers regarding an API is around rate limits. Many of these complaints are directed at APIs who impose rate limits without any clear path beyond the default limits.
Google seems to be offering opportunities for developers to pay for use beyond their "courtesy limits", providing a form of release valve for developers concerns about API rate limits. &nbsp;Google is providing these release valves for API services via their&nbsp;API Console, but only appear to available for a handful of services.&nbsp;
While I&rsquo;m still unsure about API rate limits in general, it seems clear that if you are going to limit, make sure and provide a release valve in some way, so developers understand what the options are when they hit the ceiling, and that there are opportunities to grow.

There is a new API edition to the healthcare industry this week.  lifeIMAGE launched an API that can be used by developers of healthcare applications, to enable the secure exchange of medical images and related patient records.
Norman Young, President and CEO of ClearCanvas, said &ldquo;We were founded on the simple belief that medical imaging informatics should be accessible to all. Now, using the lifeIMAGE API, users of our FDA-cleared diagnostic viewer will be able to instantaneously share images that are in front of them with any one.&rdquo;
The healthcare is industry that is ripe for API adoption, so I&rsquo;m always looking for &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; new API stories for the space--lifeImage API is perfect.  You can find out more about the API at  www.lifeimage.com/api.

			<p><em>31 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I talk with a lot of entrepreneurs in my travels to conferences, hackathons and online with my API evangelism. I get a lot of ideas pitched to me, asking me for feedback, and ultimately if I think their startup is viable.
I hear a lot of good ones, and bad ones. Even the good ones face an uphill battle to get noticed in an extremely crowded and noisy landscape. The one piece of advice I leave with all startups about how to get their web or mobile app noticed?
Develop an API!!
The one thing an API can do for your startup is allow your product to become a feature in other platforms. If you deliver only as a mobile or web app, you are leaving out numerous opportunities to become the next killer Facebook or Salesforce feature, or something smaller like a Wordpress add-on, but ultimately something that could make enough of a mark, that your startup could survive.
So when you are planning the feature list for your killer startup, make sure you consider an API, and the potential of becoming the next killer feature in an existing platform.

			<p><em>31 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>In my quest to understand the monetization opportunities via APIs, I&rsquo;m studying the possibilites around tracking, and now monetization of content and URL&rsquo;s served up via APIs. The other day I considered wrapping URLs for another layer of metrics in your API, and today I&rsquo;m thinking about how to evolve API monetization beyond advertising, defining entirely new API driven conversion events where both API owners and consumers, can realistically make money. I first talked about an advertising network dedicated to APIs and developers last year, and everytime I come back to it in my Evernote list, I can&rsquo;t help but consider using the Google Affiliate Network as an engine. I don&rsquo;t have any access to Google Affiliate Network (I submitted request), so all of this is speculative. But after looking through the Google Afffiliate Network API interface, it looks like I can pull both advertisers, publishers and events through the API-- so I&rsquo;m envisioning two scenarios: API Owners - As an API owner I could use the Google Affiliate network to define &ldquo;events&rdquo; that could occur via my APIs, and setup my API developers as &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. API Consumers - As an API consumer I could setup various APIs I use as &ldquo;advertisers&rdquo;, creating specific events for these APIs, and setup my own applications or sites as &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. In either case, API owners or API consumers could replace any URLs in content or URLs directly served up via APIs with a Google Affiliate Network generated URL with specific conversion events defined, then shortened using Google URL Shortener API. This would create a layer of not just metrics, but conversion events that could be monetized. API consumers could choose from affiliate opportunities available on the Google Affiliate Network, and API owners could do the same, or define their own conversion events that were meaningful to their business goals. These are just some original thoughts on API monetization using Google Afffiliate Network API and the Google URL Shortener...[<a href="/2012/05/31/api-monetization-api-affiliate-network-api-google-url-shortener-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Pinterest and The Fancy are locked in a deathmatch, if you hadn't heard? Compete wrote back in February that The Fancy was poised to take over a chunk of Pinterest's traffic with their new webstore.  Fast forward 5 months, The Fancy has just launched an update to their iOS which includes the ability to purchase products from the mobile app with just one click.
Nice move!  The Fancy is definitely an easier and cleaner looking site than  Pinterest, and with a monetization move, The Fancy could gain even more market share against Pinterest.
Now if The Fancy wanted to seal the deal and put a death nail in Pinterest's coffin, they should launch an API, and make The Fancy a platform.  Don't just open up API access to your content--open up API access to your new commerce layer as well.
Once you have this mapped out, deploy a well crafted suite of embeddable objects, like share and buy buttons, along with essential widgets--all with the commerce layer built in.

Developers and non-developers will make sure The Fancy becomes ubiquitous across the web, and because you chose to consider monetization, while making your platform play, and included developers in this model, the entire platform will be sustainable and outlast anything Pinterest can come up with.

			<p>I recently stumbled across the University of Washington&rsquo;s Web Services area, where they are working to create a single place to learn about, discover and connect with various APIs that are available at the University. As the home page says: Web Services at the University of Washington is a method of getting important institutional data from and/or into your applications. Web Services are a way for applications or systems to talk to one another and does not usually involve human interaction. I&rsquo;m always trying to understand where the next wave of API growth might come from, and while the enterprise is definintely sitting on a treasure chest of information and resources, just waiting to be exposed via APIs--I think Universities might be in the same position. As soon as Universities start realizing how many APIs they have laying around already, and understand the potential of launching new ones, they are going to have a massive API management problem. I stumbled across UW APIs via a ProgrammableWeb update of 7 web services from the University. I started looking around further, and discovered there were 29 total APIs available at UW Web Services. I&rsquo;m not sure why only 7 are listed at PW, but right there you start seeing slippage in the current API directory model. Quickly invdividual schools are going to face the same problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs and need to standardize their management platform with: Access - Usage of a healthy balance of keys and OAuth for accessing school and student data&nbsp; Discovery - Establish some sort of WADL or other discovery service that can feed not just a human directory but IDEs and other programmatic discovery.&nbsp; Explorer - Provide an API explorer so developers and even non-programmers can make calls against any API without writing code&nbsp; Billing - Establish some sort of billing layer, if only for making high volume users pay for access and pay for infrastructure--but also...[<a href="/2012/05/30/api-management-platform-for-universities/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2012/05/29/why-do-we-limit-api-access-for-developers/">Why Do We Limit API Access for Developers?</a></h3>
			<p><em>29 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I am putting a lot of thought into why we limit API access for developers. &nbsp;I understand requiring keys to access APIs, and tracking who has access to your API, so you can understand how they are using it. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why you&rsquo;d want to limit API access.
By limit, I mean...here is an API, you get 100 calls, then no more! No option for paying, begging or pleading for more access. There are some APIs (I will evaluate specific APIs in the future), that have this approach, and it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.
Last year I touched on this subject with a post in ProgrammableWeb called,&nbsp;Should We Be Limiting Developers&rsquo; API Usage? Where I flip this model on its head and showcase two API providers, YellowAPI and ironically enough Qwerly (another story by itself), and how they were actually rewarding developers for more API usage.
I understand that in the early days, limiting access was a way to keep people from using their APIs too much, but I think in the era of cloud computing, that throttling as opposed to limiting is a better option. Let price control a developers API usage, and set that price at a level that is logical for this equation.
If your limiting developers from using your API, why even have one? It seems like you should sit down and re-evaluate your business model. I hope you don&rsquo;t have other products that your customers can access, that at some point you cut them off and say, you can&rsquo;t have anymore.

			<p><em>29 May 2012</em></p>

APIs are making information more accessible across many industries and sectors, but one area I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of movement, until recently, is at Universities.
Last month, Harvard openly licensed their library meta data and through a partnership with the Digital Public Library of America, made it available via APIs.  But today&rsquo;s story is more about APIs driving the operations side of higher ed at the University of Washington.
Under the Universities of Washingtons web services site, you can learn, discover and connect to 29 separate University APIs:





Academic Calendar
UW's authorization management service
Bandwidth Quota Service
Benefit Rate Service
Catalyst Crowds
Catalyst WebQ
CSE - MyUW Conduit
CSE Cloud Auth
CSE Grades
CSE Host Rec
CSE Provisioning and Mail Routing Web Service
CSE Times Away
CSE Undergrad Exit Survey

IdCard Web Service (Photos)
IT Connect News
Person Web Service
R25 Classroom Scheduling Web Service
Space Web Service
Student Web Service
Study_Abroad_Public
UW Events Calendar
UW GoHuskies Athletics Feed





Its grest to see that the University is trying to create a single directory of all University web services, and even has an API suggestion service where students and faculty can submit and vote on ideas for new, useful campus APIs.

With the volatility of school funding, online learning and just overall competition in higher ed, Universities need to start noticing of the transformative powers of APIs, and how it can make University operations more transparent, accessible and nimble, and potentially even save money when it comes to empowering the students themselves to build interfaces for accessing vital University information.

			<p><em>29 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Twitter just rolled back their architectural approach for Twitter.com back to a server side implementation.
If you remember back in September of 2010, Twitter rebuilt Twitter.com to use a web application architecture that pushed all of the UI rendering and logic to Javascript running in the browser and consumed the Twitter API directly.
Now they are "taking back control" of their front-end performance by moving the rendering back to the server.  They don't say whether they don't use the APIs at all, but I am working under the assumption that they abandoned them.
Twitter felt the API driven web application architecture broke new ground, offered a number of advantages, but it lacked support for various optimization techniques available only on the server.
I was excited to see Twitter go with the API driven approach, along other sites, like the FCC. &nbsp;I hate to see them abandon it.
What does this say about an API oriented architecture?
Are we not ready?  Are there are not enough tools for optimization, or the talent to deliver the performance necessary for Internet at scale via API driven architecture? &nbsp;Or maybe there are other business reasons for stopping eating their own dog food and going back to a server side architecture?

			<p><em>26 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m documenting Twitter&rsquo;s process of wrapping the URLs contained within tweets, using a shorter URL like t.co.  I&rsquo;m interested in understanding the opportunities around URL wrapping (aka URL shortening) as an API business strategy.
From an API business perspective, the reasoning for implementing URL wrapping as part of your API would be:

Saving Space - By shortening URLs you are reducing the length of any string that contains URLs, and in cases like Twitters, every character counts
Security - Twitter is actively combating URLs that carry malicious intent
Analytics - Each shortened URL provides a mechanism for tracking clicks on URL within content

Shold URL wrapping be something API owners adopt for all content served up via an API?  Could every URL within content served up via an API be wrapped, allowing tracking of clicks through that URL--no matter where that content ended up living after it left the API?
Just some initial thoughts, but it seems that a comprehensive linking strategy could be established, bundled with a URL shortening service like Bit.ly, Google URL Shortener or a custom service--and provide a new layer of metrics that could be used to tell how your developers and their application users are interacting with the content you serve up via your API.

			<p>One of the best ways to explain what APIs are to someone sitting next to me on the plane is to find something the user does every day, that is driven by an API, and explain how an API drives the functionality they take for granted. I tend to look for industry specific examples if they are an accountant or stock broker, but the most common example I use, is Facebook. Facebook is technology everyone I meet has exposure with. My story always starts with Facebook.com, and how the social networking website was built for people. People go to www.facebook.com and they see HTML web pages, that allow them to interact with the community. Next I move to the Facebook application on their mobile phone. While the application is built for people to use, the application needs a way to talk with Facebook--in comes APIs. APIs are a way for other programs to interact with Facebook, providing a interface for developers to build applications that use Facebook. When you first login to Facebook on your mobile phone, the applications makes a request to the Facebook Authentication API, and gives your mobile application rights to interact with your Facebook account on your behalf. After your logged into the Facebook application on your mobile app, every action you take will make an API call. When you click on your news feed, update your status, look at photos or check-in to a place, they each represent a different call to the Facebook Open Graph API. The Open Graph API exposes almost every aspect of Facebook as a programmatic interface that applications can use, hence the name Application Programming Interface (API). &nbsp; Most online technologies that you use everyday have APIs. Amazon, EBay, Facebook, Twitter and Google all have APIs, allowing developers to build applications on top of their businesses, turning their websites into web services.

			<p>Here we are going into June, and I still don&rsquo;t see a publicly available Pinterest API. Jay Yarow wrote in Business Insider back in February, "Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited" and Adam Duvander wrote in ProgrammableWeb, "Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here?". There is also a reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati, Lead Engineer at Pinterest from May 2011, saying the API is 2-3 weeks away. It&rsquo;s now a year later and there is no official API (there is a Rogue API). Business Insider says, Pinterest fears having a "Twitter problem&rdquo;. Meaning that when Twitter released its API, it was still an immature company, allowing developers to build applications with features that it was missing--then Twitter matured, and it wanted to control its platform, it began adding building its own features and poaching from the Twitter API ecosystem. So why not learn from Twitter and other APIs, and use the appropriate API building blocks to address this: Branding Guidelines - Establish branding guidelines that clearly lays out what apps that use Pinterest API should look like UI / UX Toolkit - Provide a UI / UX toolkit like Twitter Bootstrap that sets the tone for applications built on the API Roadmap - Provide a real-time and transparent roadmap that developers can use to help keep their development efforts in line with Pinterest Developer Framework - Establish a developer framework outlining opportunities for developers to become stronger members of API community, also introducing possible investment and incubation of most success or important features Terms of Use - Establish a fair and equitable terms of use that protects Pinterests but acknowledges the commercial aspirations of developers Events / Meetups - Establish a roadshow or network of meetups that brings developers together and makes them part of the Pinterest API community These are just a few of the ways Pinterest could establish a solid business strategy for their API that...[<a href="/2012/05/25/lack-of-pinterest-api-is-a-lack-of-api-business-strategy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m always looking for solid examples of how more and more of our every day world is being driven by APIs.  Examples I can use to help explain APIs to every-day business folks.
I came across one example that will speak to many business executives today via an Apigee Innovator Spotlight on their client TradeKing.  When asked about the vision of their API program Dan Raju CIO of TradeKing says:

We are one of the top-ranked online brokerages in the country, growing very rapidly. We manage people's assets, give them a set of capabilities to trade, and offer an extremely transparent pricing structure. However, we recognized that our customers&rsquo; demands for next-generation interfaces are rapidly changing, and our API helps us stay in front of that. We anticipate that in the next phase, the API will be a meaningful revenue driver for us. It is already opening us up to new markets.  We will continue to develop our own platforms on the API and incentivize and engage our development partners.  At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about delivering value to our customers, and the API will continue to help us drive increased value at an accelerated pace.

Raju hits on all the best of the API buzzwords including transparency, rapid change, meaningful revenue, open to new markets, and delivering value to end-customers.
I feel TradeKings vision of their API program, speak to larger visions of the API driven economy we are now immersed in, and provide a great example we can reference when helping other companies not just understand what an API is, but the imperative for their companies to embrace APIs and actively join the API economy.

			<p><em>24 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Facebook provides an interface for Open Graph API developers to better understand how users are interacting with content via their applications, called&nbsp;Insights.
With Insights you can monitor the number of your unique users that are seeing and accessing a Facebook authorization dialog, number of unique users publishers stories through Open graph as well as viewing and clicking on those stories.
While the number of users clicking, viewing on stories is very cool, I&rsquo;m interested in their stats regarding the authorization dialog.  Insights provides data on how many times people access your dialog authorization, with the number of acceptances, while also breaking down the number of views, acceptances into a corresponding conversion rate.

If your authorization dialog prompts users for different permission sets, you&rsquo;ll also see a breakdown of the impressions, accepts and CTR for each one, showing you the rates at which people accept and reject different permission sets--helping you to identify the most optimal permission set for your authorization dialog, which will directly help increase user installs for your app.
This kind of insights for developers is critical, helping them understand the level of engagement with users and build a more effective Auth Dialog flow, which could make or break an applications Facebook Open Graph integration and adoption.
Providing developers with analytics to evaluate their users API usage is so valuable, I wonder if I can find any other examples of this granular type of OAuth reporting with other APIs or from API service providers like Apigee?

Nike is working on a new API as part of their Nike Better World initative.  The API provides access to a materials sustainability index, which evaluates the environmental impact of materials used by manufacturers.
The scoring system evaluates the environmental impacts of materials used in products using a combination of materials-specific data, covering areas such as Chemistry, Energy and Greenhouse Gas Intensity, Water and Land Use Intensity, and Waste.
The Nike Materials Sustainability Index API is only in alpha stage right now, and is undergoing for a peer review process with Duke University.  You can follow their Nike Maker&rsquo;s Blog to get more information on the initiative and get notified when the API will be available to the public.

Adam Duvander (@adamd)&nbsp;reported at ProgrammableWeb today that they rolled over 6,000 public APIs in the directory.  The pace at which companies are launching public APIs is accelerating, with the last 1,000 added in just 3 months.
Any of us in the space knows that this is just the tip of the iceberg, and Adam acknowledges that internal API usage is a major factor in API growth.  While public APIs get all the major press, there are many private API initiatives that won&rsquo;t see the light of day.
So my question is, how are we going to track on the growth of private APIs along with public APIs?  Since mobile app development is such an important piece, can we count mobile apps produced by a company?  Can we count on API service providers to start reporting on this data?
I don&rsquo;t have the answer.  It is something I think we need to figure out, not just so ProgrammableWeb can have its finger on the pulse, but there is an ever increasing amount of business and personal resources flowing through these API pipes, we need to have an understanding of where these API pipes are laid, which industries, etc.
Much like the rollout of fiber in the late 90&rsquo;s, we are going to see massive API rollouts, without much oversight and map of where these virtual pipes are.  I&rsquo;d like to hear more about how we can work together to build a map of the back-end of the new API driven economy.

I am going through all my notes from organizing the CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon and trying to publish as many stories as I can, about how I planned and organized the hackathon.
One service that was a catalyst for the event occuring, was assistance from EventUp.  EventUp is a service that assists event venue owners in finding people to rent their space, and in turn can help you find the ideal location for your hackathon.&nbsp;
Tony Adam (@tonyadam) the owner of EventUp emailed me one day after I had submitted a request via eventup.com for more information on venues for my Hackathon in the Los Angeles area.  He offered to help make sure I found the right location.
After a couple days he helped me secure CoLoft which was the best location for the hackathon imaginable.  It was accessible, had great layout with tables, good wifi and the staff was extremely helpful.
EventUp isn&rsquo;t in all markets yet, but if you&rsquo;re planning a hackathon I recommend talking with Tony at Eventup, and seeing if they have the right location for your event.

			<p><em>16 May 2012</em></p>

I am really starting to see my early visions of the Internet&nbsp;coming together.  In my mind I see an interconnected world of products and commerce, where every business has an API.
APIs finally seem to be maturing, reaching a point where they can deliver at the scale and reliability we need, to really make this happen.  Three good examples of this are:

The StructuredRetailProducts.com API - Providing to access to over 3 million individual product listings from 1700+ companies, representing total sales of over &pound;3,382 billion and counting. Access 15+ years of product and market data across 72 different countries at the click of a button and get the latest data on sales volumes, activity levels, and market share.
The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API - A Digital Commerce Engine&trade; for driving any e-commerce experience, on any device or platform, allowing companies to build compelling product experiences, leverage new business models, and extend their reach to emerging end points.
Stripe API - A complete payment platform, that handles everything, including storing cards, subscriptions, and direct payouts to your bank account, without a merchant account or gateway.

When you look through those three APIs, you see the simplicity of REST + JSON, plus the essential building blocks to support developers, and the power and scalability you need to drive commerce in the API driven economy.

Last week Facebook announced a new App Center where developers can submit applications they've built. &nbsp;Like any API owner, Facebook is looking for high quality applications to list in its directory and has published a list of App Center Best Practices:

Websites must provide a personalized experience - All websites and mobile web apps need to immediately present authenticated users with a logged-in experience. Specifically, we&rsquo;re looking for personalization, such as name and profile picture, so users know that their Facebook information is being used to create an account. 
Review your app settings - App detail pages are dynamic based on the integrations you&rsquo;ve specified on the basic settings page of the Developer App. Be sure to review this and remove any old or non-functional integrations. 
Provide high-quality images - Your images should match the quality of your app. As specified in the guidelines, images shouldn&rsquo;t have buttons, excessive text, borders, dropshadows, URLs, promotions, pricing, or third-party logos. 
Input accurate names &amp; thoughtful descriptions - Don&rsquo;t add any additional keywords to the name of your app. Proofread your app description for spelling and grammar and remove unnecessary symbols, like stars, hearts and multiple exclamation points.

Some food for thought. Every app center will be different and have different requirements. I think I will add App Center Best Practices as a building block, after I look at a wide selection of other API app showcases, and identify some common best practices.

			<p><em>15 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>Explaining to developers, what an API does, can be hard. How you describe your API, the underlying endpoints, can make or break user adoption. You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to evolve, and keep trying to find the sweet spot in both the language and branding that you use in your API area. I saw an example of this today, with the restructuring of PeopleBrowsr's APis. When I first starting playing with PeopleBrowsr's APIs, they were broken into 3 separate APIs: PeopleBrowsr API Kredentials API Kred API On the surface its really hard to know what each of these APIs does, but after I dove in I saw lots of value within individual methods, but I really had to spend time, getting to know each method, one by one. I saw the value, but the structure and presentation of the PeopleBrowsr API area, and the way the interfaces were assembled, didn&rsquo;t immediately speak to this value. Today they&rsquo;ve restructured their three APis into a single API, dubbed the PeopleBrowsr Kred API, and grouped all the API methods into four logical groups: Find Influencers - Pinpoints influential people on any subject or within communities connected by shared interests or affinities. Deep Analytics - Author-based analytics which includes Kredentials (a single-screen summary of anyone&rsquo;s social presence), historical Kred scores, reach, and friends &amp; followers. Action Analytics - Aggregated social data metrics for any keyword, hashtag or @name, including mention counts, word clouds and hashtag clouds. Global Kred Score - Appends global Kred scores to @names or twitter IDs in web-based applications. This new presentation immediately helps me understand which methods I should use based upon my goals. PeopleBrowsr took the time to understand how developers were using their API, and worked to present the API in a way that best speaks to this. PeopleBrowsr also took the time to understand the value delivered via their API in each of these new areas and restructure pricing to reflect this value:...[<a href="/2012/05/15/peoplebrowsr-api-restructures-to-deliver-more-meaning-for-developers/">Read More</a>]</p>

API metrics are an essential, but what should we measure?  There are two metrics that seems to dominate discussions about success of the API industry:

Number of New API Registration
Number of Daily and Monthly API Calls

Every API I&rsquo;ve consulted with, use the same two metrics, if they have any at all.  The tech blogosphere (driven by API service providers) have created a so call billionaires club, showcasing APIs that have over a billion API calls within a day or month.
Investors are even using the number of API calls as a&nbsp;metric to consider the valuation of a company, and seen as a good indicator of the demand for a company&rsquo;s services.
I agree that new registrations and number of API calls are a start, but we should be able to identify many other metrics to truly measure the activity and success of an API and the sentiment of it's API developer community.

			<h3><a href="/2012/05/14/usda-releases-api-for-mandatory-livestock-reporting-data/">USDA Releases API for Mandatory Livestock Reporting Data</a></h3>
			<p><em>14 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
USDA&rsquo;s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has released a new, publicly available web API for its Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) system, offering access to all historical LMR data, allowing users to pull large amounts of customized data sets via a RESTful interface with JSON embedded URLs and XML formatted output.
"The Livestock Mandatory Reporting program facilitates open, transparent price discovery and provides all market participants, both large and small, with comparable levels of market information for cattle, swine, sheep, beef and lamb meat," said Craig Morris, Deputy Administrator of the AMS Livestock and Seed Program. "This new web service will provide our customers with additional resources to obtain large volumes of data."

In 2001, USDA&rsquo;s Agricultural Marketing Service implemented the Livestock Mandatory Reporting program as required by the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999, establishing a program to track information on the marketing of cattle, swine, lambs, and the products of such livestock, providing information that can be readily understood by producers to improve the price and supply reporting services of the Department of Agriculture, while also encouraging competition in the marketplace for livestock and livestock products.
A great example of APIs providing being used to manage and regulate industries while also letting markets freely operate, and encouraging competition.  Imagine that, the best of both worlds.

			<p>This summer its been 2 years since I started API Evangelist. API Evangelist started as my research project into the Business of APIs, and became a full time career. While over the last two years I&rsquo;ve worked for clients like Mimeo and CityGrid, my ultimate goal is to focus on studying the Business of APIs. So whenever I get the time, I study how popular APIs operate, and how they are transforming industries. This month, I&rsquo;m getting the opportunity to dive deeper into my research around different API business models, with the chance to look at the politics within specific API ecosystems. While my research will always span the entire API sector, this round I&rsquo;m going to study the approach of some of the most successful APIs: Twitter - Deep understanding of the largest, and most important API ecosystem Facebook - Better understanding of the largest API driven social platform Google - Document the 100 or so APIs offered by Google, and the platform that connects them LinkedIn - Better picture of the leading business social network platform Amazon - Document the history of this API pioneer Twilio - Understand how Twilio continues to deliver their API, and woo developers I&rsquo;m going to begin by&nbsp;analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem, and as more funding comes through I&rsquo;ll focus on the other APis. While studying each API I look at: Historical company blog posts, tweets and press releases Historical blog posts and tweets from the blogosphere and developers I organize all my research into a curation framework I&rsquo;ve developed and will be generating: Timeline - A easy to navigate, timeline of the APIs history through curated blog posts, tweets and company announcments. Blog Posts&nbsp;- Single and series of blog posts documenting the business and politics of each API provider. Final Paper(s) - Each project will have at least one final white-paper with findings from the research.

			<p><em>14 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I attended a great webinar put on by the folks at Apigee last week, where they discussed APIs &amp; Copyright.  A very timely discussion with the recent API copyright decision in the EU, and from the ongoing Oracle vs. Google case.
As I process all discussions around API copyright, I&rsquo;m going to publish relevant pieces here at API Voice, for everyone else to process along with me.  One interesting piece of the Apigee discussion is that APIs have been copyrightable for the last 22 years--specifically referencing the JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC. v. PHOENIX CONTROL SYSTEMS, INC. from October 3rd, 1989.  On page three, it states:
"A computer program is made up of several different components, including the source and object code, the structure, sequence and/or organization of the program, the user interface, and the function, or purpose, of the program. Whether a particular component of a program is protected by a copyright depends on whether it qualifies as an "expression" of an idea, rather than the idea itself."
Beyond Johnson Controls, Inc v. Phoenix Control Systems, it appears there is further precedent to apply copyright to APIs.  The filing also references:
See Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.,471 U.S. 539, 547, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2223, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985); Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.,862 F.2d 204, 207-08 (9th Cir.1988); 17 U.S.C. &sect; 102(b).
I think the questions API owners and developers should be asking themselves is not, whether or not they might have to think about API copyright protection in the future, but that it is something they should be discussing now, when it comes to their other legal API&nbsp;building blocks like&nbsp;terms of use,&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;and&nbsp;branding.

			<p><em>14 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for API stories that capture the power of APIs, showcasing how they are transforming industries and businesses around the globe. Today, my global API monitoring platform picked up one such story in Edinburg, Scotland. In the summer of 2011, the summer-based Edinburgh Festivals made their event listings data publicly available for digital developers and technologists, via web APIs. There are seven events participating in the API: Edinburgh Jazz &amp; Blues Festival Edinburgh Art Festival Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo Edinburgh Mela Edinburgh International Festival Edinburgh International Book Festival Edinburgh Festival Fringe Despite all the printed brochures and media coverage, with 44,000 performances in 3,000 separate venues, discovery, planning and finding what you want to see at the Edinburgh festivals is a near impossible task. Event organizers needed a way to provide the most up to date event information for the media and press, while also delivering the most enhanced experience possible for festival goers. So, upholding their commitment to openness and innovation, the Edinburgh Festival organizers decided to release their data via API. With an API they hoped to challenge developers to build things that extended the reach of the festival, beyond what the event could do themselves.&nbsp; Immediately festival organizers started seeing innovation around the API, and further encouraged developers with the Edinburgh Festivals Idea Challenge, offering prizes to the top 25 of 291 ideas submitted. &nbsp;The Edinburgh Festival API has spawned many projects including: Festipods&nbsp;&ndash; a fun and engrossing way of visualizing the Edinburgh festival events that you have attended Festivalclock.com&nbsp;- a beautiful visualisation of the summer festivals listings information FakeFringe&nbsp;- a fun game where players have to guess which Fringe show description is real and which is the fake Festafriend&nbsp;- a website that uses the festivals as a way for people to date and make new friends Andrew Coulton (@acoulton), of the Ediburgh International Book Festival was very excited about APIs from the beginning, realizing there was a...[<a href="/2012/05/14/api-innovation-at-the-edinburgh-festivals/">Read More</a>]</p>

There are a lot of high value APIs emerging these days,  APIs with access to essential business data, resources and intelligence.
When designing your API you want to make the interface as intuitive as possible, and ensure&nbsp;as wide as access to it as you possibly can.&nbsp;To quote Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO regarding Java APIs:
"We wanted to build the biggest tent and invite as many people as possible,&rdquo; Schwartz said. &ldquo;You have open APIs and compete on implementations."
To do this, I encourage building tools and widgets that non-developers can use when working with your API.  A great example of this is at Google, with their Google Analytics Dashboard Library.  Google wanted to make it easier for users to deploy a dashboard that was tailored specifically for their business, so using a team of University of California Irvine students, they set out to simplify it down to 3 steps:

Register with Google APIs Console.
Copy and paste the JavaScript code.
Configure this code to query your data and choose a chart type to visualize it.

Now, you still have to be JavaScript savvy to work with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library, understand how to edit your site, and be fluent in Google Analytics--but it&rsquo;s a step closer to providing wider access to the power of the Google Analytics API, beyond just the development community.
LinkedIn also has some great examples of taking concept this to the next level with their &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; builders which essentially generates the widgets for users, using the API. Since Google is going to keep working with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library over the next 3 quarters, so I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see their library evolve as well.

I&rsquo;ll keep exploring other great examples of API embeddable strategies that can potentially bring in a much wider audience, opening up your API for access beyond developers, potentially bringing in other more business oriented groups.

Twitter has an innovative approach to presenting the objects that make up the Twitter Platform.  They have built a&nbsp;field guide to Twitter Platform objects, designed like an Audubon Society field guide, describing the four primaty Twitter objects:

Tweets -&nbsp;Also known as a&nbsp;Status Update, Tweets are the basic atomic unit of all things Twitter. Users&nbsp;create Tweets. Tweets can be&nbsp;embedded,&nbsp;replied to,&nbsp;favorited,&nbsp;unfavorited,&nbsp;retweeted,&nbsp;unretweeted&nbsp;and&nbsp;deleted.
Users -&nbsp;Users can be anyone or anything. They&nbsp;tweet,&nbsp;follow,&nbsp;create lists, have a&nbsp;home_timeline, can be&nbsp;mentioned, and can belooked up&nbsp;in bulk.
Entities -&nbsp;Entities provide metadata and additional contextual information about content posted on Twitter. Entities are never divorced from the content they describe. After May 14th, 2012&nbsp;Tweet Entities&nbsp;will be returned wherever&nbsp;Tweets&nbsp;are found in the API. Entities are instrumental in&nbsp;resolving URLs.
Places -&nbsp;Places are specific, named locations with corresponding geo coordinates. They can be attached to&nbsp;Tweets&nbsp;by specifying a&nbsp;place_id&nbsp;when&nbsp;tweeting. Tweets associated with places are not necessarily issued from that location but could also potentially be&nbsp;about&nbsp;that location.&nbsp;Places&nbsp;can be&nbsp;created&nbsp;and&nbsp;searched for. Tweets can also be&nbsp;found&nbsp;by place_id.

It is a creative way to educate users about the Twitter API, making it more visually appealing. Beyond that, I'm not sure it helps developers get up and running using the API, but who knows...it might make it more accessible to some users.
Have you seen any other creative wasy of displaying API documentaton?

In my Google Reader I curate hundreds of articles pulled from 600+ blogs and 25+ real-time Google Alerts, on a daily basis.  Everything I star in my Google Reader or Tweet about daily ends up in my Pinboard account.  In addition to this curation, I bookmark every relevant site and post I come across in my daily surfing using the Pinboard bookmarklet.
Using the Pinboard API I setup a news curation system at API Evangelist which pulls my latest pinboards every 15 minutes and adds them to a curation queue which I monitor every couple hours.  My API Evangelist curation system allows me to add comments and tags, further adding meaning to what I&rsquo;ve already read throughout the day. Then using a combinations of tags, I route relevant news to&nbsp; API Evangelist and Hack Weekends.
These curated links represent the daily reading and research that goes into my writing and industry reports.  I thought it would be good to share with you some of what I read on a daily basis, my random comments and insights, rather than just the final results.

			<p><em>03 May 2012</em></p>
			<p>As my professional career moved online during the years between 1995 and 2000, I had numerous visions about what the World Wide Web could do for businesses. I think I shared these visions with millions of other individuals, fueling what we now know as the first Internet bubble. I saw e-commerce driving entirely new businesses that could operate entirely online, and strengthen existing brick and mortar businesses allowing anyone to buy and sell goods and services from anywhere, instantly. What we ended up with was still important, but the web 1.0 world was not quite as grand as I think some of us had envisioned. E-Bay, Amazon and Paypal definitely went further than many e-commerce platforms and service providers, and I firmly believe their embrace of web APIs was the reason for this. While e-commerce has undeniably grown and evolved, other new concepts like social and cloud computing took center stage in creating an entirely new vision of the Internet, concepts we didn&rsquo;t even conceive in the early days of the World Wide Web. Years later, driven by APIs, I think we are just now beginning to deliver on the early visions of commerce on the Internet. E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath are delivering on this vision by offering up a mature and robust e-commerce engine completely accessible by a truly RESTful API. Using ElasticPath you can define and execute against any vision of commerce whether it involves physical or virtual goods, with any type of pricing, offers or subscriptions that enable purchasing of these products on truly any platform or any device, in a myriad of ways only limited by your imagination. ElasticPath delivers by starting with a hardened and complete e-commerce engine that drives clients like Google and Sony, and proven by driving extreme online and offline commerce scenarios like the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Next ElasticPath bundles a robust Level 3 REST API with the their e-commerce engine, providing not just programmatic access...[<a href="/2012/05/03/apis-help-deliver-on-early-visions-of-the-internet/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The best thing about owning API Evangelist is I get to write about whatever I want.  I have full editorial control, and because of my unique view on the API space I tend to write about APIs from three separate perspectives:

API Owner
API Service Provider
Developer

These are the three main actors in the API game.  There are others, but these are the three viewpoints I write about the most.  I tend to rail on API owners a lot, and today I think I will rail on API developers.
Currently I&rsquo;m doing a lot of reaching out to my developers.  I personally email everyone who registers for CityGrid APIs.  Sure I use template emails, but I customize them and send the email one by one so I can profile my API developers and understand what they are doing.
So far, my findings are that many developers don&rsquo;t have any sort of verifiable online persona, and even more don&rsquo;t bother responding when I email or tweet at them.  Its not my business to police the CityGrid APIs, but I definitely apply a grade to every developer I look at, and make recommendations based upon this grade, where online persona and responsiveness are two big factors.
We hear a lot of developers (me included) complain about API owners not being responsive, but remember there is another side to the coin.  If you're using someone&rsquo;s API for FREE, and they take time out of their day to email you or tweet at you, it might be cool if you took 10 seconds to respond and say hello, and let them know you're an actual person.

			<p><em>23 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
At most hackathons, the end goal is building a web or mobile application, using various platforms and APIs.  Even though I&rsquo;ve seen this evolve to data visualization, or mashing up SaaS platforms at some events, the app really tends to be the primary deliverable at hackathons.
So this week I&rsquo;m spending time thinking of unique and interesting ways to present my sponsors for the CityGrid Hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica at CoLoft.  One of our sponsors is 3Scale, one of my favorite API service providers, and while we see many of the API service providers including Apigee and Mashery involved in many of the hackathons you really don't see anything built using their platform. (I know they&rsquo;ll ping me and say they do, but really your building using their clients.)
So for the CityGrid Los Angeles hackathon, I want to encourage developers to come up with ideas for APIs, develop the API and using 3Scale, deploy the building block that are essential that enable other developers to build on top of the API.
Not only do we need more, high value APIs, we need developers to be fluent in not just developing and deploying mobile and web apps, developers need to be fluent in designing, developing, deploying and managing APIs.
So if you have a great API idea and are in the Los Angeles area this weekend, come down to the CoLoft in Santa Monica and form a team and build your API, and deploy it using 3Scale, and you just might have a chance at winning $5,000.00 for your API.

			<p><em>20 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>One of my self-appointed roles in the API industry is to shed light on, and discuss the business of APIs when many other API owners and evangelists tend to keep their strategy and business closer to their chest. Many API owners don&rsquo;t discuss their roadmaps, either because they feel they will be giving away their secret sauce, or quite possibly because they don&rsquo;t have a clue where they are going with it. I think it&rsquo;s more the latter, as we are all making this shit up as we go along. One subject you don&rsquo;t hear API owners discuss often, is when their API will be deprecated or shuttered, leaving developers and tech bloggers to speculate on the subject. Because of this you tend to hear just the extreme views on the subject. Popular perspectives on API life-span tends to be: APIs Are Forever - Once you put an API, you have to support it forever APIs Can Go Away Anytime - There is no stability whatsoever when it comes to APIs I&rsquo;ve written on this subject several times including What Happens to Instagram API Developers After Facebook Acquisition and Building Your Business Around Google or Any Other APIs. Even with my stance on the subject I fall prey to the hype sometimes. I saw the post from Google today called Changes to deprecation policies and API spring cleaning, and I immediately thought oh no, here we go again. After reading deeper I realized they are updating their API deprecation policy for many popular APIs. As they state: The new policy simply states that we will strive to provide one year notice before making breaking changes. Google is setting a clear window, for which they will make sure and give developers a heads up before deprecating an API.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>One of the essential ingredients of a successful API, is a self-service area to support your API developers. In my opinion this is a no-brainer. You have to have registration, documentation, code samples, forum and other essential API building blocks available to developers in a self-service way--so they can engage with your API 24/7 without asking for access. I&rsquo;ve worked hard to make sure the CityGrid API area has a logical navigation, taking developers to the essential information they will need to learn about and integrate with the APIs: Getting Started&nbsp; Publisher Overview&nbsp; Ads by CityGrid Documentation&nbsp; Content by CityGrid Documentation&nbsp; Code Samples&nbsp; SDKs&nbsp; Usage Requirements&nbsp; Terms and Conditions&nbsp; Version History&nbsp; FAQ&nbsp; Blogs&nbsp; Forum&nbsp; Dashboard With those 13 links you can get to everything you need to know about the CityGrid Places, Offers, Reviews and Mobile, Web and Custom Advertising APIs. I keep a regular flow of information going through the blog to make sure there is excellent SEO content, so developers can search for anything at Google, and the blog will support linking to whats relevant in the CityGrid Developer Center. Even with all of this, I still get some pretty basic questions like: I need PHP code samples? - Immediately available on the code samples page. What does the API cost? - Says that it is FREE on Getting Started and FAQ. Can I save your data in my database? - Says it on the Usage Requirements Do I have to show your logo? - Says it on the Usage Requirements That is just the tip of the iceberg. I&rsquo;ve posed this question before...are there enough doers in the world to make this whole API vision work? It&rsquo;s hard to tell if its just my view, while in the pit of despair, or if it is just the way it is. It seems like there will always be some users who need hand holding, and they refuse to read the self-service material available...[<a href="/2012/04/17/will-a-selfservice-api-area-ever-be-enough/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
For the last couple weeks I&rsquo;m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the CityGrid APIs.  I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.
To find this out I start out profiling them socially using Rapportive&nbsp;(which I plan on automating using the&nbsp;Full Contact API as soon as I have more time) for the following information:

Twitter Profile
LinkedIn Account
Facebook Profile
Google + Profile
Github Profile

Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don&rsquo;t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me. I visit each developer&rsquo;s site and look for:

Blog w/ RSS Feed
Business Contact Email 
Business Contact Form

Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do.  I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.
Before I&rsquo;m done looking around their site I take a picture of their home page, so I have a visual reference to go with the developer profile. The home page image can go further than just a logo sometimes.

I take all of this information, put it into a database, and connected it to a JQuery Carousel that allows me to watch a slideshow that walks me through the world of my developers, and watch like a TV channel.
This process not only gives me a 100K understanding my developer ecosystem, but helps me remember as much as I can about each developer.  From this I hope to better engage them on a daily basis as well as provide feedback to the CityGrid API roadmap based upon quality API developer segmentation.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m currently planning a 9 city hackathon tour, starting with the CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon, and following up with Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Austin.
The CityGrid Hackathon tour is meant to bring together commercial and civic hackers to build the next generation of apps we use in our everyday "local" lives.
I&rsquo;m trying to find a blend of developers, business, marketing and advertising folks that will come together and develop commercially viable ideas that can also make our cities better places to live.
So I'm looking for sponsors that really enhance the local theme of the event, so I started with:

Local API Stack - These are APIs that I track on for CityGrid, providing direct value to local mobile and web app developers.
Mobile Back-end as a Service - Service providers that exclusively provide back-end platforms and tools for mobile developers.

I&rsquo;d be happy if all of these companies could provide the sponsorships that I need to support the event, but it probably won&rsquo;t be enough.  So I&rsquo;m looking elsewhere with some of the usual suspects like Amazon Web Services, Rackspace and Twilio.
Regardless of what my sponsor line-up looks like I think I will still provide a directory of local APIs for developers to use, so that they have a robust listing of high quality APIs to choose from when building their local web and mobile apps.

			<p>When I was a tech blogger for ReadWriteWeb and API-related news broke, we writers would often shudder. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t use API in the headline,&rdquo; the argument in the newsroom went. It&rsquo;s the page-view-kiss-of-death. That&rsquo;s not because APIs aren&rsquo;t super-important or super-ubiquitous on the Web (they are both). It&rsquo;s because most &ldquo;normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know what they are or why they matter. They&rsquo;d rather click on a story that says &ldquo;101 Ways to Use Pinterest to Plan Your Wedding.&rdquo; The decision to cover APIs regularly on ReadWriteWeb and eschew stories that fall into the &ldquo;[Number] Ways to Use [Hot New Social Media Tool] to [Conduct a Seasonally-Relevant Activity]&rdquo; goes a long way to explain the popularity of RWW versus that of Mashable, incidentally. Also incidentally: Pinterest has an API. This all presents a bit of a challenge, of course, if I want to make an argument for my readers here about why APIs really matter in education. Do I frame the argument for &ldquo;normals&rdquo;? (Wait! HA! &ldquo;Normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t read Hack Education!) Do I frame it for educators? Entrepreneurs? Technologists? The answer: hopefully all of the above. What is an API? API stands for &ldquo;Application Programming Interface.&rdquo; At its most basic level, an API allows one app to talk to another app. It&rsquo;s the way in which Web and mobile technologies can open up their data and their software&rsquo;s functionality to others. It&rsquo;s how Zynga integrates its games with your Facebook profile. It&rsquo;s how websites handle accepting payments via Paypal and play YouTube videos. It&rsquo;s how Instagram can share your photos to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr. Rather than having to export a file from one system, then import it into another, APIs allow programs to &ldquo;make calls,&rdquo; sending and receiving just the information they need just when they need it. Web APIs (also known as REST APIs) do this &ndash; well obviously &ndash; via the Web using the protocols of the Web (HTTP). But instead of...[<a href="/2012/04/13/why-every-education-company-needs-an-api-amp-why-educators-should-care-when-one-doesn039t/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I was going to write this story when I got an email from Qwerly after they got acquired by Fliptop, then after SimpleGeo was acquired by Urban Airship, then when I got the email from LinkedIn announcing they were shutting down IndexTank.  Four acquisitions later, I&rsquo;m finally making time today after the announcement of Facebook acquiring Instagram.
So, what will happen to Instagram API developers, now that Instagram is owned by Facebook?  We don&rsquo;t know.  It sounds like Facebook will keep Instagram in tact, but who knows where it will go from here, where founder Kevin Systrom will take it, or Facebook will step in and make changes.
If your like Postagram, you&rsquo;ve already diversified beyond the Instagram API and acknowledged that you need to offer more than what you can build off a single API provider.  We&rsquo;ve hear the cry of many developers when Twitter poaches from its ecosystem, Google decided to shutter Google Translate, then quickly decided to offer paid version--it doesn&rsquo;t matter who your API provider is, nobody is immune from acquisition or their API service being shuttered.
I wanted to ask the question about Instagram API developers before the API haters, jump in and blame the API.  Its not about the API, its about the API owners acknowledging their API ecosystem exists, and its developers, and whether or not they have a solid business strategy that includes having multiple suppliers for their content and products.
Hopefully you are a developer that understands the APIs you use to power your web or mobile application are potential vendors that could stay around for the next 10 years, or they could go away tomorrow with the next billion dollar acquisition--and with the right business strategy, maybe you could walk away with $400 Million, with your 40% equity, when your killer app is acquired.

			<p><em>31 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
While assembling the building blocks for a successful API ecosystem, one of the requests I get from developers is for tools to help them build successful integrations with existing platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, Facebook and Salesforce.
Some of the requests I get are from non-developers who just want a plug and play tool, they can deploy without needing to write code--but many of the requests are for white label, starter kits that developers can use to quickly deploy API driven applications on popular platforms like:

Wordpress
Drupal
Facebook
Salesforce
Joomla

I&rsquo;m not an expert in any of these platforms, but I find the more I dive into developing on these platforms, the more I learn and the more I discover other experts who really understand the ins and outs of building plugins and add-ons for 3rd party systems. &nbsp;
In addition to building code samples, code libraries and generic start kits for your API, you may want to take a look at building white label, 3rd party platform plugins and add-ons your developers can use to quickly integrate your API into existing networks. &nbsp;
At the very least, you will learn a lot.

			<p><em>30 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>I read a post over at Cloud Ave today by Martijn Linssen, Why API&rsquo;s suck, and what they lack. &nbsp;I'll start by saying, everything he says about APIs, can be true for some APIs, but the post has more to do with the state of tech blogging, than anything to do with APIs. To Linssen's points: First of all, API&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t open - True many APIs use this term, without it being true. But those of in the industry who get it, call these "public" APIs and have stopped using the term "open". Open has been used by a few bad marketing seeds, and perpetuated by the blogosphere. Second of all, API&rsquo;s are for free, mostly, and no uptime is guaranteed - What? Really? Maybe the 10 you've tried don't, but many of the APIs I depend on do. Just to name a few:&nbsp;Google Maps,&nbsp;WebServius,&nbsp;Datasift,&nbsp;Zencoder,&nbsp;Amazon EC2, Amazon S3. Third, API&rsquo;s are badly documented, if any - Sure this can be a problem, and is something everyone is working on. This doesn't point to APIs sucking, more the documentation. &nbsp;Can you point me to the documentation you&rsquo;ve maintained? Its&rsquo; not as easy as it looks. And there are plenty of shining examples of how do you do it right. Ok those are your points? And you went to ProgrammableWeb and looked at 10 APIs? And you came to the conclusion all APIs suck? I've spent hundreds of hours looking through ALL of the APIs in the ProgrammableWeb directory, and yes there is a lot of shit in there. But there are some really amazing examples of the API vision, that you seem to be bothered by.&nbsp; Have you hacked on Twilio? Twilio rocks! Have you used Stripe?

			<p><em>28 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The largest portion of my time as API Evangelist is spent keeping the area around an API active.  Your developer&rsquo;s first impression when they enter your API area is critical, and if they see signs that your API is inactive, they might start looking elsewhere.
The most common ways I keep an API active is by:

Blogging
Tweeting w/ Twitter Feature in API Area
Forum Posts
How-Tos
Starter Projects
Developer Showcase

By actively posting content in these areas w/ timestamps showing when they were posted, I keep the API area looking like someone is home.
This active content doesn&rsquo;t just help developers visiting the site feel like the API is active, it also helps your SEO. Search engines and social networks will regularly index your content, providing fresh traffic, and potentially new developers to your API.
Just a couple hours a day, generating fresh content and engaging with your developers goes a long ways in attracting new developers and making them feel confident that your API is a priority, and they should integrate it into their applications.

			<p><em>26 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
With all the attention sexism in silicon valley has gotten, I wanted to make sure and showcase some positive news on the Hackathon front this week.
There was a great article in the Oregonian out of Portland called, "Intel 'Code for Good' hackathon helps nonprofits solve technology challenges".
The theme for the hackathon: Girls in education
Code for Good co-organizer Josh Bancroft worked with co-organizer Renee Kuriyan and employees in Intel's corporate affairs group to help four nonprofit organizations, World Pulse, a Portland-based nonprofit; Room to Read; 10X10: Educate Girls Change the World; and Global Campaign for Education.
"I felt like we could amplify the impact" by software and corporate working together, Bancroft said. The partnerships were already established by corporate affairs, and the software group simply brought the technical expertise.
Their task was to create software solutions to real-world problems facing girls in education, and for each team to develop an app by the end of the day that the nonprofits could then put to use. The hackathon theme is part of Intel's "She Will" campaign and with the company's overarching mission to "create and extend computing technology to connect and enrich the lives of every person on Earth."
You can read more about the great hackathon over at Oregon Live.&nbsp;I just wanted to point out that not all hackathons are male dominated, and the model can go much further than some of what we see coming out of Silicon Valley.

Every Monday I generate a list of all new API developer who registered for the&nbsp;CityGrid&nbsp;API&nbsp;the week before.  This list has the name and email address for each developer, and I manually go down the list, and email them individually, letting them know I&rsquo;m here to help.
As I email each new API developer I use Rapportive to identify more information about them, such as their website URL, Twitter and LinkedIn profile.  If a developer has a Twitter or LinkedIn profile, I engage them on those networks.
After 3 months of doing this, I&rsquo;ve noticed that developers who work for larger companies have LinkedIn profiles and developers who either are freelance, own or work with a smaller development shop tend to have Twitter.

It makes sense.  Twitter is a more public forum, and smaller companies tend to need to market their skills and services and actively engage the world around them.  While established companies tend to keep their developers in a more closed environment, suitable for the business social network LinkedIn.
This type of information helps me segment my API developer audience into various groups allowing me to craft blog posts, announcements and share other information with them on appropriate channels.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of emailing, so being able to push out information regularly on LinkedIn and Twitter, and engage with users that are active on these networks, works very well for supporting my approach to API developer support.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying to track on what gets created at hackathons. &nbsp;Some innovative programming occurs at these events and I&rsquo;d say 98% of it is forgotten by Monday morning.
I think a lot of attention is given to the myth that hackathons are about building startups.  When in reality, how many startups come out of hackathons?  In my opinion the top three things that come out of a hackathon are:

Marketing - For the event organizer, sponsors and for participants. 
Talent Acquisition - There is some seriously talented folks attending hackathons. 
Networking - Hackathons are a great place to meet people, network, make friends and sure maybe a co-founder. 


Beyond that I think there is a lot of code that gets generated at hackathons, that really never goes anywhere.  Much of this code is not immediately VC fundable, but still some of it is really good.  And I see a lot of kids spending whole weekends writing the same or similar code as I saw the weekend before.
To help remedy this, I suggest that event organizers use&nbsp;Github.  Just like every hackathon organizer should identify a Twitter #hashtag for the event, you should setup a Github organization and add your hackers as users.  Encourage them to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the weekend with a nice README file of their project.
Seems like a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.

From what I can tell, Sqoot was called out by @BoazSender:

Then the pressure quickly was put on in the Twittershpere:

Resulting in Apigee pulling their sponsorship:

And Heroku pulling theirs as well:

Sqoot quickly released an "apology" which included:
"While we thought this was a fun, harmless comment poking fun at the fact that hack-a-thons are typically male-dominated, others were offended."
Their "apology" definitely summarizes the misogynistic tone of the spreading Silicon Valley startup and hackathon culture.
This is a major problem.  One of my biggest complaints about many hackathons is that they are male dominated, and this is nothing to joke about, make fun of or take lightly.  You don&rsquo;t realize it when all you do is attend the all boy hackathons and do your bro-gramming.
I&rsquo;ve been to hackathons where there are equal sexes, and they are awesome-- way more fun, and truly work to solve real life problems, not perceived problems.
I hope other blogs will publicize this, and make other hackathon organizers aware so this kind of shit doesn&rsquo;t not only go away, but we start working the other direction and making sure EVERYONE feels welcome at hackathons.

			<p><em>20 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>As a building block, a blog is a very valuable tool for building awareness of your API, keeping your developers informed and give a personality to the team beyond an API.
My recommendation to API owners is to always have a blog, however one the most damaging things you can do is stop posting to your blog.  A blog is a key variable in my API Stack algorithm, of whether or not an API is worth integrating with, and if you haven&rsquo;t updated your blog anytime in the last year, I immediately step away.
If you want people to find your API, have a blog.  If you want your existing developers to be educated about what can be done with your API, have blog.  If you want developers who find your API, to feel confident enough to integrate it into their app, keep you blog updated!

			<p><em>15 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m going through hundreds of APIs and curating a list of APIs, for what I&rsquo;m calling the API Stack. &nbsp;The API Stack consists of APIs that provide clear value for developers and have demonstrated real investment in their API, and are in it for long haul. There are quite a few things I consider when looking at an API, here are a few: Value - The API offers clear value to developers, without needing an explanation. Web API - They don&rsquo;t have to be 100% REST, but web APIs make developers lives easier. Active Blog w/ RSS - A blog is a quick way to see what is behind the curtain of an API. If they care enough to have a blog, and communicate with developers, and keep it active it demonstrates they care. With an RSS feed I can programmatically understand whether they are active or not. Active Forum w/ RSS - A forum gives developers a voice and also shows an API owner cares what developers thinks, and is willing to support a large community. An active forum is a positive sign of an API, and the RSS feed also gives me a programmatic way to assess. Twitter - An active Twitter presence is a pretty key metric in understanding the value of an API. If the company has the resources to actively engage developers via Twitter, they care. And again I can programmatically monitor and see if someone exists behind the API. There are other metrics I use, but these are proving to be the most positive characteristics of an API that developers can depend on. Many APIs I come across don&rsquo;t even meet these basic requirements. What triggered this post, was I had just looked at about 10 APIs that did not meet these basic requirements, and then I came across one that clearly met all of these, and more--GeoIQ. GeoIQ has a mapping API that provides clear value to developers,...[<a href="/2012/03/15/qualifying-for-the-api-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Social Data Analyzing API Knodes has just announced a $250K startup fund that will invest in the best products, websites and applications built on top of the Knodes API platform.
Knodes Social Data Analyzing API provides developers with social data-based insights about their users across social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and LinkedIn.
With the launch of the Fund, the Knodes team is hoping to bring awareness to their API and jumpstart a new ecosystem of developers, businesses and campaigns whose next generation social applications will be powered by its API.
The Knodes Fund which is in partnership with Quotidian Ventures, will take the best websites, web and mobile applications and give them the resources they need to be successful, including up to $25,000 in equity funding, mentorship and access to new features and social intelligence available via the Social Data Analyzing API.
The Knodes Fund is open to all individuals and companies building an application, website or program using the Knodes API.  Applications can be submitted at Knod.es beginning May 1, 2012, and the deadline to apply for the Knodes Fund is June 1, 2012.

The Knodes Fund represents a growing convergence of the innovation occuring within both API ecosystems and a growing number of startup incubators.  APIs provide a fertile environment to entice talented developers with fresh ideas to build new applications without commitment, while also being able to invest in successful ideas that prove themselves, bringing to life the original business development 2.0 promise of the API ecosystem.

			<p><em>14 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Andreas Krohn&nbsp;(@andreaskrohn)&nbsp;first saw the potential of APIs when he in 2005 started working with enterprise web scraping solutions at Kapow Technologies (now Kapow Software). Conceptualizing the web as one big database and creating APIs to get to that data is not that different from the REST APIs used today. When leaving Kapow to start his own company it was a given that the focus would be on APIs and open data.
Andreas API work is focused in Sweden where he regularly speaks at conferences. Mostly he focuses on the non-technical side of APIs since APIs are doomed to fail without a good business strategy and long term marketing plan. The ones that really need to understand the potential of APIs are the business people and then focusing on the money instead of technology is the way forward. He is also providing consulting services customers regarding API strategies and technologiesone such project he has been active in is Trafiklab which is a portal for Swedish public transport APIs. The goal of the project is to collect Swedish travel related APIs in one place with consistent documentation, API-key handling and support to make them as attractive to developers as possible.
He writes about APIs on Swedens leading API blog Mashup.se and has done so for several years. The focus of Mashup.se is international API news as well as highlighting local Swedish APIs. To increase the use of Swedish APIs he has recently launched the Swedish API directory listing over 200 Swedish APIs. Not much compared to the 5000+ APIs listed on ProgrammableWeb, but a lot for a small country where the wave of APIs are just getting started. The development of APIs in Sweden is currently lead by government agencies and agencies due to European Union directives but Andreas hopes that showing the available private APIs will lead to a wider use of APIs and more private companies developing APIs.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE This post comes from the SDK Bridge newsletter.  I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you. People are constantly trying to come up with tools to make API documentation an easier task. If you are documenting an SDK built for C++, C#, or Java, there are tools such as Doxygen, Sandcastle, and JavaDocs to take comments from the code and automatically generate documentation from them. Why aren't there tools like this for REST APIs? The beauty of Web APIs is that they can be written in whatever language you like and in whatever manner you like. As long as when an HTTP request comes in, the proper HTTP response goes out, it doesn't matter how it actually happens on the server. But this very flexibility makes automated documentation nearly impossible, since there's no standard mapping between what an API request is and what the code is that generates its response. Nonetheless, there are some solutions out there to this problem. I need to start by saying that there are in fact two approaches to automation that are used to document REST APIs. One is similar to the tools I mentioned above, where comments are taken from code to generate the documentation. The other involves having the documentation separate from the code, but in a data format (such as JSON) that can be parsed and used to generate the documentation. I also should mention that documentation automation does not guarantee good documentation. Before choosing to to incorporate automation into your process, I recommend reading an excellent article by Dana Fujikawa: What to Consider Before Considering Auto-Generated Documentation. Automated Documentation from Code There's no off-the-shelf tool that pulls documentation comments out of code that's going to work for all REST APIs. But there are two possible solutions: Use...[<a href="/2012/03/08/automated-documentation-for-rest-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m always looking for new, relevant ideas to write blog posts on for the CityGrid Developer blog.  I have several topics I write about regularly including new projects I&rsquo;m working on, new releases around the API, and what I find during my local, mobile and social landscape analysis.
However it can be hard to find topics to write about that are relevant to CityGrid developers, or publishers as we call them.  To help write blog posts that are useful to my API community I started harvesting ideas and topics from actual forum posts from developers.
Earlier today a publisher submitted a forum post stating their concerns about the age of some of the reviews they get along with businesses, when making requests against the CityGrid Places API.  It was an easy question to answer, since CityGrid also provides a business reviews API, that will give you more control how you can pull reviews for a zip code, neighborhood or specific business.
Using the topic that was posted on the forum I was easily able to create a quick blog post framing the question and providing a detailed answer explaining how the CityGrid Reviews API provides a solution.
Now CityGrid publishers can potentially be exposed to this solution via the blog, RSS feed and since I actively syndicate my blog posts, they will see it if they follow CityGrid on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and also using a search engine.
When evangelizing for an API, I feel it is important to try and provide as helpful content as you can via an active blog presence, while also reverberating it across the multitude of channels your developers might be listening on--turning relevant forum posts into stories is a great way to do this.

     I am going through the Foursquare API, and found their section about how to get an increase in the number of calls you can make against the Foursquare API interesting:


     If your application runs into any of our rate limits and you think you could use more, write us at [email&#160;protected] We'llneed your OAuth consumer id, an explanation about why you need an increased cap, and information about the following 


     
          Usage: A description of the endpoints you're calling and how you're using the data retrieved. We use this to make sure you're abiding by our Platform Policies and Terms of Service. Sample requests are generally helpful.
     
     
          Attribution: Screenshots of your application so we can confirm you're attributing foursquare correctly.
     
     
          Caching: Cache venue details where appropriate to avoid making spurious requests to our servers. See theRetention section of our Platform Policies for more details.
     


     I like the idea of rewarding developers with the ability to make more calls against your API, when they adhere to your terms of service and benefit your operations.

			<p>API Evangelist has grown beyond being just a research blog. It is time for me to update the about us page, and its time for me to tell the story of what is "API Evangelist", and how I view my role in the API industry. API Evangelist started in July 2010. I was burning out in my job as VP of Technology for an events management company that managed events for SAP and Google. I was looking for a way to re-invent myself, doing something that I enjoyed, but also keep me employed for the next 5 years or more. I was looking for something that I was knowledeable about, would be around for a few years. I quickly identified web APIs as this focus. Web APIs had been a big part of my career since the early 2000’s. I’ve designed and consumed a lot of APIs, and they were the glue in a platform I built for my web development company Original Web Solutions, which I ran from 2000 through 2008.  But I also saw web APIs as vital, but quiet player in the growth of the Internet: Social - Web APIs grew up along with social platforms like Flickr, Delicous, Twitter and Facebook. Cloud - Web APIs came of age, with proving they could deploy IT infrastructure via Amazon Web Services, and are the power driving Paas and Saas. Mobile - Web APIs are becoming ubiquitous with the growth of iOS, Android, Blackbery and Windows mobile phone usage. This locked it in for me. APIs were not only growing, they were going to be around for a while. So I started API Evangelist, and began researching the space, looking for a way that I could make not only a career, I could also make an impact. I set out, researching the space. I evaluated over 200 of the top web APIs, and wanted to understand their approach, why they were successful (or not), and who were...[<a href="/2012/02/26/what-is-api-evangelist/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>When new users sign up for the CityGrid API, I immediately get an email with their name, email and phone number, which are required for registration. The API is self-service, and I rely on the essential building blocks I&rsquo;ve assembled as part of the API area to support them in their first hours and days of integration. Five days after registration, if a publishers has not reached out to the CityGrid API team, or show any usage on the API, I reach out to them via email, asking if there is ANYTHING I can do to make their integration successful. I do not send an email blast, I email them one by one, and as I do this, I use Rapportive in my Gmail to identify if they have a Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn account. I then send a personal email, and follow them on their social networks and research their business web site, if they have one. I&rsquo;d say about 65% of my API users that are responsive, reply and tell me they are planning on integrating and just need more time or are waiting for the development resources to free up and then they&rsquo;ll tackle integration. These are perfect candidates for social media, and because they are responsive they tend to follow me back on Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. Since I keep my social networks active on a daily basis, hopefully they&rsquo;ll see regular, informative posts from me, demonstrating not only is there a person behind the curtain at the CityGrid API, that I am actually investing in their success. New registrations are only one of my API success metrics. My ultimate goal is to have them actively consuming the Places, Reviews and Offers API and making money using CityGrid Mobile and Web Advertising and Places that Pay. &nbsp;To&nbsp;convert users from new to active users, I have to stay engaged with them, and I couldn&rsquo;t do this without the use of social media....[<a href="/2012/02/26/role-of-social-media-in-managing-an-api-ecosystem/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I'm a member of a Google group called API Craft.  There are some really smart API folks talking about everything from API deployment to API business strategies there. &nbsp;
The other day someone in the groups asked:
How does someone measure success in developing and deploying a public&ndash;facing Web API?
Scott Regan (@scottregan) of Apigee gave a great response, and I wanted to share with everyone here.  Scott&rsquo;s suggestions for measurements were:

Revenue - For public APIs, could be affiliate program revenue, ad revenue, or if incremental traffic from apps to the website has a known monetization rate
Reach -  Incremental new user accounts or unique users
Partnerships - Number of new partnerships established around your API
Apps - The number of new apps developed using your API
Traffic - Apply percentage of incremental traffic ("our API channel is now X% of total internet traffic")
Brand - Measuring increased 'brand', but only if the company has an really established way to do this

Scott goes on to say:
When it comes to business metric tracking one thing i've seen work well is when the  API team publishes a 'dashboard'  widely and regularly -   tracking actual results to estimates  -   because it helps PM focus the roadmap on what moves the business needle as agreed and avoid getting the team pulled in different directions.
Each API could potentially have different success factors depending on the type of API or the goals of a company.  But revenue, reach, partnerships, apps, traffic and increased brand awareness are good places to start. &nbsp;Thanks Scott.

			<p><em>15 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I first wrote about interactive API documentation with Posterous&rsquo;s new API area in June 2011, then the follow-up when&nbsp;Mashery deployed their own version called I/O Docs in July 2011.
Smart, interactive or I/O API documentation is an evolution of API documentation from static and often boring documentation, to more interactive and real-time experience, allowing you to make live calls against an API while also browsing the documentation that explains how it operates.
Peter Gruenbaum of SDK Bridge has surveyed and done exhaustive research on what developers say about API documentation and web API documentation best practices, proving that up to date, and complete documentation can be very successful in helping developers get up and running using an API.
The API Service Provider, 3Scale has stepped up with their own interactive API documentation for users of their platform using Swagger, an open-source framework that lets developers learn, play, test and debug each element of an API in real-time.
There are 3 main benefits for API owners coming from adopting Swagger:

Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation
Generation of client code and SDK in Scala, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Actionscript 3
Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use

While many companies are providing API explorers for their developers to make live calls against their APIs, I think interactive documentation holds more value in educating developers about APIs, while also allowing them to make real-time calls.  My feeling is that this makes some tough concepts stickier while trying to understand and integrate with an API.
Visit the 3Scale site for more information on using their API management platform for deploying interactive documentation, using Swagger, for your APIs.
Disclosure: &nbsp;I have consulted with 3Scale on industry strategy several times.

			<p>Much of the work I get as an API Evangelist starts with a review of an API area. I have evolved a way to look at API areas, and identify which building blocks are present or missing, all contributing to the success or failure of an API. I started evolved this methodology in summer of 2012 when I was first building API Evangelist, by reviewing over 250+ of the top APIs out there. I generated a list of the common building blocks used by APIs, as well as identified a bunch of innovative and less commonly used building blocks. When I first started working with CityGrid I reviewed their API area, which contained the following building blocks: API Dashboard Documentation for Content and Advertising APIs SDKs for iOS and Android Version History Blog Forum(s) Terms and Conditions Usage Requirements Self-Service Registration I have a list of what I consider essential API area building blocks, and most of them are represented here, but there were a couple missing. So today I added 3 more areas: Getting Started Publisher Overview FAQ An API has to have a getting started page as well as a place for frequently asked questions. Developers have to find the information they need to go from evaluation to integration without asking for help. The publisher overview page is unique. It covers the different business tiers of developers, or as we call them at CityGrid, publishers. Even though these tiers are unique to how we approach things at CityGrid, they are four potential levels of an API ecosystem, that other API owners can employ. The CityGrid API area is not up to par 100% by the standards I preach here on API Evangelist. I&rsquo;m working on a new code samples page which has PHP, Python, Ruby code samples and starter kits--which I will publish this week at some point. But overall the CityGrid API community contains the essential building blocks I feel are necessary...[<a href="/2012/02/13/citygrid-places-reviews-offers-and-advertising-api-review/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I am an eternal optimist, especially when it comes to APIs.  I really feel that APIs can decouple businesses assets and resources, making these companies much more efficient.
We&rsquo;ve seen the power of the API when it comes to companies like Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and many others.  But to build something on top of an API, you have to be a do-er.
A do-er is a term invented by Jeff Lawson (@jeffiel) of Twilio:
Do-er (n): A particularly driven individual, esp. a developer, who picks up their tools and builds something special.
Do-ers are a fundamental ingredient in API ecosystems, and when I go to many conferences and walk by booths I see a fundamentally different process of holding peoples hands and showing them what they need to know.  I also see many companies relying on this process to even make money.
So I have to ask--are we creating enough do-ers? &nbsp;
I am very optimistic about the future of API growth, but I do worry sometimes about there being enough doers to make APIs continue to grow.  Many individuals are so used to the regular sales cycle and corporate training, they don&rsquo;t seem equipped to find solutions to their problems on their own.
Are you a do-er? &nbsp;Do you think there are enough do-ers out there?

			<p><em>07 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>I was reading several stories yesterday about the State of California cutting funding for libraries across the state. These kind of budget cuts really make me worry for the future of our children and our communities. I say it is time that we all come together and figure out a way to re-invent our libraries, and one possible way forward is to remake our local libraries as hacker space. Here are a few ideas I had today about this: Dedicated Hacker Spaces - Each community could have a space to have hackathons that could be used for locally driven events as well as a place for out of town organizers to throw events. Hackathon Model - Libraries could adopt a hackathon model for throwing small or large events in any area, allowing kids and adults to organize and participate in hackathons in any topic area. Sponsorship - Bring in sponsors much like we do for hackathons, allowing tech and other companies to invest in single or ongoing hackathon efforts at libraries in the markets and subject areas that matter to them most. Revenue Opportunities - These sponsorship opportunities would allow libraries to create new ways to fund their operations based upon the corporate sponsors that reflect the type of space libraries want to create. Mentorship - Allow anyone to become a hacker mentor in any subject, allowing them to share expertise and knowledge with others in their community. Resources - Libraries could provide access to computers, Internet connectivity, data repositories, code repositories, APIs, software and other resources that are essential to hackers. Community Innovation - These new library hacker spaces could be centers for community innovation to occur, bringing in outside ideas, and circulating new ideas within existing community leaders. Incubation - Library hacker spaces could be centers of business incubation, providing a rich and fertile environment for ideas to take root and find the resources and talent they need to actually become businesses, creating...[<a href="/2012/02/07/lets-remake-libraries-as-hacker-spaces-and-community-innovation-centers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>I brought my 11 year old daughter Kaia, to the Trojan Hack at USC Friday night and Saturday, which was a new experience for her. I wouldn&rsquo;t say she is on a track to be a hacker like her dad, but she does have a Chromebook, iPhone and is pretty technologically literate. She has asked me a couple times about teaching her how to build a game, or some sort of fashion web site. She has her own Wordpress blog and even went and setup her own Wordpress.com account to blog about Harry Potter without my help. I asked her if she found any of the projects that were being built at the hackathon interesting--she said no, except the Wolves with Friends video game. Then she said, &ldquo;maybe if there were more girl hackers, the projects would be more interesting&rdquo;. Kaia is at a very important age, where I think she can be influenced or turned off in many different ways, and within a variety of subjects. I don&rsquo;t want to push my hacker ways on her, but I want to influence her as much as I possibly can--and leave the decisions up to her. When I go to hackathons with Audrey (@audreywatters) and my daughter I can&rsquo;t help but see it through their eyes--where not only the programming challenges are intimidating, but a room full of boys are a big turn off. Something that isn&rsquo;t apparent to me, when I go by myself as hacker white guy. One of things I&rsquo;ve noticed at various places I&rsquo;ve worked is that the tone of the workplace, the focus of projects, and the overall energy is different when there are more girls on teams. This is something that is very apparent working at CityGrid, not just the diversity of the workplace, but that there are many female managers and team leads, which sets a very positive tone for the company.

			<p><em>01 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>I've been having a lot of discussions with folks around the country about how to make money from data. There is a lot of data being pushed out there from federal, state and city governments, as well as from private companies and individuals--without much evidence of revenue. At this point there seems to be money in acquiring, processing, storing an deriving meaning out of the data, but not much money in actually selling access directly to the data. Through portals like opendata.socrata.com we are seeing more government agencies and cities publish their data, and after talking with the guys from Socrata last week, their focus is on helping more agencies get their data up, not metering or building business models around the data.  Socrata has some great tools, that let developers customize how they want to access the data, and use in their applications, but there really are no mechanisms that allow data owners to make money from their data. Granted this is public data, so it should be publicly available for anyone to access and use. However there are costs associated with acquiring, processing and making this data available for download and via APIs. I've had discussions with several data evangelist about how government could maximize their efforts around data in the virtual space and even charge for it under certain circumstances, allowing them to generate revenue to cover operational costs as well as fund more data projects. If you think about it the government does this with public domain in the physical space. Cities and National Parks are free and open spaces for anyone to use, but once you begin looking to use these spaces for commercial use, you are required to apply for permits, and often pay fees and revenue share for access to these spaces and facilities. Why shouldn't this same thinking be applied to the virtual public domain? Don't get me wrong.

     One of the biggest areas around APIs I think needs attention in 2012 is more tools that focus on developers. There are plenty API services and tools focusing on API owners, but we need to start making sure developers are taken care of.


     So its nice to see the Mashery’s new Developer Connect, which matches developers with companies looking for specific API development skills. Mashery partnered with Elance to develop the API skill matchmaking service, powered by Elance’s huge network of professional technical talent.


     There are plenty of developers out there who have polished their skills working with specific APIs, either on production, or hobby development projects, and would love to find freelance work, and make some money of their talent.


     On the flip-side, there are plenty of companies looking to build web and mobile applications that use one or many APIs, and would prefer to contract with developers who already have experience with those APIs.


     Its a win-win situation for developers, API owners and companies looking to build on top of APIs. I think it is also a sign that the API space is really maturing. With platforms like Mashery’s Developer Connect, powered by Elance, developers may now be able to make a good living specializing in API development.


     Its a great idea, I wish I had come up with it! Oh wait. I did!! In fall of 2010, and pitched it to Elance, after pitching the idea, I even built a Elance Developer Area prototype, and did a four part series on the potential.


     I actually don’t have a problem with this, I thoroughly enjoy my ideas getting used, rather than sitting on the back burner. What did piss me off, is when I was offered the exclusive by Elance after they actually built their version...they sent me a Techcrunch post, saying here is your exclusive.

			<p><em>31 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>I'm working on a framework for the City Grid API that helps define the different types of developers that are using our APIs, helping me understand how to better support them, and ensure their success. This particular approach is different than segmenting my developers by type of development, like web and mobile or by industry like real estate or medical. I'm focusing on the business side of the API, and identifying what developers need to be successful in the business of the applications they are building on the CityGrid API, and where I should focus CityGrid resources. I'm breaking down our API developers into four distinct levels: Open - Publicly available, self-service use of the API, with general forum and email support via developer area. Associate - Motivated app developers who demonstrate their understanding of an API, submit their app for internal approval and take advantage of revenue sharing opportunities around the API. Partner - Developers who already have successful businesses or have built businesses around the CityGrid APIs, and may have higher usage needs, and usually contribute some value back to the CityGrid business model and API ecosystem. Incubation - Developers who have grown their businesses in significant ways, but need mentoring and investment of additional resources to take their business to the next level. Anyone can register to use the API and become an open developer, integrating businesses, places and other related content like reviews, offers, images and videos in their web or mobile apps. The API is self-service, allowing anyone to participate.  I can speculate what these developers need, but its up to them to let me know how they are building on the API and what they need to go to the next level. To rise up to the next level of associate, you need to demonstrate you've integrated CityGrid APis into your app, using best practices, while adhering to the CityGrid Terms and Conditions and Usage Requirements.

			<p>I had the pleasure of getting an early copy of the APIs: A Strategy Guide, Creating Channels with Application Programming Interfaces, by Daniel Jacobson(@daniel_jacobson), Greg Brail(@gbrail), Dan Woods(@danwoodscito), published by O’Reilly Books. APIs: A Strategy Guide, provides the essential knowledge needed for planning, implementing and managing an API in this emerging API driven world. Written by Daniel Jacobsen who has managed two of the fastest growing and progressive APIs I know of--Netflix and NPR, and Greg Brail who is probably the one individual who has deployed the most number of APIs in the industry, and not leaving out Dan Woods who's is responsible for bringing this book together. The APIs: A Strategy Guide is sound advice for any executive, business, marketing or engineering person looking to deploy an API. But it doesn't stop there, as an experienced API product manager and evangelist it provides a framework to better look at much of what I already do, while also introducing some new concepts I hadn't considered. From a business perspective the book describes the API opportunity perfectly while providing the necessary business, product and value chain understanding to take on an API initiative within any company. As an author who's written a book on the Business of APis, Jacobsen, Brail and Woods take it even deeper and perfectly describe the business imperative for using APIs in your company. From a technical guide, you can't ask for a better approach than Jacobsen and Brail provide. API design is more art than science and they describe a balanced, but deeply technical approach for designing your API, wearing a very pragmatic hat, which is crucial in deploying a successful API. Beyond technical, the book provides the necessary legal considerations that come up when deploying an API, that could make or break your efforts. There is also concrete operational advice regarding how to approach the day to day operations of your API and ensure that you are able to measure and...[<a href="/2012/01/30/review-of-apis-a-strategy-guide-from-oreilly-books/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>This post comes from the&nbsp;SDK Bridge&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you. I recently received an email with the subject "FW: boring job". It was a long email chain that started with someone casting about for someone to write API documentation. It got me thinking about how most developers must wonder&nbsp;why on earth&nbsp;someone with the skills to program would choose to write API documentation instead. "Why" is a good question to ask yourself when starting up a new year. In fact, I recently saw a&nbsp;TED talk video by Simon Sinek&nbsp;on how the most effective people, companies, and organizations, start by thinking about&nbsp;why&nbsp;they do something instead of&nbsp;what. In the video, Sinek brings up examples like Apple, the Wright Brothers, and even Martin Luther King, whose most famous speech began with "I have a dream" (why) and not "I have a plan" (what). In this newsletter, I'll talk about why we write API documentation, from how it impacts the world to how it challenges us personally. But first, here's what SDK Bridge been up to since our last newsletter: Writing C++ documentation for software embedded into agricultural vehicles. Writing REST documentation for a company that creates software for governments. Writing REST documentation based on&nbsp;OpenSocial&nbsp;to be able to create and manage online meetings. Writing IT documentation for&nbsp;Microsoft HealthVault. - Peter Gruenbaum, President, SDK Bridge Why We Write API Documentation To most developers, writing API documentation is nothing short of torture. But to a few of us, it's a fascinating area. What gets us so excited? Enormous Impact In case you haven't heard, the biggest technology revolution is happening since the invention of HTML.

     When new developers register for the CityGrid API, I get an email with their name and email address. I want to make sure each developer knows I’m here, and available to help them get up and running as quick as possible.


     Emailing them as soon as they register seems a little too pushy, but following them on Twitter, with my personal Twitter and the CityGrid API Twitter account makes sense. So how do I get their Twitter handle, without spending too much time and derailing whatever I’m working on?


     In comes Rapportive. For those of you who don’t know what Rapportive is, it is an browser add-on that runs in my Gmail and shows me everything about a contact I’m emailing with. On the right hand side it lists as much information associated with the email as the service can find, such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.


     So when I get a new registration email from CityGrid APIs, I highlight the email address and it shows me information about the user. Many users don’t maintain active online profiles, so it returns nothing. However a handful, have Twitter accounts associated, which I immediately follow with my personal and CityGrid API Twitter accounts.


     Both of my Twitter profiles clearly reflect CityGrid APIs, so when I follow them on Twitter, my developers know who I am, and they should now be aware that I am here to help. If they have any questions, they know they know how to find me.

			<p><em>22 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>When I started with CityGrid as their API Evangelist, I wanted to make sure and share as much of my strategy with my audience here, in real-time. Of course I&rsquo;ve been so busy executing I have forgotten to tell the story about what I&rsquo;m doing. So let me take a few moments to kick off telling the story of what I&rsquo;m doing to build awareness of the CityGrid Places, Reviews, Offers and Advertising&nbsp;APIs. Let me paint a picture from the 100K foot view, then in other posts I&rsquo;ll go into more detail. Here are the areas I&rsquo;m focusing on: API - The CityGrid API already provides clear value and has a developer base, but there are always ways to improve. I will be providing feedback regularly, to the CityGrid API team on where we can improve on our APis. API Area - Spending time in December hacking on the CityGrid APIs, I experienced first hand what it takes to get started hacking using the content and advertising APIs. While it is still fresh in my mind, I&rsquo;m working on building a new getting started, publisher overview, FAQ and code samples and SDK page to help my publishers get up and running with their own development. Hyp3rL0cal - To wrap my head around the CityGrid APIs I needed a project, so I started Hyp3L0cal, a playground for building local applications using CityGrid and other local and social APIs. I will be publishing all my code there, for others to use in their projects. Presence - A healthy presence is important to the success of the CityGrid APIs. I am focusing on equal doses of an online and offline presence for CityGrid. The online presence consists of actively blogging, tweeting and coding on projects, while my offline presence includes a non-stop tour schedule of hackathons and conferences. Publishers - CityGrid calls its developers, &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. I am focusing on helping attract new publishers, and educating them about what...[<a href="/2012/01/22/api-evangelist-strategy-for-citygrid/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>I just wrapped up two separate Facebook Hackathons, one in&nbsp;New York&nbsp;and the other in&nbsp;Boston. &nbsp;Both events started with presentations from various Facebook team members, demonstrating different aspects of the Facebook platform.
After the Facebook workshops, there was a presentation by Jim Zimmerman&nbsp;of&nbsp;Thuzi, a preferred Facebook mobile development shop from Florida. &nbsp;During both his talks, he asked audience &nbsp;to raise their hand and show which platform they developed their mobile apps on.
The breakdown in New York, from my view was about:

25% iOS
25% Android
50% HTML5

While the breakdown in Boston, from my view was about:

&nbsp;10% iOS
10% Android
80% HTML5

In both cities HTML5 was the clear choice of developers. &nbsp;Even though Facebook still heavily focused on native app development during their workshops you can tell they were leaning heavily towards HTML5, by inviting PhoneGap to present, and giving away HTML5 t-shirts.
I don't think HTML5 has won the mobile battle by any stretch, but after seeing Adobes heavy focus on HTML5 at the&nbsp;Designing &amp; Developing for Mobile Workshop in San Francisco, and now the dominance of it by developers at both Facebook Mobile Hacks, I think the tide is turning.

			<p><em>21 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>
One of the areas of API development I'm focusing a lot of energy on in 2012 is around monetization.  I want to help define the playing field, of how API owners make money from their APIs, as well as how developers make money from their apps.
Both areas are extremely critical for the success of any API ecosystem.  If the API owner does not have a clear path to generate revenue, the API won't be sustainable, and eventually will go away.
On the other side of the coin, developers have to be able to make money from their apps in order to sustain their work, and build a viable business around an API.
As part of my work on understanding the developer side of things, I'm doing several posts asking developers how they make or plan to make money from their apps. Two obvious ways immediately come to mind:

App Sales - Download and service based fees around apps.
Advertising - Web and mobile ads in apps.

Advertising has long held the title when it comes to monetizing apps, and iTunes and iOS sparked the mobile app gold rush.  But what other ways are there?
How can developers make money from their apps in ways that make them successful and sustainable? At CityGrid we have "Places that Pay", where users get paid for showing certain business profiles, and we are working on other versions of "Content that Pays", in the future.  But there has to be other innovative ways to make money from web and mobile app development.
Let me know how you are making money from your apps!

			<p><em>16 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>This is a guest post by Travis Spencer, a Software engineer specializing in federation, SSO, cloud computing, Web services, &amp; enterprise architecture. This week, AT&amp;T announced the release of a new API platform that is made up of various components designed to simplify mobile Web application development and utilize resources only available through them. Specifically, the new offering is made up of the following: A number of RESTful cloud services such as device location, MMS, digital signing, and direct carrier billing An application marketplace and distribution channel A hosting environment for the HTML5 and server-side components used by applications running on the platform SDKs for common development environments such as C#, PHP, Ruby, and Java that can be used to call the API An HTML5 client-side SDK built atop Sencha Touch that abstract away the various mobile UI differences of Android, iOS, Blackberry and others while simultaneously simplifying the integration w/ their new cloud services These are complimented by extensive samples, documentation, forums, on-line support, and a non-production environment where you can create an unlimited number of test applications. After joining the developer program, you can use the portal to create applications. When you do so, you specify which services your application will use (as shown in the adjacent screenshot). If you are developing a mobile Web application w/ HTML5, the SDK for that platform greatly simplifies the process and reduces the effort required. It does this using the architecture shown in the following figure. As depicted, an HTML5 application calls the new cloud API via a proxy (possibly hosted by AT&amp;T). This intermediary hides the security of the API in a Sencha plug-in, simplifying the programming model clients must follow. This JavaScript library ensures that a user has authorized an application to access her AT&amp;T resources without having to share a username or password. It does this using a standard security protocol called OAuth, which many other APIs discussed previously on this blog also use....[<a href="/2012/01/16/atts-new-cloud-api-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2012/01/13/email-as-a-content-api/">Email as a Content API</a></h3>
			<p><em>13 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I think email is highly underrated as a content API.  I know its not what we traditionally think of as an API, but has a lot of potential as a basic interface into an application.
An example of this is If This Then That (iftt). I use iftt to syndicate content to some of my blog platforms.  As part of my blogging strategy I want posts I publish on API Evangelist, to also show up on my Blogger, Posterous, Tumblr and Wordpress.
Using iftt you can setup tasks that get triggered on certain events.  One such trigger is a new post to an RSS feed.  So when a new blog posts shows up in the API Evangelist RSS feed I can have iftt pull the title and body and push to a channel.  iftt provides channels for Posterous and Tumblr, allowing me to automatically syndicate using their APIs. &nbsp;

There are no channels for Blogger and Wordpress, so I use their Gmail channel in conjunction with the post by email features on Blogger and Wordpress.  So instead of using an API to syndicate my content, I use email as an interface for these blogging platforms.
Using email as a content API is obviously not for every situation, but for some application processes, it might just work for moving content from one application to another, without much overhead.

			<p><em>12 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>Last year there was an accidental post from a Google employee about Google+.  The internal rant was accidentally shared publicly and provides some insight into how Google approached APIs for their new Google + platform, as well as insight how Amazon adopted an internal service oriented architecture (SOA). The insight about how Google approached the API for Google+ is interesting, but what is far more interesting is the insight the Google engineer who posted the rant, Steve Yegge, provides about his time working at Amazon, before he was a engineer with Google. During 6 years at Amazon he witnessed the transformation of the company from a bookseller to the almost $1B, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) API, cloud computing leader.  As Yegge's recalls that one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate, sometime back around 2002 (give or take a year): All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces. There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network. It doesn’t matter what technology they use. All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. The mandate closed with: Anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired.  Thank you; have a nice day! Everyone got to work and over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed itself, internally into a service-oriented architecture (SOA), learning a tremendous amount along the way. Think about what Bezos was asking!   Every team within Amazon had to interact using web services.  If you were human resources and you needed some numbers from marketing, you had to get them using an...[<a href="/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I needed a way to tell the story of the&nbsp;CityGrid API&nbsp;from the perspective of cities across the United States. &nbsp;The way I tell stories is through programming and hacking on APIs, so I needed a project that would allow me to hack on CityGrid&rsquo;s&nbsp;places,&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;and&nbsp;offers&nbsp;as well as play with different ways of using the&nbsp;web, mobile and custom advertising&nbsp;we offer.
So I created&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal, my playground for all things local. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal gives me a place to publish projects that I hack on using the CityGrid APIs, while also telling the story of what I build in real-time. &nbsp;You can find local applications I build in a variety of languages, complete with links to&nbsp;download and fork on Github, and even in some cases I publish Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with the code already loaded and ready to use.
As the API Evangelist at CityGrid I will be touring around the country attending hackathons and conferences, &nbsp;spreading the word about CityGrid, and interacting with developers in different cities. &nbsp;Each city I visit, I will launch a copy of my local directory prototype for that city, and publish to Hyp3rL0cal. &nbsp;This will allow me to see the quality of data available via CityGrid APIs for each city and community I visit.
I have added a&nbsp;blog to Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;where I will tell the story of my projects and travels around the country evangelizing about&nbsp;CityGrid. &nbsp;Come back often, I hope this will be as much of a learning experience for you, as it is for me.

			<p>I just wrapped up the AT&amp;T Mobile App Hackathon in Las Vegas. I had a great time hanging out with developers at the Palms Hotel, and watching everyone compete for the 30K in prizes. My primary goal at these events is to get to know developers and hear what they have to say. I was fortunate to connect with one such developer, Ravi Singh (@Code4Ever), and he was so kind to share Ravi's Rules for Hackathon's: #1: Use Eventbrite or Meetup to organize the event. Don't spin your own system because it is a waste of time. Eventbrite has it's own systems to market and get info about your event out. #2: Build a messaging network BEFORE the hackathon and register a hash for it. So many times developers leave the main area to work out their idea and miss critical information. Establish a simple back-end for all messages and let the attendees now and blast all important information about the even through it. #3: BEFORE the event setup a Google Spreadsheet so teams can register for the final presentations and send that out in the first mails. Do not wait to do or announce it late or in slides. #4: FOOD: Do not waste your money in lots of cheap items that are bad for the developer. Pounds of candy and jerky don't help your developers become more productive. There is a reason Google has 640 chef's cooking with organic and healthy foods. Instead of wasting your money on that stuff, find a good local cook or chef to make a hot lunch for the developers. Do not invest in Red Bull or 5hr energy or other food items that are actually bad and questionable for the health of the developers. This doesn't mean you serve tofu and fruit , but that you actively consider making food and providing drinks that are in the benefit of making the best apps. #5: Networking, test the...[<a href="/2012/01/11/rules-for-hackathon-organizers-by-ravi-singh/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
     


     I’m spending a lot of time traveling around the country going to hackathons. I find myself constantly explaining what the term hack means.


     I’m blown away by the number of people, even in the tech industry that still see hack as a negative term. At the AT&amp;T hackathon in Las Vegas , I encountered quite a few hardware folks in town for CES, attending the event. I was asked by one guy, “Are all these people trying to hack someone’s network?”.


     So, as part of my 2012 hackathon roadshow, I will take on trying to rebrand the term. Currently, these are the common definitions of the word hack:


     To cut or chop with repeated and irregular blows: hacked down the saplings
     
     To break up the surface of soil
     
     To alter a computer program
     
     To gain access to a computer file or network illegally or without authorization
     
     To cut or mutilate as if by hacking
     
     To cope with successfully
     
     To chop or cut something by hacking
     
     To write or refine computer programs skillfully
     
     To use one's skill in computer programming to gain illegal or unauthorized access to a file or network
     
     To cough roughly or harshly
     
     A rough, irregular cut made by hacking
     
     A tool, such as a hoe, used for hacking
     
     A blow made by hacking
     
     A rough, dry cough
     


     The definition I’ve heard, and prefer is:


     A quick and dirty programmatic solution to a problem.


     I would like to solicit other definitions and feedback of how you’d like to see the term hack used widely in the media and Hollywood.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>
There are a lot of reasons for throwing a hackathon, and what value you get out of a hackathon will vary depending on who you are.
As I explore the hackathon phenomenom in 2012, I&rsquo;m trying to track on what value hackathon organizers, API owners, mobile platforms, developers and other participants get out of hackathons.
I will be tracking on the different reasons people attend hackathons throughout the year, and share my findings, but here in January I know one thing for sure--hackthons are a marketing vehicle.  Whether you are the hackathon organizer, an API provider or developer you are depending on the event to market your organization, business, API or talent and skills as a developer.
In future posts I will write, more about the marketing effect of hackathons, but I wanted to talk about a common mistake I&rsquo;m seeing from hacakthon organizers--no Twitter hashtag for the event.
A Twitter hashtag is probably the most important marketing element of your hackathon.  It should be everywhere, on your site, print materials, slides...everywhere.  A hackathon organizer should be tweeting out every aspect of the event with the hashtag, before, during and after the event.
The hashtag will enable sponsors and other participating businesses to market themselves around the event.  It will also allow hackathon developers to showcase their ideas, skills and applications.
While researching hackathons I have to spend a lot of time tracking down the event hashtag, and many times I have to ask an event organizer to provide it, and often there isn&rsquo;t even one.
If your organizing an hackathon, make sure and establish a unique Twitter hashtag for event right away, and use it everywhere, everyone involved will benefit, and your event will be much more successful.

			<p>To kick-off my role as API Evangelist at CityGrid, I took a quick walk through the world of location and places API. The CityGrid API centers around places API which provides rich local business data via a RESTful API. So getting familiar with other location and places API is critical to my role. While going through each of these APIs in the space I flushed out what I'd consider the high levels areas that these APIs offer. This list is a work in progress, with a goal in helping see the industry, and potentially identify where players are leading the industry, and where there are gaps. Of course it all starts with places information. Rich content about businesses and other geographic points of interest. CityGrid, Google, Yahoo, Bing and other players like Foursquare, SimpleGeo, InfoChimps and Factual all bring places data to the table. CityGrid and Foursquare also bring merchant APIs to the game, allowing businesses to manage their profile data as well as how it gets syndicated across many networks. Along with places data there are various geo related services that are offered across these APIs: GeoCoding Directions Distance Elevation Geofencing The next area I'm grouping location services under would be other content directly related to specific places, pulled through APIs: Reviews Offers Images Videos Menus Editorials After location and business related content I'd say there is a growing pool of related content that may not be directly associated with a business or location, but provide context, and augment places data making it more meaningful to users: Weather Demographics Wikipedia Neighborhood Tagging That isn't a complete list of contextual places content, but a couple of quick ones I found. I will explore this area more later. After content I'm seeing very distinct actions that users can take around location and places data. Again, I'm sure there are more of these, but here is a short list of location actions: Check-In Push Notifications Recommendations You...[<a href="/2012/01/03/service-offered-by-local-social-mobile-api-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

     2011 was an interesting year for APIs. I wasn't as good as I wanted to be at covering all major API events, but I got some traction with some posts I didn't anticipate.


     Here are my top 10 traffic posts on API Evangelist for 2011:


     
          Apple iCloud API
     
     
          Considerations When Planning Endpoints for your RESTful API
     
     
          Google Launches OAuth 2.0 Playground
     
     
          iCloud Storage APIs
     
     
          The Need for More Transit APIs

          Providing Code Libraries is Not Enough for Your API
     
     
          RESTful Business Architecture
     


     I expected Apple related API stories to be big, but the other topics on here like endpoint planning, transit APIs, open building blocks, RESTful business architecture and a flood of APIs were a surprise.


     Overall it shows me that applying APIs and RESTful concepts to business in specific industries can really get people talking.


     A few of these posts were written while I was doing deep dives into government, water and transit industries and how APIs are changing the landscape.


     I hope to do many of these deep industry dives in 2012.

			<p>I'm reading The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood right now. So far its a great read. Very thought provoking stuff. I just read this passage on how the first dictionary transformed the way we were able to think about, understand and re-use words: ...the meaning of words come from other words. It implies that all words come from other words, taken together, form an interlocking structure: interlocking, because all the words are defined in terms of other words. This could never have been an issue in an oral culture, where language was barely visible. Only when printing---and the diction---put the language into separate relief, as an object to be scrutinized, could anyone develop a sense of a word meaning as interdependent and even circular. Words had to be considered as words, representing other words, apart from things. For the first time words stood on their own, apart from the stories and poems that contained them. The first dictionaries set into motion, much of what we take for granite today with writing and communicating. It made me think of what APIs are doing for business information and resources. APIs decouple them, making them independent of their original intended form and meaning.  Allowing them be accessed, distributed, re-used and transformed into new ways never even conceived by its original source or creator. The content of an existing travel book could become an interactive application, using Google Earth, Wikipedia and other APIs allowing someone to travel the global on their iPad without leaving their home.   The CityGrid API I evangelize for offers business and places data for cities across the country, with a web and mobile adveritising network.  This single resource can mean many things to different people, it could be a restaurant directory in Seattle or a medical assistance guide in Philadelphia.   APIs have a lot of potential in freeing up many of the business resources, media and content we use everyday and allow...[<a href="/2011/12/25/apis-can-decouple-business-information-and-resources/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>As 2011 comes to an end, I’d like to take another look at what I learned about the API management service provider space in 2011. I started the year engaging 3Scale, Apigee and Mashery, trying to find a platform to build the Mimeo Connect API platform on. Then spent the entire year getting to know each of the API management service providers, and the products they offer. At the end of the year, we are discussing the relevancy of API service providers, so I think a year-end API service provider post is due. The First DimensionTo make sense of the API management space, I’m looking at it in five separate dimensions. As of December 2011, I would set the first dimension and primary API management playing field as: 3Scale Alcatel Lucent Apigee SOA Software Intel Layer 7 Technologies Mashery Vordel These companies are going to provide a gateway, proxy or a connector for your APIs either on-premise or in the cloud. Then through that gateway, proxy, connector they will offer a variety of services to secure, translate, throttle, cache, distribute and scale your APIs as you need. Some of these companies will also provide you with a way to manage usage, billing, reporting and legal for the users, partners and developers who will be consuming your API. These companies will also bring a whole bunch of expertise to the table, that your company can tap while building your API strategy. Some will even help you market your API to developers online and at events. One thing to know about these API management service providers is, well...they are API management service providers. To my knowledge they don’t actually deploy your API for you, they help you build a strategy, and manage the API. But you still need to rely on other tools and in-house resources to deliver your API. A common Google search or in-person query I get is: Apigee vs. Mashery, 3Scale vs. Apigee and...[<a href="/2011/12/23/api-management-service-provider-roundup-for-2011/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>ProgrammableWeb says Google has 94 APIs. I roughly count about 75 going through Google Code. I&rsquo;m more concerned with public web APIs, and Google has Android, Chrome and other non-web APIs, so its hard to tell. In any case I would consider Google to the largest public web API owner around. I don&rsquo;t think any other single provider, owns the number of, as well as size of public APIs, that Google does. As with any leading API providers I think there is a lot to learn in studying their approach to API deployment and management. With this in mind I wanted to take a look at the Business of Google APIs in 2011 as one of my year-end, API reflection posts. I think there are some important lessons to be learned from the work Google did over 2011, to get their API business in order. Google was already setting the theme for 2011, with the launch of Google Console in November 2010. The Google API Console helps developers manage their Google API usage across all of thier sites and apps. It was clear, Google was not just looking for a way to get a handle on how they deploy and manage large numbers of APIs, they were acknowledging developers needed a way as well. Google API Console centralized how developers managed the Google APIs they used, traffic generated via these APIs, introduced billing management for some APIs, and provided developers with project and team building tools. &nbsp;Google supports 30 APIs inside of the API Console now. In 2011 Google also worked to make their APIs more discoverable for developers with the launch Google API Discovery Service. The Google API Discovery Service provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs by delivering a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document for each API. Now developers can integrate Google API discovery into client libraries, IDE...[<a href="/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>The FCC just launched a new platform that&nbsp;allows anyone to create, save and manage a customized page, built from widgets that pull content from FCC APIs, called MyFCC.&nbsp; At first glance MyFCC might look like just another dashboard or start page, but it goes much further, as an API curation platform. To understand, you have to go back to the beginning and see the scope of the problem being solved. To deliver on its promise for a more open government, the FCC didn't just want a new website, they needed a platform. To do this the FCC embraced an API-driven methodology while building their web site, meant to standardize the way they deliver information between internal groups, government agencies and with the public. At the time, the managing FCC director Steve Van Roekel, partnered with Seabourne to architect a platform that could deliver on this vision. The new FCC web site would start with Drupal, providing a content management system (CMS) that would allow the FCC to focus on getting a handle on its content, centralizing it, preparing it to be shared with other departments, agencies and the public. The federal government is drowning in content, so the entry, storage and management of this content was the first problem to solve, and an open-source platform like Drupal, was an ideal solution. The new Drupal web site provided public access to the content, but the FCC needed to allow sharing of content with other departments, agencies and allow the public to get at the raw data for re-use. "Everyone is talking about opening up data with APIs, to me it makes more sense to focus on opening up content using APIs.", says Mike Reich, owner of Seabourne. So Seabourne developed the Content API module for Drupal, providing a plug-and-play API, not just for the FCC website, but for any Drupal driven website. Then in April, the FCC launched their API driven content platform, stating that &ldquo;Everything...[<a href="/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">Read More</a>]</p>

Google just launched their new Google Affiliate Network API, which allows publishers and advertisers to automate various tasks related to the Google Affiliate Network.
The Google Affiliate Network is the affiliate network, formerly known as Doubleclick Performics, which was part of Google&rsquo;s Doublick acquisition in April of 2007.
Using the new Google Affiliate Network APIs, developers can programmaticaly manage:

Advertiser Lookup - Publishers can now use the Google Affiliate Network API to access data that advertisers have chosen to share with them.
Event and Order Details - Developers can easily integrate data from events that occur in Google Affiliate Network into their own website's workflow and internal systems.
Publisher Lookup - Advertisers can use the API to look up data that publishers have chosen to share with them

I need to play with the network more to understand how it works from both an advertisers and publishers perspective.
It looks like an interesting addition to the suite of publishing, advertising and revenue generating tools from Google like Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Google Adsense and Google Webmaster Tools.

			<h3><a href="/2011/12/12/restful-business-architecture/">RESTful Business Architecture</a></h3>
			<p><em>12 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.
His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: software and networking.
He identifies that software research:
...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.
While networking research:
...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.
 Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software.  He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.
The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.
As Fielding states:
REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.
As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an API Evangelist, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.
When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like?  Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software?  When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?
Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.

			<p><em>12 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>
Google has made another step towards a more common API infrastructure in line with their API Discovery Service, API Explorer, and API Console by launching a single terms of service for all Google APIs.
Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers.
At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like Google Tasks, Google Moderator,&nbsp;Google Charts and Blogger.
While more complex APIs like Youtube, Google Analytics, Google Adwords and Google Latitude still use their own terms of service.  Over time, more APIs will be migrated to the new, centralized terms of service format.&nbsp;
With almost 100 APIs now, it makes sense for Google to reduce the complexity of terms of use across APIs, increasing the chances a developer will &ldquo;legally&rdquo; build an application or business around one or multiple Google APIs.&nbsp;
Google provides tools for developers to easily discover, explore their APIs, while also providing centralized management of billing, usage reporting and terms of use. &nbsp;I predict we will see other API service providers offering tools for managing terms of use, branding and other legal aspects of API management in 2012.

			<p><em>02 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>I recently pulled the title, description and tags for all the APIs in the ProgramableWeb directory into a local MySQL database. At the time of this writing there are 4,480 public APIs in the directory. My goal is build a better search and discovery interface, so I can get a handle on all these APIs. Which ones I should be paying attention to, recommending to developers and generally just have an awareness of what types of APIs are available. Where do I start? First I start with a keyword search on the title, description and tags associated with each API. I will build a bunch of custom search queries, but no matter how good my queries are, I’m still limited by whatever descriptions are associated with the APIs and whatever tags were applied. This is just search, it isn’t discovery or real-time tracking. Having gone through whole categories of image APIs and storage APIs by hand I know there is a lot of crap APIs that aren’t in my opinion, real API efforts. They just throw up an API, register it with ProgrammableWeb and don’t actually have a supporting area for developers. I need a way to programmatically rank each API while searching through APIs. When I search for photo management APIs, I want them sorted by some sort of value. Currently ProgrammableWeb uses the number of mashups of an API as a “popularity” ranking. I need more and I figured Compete and Alexa APIs could give me some sense of the value of each API based upon its domain. This is just a start and I want to establish a wide variety of metrics for measuring the value delivered by an API. My API ranking algorithm is obviously a work in progress. I just figured I’d tell the story of how I evolve my API ranking algorthm here, and leave open for comment and others to add to. But as I work to make...[<a href="/2011/12/02/what-does-a-world-with-100k-open-apis-look-like/">Read More</a>]</p>
