        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.marvel.com/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/marvel-comics/marvel-avengers-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reviewing the recently released <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/" target="_blank">Marvel Comic API</a>, because I&rsquo;m a comic book geek, wait no, because I&rsquo;m the API Evangelist&mdash;no wait it is both. Properly reviewing an API takes time because you need to spend time in the developers area, and actually go through the motions of hacking on an API. So far I&rsquo;ve registered, spent about 15 minutes looking around the documentation, and wrote a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/01/a-simple-honest-approach-to-getting-started-with-the-marvel-comics-api/">post on their getting started page</a>.</p>
<p>My friend Andreas Krohn (<a href="https://twitter.com/andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>) started by first reviewing the Marvel Comics API terms of use, which is the first thing any savvy developer should do, and he wrote up a great blogs post called, <a href="http://blog.dopter.se/post/75494422535/the-marvel-api-a-case-study-in-how-to-not-respect">The Marvel API - a case study in how to not respect developers</a>.  Andreas uncovers some pretty show-stopping aspects of the Marvel terms of use, &nbsp;including the fact that you can&rsquo;t generate any revenue from your applications built on the Marvel API, publish press releases about your work, and they reserve the right to take any idea you have, and keep for themselves. ;-(</p>
<p>Through a developer lens, these are pretty clear signals that an API provider is more concerned with their own interests, and don&rsquo;t care about developers success, and it is probably a good idea to steer clear of integrating with the platform. Through the lens of a major publisher who is first entering this scary new world of APIs, it starts to makes more sense.  This is why the terms of service is the single most important building block of any API--it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good your technical implementation of an API is, or how good your other building blocks like documentation are--if your TOS does not encourage innovation, developers will walk away.</p>
<p>Even with these extreme limitations placed on the TOS, I&rsquo;m still very optimistic for the Marvel API. I agree 100% with Andreas&rsquo;s analysis, but we also have to also celebrate that a major publisher like Marvel even being willing to play in the API game. I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">watching Pearson iterate on their API for over three years now</a>, which reminds me that I should work with Andreas to do a deep dive on the Pearson TOS, and like the rest of us, Pearson is learning a lot along the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that we shouldn&rsquo;t critique the API initiatives of these companies. We should! They need to hear our feedback on every aspect of API operations, especially the terms of use, but we should also celebrate that they are even willing to put their cards on the table at all. We can&rsquo;t expect companies with major brand recognition, and deep history, to change overnight. As with the rest of us, Marvel will eventually learn to open up, give more control and opportunities to developers and better understand the benefits of a more &ldquo;open&rdquo; API program.</p>

<p>One of my biggest challenges at API Evangelist is keeping content accessible for people who have just come into the API space. The most successful aspect of my site is the blog, and while I try to keep all my writing targeted outside the developer community, it can be a lot of work to jump in and get up to speed on posts that are chronological.</p>
<p>It is really important to me, that people who are just learning about the space, or weekend API warriors can find the best resources across the space, not just on my blog&mdash;this is why I&rsquo;m super stoked about the new site from 3Scale called <a title="API Alchemy" href="http://apialchemy.3scale.net/">API Alchemy</a>.</p>
<p>API Alchemy is looking to curate the best of resources from the API space, providing curated links and commentary and access to the most influential authors across the world of APIs, in an easy to discover format.</p>
<p>API Alchemy isn&rsquo;t just for newbies either. Now when you are looking for <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BRipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">that kick-ass rant from Steve Yegge</a>, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API</a> by that blowhard Kin Lane, you can find it in one place.</p>
<p>Now I have a place to publish the best of the best I find across the API space, and somewhere to send people of all skill levels&mdash;<a href="/admin/blog/API Alchemy">API Alchemy.</a>&nbsp;Nice work 3Scale team!</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is easy to think of <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> as a central repository for your open source code&mdash;most developers understand that. I have written before about the <a title="many ways to use Github as part of your API management strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">many ways to use Github as part of your API management strategy</a>, but in the last few months I'm really seeing Github playing more of a central role in the overall lifecycle of an API.</p>
<p><strong>API Presence</strong><br /><a title="Github Pages" href="http://pages.github.com/"> Github Pages</a> provides a very simple way for API providers to deploy public or private portals that can be a simple or elaborate doorway for developers to learn about and engage with APIs. A company can potentially have a single or multiple API portals, targeting a variety of potential consumers. You don't need a special website for your API anymore, just fire up a Github Page and get publishing the <a title="relevant building blocks your consumers will need" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">relevant building blocks your consumers will need</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Definition</strong><br /> As I continue to study the world of API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, I'm increasingly finding API definitions published to Github, as well as employing it as a central storage for all my own API definitions. When 3Scale and API Evangelist designed <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, we allowed the publishing of API definitions to Github to be one of the ways you can include your API definition in the commons. By publishing your API definition on Github, either publicly or privately, you can provide a central definition of your API surface area, that can be versioned, forked, downloaded, and allow for contributions from other key players in your API ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>API Services</strong><br /> During my monitoring of the API space, I came across a new API monitoring service called <a href="http://autodevbot.com/">AutoDevBot</a>, which monitors all your API endpoints, and notifies you when something goes wrong. Pretty standard feature in a <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/companies.html">new wave of API integration tools and services</a> I&rsquo;m seeing emerge, but what is interesting is they use Github as a central place to store the settings for the API monitoring service. AutoDevBot has you clone their settings template, make changes you need to monitor your APIs, register and fire up AutoDevBot to monitor. Seems like a pretty simple way for API service providers to engage with API providers, allowing them to manage all the configuration for API services alongside their own internal API operations.</p>
<p><strong>API Source Code</strong><br /> Using Github as a central repository for server and client side code is not new, but using it as a central source for deploying, scaling and distribution of permanent or temporary instances of an API resource across various PaaS providers is. Allowing users to deploy cloud or on-premise instances of your API resources to Amazon Cloud Formations, Red Hat OpenShift or even Heroku, will define how we deploy and manage APIs in the future.</p>
<p><strong>API Feedback Loop</strong><br /> APIs are all about iterating, hopefully throughout the design, deployment, management, monetization, licensing and evangelism cycles, and Github provides a  perfect platform for managing the feedback loop for each of these iterations. Github issue and milestone manager is increasingly being used to manage feedback around the API design process, all source code, and will play a significant role in external API services, API definitions and the the overall presence of an API.</p>
<p>Github isn&rsquo;t just for server or client API code anymore. Git(hub) can play a central role in not just helping API providers manage a central definition of their API as it pertains to general operations, Github allows providers to interact with other service providers, as well as their API consumers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by the many ways API and other service providers are putting Github to use, and will keep paying attention when I have time. I envision Github continuing its evolution as the backbone of public or private APIs, providing a central presence, definition, service integration point, feedback loop, as well source code repository for the thousands of API resources that are being deployed in the coming years.</p>

<p>It is easy to get excited about the potential around &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. Many individuals and companies feel this latest trend is all about offering up big data solutions with business models that are built around algorithms, that founders consider their &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with this, more power to you, however I personally feel big data solutions, especially those within government should be more transparent than many of the secret sauce, big data approaches we&rsquo;ve seen to date.</p>
<p>Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) has a great post at TechRepublic, called <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-driven-policy-and-commerce-requires-algorithmic-transparency/" target="_blank">data-driven policy and commerce requires algorithmic transparency</a>, which outlines this very well.  Alex uses the the phrase "algorithmic accountability&rdquo;, which I think sums all of this up very nicely.</p>
<p>When it comes to big data solutions, especially in the public sector, it is fine to collect large amounts of data, offer up analytics, visualizations and other big data tools, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">algorithmic accountability</span> is something that will be essential in moving forward and building trust across all indusries when it comes to big data.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/01/the-voice-chat-api-is-great-example-of-an-simple-open-api-driven-resource/">interesting approach by Plivo the other day around their Voice Chat API</a>, in which one thing they did really caught my eye, and reflects what I think is the future of APIs&mdash;the deployment of the API to Heroku.</p>
<p>This type of very modular, cloud deployment of fine grain APIs is something that I&rsquo;ve blogged about recently in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/modular-apis-driven-from-github-blueprints-using-openshift/">Modular APIs Driven From Github Blueprints Using OpenShift</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/server-side-api-templates-on-aws-cloud-formation-and-openshift/">Server Side API Templates On AWS Cloud Formation And OpenShift</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/12/caching-apis-with-cloudformations-or-openshift-/">Caching APIs With CloudFormations Or OpenShift</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the Voice Chat API, Plivo allows you to deploy an instance of the open source audio conference API to your own Heroku account. This is an interesting way to empower developers to deploy API resources, allowing them to allocate them within their preferred cloud environment, whether it is Heroku, Amazon, OpenShift from Redhat, or any other provider.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t investigated if there are any dependencies between the Voice Chat API and Plivo, but even with dependencies, this approach still holds a lot of promise. This gets us closer to some of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">earlier thoughts around virtual API stacks</a>, that allow us to build, manage and put to use the most meaningful stack of APIs possible for our applications&mdash;think b<a title="Backend As A Service" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">ackend as a service (BaaS),</a> but custom fit to exactly the resources we need.</p>

<p>A free, open-source, API driven conference solution called <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/">Voice Chat API</a> popped up on my API monitoring radar today, as I was going through my feeds. The Voice Chat API is a very cool, dead-simple conferencing solution. As a tool it provides clear value, and I really like the approach from <a href="https://plivo.com/">Plivo</a> to rollout out an open, API driven resource like this&mdash;a model that could be applied to other valuable resources.</p>
<p>What really stands out is the Voice Chat API does one thing and does it well&mdash;audio conferences. It is easy to tell what it does. We aren't having to convince users of a problem, then sell them on a solution. The problem is clear, the solution is simple.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong><br /> The <a href="https://github.com/plivo/voicechat/">Voice Chat API is open source and available on Github</a>, built using "Plivo WebSDK and APIs&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t investigated the separation between what code is open source, and where the dependencies on Plivo is, but regardless the approach is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Add-Ons</strong><br /> Providing users with more ways to deploy a conference, the Voice Chat API provides a set of add-ons including a <a href="https://github.com/dhfromkorea/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/voicechat.coffee/">Hubot Plugin</a>, that works in Campfire or Hipchat, a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-chat/mmamadaodppejbaffaagddokjjekifoe">Chrome extension</a>, and a <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/create">bookmarklet for deploying a conference from any other browser</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API</strong><br /> The <a href="http://plivo.github.io/voicechat/">Voice Chat API centers around its API,&nbsp;</a>which allows developers to create a unique audio conference, the call mobile &amp; landline phone numbers (PSTN) into the bridge. The API deploys to your Heroku account, allowing you do manage your ad-hoc audio conference deployments in the cloud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing around with the <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/">Voice Chat API</a>, understanding how the application and the API works, as well as considering how this new open source approach dovetails with Plivo's business model, but now I&rsquo;m intrigued which the approach, and how they crafted this API driven resource.</p>

<p>I like their style. As a building block, getting started pages are pretty important, yet most API providers provide very dry, technical steps for on-boarding with an API&mdash;if at all.</p>
<p>The Marvel Comics API is a refreshing approach to explaining to developers how to get up and running with the API. Its nice to see from such a big brand.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2014</span>

<p>As a proprietor of a small, successful niche blog, I can easily share some insight into why <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en">Google recently started punishing blogs that have guest posts</a>.</p>
<p>At <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I get about two offers a week from random companies and individuals asking to guest post on my blog. These people cite several reasons for wanting to do it, ranging from me helping them as an aspiring blogger, to them helping me with more content and traffic. If you know me, you know I don't have a problem producing content, and I do not blog because I give a shit about pageviews.</p>
<p>In addition to these smaller, much frequent requests for guest posting. I also get the occasional bigger company looking to &ldquo;partner&rdquo; with me, when in reality they have no desire to partner and generate value for my readers, or move my research forward. These conversations start out entertaining my perspective of partnering and bringing me value, but once I choose to dance with these partners, they almost always start getting heavy handed about me publishing what they want, and providing links to their own sites and content.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/thanks-for-offering-to-guest-blog-or-advertise-but%E2%80%A6/">Mike Schinkel has a great post on this very topic</a>, echoing much of what I&rsquo;m saying.  Mike is like me, he blogs for himself, not to generate pageviews. I started API Evangelist to help me better understand the API space, and while I do have a mission of also educating the masses about APIs, the primary directive is still about educating myself&mdash;without this none of it matters.</p>
<p>The reason Google has begun cracking down is because it is in their best interest to ensure blogs are of the highest quality, unique content possible. What these &ldquo;guest post farmers&rdquo;, and the enterprise companies that employ this same practice don't realize, is their aren&rsquo;t generating any value, they are extracting and diminishing the value of these blogs, and this is what has catching Google&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>On second thought, maybe these companies realize what they are doing. They are just leeches, looking to extract value for their purpose&mdash;at all costs. They don't care about your blog, content or career. They want to suck every last page view from your blogs soul, transferring any value you may have had to their operations.</p>

<p>I am working through some deeper research into the world of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and specifically into the world of API definitions. This research involves talking to each of the leading providers, crafting a series of stories along the way, resulting in a white paper that provides an overview of the space and possibly where things are going.</p>
<p>During my conversations with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) of <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, creator of <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a>, Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril) and Z (<a href="https://twitter.com/zdne">@zdne</a>) of <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, creators of <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and Uri Sarid (<a href="https://twitter.com/usarid">@usarid</a>) of <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a>, creators of <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, I asked a simple question:</p>
<p><strong>What is the vision behind  your API definition format?</strong></p>
<p>Resulting in a little insight behind each approach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - The vision behind Swagger was not to make a company or to get people to use our service, it was strictly to solve a workflow problem. Initially the goal was centered around documentation and client tooling, but quickly realized it was much bigger, and became about managing the overall lifecycle of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Blueprint</strong> - API Blueprint is all about simplicity, and allowing people to have a structured conversation around an API, with the people who are actually going to be using it. Apiary is the conduit for this conversation, allowing developers to easily create a mock interface from the blueprint, share with consumers, and iterate as necessary.</li>
<li><strong>RAML</strong> - The motivation behind RAML was about seeking one source of truth, and a basic representation of an API. We used Swagger and API Blueprint, but neither fully met our vision. RAML was born, and is in alignment with Mulesoft's design first approach, and gave them the ability to design an API in a format that allowed them to sit down with stakeholders in a webinar and get instant feedback&mdash;bringing the API to forefront, not the implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are my summarizations of what Tony, Jakub, Z and Uri said in response to my question, not direct quotes. I think they get at the essence of why each company has invested so much in defining an API definition that delivers on their separate visions, and meets their goals</p>
<p>I also think there is a lot of overlap in these visions, as well as being in sync with where the overall demand in the API space is going. I don't endorse one solution over the other&mdash;I think each API designer will choose, and the fact there are multiple approaches is a good thing.</p>
<p>API definitions play a central role in my API design process, but in my personal approach, theAPI server and client code is regularly thrown away, where my API designs remain constant&mdash;something I work to iterate on, much like my writing.</p>
<p>Even with my personal passion for API definitions, I don't think they will be for everyone. I think API designers who find they deliver value in their work will use, while many successful API designers will have no use for them, and be just fine without them.</p>
<p>For some in 2014 API design will be about sharing, collaborating and communicating, in which API definitions will play a central role. For others the API implementation will be where the sharing, collaborating, communicating and ultimately the rubber meets the road.</p>

<p>I was having one of my regular Google Hangouts with the OG API Evangelist John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>) the other day as I was flying back from east coast, and he made a comment about my classic API Evangelist drawing, and said I should write the ten commandments of APIs.</p>
<p>At first I thought, not my style, but on second thought, what the hell. Here they are:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Deliver Value </strong>- Generate value for consumers, without value APIs mean nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Documentation</strong> - Provide clean, simple, up to date API documentation for users.</li>
<li><strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Deliver code sample, libraries, SDKs, or starter projects in a variety of languages.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Support</strong> - If you don&rsquo;t support your APIs, your efforts won&rsquo;t be sustainable.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Don&rsquo;t Break</span> Minimize Breaking Shit </strong>- You will never establish trust with consumers if you break your shit all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model </strong>- Without a business model for your API, they will not be sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - Establish TOS that protect your company's interests, but allow consumers to prosper and grow.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Establish solid security practices that keep your resources secure, while also protecting all users involved.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Passionately protect the privacy of your API consumers and end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Tell Stories </strong>- Craft and tell meaningful stories about the value your APIs deliver or nobody will will know or care about them.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are my 10 commandments for API providers, and represent what I think are the 10 most important elements of delivering APIs. If you follow these 10 commandments, in your API design, development, deployment, and management you will find happiness. ;-)</p>
<p>These commandments won&rsquo;t guarantee your success in the market, but they will guarantee that you will learn and grow in your API initiative, whether its internal or external&mdash;which in my opinion is the most important aspect of adopting an API way of life.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Adjusting breaking shit, as John cites below. It is inevitable so minimizing is my advice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connected-network.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm continuing my exploration of the possibilities of offering up a wholesale version of an API resource. While wholesale is not an option for all types of APIs, there are a subset of APIs that are more utility in nature and would lend themselves nicely to being sold wholesale to other API providers.</p>
<p>I want to better understand the nuts and bolts of what it will take to offer up APIs in this way, and for this exercise I&rsquo;m going to explore providing <a title="screenshot API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/creating-my-own-screenshot-api/">my recent screenshot API</a> as a wholesale API that other API providers could resale alongside their own resources. An API provider could have their own news, content or other resources, and decide it would be more cost effective to resell my screen capture API, rather than design, deploy and provide their own.</p>
<p>I have designed, developed and deployed my screenshot API, now what do I need to make it available wholesale?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Definition</strong> - I'll need to have some sort of API definition in API Blueprint, Swagger or RAML to be able to communicate my interface and underlying data model to other providers in a machine readable way that lets them interface with it, as well as potentially develop other tooling around their resale of my resource.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy</strong> - I don't think this this one is a requirement, as some providers would prefer to develop their own proxy layer, but providing a proxy harness that other API providers could use to deploy my API, as a resource within their domain would be a nice to have. Providing it in a variety of languages including PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Java and Node.js would sensible.</li>
<li><strong>Management APIs</strong> - To support wholesale interactions I would need a set of my own APIs that providers can use to accomplish common API management features like usage volumes, rate limits, and user management if applicable. These services would have to be available as APIs so that providers could seamlessly integrate into their own API management platform.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>That is just a few of the elements I think that I would need to serve up my API in a wholesale way. I might think of more needs as I evolve my thoughts on this, and potentially develop a working prototype around my screenshot API.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>Using these tools, an API provider could come and sign up for wholesale access, deploy a proxy within their domain, and use the API definition to deploy interactive documentation that was seamless with their own documentation. Next I see two distinct scenarios for user management around wholesale APIs. You don&rsquo;t want users having to sign up for two separate keys, or even know about the wholesale provider in any way. This is where the management APIs would come in, depending on my business goals that surround my wholesale resources I would employ two user scenarios:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User Profile Required -</strong> If I wanted to require my API resellers to pass along their user profiles along with API usage I could provide some sort of key translation as part of management APIs and / or as part of the proxy operations. When a new users first uses the API resources, my reseller would have to generate a profile for them in my wholesale system, generating a unique key, and either my system or my resellers would translate keys upon requests. This way I could understand who is using my API resources, and enjoy deeper demographics around API sales.</li>
<li><strong>User Profile Not Required - </strong>Maybe, as a whole provider I don't care about understanding who uses my API at this granular level, I just want to sell, sell, sell. This way I could provide a much more simplified process that would just require resellers to sign up for a single API key, and all API requests are tracked under this single provider key. Resellers would manage their own user keys, and just hardcode all requests to my API with their wholesale key via their proxy.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could understand both of these implementations. Some wholesale providers are going to be obsessed with understanding who is using their API, and require their resellers to be transparent and share their API developer profile data. While I personally think this is overkill, and it would be much simpler to just use a single wholesale key for each reseller--I will assume that most wholesale API providers will go this route.</p>
<p>Next steps for this concept is to actually make it work for real. I have the screenshot API as well as some other similar, utility style APIs, that I wil use as my test cases. I use <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> for my API management, so I have <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/activedocs">APIs for almost all aspects of my API management</a>. I just need to proxy them on my end, and potentially offer up to my prospective API resellers, giving them access to usage, rate limits and user management.</p>
<p>Right now this is just an idea, an academic exercise, but I see no reason this can't be reality and just like other goods and services in the real-world, companies could sell wholesale version of the API resources, further fueling the growth of the API economy.  After making this scenario a little more real, I want to think through what this would look like in an on-premise scenario&mdash;no proxy involved.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-classroom.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I recently talked with the AT&amp;T API team about their recent Sabre partnership, which I thought was a pretty interesting <a title="approach to evolving your API strategy, by leveraging your partners" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/24/work-with-your-partners-to-iterate-on-your-apis/">approach to evolving your API strategy, by leveraging your partners</a>.  As we discussed the overall AT&amp;T API strategy and their approach to partnering, we also discussed the evolution to their hackathon strategy and how they've added workshops to their event toolbox.</p>
<p>While AT&amp;T is very much committed to having hackathons, they didn't always deliver the understanding and feedback around their APIs that they were looking for and decided to develop a workshop format around their developer programs. A workshop is about sitting a group of developers down in a room, provide them with workbooks and other structured content, as well as more direct engagement with the AT&amp;T API team.</p>
<p>I recently spoke with Brian Koles (<a href="https://twitter.com/BrianKoles">@BrianKoles</a>) from <a title="ChallengePost" href="http://challengepost.com/">ChallengePost</a> on the subject, and he says it is what their developer challenge platform company is also witnessing occur in the space. A majority of companies that approach them to do hackathons, in reality don't get what they desire from the more open hackathon format. These companies are looking for a safer, more controlled environment, where they can educate developers about their APIs, and receive quality feedback and measurable results around their API programs.</p>
<p>While a workshop may not be as attractive as the exciting and more intensive hackathon format, it is something that can deliver more meaningful results to your company, as well as reach an audience that probably isn't that interested in spending their weekends, staying up all night, building apps they won't use&mdash;they just want to learn more about your API, and understand how it can solve real-world problems, in their everyday lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.thenounproject.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/noun-project-jetpack.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> recently&nbsp;<a href="http://thenounproject.tumblr.com/post/69623674070/launched-the-new-noun-project">launched their API</a>, and after getting off the phone just now with a publication, I looked to see if I had written it up&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t. I had a lot of thoughts in an Evernote, but I had not really shared my thoughts on why I think The Noun Project API is significant.</p>
<p>If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, I use <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a lot</span> across the API Evangelist Network. Not all of my images are directly from The Noun Project, but they reflect they same general approach. I use The Noun Project for two main reasons:</p>
<ol style="padding-left: 25px;">
<li><strong>On-boarding Users With Abstract Concepts</strong> - It can be hard to convey the often abstract concepts around APIs, and a single, concise image really goes a long way in bringing a user quickly up to speed with what I&rsquo;m talking about.</li>
<li><strong>Simple &amp; Minimalist</strong> - The Noun Project images just look good with the overall API Evangelist look and feel. I don&rsquo;t think this stops with just my website, I think a simple, minimalist image goes a long way in blending in with any site, without cluttering the overall look.</li>
</ol>
<p>When publishing content online, whether its blogging or publishing a list of local events, it can be difficult to capture and keep the attention of your audience. A simple, concise image can go a long way to help convey the meaning of a blog post, event listing, or other content, and on-board users with what you are dishing up, and this is where The Noun Project comes in.</p>
<p>The Noun Project gives you an API to search, pull and manage simple image representations for a person, place, thing, animal or idea. I use a single Noun Project image to accompany each blog post, as well as other elements of my work such as <a title="API building blocks" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API building blocks</a>, and tools. The API allows me to integrate images in this way, seamlessly within my content management system.</p>
<p>While I use the Noun Project API to pull meaningful images to accompany my content, there are unlimited uses for the image API, allowing developers to weave the images into their own sites and applications, and potentially extend the images to the end-users of their applications, to accompany their own user generated content.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of image APIs currently available, but <a href="http://api.thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project API</a> is significant because it providers developers with a very focused, meaningful, but powerful way to represent a person, place, thing, animal or ideas in their sites and applications.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://cashtie.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/cashtie/cashtie-mobile-barcode.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with a very interesting new API offering from the retail focused <a href="http://www.incomm.com/">InComm</a>, dubbed the <a href="https://cashtie.com/">Cashtie API</a>. Over the last two decades InComm has worked hard to build relationships with major retailers, resulting in a very hard to establish presence at the cash register of major retailers like Walmart, Target and CVS.</p>
<p>InComm&rsquo;s new Cashtie API opens up access to retailers point of sale (POS) systems, allowing any approved developer to sell online goods to consumers at these high value retail locations&mdash;opening up the possibility for web and mobile applications to accept cash payments for virtual goods, services and utilities at top retailers.</p>
<p>InComm is the company behind gift card activation solutions for all those major gift cards you see everywhere, and digital barcode solutions that we are getting familiar with when purchasing physical goods like a coffee at Starbucks, but the Cashtie is pushing commerce into an entirely new realm.  These earlier solutions are about buying physical goods with virtual gift cards and online accounts, where the Cashtie API is about allowing buy digital goods at retail locations with cash.</p>
<p>The immediate use of cash for purchasing virtual goods can be applied to the hottest virtual products like online movies, music and gaming. Think of the possibilities for impulse buys at the cash register of Walmart and Target, when you aren&rsquo;t limited to the physical items that surround the cash register, but expanded into an unlimited world of digital goods and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://cashtie.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/cashtie/cashtie-billpay.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Opening up cash payments for digital goods to all retail consumers is interesting, but the application that really gets me interested, is delivering applications to what is considered as the unbanked, and underbanked across the nation.  According to the FDIC, 8.2 percent of US households are unbanked, representing 10 million in total, as well as 20.1 percent of US households are underbanked, which represents 24 million consumers&mdash;this is a pretty significant audience to reach with online goods and services.</p>
<p>The Cashtie API opens up an interesting new world of paying cash for digital goods, but also can be easily applied to paying our regular and one-time bills with cash. Currently bill pay with cash at retail locations is a pretty time consuming process, but Cashtie makes it as simple as scanning a barcode on physical utility bills or on your smartphone via a digital barcode. No more going to the information counter at the grocery store, bills can be paid alongside everyday purchases at the regular checkout line in a variety of retail locations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by the potential of the Cashtie API. Those of us who live and breathe the online world may think the world revolves around us, but a significant part of world still operates on a cash-only basis. The Cashtie API bridges these two worlds, allowing cash to buy virtual goods, augmenting our existing ability of buying physical goods with virtual currency.</p>
<p>I will be working with InComm to developer their API strategy, and hoping to tell the stories that come out of this interesting new ecosystem. I&rsquo;m pretty picky about who I work with at API Evangelist, and while there will be uses of the <a href="https://cashtie.com/">Cashtie API</a> that won't capture my attention, I predict there will be some very meaningful uses that deliver value to a very underserved segment of our society.</p>

<p>Amazon has an interesting <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/post/Tx3VAMG90LQR7DF/Amazon-Instant-Access-Sell-Digital-Items-for-Your-PC-Mac-or-Web-Based-Applicatio.html">new service called Instant Access</a>, which follows a trend I&rsquo;m seeing in commerce, that allows the sales of digital goods, not just in-app like <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/in-app-purchasing">Amazon&rsquo;s In-App Purchasing</a> does, but let&rsquo;s you sell your digital wares on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>This new service allows you to list and sell your digital goods on Amazon.com, just like the physical goods you normally associate with Amazon. This opens up your digital products to the heavy traffic of Amazon.com, as well as the other perks like discoverability, reviews, and the payment systems that the Amazon platform enables.</p>
<p>Amazon Instant Access connects customer&rsquo;s profiles with your application profiles, and triggers digital products sales in your system, using your API. To do this, you provide Instant Access with API endpoints for triggering profile creation or linkage, and for initiating digital product sales that are coming from Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Now you can generate new sales, as well as allow your existing customers to use Amazon.com for searching, browsing and purchasing your digital products&mdash;changing the dynamics of virtual commerce. This opens up another reason for you to have APIs for your customers, as well as for your physical and virtual products. If you don&rsquo;t have APIs, you will be limited to attracting customers and sale of your products via your website and applications.</p>
<p>If you do have APIs for your customer profiles, and physical and virtual products and services, you can open up the sale of your products via 3rd party platforms, including commerce giants like Amazon.com.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done 3 stories over the last week about the Panoptix API from Johnson Controls (JCI). I try to regularly check in with the <span>John Bernd (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jkbernd">@jkbernd</a><span>) and Simone Vigano (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/viganosimone">@viganosimone</a><span>)&nbsp;</span> of the <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix-developer-center">Panoptix API</a> team, and see what they are up to in the world of building efficiency APIs.</p>
<p>What make this possible is their willingness to share stories, trust in me that I&rsquo;m going to tell these stories in the best possible light, but also no fear of what people think of their approach. John and Simone share my humble view, that we are all just figuring this shit out as we go along. Of course it is based upon experience, and both sensible strategical and tactical execution, but in the grand scheme of things, there is no single master plan for success.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised at the number of people who call me, share stories about their internal API operations, then conclude the conversation by telling me that I can&rsquo;t tell publicly for fear of what the public will think, or fear of upsetting folks within their own company. Sometimes I tell the stories with names and identifying elements scrubbed, but often I just add to my wealth of knowledge of move on.</p>
<p>Teaching individuals and companies how to tell stories and open up, and be more transparent, is the number one benefit of APIs in my opinion. All the business benefits in new revenue streams, efficiency, agility, innovation and all the other reasons I often cite are secondary to helping companies learn to open up.</p>
<p>What is your company&rsquo;s stance on storytelling, and sharing both the good and bad of your API operations?</p>

<p>One of the areas I track on is what I call the <a title="API reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">API reciprocity space</a>, which is all about interoperability between platforms, but I label it reciprocity as an attempt to capture that it isn&rsquo;t just about old school <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</a> of the old days&mdash;today it is about ETL in the cloud, plus adhering to the intent of not just platforms, but the users interest as well.</p>
<p>When thinking of API reciprocity, think <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://temboo.com/">Temboo</a>. I&rsquo;ve been watching Temboo evolve with their API driven, platform to platform solutions, but I&rsquo;m really interested in there latest moves to support web platforms to the Internet of Things using the Arduino platform, specifically using the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun?from=Main.ArduinoYUN">Arduino Y&uacute;n micro controller board</a>.</p>
<p>Temboo has been working hard recently to <a href="https://www.temboo.com/arduino">connect the Arduino Y&uacute;n to over 100 web-based resources and services</a> like Facebook, Twitter and Dropbox.  The Arduino Y&uacute;n gives you connectivity to lights, motion, sound, temperature and other sensor based devices, and Temboo provides the connectivity between these sensors to the numerous API driven resources in the cloud.</p>
<p>Taking it to the next level, <a href="https://temboo.com/library/Library/devices/">Temboo has released Sketch Builder</a>, an application that allows anyone to design interactions between Arduino Y&uacute;n and Temboo enabled cloud services. This opens up this type of Internet of Things to web service interaction design, development and deployment to anyone, not just developers.</p>
<p>APIs are moving forward at a very rapid pace, and as we move from the mobile era of APIs into the Internet of Things phase of APIs, the pace is going to quicken. APIs aren't just about social, cloud and mobile anymore&mdash;innovators like Temboo at bridging all of the APIs driven platforms we depend on, to our physical world via sensors.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoons are great for closing out tabs I&rsquo;ve had open all week, and the theme this Saturday is APIs and the Internet of Things. This time it is about <a href="http://community.thingspeak.com/2014/01/introducing-talkback-the-new-internet-of-things-app-to-control-things-with-the-thingspeak-cloud/">controlling your Internet of Things using voice the Thingspeak Talkback API</a> and the Arduino Y&uacute;n, which seems to be the darling of API to Internet of Things projects.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thingspeak.com/docs/talkback">Thingspeak Talkback API</a> allows for the adding, updating, deleting and executing of voice commands. It acts as a middleware for the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun?from=Main.ArduinoYUN">Arduino Y&uacute;n</a>, allowing IoT devices to to be able to check for commands that need executing&mdash;providing an API driven queue of voice commands for all of the Internet connected devices in your life.</p>
<p>As the cost of connecting everyday objects to the Internet gets easier and cheaper, it is fascinating to see the different approaches that providers take to connect these objects to the web. Thingspeak is choosing to go the voice route, where Temboo is betting on the fact that people want to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/25/interoperability-between-web-and-internet-of-things-opening-up-to-nondevelopers/">connect IoT devices with their existing cloud platforms and services</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.att.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/att-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I received a press release from AT&amp;T last week, about a <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=25205&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=37388&amp;mapcode=consumer%7Cmk-att-business-customer-">new partnership with Sabre to develop what is called location information services (LIS)</a>. Ben Kepes has a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2014/01/22/att-and-sabre-join-up-to-stalk-travellers-in-a-nice-way/">good summary of the partnership over at Forbes</a>, so I won't add my own analysis of what the partnership means. After speaking with the AT&amp;T team today, and I&rsquo;d prefer to focus on the importance of partnerships when developing your own APIs--sharing AT&amp;T's wisdom with my audience</p>
<p>When listening to Laura Merling and Chris Aron of AT&amp;T talk about the Sabre partnership, I couldn't help but think about the importance of working with trusted partners, in developing your valuable API resources. In the open API world, many companies open themselves up to iterating on API resources with a large group of public developers, a process that can make your API strategy feel very schizophrenic&mdash;in contrast making designing, developing and iterating on API design in closed environment with trusted partners much more, well sane.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information Services With Transportation and Travel Partners</strong><br /> The location information services that AT&amp;T is partnering with Sabre on, began as a set of location services they first worked with AAA on to help them locate drivers in need of roadside assistance. Now AT&amp;T is working with Sabre to evolve these same location APIs and expand not just to new business sectors like travel or retail, but improve accuracy of a mobile user's location by not just using a cell signal, but also wifi and bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Identity Toolkit With Banking and Financial Partners</strong><br /> In addition to location APIs, AT&amp;T recently developed a <a href="http://developer.att.com/apis/mobile-identity-toolkit">mobile identity toolkit</a> and what better way to help define the most valuable toolkit possible, then to work with banking and financial partners to design and deploy a toolkit that reflect exactly what they need.  The result is a set of API fueled services that makes apps more secure, and reduces fraud via mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored Data With Multiple Partners</strong><br /> Beyond location and identity, AT&amp;T has also been working on the APIs that drive their new <a href="http://www.att.com/att/sponsoreddata/en/index.html">sponsored data initiative</a>. This new program is much more sensitive than other API resources, as it directly touches AT&amp;T user's bills, and required working with trusted partners to define a set of services that worked properly. AT&amp;T worked with existing partners in defining everything from how the APIs will work to how these sponsored data services would end up looking on AT&amp;T customers bills.</p>
<p>These are three examples of how AT&amp;T is leveraging partners to plan, design, develop and evolve their catalog of API resources. While AT&amp;T has their <a href="http://developer.att.com/apis">open developer ecosystem</a>, a partner centric approach keeps things on track, by defining APIs that have proven needs, via existing partners, and represent expanding on existing revenue streams.</p>
<p>As with the rest of us in the space, AT&amp;T is working to figure out the best path forward with APIs. Their approach to leveraging their partner ecosystem to provide fuel for their API initiatives is something we can all learn from. I&rsquo;m not saying stop evolving your public APIs out in the open, but for newer, or possibly higher value API resources, you may want to consider kicking things off with your trusted partners.</p>

<p>Some of the best stories I hear as the API Evangelist, are the internal success stories around API efforts. Everyone wants to be the next Twilio success story with their API, but in reality the API use cases that will make the biggest impact, will be the ones within your own organization.</p>
<p>In my story queue I have two stories coming from very different API efforts, but they both have a similar theme regarding APIs starting conversation internally&mdash;something that couldn&rsquo;t have occurred, if they didn&rsquo;t already have APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Johnson Controls (JCI) / Panoptix</strong><br /> While talking with the <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix team</a> last week, they told me about making the rounds within JCI to talk APIs and strategy with other groups, and how they were surprised to learn that another group within JCI not only had heard of the Panoptix API, they had already integrated with it. Apparently the separate group caught wind of what Panoptix was up to and because the API was self service, they registered, began playing with, and found a use for the resources, and integrated into their own operations. A great story of not just internal API usage, but of self-service APIs, and how API can change things within an organization without you even knowing.</p>
<p><strong>City of Philadelphia</strong><br /> I had the pleasure of drinking a beer with head data guy, Mark Headd (<a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd">@mheadd</a>), for <a href="http://phlapi.com/">City of Philadelphia</a> last night. As we exchanged war stories he mentioned a city agency that he went to visit to discuss their data resources, and how the conversation had quickly shifted to discussing other available city API resources, that they could put to use in their own operations. While working in the federal government this is one area I see APIs having the biggest impact--inter-agency API usage. In Philly, Marks role is to go around and assess the open data resources of each group, and the potential for deploying APIs, but quickly he is finding that making agencies aware of other agency&rsquo;s API assets is extremely critical to making things work. Internal API evangelism isn&rsquo;t just about getting people on board with deploying APIs, it is also about getting internal groups on board with consuming each others APIs.</p>
<p>These are just two short stories that show the power of APIs, and how they can impact your organization internally. These conversations would never have happened if JCI and City of Philadelphia weren&rsquo;t already deploying APIs. You can&rsquo;t kickstart this type of innovation with just talk of APIs, you need to have APIs up and running, working in a self-service way, and then you&rsquo;ll start seeing change in this way.</p>
<p>My number one post of all time on API Evangelist, doing at least 2K page views a month, even after two years, is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret to Amazons Success Internal APIs</a>, which talks of Amazon&rsquo;s own success with the internal usage of APIs. The external usage and effects of APIs is what attracts many businesses and organizations to the world of APIs, but it will be internal usage and effects that makes them stay for a while.</p>

<p>According to Keir Clark over at <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/">Google Maps Mania</a>, we are seeing <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-slow-death-of-google-maps-api.html">The Slow Death of the Google Maps API</a>. Who else could read the tea leaves, when it comes to an API, than a blogger who is dedicated to covering the innovation that comes out of a single API ecosystem.</p>
<p>Clark has noticed that "there seems little sign of the Google Maps API team returning from their two year vacation&rdquo;, and "at the same time the MapBox team has continued to innovate and has now become the maps API of choice for most developers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While nobody knows the reasons Google Maps has stopped innovating (except Google), it is clear that you can&rsquo;t stop delivering value to developers, or they will migrate elsewhere to find the API resources they need for their applications&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are Google, or any other tech giant.</p>
<p>Mapping darling <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>, and open source JavaScript library <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> has seemed to captured the attention of developers by delivering simple, open solutions&mdash;while also continuing to iterate and deliver features that keep up with the needs of developers.</p>
<p>The Google Maps API is one of the API pioneers listed on my <a title="history of APIs" href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">History of APIs</a>, but much like Delicious, maybe the age of Google Maps is coming to a close. I&rsquo;m sure many mainstream websites and applications will use Google by default because of the advertising and SEO opportunities, but for developers who care about providing beautiful, seamlessly blended maps that add value to their websites and apps, I think Google Maps just isn&rsquo;t going to do it anymore.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">The Evolving Motivations Behind API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-evolving.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time diving into the evolving world of API design over the next couple of weeks. There is a rapidly emerging community of companies, tooling and approaches to designing and developing APIs, that is centered around API definition languages.</p>
<p>Languages for defining web services have been around for a while, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, which was born out of the SOAP WSDL era, representing very technical approach to describing this new world of web APIs. While WADL is still in use, it hasn&rsquo;t seen the adoption many envisioned.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until recently that we&rsquo;ve seen new approaches emerge, and get traction, with JSON based API definitions like <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> from <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, and <a href="http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs">I/O Docs</a> from <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>. The primary motivation behind defining your API using Swagger or I/O Docs has historicaly been to deploy interactive documentation for developers, with discovery, client-side code generation, server-side code generation and other tooling as secondary motivator, if at all.</p>
<p>In the last year we&rsquo;ve also seen even newer approaches to designing and defining APIs emerge, with the introduction of markdown based API definitions like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> from <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a> from <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a>. This new markdown approach is&nbsp;providing languages for describing and defining APIs that holds the promise of even being accessible to non-developers.</p>
<p>I have time scheduled to talk with each of the providers listed above in the coming weeks, but after a talk with the API Blueprint team from Apiary, I&rsquo;m reminded of how the motivations for API definitions is continuing its rapid expansion. When you are motivated to use API definitions for just generating API documentation, you miss so much opportunity for communicating, collaborating and iterating during the planning and design of your API.</p>
<p>API Blueprint was born out of Apiary, so it is rooted in the desire to design and mockup APIs, all while collaborating with other key players and the actual consumers of the API. If you wait to generate an API definition when you reach the point where you are ready for documentation, you are throwing away valuable design time, and burning costly development hours. Apiary needed a way to articulate, share and communicate around the design of an API from start to finish, pushing the motivation for developers to generate an API definition, from producing interactive docs, to devliering on the entire API planning, design, development, deployment and management lifecycle.</p>
<p>We need these new languages to describe and communicate around APIs. Without them we can&rsquo;t mockup, iterate and collaborate to find the best possible API design. Without these new languages we can&rsquo;t quantify APIs to key business, marketing, and sales players, as well as the lawyers, providing a contract for not just machine to machine interaction, but B2B and B2C. Without these new languages we can&rsquo;t generate standardized tooling and API deployments based upon the best API patterns available today.</p>
<p>I think that the fact that there are now 4 major API design approaches, represents not just an evolution in the motivation for developers to use common definitions for APIs, but also a shift that will make API design accessible to everyone, motivating even non-developers to communicate and interact with APIs, in a simple, but powerful way that can align IT and development, with overall business goals.</p>

<p>It appears that DOE is looking to develop open source software that state and local governments can use to manage energy efficiency across their buildings.</p>
<p>I like the approach to develop an open source, API driven platform that can set the tone for how data can be collected, managed, and shared. I think this is a great way to lead in an industry, and bring together not just government entities but other private sector players.</p>
<p>SEED is something I&rsquo;d love to see work, and an API design I&rsquo;d love to see in the <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. If you are part of the SEED project, I&rsquo;d love to talk more. I pinged the email on the site, but haven&rsquo;t heard anything.</p>
<p>Good stuff coming out of DOE lately.</p>

<p>I was playing with the <a href="http://api.thenounproject.com/">Noun Project API</a> today. If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, I use the <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a> throughout the API Evangelist network. The simple, black and white icons work very well with my minimalistic look, and help me convey some very abstract API concepts.</p>
<p>As I was reviewing the Noun Project API, looking at what resources are available via their API endpoints, I noticed a /usage endpoint,  which lets you understand your API usage, as well as the rate limits for your API access level. This isn&rsquo;t revolutionary, its something I've seen on other APIs, but it is an important resource I think many API owners overlook.</p>
<p>Providing an API usage endpoint by default for all APIs makes sense. Developers can either build into their apps, or just setup some sort of daily job, that alerts them when they are approaching API rate limits. Much like push notifications on your bank account or other online resources, a usage API will go a long way in helping developers quantify and understand what resources they have available to them, as well as what they consume on regular basis.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a title="Evercam.io" href="http://www.evercam.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/evercam/evercam-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I look at a lot of APIs--some are crap, some make sense, a few are interesting, and every great once in a while you see an API that you know will be one of the next big API platforms.  I&rsquo;m reviewing one such API, <a title="Evercam.io" href="http://www.evercam.io/" target="_blank">Evercam.io</a>.</p>
<p>I know that Evercam.io will be be big, because it bridges an increasingly ubiquitous technology&mdash;the camera. Whether its its for home or commercial usage, Internet connected cameras represents low hanging fruit for applying proven API techniques.</p>
<p>Evercam.io was born out of experience working at a <a href="https://cloud.camba.tv/">cloud CCTV company</a>, where the Evercam team realized the opportunity was about becoming a developer platform that enabled any developer to interact with potentially hundreds of types of cameras, while also applying modern API techniques to the world of security and webcams.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cameras + Oauth 2.0 + API + App Store = Evercam.io</strong></p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong><br />When it comes to video, the obvious API usage involve storage of the video, still photos, audio, and logs generated by a video camera. The cloud opens the ability to scale storage to match whatever needs the camera owner may have. Video potentially can be disk heavy, something that is perfectly suited for the cloud, as long as someone is willing to pay for the storage.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-surveillance-camera.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong><br />Cameras are just one node, in this fast growing world of Internet connected devices that you may find at home or in the business. The ability to sync up cameras and still photos with point of sale (POS) activity, sensors or even other cloud applications is significant. Zapier and IFTTT like actions or seamless reporting and analytics across systems will open up with API deployent.</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong><br /> Evercam.io introduces events as a layer between the camera and users, allowing developers to define custom or scheduled events based upon what happens in a video. Examples include sending of MMS when camera receives SMS from owner, take picture of storefront or dining area each hour or during peak hours.  Video is all about a sequence of events, and adding an API layer allows for an unlimited amount of slicing and dicing and custom defined of events that are meaningful to camera owners.</p>
<p><strong>Logging</strong><br />One of the significant benefits of API layers between camera and their access layers is the ability to log operations. Camera availability, access logs, events, actions and basically any interaction with a camera potentially can be logged. When used for security, this API layer expands on the existing definition of what a security camera is used for.</p>
<p><strong>Marketplace</strong><br />Any successful platform needs a marketplace, where developers can showcase the applications they've engineered on top of the platform, and even generate revenue through application sales and add-ons. Evercam.io has a marketplace out of the gate, modeled after the Chrome Web Store and Force.com, which charges developer s30% of revenue generated via the apps they publish to the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong> <br />Deployment of an API for one or many cameras, provides a single point of security for all devices. This is only as good or bad as Evercam.io&rsquo;s platform security, which only time will tell how solid it is. This one element will make or break platforms like Evercam, and is the area that will keep me up at night when thinking about API driven cameras.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.evercam.io/2014/01/weighbridge-integration-using-evercamio.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/evercam/evercam-weigh-docket-camba-integration.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Ok, now I&rsquo;ve laid out some of what I feel will be key things that make Evercam.io significant. I think Evercam.io will be big because it represents a fairly obvious target for applying APIs, and the deployment of cameras, as well as the use of video is only going to grow--exponentially.  I don&rsquo;t just think that Evercam.io will be big because of the technological and business opportunities, I think it will be huge because of the political implications.</p>
<p>Our homes and automobiles will be increasingly wired with cameras, businesses will be operated, managed and secured through cameras, and governments will increasingly monitor citizens via Internet connected video devices. Camera APIs will be one of the most influential, yet silent players in our personal and professional lives, from here on forward&mdash;there is no escaping it.</p>
<p>Honestly all of this has me worried, but I&rsquo;ve done my due diligence on the Evercam.io team, and feel like there isn&rsquo;t a better crew I&rsquo;d like to see help lead in this potentially frightening new world of Internet connected cameras. I try to help lead the API space by shining the light on some of the positive in the space, while calling out potentially negative practices. I think the Evercam.io team reflects these values, and I&rsquo;m interested in seeing more of how they handle it in this potentially volatile aspect of our online world.</p>
<p>It can be easy to freak out over some of the potentials for exploitation via a platform like Evercam.io, but after reading their business plan, and looking through their site, you see examples like the&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.evercam.io/2014/01/weighbridge-integration-using-evercamio.html">agricultural scale that uses a camera and the Evercam.io API to take pictures of grain deliveries</a>, providing the pictures as part of the grain sale process. These are every day uses that will have significant implications on the economy and become regular part of business operations.</p>
<p>After spending some time researching Evercam.io, and thinking about the world of Internet connected cameras, I&rsquo;m intrigued. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing what solutions get developed on the platform, how security is handled, and what issues arise in different scenarios when you connect cameras to the Internet, apply APIs and start building applications and logging tools that operate in this new API defined space.</p>
<p>I predict the Evercam.io ecosystem will grow rapidly, and be an interesting, and potentially scary place to watch our world be connected to the Internet via billions of tiny cameras, that track on every aspect of our personal, business and increasingly very public lives.</p>

<p>Right now when it comes to API discovery you have the OG <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, and newcomers <a href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> and <a href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> (which also owns ProgrammableWeb). All three of these sites provide you with a large directory of APIs you can search and browse at, when looking for APIs.</p>
<p>I pull new APIs from all these sources, in hopes of staying in tune with what is out there. However, I have a different approach to my API database of APIs. I only keep track of the best APIs I see. I'm not concerned with every API available, I&rsquo;m interested in the best approaches to APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping in 2014 that we'll see more niche API hubs emerge, that specialize in specific areas like government, finance, photos, video and other specific areas that developers would be specifically interested in--allowing domain experts to step in and help guide us.</p>
<p>When looking at the big picture it can be hard to see the gaps and opportunities. If you specialize in a particular area, you really get to know what resources people are offering, how they are serving these resources up, and potentially what is missing fro the consumer perspective.</p>
<p>This doesn't have to be exclusive from the existing efforts, Mashape and APIHub could provide more curation tools for domain experts to use in organizing, deploying and management of these hubs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a thought...</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2014</span>

<p>When I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/17/making-an-impact-on-environment-with-building-management-apis/">last talked with the Panoptix API team over at Johnson Controls (JCI)</a>, they were working hard on new features, including the possibility of writing data to the <a title="building efficiency APIs" href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">building efficiency API(s)</a>.</p>
<p>A year later, I wanted to see where the team was at with their API efforts and was intrigued to learn that their work to make their API writable hadn&rsquo;t gone exactly as they had planned.</p>
<p>On the surface it sounds like an easy task. You can pull data from an API, now using POST, PUT and DELETE you should be able to write data back into the system. Easier said than done, says <span>John Bernd (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jkbernd">@jkbernd</a><span>) and Simone Vigano (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/viganosimone">@viganosimone</a><span>)&nbsp;</span> of the Panoptix API team.</p>
<p>First you have all the technical issues around data storage, indexing, accessibility and the usual problems you face with managing lots of data. Working with known data from their own systems and devices is one thing, but opening it up to wider audience takes some extra work.</p>
<p>Second you have to think about the legal issues. Who&rsquo;s data is it? Do they have the right to publish it. What are the legal responsibility of JCI and Panoptix? Once you open up a system for publishing of data, you open yourself up to a whole new world of legal headaches.</p>
<p>Once you allow write capabilities for Panoptix API users, whats next? What features are needed. How much will all this cost to develop, manage and evolve? Opening up a lot of business questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big proponent of APIs being not just read, but also write. I rail on city, state and federal governments, stating this is one of the biggest problems with government APIs--the lack of writeable APis. However I understand it is not as easy as it seems, and agree with the Panoptix team, that it is something you have to think through all the pros and cons. Then take your time, build a proper strategy, and do it right.</p>

<p>Just exactly what an API is, is always up for debate. APIs have been around since before the Internet. API Evangelist focuses in on what I call web APIs, that were built using the same technology as websites, and were made even popular for delivering valuable data and resources to mobile phones. While there are device APIs on phones, that give you access to resources like the camera or microphone, web APIs are the choice of developers when it comes to delivering popular cloud based resources like friends, photos and video to mobile apps.</p>
<p>Web APIs, are using the Internet to deliver common resources that websites, web and mobile apps need to operate. With the dominance of mobile devices, and the emergence of the Internet of things, we are now seeing APIs that move beyond just this general approach, and focusing on delivering resources tailored to specific devices, or device groups.</p>
<p>As I do with everything, I&rsquo;m just shedding more light on what is already happening out there. Daniel Jacobson of Netflix has been talking about <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/15/why-rest-keeps-me-up-at-night/">Why REST Keeps Me Up At Night</a>, and how Netflix is catering to hundreds of devices for some time now.</p>
<p>So, getting to my point, I was reading two separate articles about new Google APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.webpronews.com/google-details-google-drive-android-api-2014-01" target="_blank">Google Details Google Drive Android API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2014/01/16/google-working-on-fitness-api-for-android/" target="_blank">Google Working on Fitness API for Android</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In both of these new APIs, Google is developing APIs that cater specifically to Android devices. Google has radically different motivations for delivering device based APIs than Netflix, but I think their focus on the device is still a relevant aspect of this trend in API design. General purpose APIs are common, but is Daniel right about where we are going with APIs?</p>
<p>Will we continue to see APIs tailored for specific devices? What will happen with the Internet of Things? Will there be APIs that are tailored for home automation devices or just our cars? There are a lot of important API design questions to be asked in 2014. I&rsquo;ll keep my eye out for some of the answers as I track on the world of APIs.</p>

<p>I was doing some research on a video camera API platform that I'm keeping an eye on, and <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2014/01/17/google-nest-and-the-3-2-billion-api/">Google, Nest and the $3.2 Billion API</a> by Roberto Medrano of SOA Software popped up in my curation system.  The <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a>&nbsp;is currently the best known example of APIs being placed in between us, and everyday objects in our lives. The enhanced objects, and the applications that emerge are the obvious value, that end users see, however as Robert says:</p>
<blockquote><em>These decisions will be strategic business and financial ones, but they will all be enabled by the use of APIs. Without the API involved, the work required to connect products such as Google and Nest would be too complicated or costly.</em></blockquote>
<p>When I think about devices like the Nest, in our homes, the obsessive compulsive geek in me gets excited for the potential of such a platform. However after I apply a little critical thought, I get very concerned. Then I immerse myself back into what is possible when cameras have APIs, security camera, street cameras, webcams&mdash;all have APIs. Then I get very, very concerned.</p>
<p>After this roller coast I come back to a balanced view, that smoke alarms, thermostats and cameras equipped with APIs are neither good, bad or neutral. That cat is out of the bag, and we have this technology. It isn&rsquo;t going away. We might as well enjoy the positive, but we also need to keep an extremely close eye on how things are being deployed and managed behind the scenes.</p>
<p>There is a lot of room for logging as part of the regulatory process, democratizing access of resources, and generally injecting transparency into how things work with these Internet enabled, API driven &ldquo;things&rdquo;. However there is also a whole lot of room for exploitation, surveillance and hijacking of data via these Internet enabled, API driven &ldquo;things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t freeze up with fear or lash out against this coming wave of Internet enabled things, we have to keep a level head, ask hard questions and make sure there is a healthy balance in all of the API driven, Internet enabled nodes where hardware manufacturers, platform providers, developers and user&rsquo;s best interests are kept in mind.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a title="building efficiency API" href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/panoptix/johnson-control-panoptix.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just had a great conversion with John Bernd (<a href="https://twitter.com/jkbernd">@jkbernd</a>) and Simone Vigano (<a href="https://twitter.com/viganosimone">@viganosimone</a>) of <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/">Johnson Controls (JCI)</a>, who lead efforts  at the building efficiency API, <a title="building efficiency API" href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix</a>.  They shared several great stories with me, I&rsquo;ll trickle out over the next week, with the first one about internal evangelism.</p>
<p><a title="Internal evangelism, whether your API is public or private, is something I&rsquo;ve advocated for pretty heavily over the last few years" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/29/api-evangelism-is-equal-parts-internal-partner-and-public-outreach/">Internal evangelism, whether your API is public or private, is something I&rsquo;ve advocated for pretty heavily over the last few years</a>. Lack of internal evangelism around an API can be the number on reason you get your API defunded within any size organization. Basically if the rest of the company, included your bosses , don&rsquo;t know about your API and the success you&rsquo;ve had, your done. So tell stories about your API.</p>
<p>This particular story out of JCI is particularly interesting because it isn&rsquo;t just about evangelizing your API, its evangelizing your approach to delivering your API. Over the last couple years of the Panoptix API, John and Simone have done a great job evangelizing the Panoptix API internally (separate story coming soon), but somehow in the hustle they forgot to package up and sell their approach to delivering the Panoptix API, so other groups within JCI can learn about and put the API approach to use for their own needs.</p>
<p>Panoptix realized they need to document their own approach to designing, developing, deploying and managing the Panoptix API, create a case study that they can then evangelize within JCI. The benefits of separating data and resources, establishing self-service APIs, establishing meaningful metrics combined with analytics, and the overall health brought by an API centric approach, was something that every group within JCI needs to understand.  <a href="http://www.3scale.net/tag/panoptix/">Panoptix uses 3Scale API infrastructure</a>, and has been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/17/making-an-impact-on-environment-with-building-management-apis/">reading API Evangelist for a couple years</a>, resulting in their own unique approach to API delivery, you can experience within the <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix developer community</a>.</p>
<p>Hearing John and Simone talk through their realization, made me see another layer to internal API evangelism. You shouldn&rsquo;t just have a coherent API design, deployment, management and evangelism strategy so that you can execute on it, you should have one so that you can clearly articulate it to the rest of your company and help onboard them with your API centric approach to getting things done.</p>

<p>REST head Glenn Block (<a href="https://twitter.com/gblock">@gblock</a>) over at <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a> asked a simple question on Twitter Wednesday night, Who is using Swagger? I responded, kicking off a conversation that a day later included Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) of <a href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>, Uri Sarid (<a href="https://twitter.com/usarid">@usarid</a>) of <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, and Jakub Nesetril (<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) of <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>.</p>
<p>After the fact, the conversation may be a little unwieldy to follow, but it contains enough insight and nuggets of information, I feel its worth publishing and hopefully continuing in other formats.</p>

One feature I noticed when playing with my account settings, was the ability to set the default licensing for my "things".</p>
<p>Interestingly this is a feature you don't see in many SaaS apps, let alone as part of API developer settings. I remember first seeing this in my Flickr account settings, and is something I wish I&rsquo;d see it in every platform I use (keep dream'n buddy).</p>

<p>When it comes to user generated content via APIs, this licensing is kind of a big deal. It decides as a user and developer, who ultimately owns the exhaust from your work or just from your daily online world.</p>
<p>I'll be including licensing considerations in the future discussions around the politics of APIs. A setting to determine how user generated content is licensed should not just be a setting in your application account settings, but baked into API developer account settings as well.</p>

<p>I started API Evangelist in 2010 to help business leaders better understand not just the technical, but specifically the business of APIs, helping them be successful in their own API efforts. As part of these efforts I track on what I consider the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of API management</a>. In 2014 I'm also researching what the building blocks are in other areas of the API world, including API <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">deployment</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">discovery</a> and <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">integration</a>.</p>
<p>After taking a quick glance at the fast growing world of API integration tools and services, I've found the following building blocks emerging:</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/api-design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending the next couple weeks going through each of the leading API design approaches: API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger.  Even though I still personally use Swagger in my own work, I&rsquo;m pushing myself to learn API Blueprint and RAML to better understand the landscape, as well as the pros and cons of each approach.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with this emerging trends in API design, they are approaches to defining your APIs either using JSON or a markdown language, which allows you to quantify and describe the API interfaces and underlying data models in a way that allows you to communicate with others, generate mock or production APIs, interactive documentation, code samples and potentially other tooling that will help you be successful in your API initiatives.</p>
<p>While there are other approaches, I&rsquo;m focusing on what I consider to be the three leading approaches right now:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Blueprint" href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></strong> - Using API Blueprint gives you awesome tools for your whole API lifecycle. Use it to discuss your API with others. Generate documentation automatically. Or a test suite</li>
<li><strong><a title="RAML" href="http://raml.org/index.html">RAML</a></strong> - RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a></strong> - Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. The overarching goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel there is a right or wrong answer to which API design provider you choose. What I want to understand is the nuances of each, how they help us define our APIs, what tooling is available for each, and what does the overall community of developers look like for each.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in the potential of these API design approaches empowering not just developers, but reaching a larger business audience with API design tooling and a language to articulate, and communicate around API resources.  APIs are a very intangible thing, and anything we can do to make them easier to describe is a big deal.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks I will be playing with several basic &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; examples with API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger to help demonstrate what is possible. Then I hope to get more advanced, and understand the tooling available to me from each platform. I&rsquo;ll even look through their roadmaps and talk to their creators to see what the future holds when it comes to API design.</p>

<p>Have you taken a look at the <a title="Thingiverse Developer Area" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/developers">Thingiverse developer area</a> lately? It&rsquo;s been a while since I reviewed it. A couple years ago while working at <a href="http://www.mimeo.com/">Mimeo</a> as an API evangelist I had the pleasure of doing some deep research into not just printing APIs, but <a title="3D printing APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/19/api-driven-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D printing APIs</a>&nbsp;as well. I wrote a lot on the subject, but overall I was unhappy with what was available in the areas of 3D printing APIs.</p>
<p>When you go to the Thingiverse API now, the landing page immediately tells you what is possible, gives you direct links to API documention, but also provides you what you need to get started, sign up and explore the Thingiverse API&mdash;a flow that is so very important!</p>
<p>When you look at the API docs, you immediately see that the API is a simple web API allowing you to manage users, things, their files and copies, while being able to tag, build collections as well as look for the newest, popular and featured things. The Thingiverse API interface is simple, well designed and actually allows you to access some seriously valuable 3D printing resources.</p>
<p>Thingiverse also delivers other critical resources, providing FAQs, application gallery, hackathon and challenge calendar, and a terms of service that provides a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/legal">plain english translation for developers</a>. All essential resources to supporting and growing your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed with the Thingiverse API, not just because it delivers what I envision a 3D printing API should look like, but it is a well-designed, simple implementation of what any API program should look like as well.</p>

<p>API Terms of Use is the single most important building block of any ecosystem, yet it is the least discussed area of API management and integration. I&rsquo;m working hard to dedicated more time in 2014 to not just the area of API TOS, but what I consider to be the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s focus is on making a plain english translation of your terms of service available. I came across a great example over at <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/developers">Makerbot Thingiverse</a> today, where they add:</p>
<blockquote><em>We realize Terms of Service can be confusing and, quite frankly, a snooze- fest; however, they are very important in explaining the basis of what we, the Company, expect of you, the User, while on this Site and how this interaction plays out. We promised &ldquo;understandability&rdquo; so, to the right of each term, we provided a summary in &ldquo;plain English&rdquo;.</em></blockquote>
<p>Music to my ears. Every time I come across an <a title="example of plain english terms of use" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/legal">example of plain english terms of use like this</a>, I&rsquo;m going to write a short blog post on it. While I may not always agree with a company&rsquo;s terms of service, I can get behind approaches to make them simpler, more accessible and understandable by users.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/01/13/what-happened-with-federal-agencies-and-their-datajson-files/">What Happened With Federal Agencies And Their Data.json Files</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-json-data-store.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing catchup on some of my projects, and one of them is tracking on the evolution of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government">Executive Order 13642</a> from last May, which was the White House directive to make open and machine readable the new default for government information. The piece that I'm tracking on specifically right now is around the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo">OMB Memorandum M-13-13</a> Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, in which one of the items require agencies to publish a data.json file that provides a machine readable inventory of each agencies public data assets.</p>
<p>In short, each federal agencies should round up a list of all their public data assets, make a machine readable JSON file from that list, and publish to the web.  The deadline for publishing was November 30, 2013, and I got caught up in my FAFSA work and the holidays happened, resulting in just getting a chance to take a look at truly take a look at where our government is at with this.</p>
<p>To really quantify where we are at, you have to execute on the core vision of the mandate&mdash;write a script to pull all the federal agencies data.json file. First you pull all the agency&rsquo;s root url using the Federal Agency Directory API from <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/">USA.gov</a>. Then you append data.json to the end of each address, pull each data.json file and get to work!  When executing on this work, you encounter the problem of <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/06/knowing-your-http-status-codes-in-federal-government/">inconsistent HTTP status codes from agency</a>, which I talked about before. Once you navigate this I find:</p>
<ul>
<li>22 Federal Agency Data.json Publish (I also see SEC published, what they did is another story)</li>
<li>5,558 Public Datasets Published (6,479 actual distributions)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just my initial pull, and resulting count. I have only begun hand evaluating what is published, what is not. This is good though right? 22 federal agencies successfully publishing a data.json file for a combined 5,558 datasets available! I know how hard this was to make happen, and I commend everyone for their hard work.  I&rsquo;m a big fan of acknowledging the hard work that goes into this, but then also big fan of pushing back to make sure we keep working. So let&rsquo;s break M-13-13 down, and see if we are really on track.  What did I see during my initial pulling of these 22 data.json files?</p>
<p><strong>Validate Your Data.json Files</strong> <br />My number of piece of advice to give to agencies is make sure you validate your data.json files. <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a> is a free tool, head over there, paste in the contents of your data.json file. Do this after EVERY change. If your data.json doesn&rsquo;t validate, it will just be a headache for consumers. Before you validate, also work hard to clean up your descriptions, abstracts and other fields. Make sure you do away with unnecessary quotes, slashes and other garbage that is just unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>Size of Data.json Files</strong><br />Some of the files are pretty big (wink wink EPA, DOT). I&rsquo;m not sure what the solution is for this, but the bigger the file, the more compute it takes to process. We all need to discuss the solution for this, because it is only going to get worse, and will pretty quickly become unsustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Data.json Fields </strong><br />Overall agencies make good use of the common core meta data fields as recommended in the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/">open data implementation guide for M-13-13</a>. Agencies provided a wealth of descriptions, tags and even provided relevant contact info and other important meta data for listings. I'm analyzing all the fields used an will be providing a deeper analysis of how well they tagged, are there duplicate descriptions. in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Distribution Field</strong><br />There is one critical field in each data.json listing called distribution, which can be a listing of multiple file types for a single data set. For example the dataset might be a list of government acronyms, and you might have a CSV version, as well as Spreadsheet, XML and / or JSON versions. There are 5,858 datasets I&rsquo;ve recorded so far, and there are 6,479 distributions for those datasets. However, only 3,766 of the 5,858 datasets use the distribution field, relying on the Download URL or Access URL as the reference to where the dataset is located&mdash;this is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Format Types of Distribution Files</strong><br />One of the benefits of an agency using the distribution field, is that each entry has a format field, allowing me to understand the format of each dataset, such as HTML, XML, JSON, CSV or other. While this value should be a valid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type">internet media typ</a>e--they all pretty random entries. So the best I can extrapolate right now is 2,550 are html, 2,479 are xml, 13 are json 177 are csv, 285 are xls and the rest are some other format&mdash;including PDF which, well, which is a problem.  Another big problem is almost half are html references, which if it meant structured HTML would be one thing, but mostly means it is a web page with some sort of form you can extract data yourself (not in line with M-13-13 vision).  So 2,954 are truly machine readable (the whole point of the exercise), and 2,904 are not really or can&rsquo;t be identified as so. Ok, so around 50% of the datasets are machine readable (maybe, hopefully), which will have to be tested with another round of scripts and lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Progress </strong><br />How do we track progress on what is going on with federal agency&rsquo;s data.gov files, from here forward? The best I can come up with for right now is to store a copy of data.json files each time I pull. You can find these archives on my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/tree/gh-pages/data/json-archive">federal government research Github repository</a>. I will also be pulling a copy of the 6,479 dataset distributions and storing on Amazon S3, depending on what it costs me to pull, transfer and store. Then I will work on some diff, and month to month analytics based upon agency&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Quality Of Datasets </strong><br />I give the overall data.json effort of agencies a C grade. It very much has that, &ldquo;we got our homework in on time&rdquo; feel to it. The leading agencies did what they were supposed to, but ultimately didn&rsquo;t put a whole of of care into the quality of work. The 5000+ datasets reflect what I was saying in my advice for the federal government that came out today on Govfresh, we have a lot of house cleaning to do.</p>
<p>So how should OMB, OSTP and GSA respond to this C level effort by federal agencies? They should:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Help the agencies who DID publish, refine what they published. Bring in outside help if necessary, clean up data, listings and demonstrate to agencies what was done, and how they can continue doing better in the future.</li>
<li>Help the agencies who DID NOT publish, by going through their websites, finding high value, already published datasets and convert them to JSON and generate a data.json file for them to publish on their websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would help agencies who are already on board understand more about what is needed from the consumer side of things, and why quality in their data..json listings and datasets is so very, very important. It would also help agencies who aren&rsquo;t on board get their data inventory process kickstarted. It should all be able to be done in Q1 2014, then by Q2 we can get rolling with next steps with Data.gov.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I&rsquo;m not naive about the amount of work that went into the 22 agencies getting these 5,000+ datasets published, but we can&rsquo;t stop there. If you want to see meaningful data journalism, data visualizations, web and mobile apps incorporate this hard work into their own efforts, we have to clean things up. Remember Washington, you can&rsquo;t do it alone. You have to figure out a way to open these up and allow the public to help clean, organize and add value to the data you have published in addition to your own efforts.</p>
<p>It is a healthy start, but we have so much more work.</p>

<p>During the recent federal government shutdown this last fall, the concept of API redundancy became much more important for me, and I hope for others as well. The need to ensure public open data and APIs, as well as private sector resources, stay available is becoming increasingly vital.</p>
<p>As I work through these thoughts I'm playing with different approaches to caching some types of APIs. In my experimentation, I'm using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">RedHat OpenShift</a>&nbsp;to deploy caches of commonly used APIs resources.</p>
<p>Each type of API deployment is designed to sync with the mothership upon activation, and then receive regular updates of data via API + webhooks, with all updates to the code being done with Github.</p>
<p>In the future maybe we can make API addressing work somewhat like peer-to-peer file sharing, where I can receive multiple API endpoints for a common resource. Of course this wouldn't work for more unique APIs, but for commonly used APIs it could be a way to create redundancy and establish in fault tolerance in our applications.</p>
<p>At first I will be testing this out with data APIs like government facility locations by topic or state, then more complex API resources like website screenshots, or image manipulation APIs. If you have any specific type of API you'd like to see deployed in this way, let me know.</p>

<p>I had a friend ask me for help with their talk submission for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">#APIStrat in Amsterdam</a>. He was concerned that his talk was too product pitchy, and wanted help making it something that not just would be accepted by our event, but something community would want to hear.</p>
<p>It is good to hear the concern, its true we want the best talks at #APIStrat, we don&rsquo;t want to have a bunch of product pitches, we are seeking stories of API strategy and the practices from the trenches of API design, deployment and management.</p>
<p>Additionally, the audience doesn't want to hear it. I know many companies are focused on selling their products and services, but event audiences don't care. #APIStrat participants wants to hear about how you are solving the problems they face, using APIs.</p>
<p>Sure your product or service may solve their problems, but telling them this isn't good enough. You need intelligently articulate the problem and walk the the story of how the problem can be solved, in a compelling way. Sure your product or service may be woven in there, but it can't be the central actor in the story. You need to work extra hard to find a story that is meaningful to the #APIstrat audience, and provide details they can take home with them and apply in their own worlds.</p>
<p>We are still looking for more stories of <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> from the trenches. Our <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/contact-call-for-papers.php">call for papers</a> is only open for another week, so make sure and polish your story and get it submitted. I look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/?q=ericsson">Ericsson once had around 19 APIs available</a> via their <a href="https://labs.ericsson.com/">Ericsson Labs platform</a>. After doing a round of looking through all the APIs I track on, I noticed they have ALL gone away. They are still doing a lot of research, but they seem to have lost their interest in APIs all together.</p>
<p>I have no problem with experimentation and playing around with different resources, and even the deprecation of APIs, with appropriate communication, when it makes sense. I know Ericsson exploration is via their labs, and isn't really meant for production, but it grinds on me when there are APIs be played with, then all of sudden one day they are gone, with no trace.</p>
<p>If you are experimenting with APIs, I recommend leaving some sort of landing page behind, with some trace of the exhaust from your research, experimentation--if possible open source your work. You put APIs out there and expect developers to come, play and give you feedback with no compensation&mdash;the least you can do is leave some of that research or assetts behind for the industry to put to use, or at least for us to understand that this has occurred at some point in time.</p>
<p>I don't know why your API initiatives didn&rsquo;t work or were closed down, but I think in general it leaves a bad taste in developers mouths--I know it sure does in mine. Experimentation and iteration is fine, but if you want the public to care about your research in the future, leave some of the exhaust from your research behind, so we can derive meaning and value fromit. If nothing else, just a landing page that explains what happened, otherwise we wil stop giving a shit in the future and are unlikely to participate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.shtml"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ibm-watson/ibm-watson.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The latest<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/ibm-forms-watson-business-group-will-commercialization-follow-7000024929/"> tech news to come out of IBM this week is a brand new business group to push innovation around the IBM Watson platform</a>, with IBM committed to spending $1B on the new business group, with $100M set aside to fund startups who build on top of the Watson platform.</p>
<p>The introduction of the new business group may be in response to the media&rsquo;s, and analyst&rsquo;s chatter about less than impressive results so far with the Watson platform&rsquo;s ability to generate revenue, with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304887104579306881917668654">$100M revenue over the last three years, according to the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>There was a post on on ReadWrite today, called <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/01/10/watson-fails-to-compute-hadoop#awesm=~osBWHG1mh2rWcB">IBM's Watson Fails To Compute In A World Of Open-Source Hadoop</a>, where Matt Assay nails the reason: <em>Where Are The Watson Developers?</em></p>
<p>When you visit the "<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.shtml">IBM Watson Ecosystem Program</a>&rdquo;, you get a lot of text, and then even more text contained in PDF&rsquo;s telling how much you can innovate with the platform. Then when you are ready there is a pretty lengthy form to fill out, where you can tell them what you want to do with Watson, and hit submit and hope they will let you in. They also have a Twitter, Facebook and Youtube account, but really it doesn't smell of &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; where &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; is happening.  I've looked at over 10K &ldquo;ecosystems&rdquo;, which about less than 500 are truly &ldquo;innovating&rdquo;, and after a while you start to be able to smell the signs of success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the IBM Watson platform doesn&rsquo;t offer value, I&rsquo;m just saying the team doesn't know how to make "innovation" happen. They need to loosen up, stop being so enterprise, and open up a little bit. We know you got some APIs behind there, make them accessible to ANYONE, make registration self-service, and give us some dead simple, meaningful, powerful web API endpoints to play with that will stimulate our imaginations.</p>
<p>There are proven ways to limit the access new developers so they don&rsquo;t get out of hand, and models for developing incentive ladders that incentivize developers to not just play, but actual develop solid apps that can deliver and will actually evolve into real world business models.</p>
<p>Analytics and feedback loops can be put in place that allow you to easily control the moochers and bad actors, while stimulating and listening to the true innovators, allowing the Watson team to iterate and evolve API endpoints that don&rsquo;t just cater to one industry, but any business sector.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just develop an powerful resource like Watson, make it available in the cloud, label the platform an&ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo;, provide some case studies and innovation magically happens. You have to let go a little, and allow developers to come on board, play, imagine, fail, and push the boundaries of what is possible. This doesn&rsquo;t happen when you have total control over everything that happens.</p>
<p>Bringing a true developer ecosystem to life around Watson will be more than just about the technology, you need to put in place the essential building blocks developers need to be successful, let a little oxygen into the mix, then I think you will find the innovation and ultimately the revenue you are looking for from Watson.</p>

<p>There is an excellent post in GovFresh by former Presidential Innovation Fellow and Githubber Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>), <a title="Why no one uses your government data" href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/one-uses-government-data/">Why no one uses your government data</a>?</p>
<p>Ben is looking to address one of the biggest problems with open data in government. That data is just opened, purely to check a box on some requirement imposed on agencies. The data steward doesn&rsquo;t actually put any thought into how the data will be used, and is just taking advantage of positive re-enforcement associated with opening up the data.</p>
<p>This is not just a problem in federal, state or city government. This same problem occurs in the private sector as well. While it takes work to open up data and other resources via APIs, it takes even more work to see things through the eyes of a consumer. Making the data clean and actually usable by data journalists, in visualizations and applications is hard work.</p>
<p>We need to raise the bar when it comes to open data. If you work in government, non-profit or company, your work isn&rsquo;t done when you release your open data or API, you need to see things through and ask yourself one simple question: <strong><em>How can you optimize the experience for the consumer?</em></strong></p>

<p>Building on my last post,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/10/lessons-in-gov-open-data-optimize-for-consumer/">Lessons In Gov Open Data: Optimize For Consumer</a>, I want to share another important lesson for people working on open data in government. This very important lesson is about good data narration or storytelling around your data, not just publishing it as is.</p>
<p>This lesson is triggered by a great post over at <a title="Gnip" href="http://blog.gnip.com">Gnip</a>, where <a href="http://blog.gnip.com/data-narration/">Eric Swayne, Director of Product of MutualMind talks about the fundamentals of good data narration</a>.  Swayne starts out by saying that:</p>
<blockquote><em>People that live in data analysis have the crucial opportunity for extracting meaning that transforms businesses through data-driven decisions, and it takes much more than just pushing out the monthly graphs and charts</em></blockquote>
<p>Swayne continues to talk about the trademarks of good data narration which include true insights, user-centric approach, and idea inception. This is critical in releasing data in government, it isn&rsquo;t just about the release, it is about releasing the data, providing insights associated with the data, and tailoring it for as wide as possible audience, with the goal of triggering something new within the minds and imaginations of these potential consumers.</p>
<p>Remember, if you are opening up data in government, your work is not done once you release. It is your role as a data steward to narrate and tell the story of the data in a way that will relay the value to potential end-users and consumers, so that they may build on that value through visualizations, applications and even other stories--without the story it is just data. :-(</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/01/10/another-one-acquired-apiaxle-acquired-by-exicon/">Another One Acquired: ApiAxle Acquired By Exicon</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiaxle-logo-2.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I got a email today letting me know that <a href="http://apiaxle.com/docs/acquisition-statement/">cloud platform Exicon, purchase API management provider ApiAxle</a>, further whittling away at all of the original and second wave of API management providers I&rsquo;ve been tracking on over the last 4 years.</p>
<p>ApiAxle first showed up as a blip on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/roundup-of-20-api-service-providers-in-2012/">2012 API management provider roundup</a> when:</p>
<blockquote><em>ApiAxle started out as a side project when Phil Jackson was CTO at Qwerly and found their API management provider didn't quite fit the needs of a busy, commercial API. API growth had already exploded back then and so, in the same way you could pick from a plethora of databases or webservers, there seemed an obvious space for an open source API management platform. That's when ApiAxle was born.</em></blockquote>
<p>According to Phil Jackson, the ApiAxle brand will continue to live as part of the Exicon suite of products, and he will keep evolving his baby. While it is 2014 now, I would consider this acquisition the last of a string of API management acquisitions we saw in 2014 which included Layer7, Mashery, and Apiphany.</p>
<p>These leaves just a handful of API management providers on the acquisition table in 2014, including 3Scale, Apigee, Mashape and Apiary.io. Who is next? Will API management platforms be as hot of a commodity in 2014?</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Data.gov has continued to evolve, adding data sets, agencies and features. With recent, high profile stumbles like with Healthcare.gov, it can be easy to fall prey to historical stereotypes that government can't deliver tech very well. While this may apply in some cases, I think we can confidently get behind the movement that is occurring at Data.gov, with 176 agencies working to add 54,723 data sets in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that before we look towards the future of what the roadmap looks like for Data.gov, we need to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">spend a great deal of time refining and strengthening what we currently have available at Data.gov</a>, and across the numerous government agency developer areas. Even with these feelings, I can't help but think about what is needed for the next couple years of Data.gov, in a more technical sense.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm biased, but I think the next steps for Data.gov is all API. How do we continue evolving Data.gov, and prepare to not just participate, but lead in the growing API economy?</p>
<p><strong>Management Tools for Agencies</strong><br /> We need to invest in management tools for agencies, commercial providers as well as <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a>. Agencies need to be able to focus on the best quality data sets and API designs, and not have to worry about the more mundane necessities of API management like access, security, documentation and portal management. Agencies should have consistent analytics, helping them understand how their resources are being accessed and put to use. If OSTP, OMB, GSA and the public expect consistent results when it comes to open data and APIs from agencies, we need to make sure they have the right management tools.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoint Design Tools for Data Sets</strong><br /> Agencies should be able to go from dataset to API without much additional work. Tools should be made available for easily mounting published datasets, then allow non-developers to design API endpoints for easily querying, filtering, accessing and transforming datasets. While data download will still be the preferred path for many developers, making high value datasets available via APIs will increase the number of people who access, that may not have the time to deal with the overhead of downloads.</p>
<p><strong>Common Portal Building Blocks</strong><br /> When you look through each of the <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">50+ federal agency /developer areas</a>, you see 50+ different approaches to delivering the portals that developers will depend on to learn about, and integrate with each agencies APIs.  A common set of building blocks is needed to help agencies standardize how they deliver their developer portals. Each individual approach might make sense within each agency, but as a consumer when you try to work across agencies it can be a confusing maze of API interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Developer Registration<br /></strong> As a developer I need to establish a separate relationship with each federal agency. This quickly becomes a barrier to entry, one that will run off even the most seasoned developers. We want to incentivize developers to use as many federal APIs as possible, and by providing them with a single point of registration, and a common credential that will work across agencies will stimulate integrations and adoptions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Application Keys</strong><br /> To accompany the standard developer registration, a standard approach to user and application keys is needed across federal agencies. As a user, I should be able to create a single application definition and receive API keys that will work across agencies. The amount of work required to develop my application and manage multiple API keys will prevent developers from adopting multiple federal agency APIs. Single registration and application keys will reduce the barriers to entry for the average developer when looking to build on top of federal API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Tooling and Analytics</strong><br /> When integrating with private sector APIs, developers enjoy a wide range of tools and analytics that assist them in discovering, integrating, managing and monitoring their application's integration with various APIs. This is something that is very rare in integration with federal government APIs. Standard tooling and analytics for developers needs to become part of the standard operating procedures for federal agency /developer initiatives, helping developer be successful in all aspects of their usage of government open data and APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML</strong><br /> All APIs produced in government should be described using on of the common API definitions formats that have emerged like Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML. These all provide a machine readable description of an API and its interface that can be used in discovery, interactive documentation, code libraries and SDKs and many other uses. Many private sector companies are doing this, and the federal should follow the lead.</p>
<p><strong>Discoverability, Portable Interfaces and Machine Readable by Defaul</strong>t<br /> As with open data, APIs need to be discoverable, portable and machine readable by default. Describing APIs in Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML will do this. Allowing APIs to be presented, distributed and reused in new ways. This will allow each agency to publish their own APIs, but aggregators can take machine readable definitions from each and publish in a single location. This approach will allow for meaningful interactions such as with budget APIs, allowing a single budget API site to exist, providing access to all federal agencies budget without having to go to each /developer area, but there are many more examples like this that will increase API usage and extend the value of government APIs. If you are familiar with data.json, think api.json.</p>
<p><strong>API Hubs</strong><br /> A new breed of API directories have emerged. API portals like <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> and <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">API Hub</a> don&rsquo;t just provide a directory of APIs, they simplify API management for providers and integration for API consumers. Federal agencies need to make their APIs friendly to these API hubs, maintaining active profiles on all platforms and keeping each API listed within the directories and actively engaging consumers via the platforms. Federal agencies shouldn&rsquo;t depend on developers coming to their /developer areas to engage with their APIs, agencies need to reach out where developers are already actively using APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Consistent API Interface Definition Models</strong><br /> Within the federal government each API is born within its own agencies silo. Very little sharing of interface designs and data models occurs across agencies, resulting in APIs that may do the same thing, but can potentially do it in radically different ways. Common APIs such as budget or facility directories should be using a common API interface design and underlying data model. Agencies need to share interface designs, and work together to make sure the best patterns across the federal government are used.</p>
<p><strong>Webhooks</strong><br /> In the federal government APIs are often a one-way street allow developers to come and pull information. To increase the value of data and other API driven resources, and help reduce the load on agencies servers, APIs need to push data out to consumers, reducing the polling on APIs and making API integration much more real-time. Technologies such as the Webhook which allows API consumer to provide a web URL, in which agencies can push newly published data, changes and other real-time events to users, are being widely used to make APIs much more of a two-way street.</p>
<p><strong>Hypermedia</strong><br /> As the world of web APIs evolve there are new approaches emerging to delivering the next generation of APIs, and hypermedia is one of these trends. Hypermedia brings a wealth of value, but most importantly it provides a common framework for APIs to communicate, and provide essential business logic and direction for developers, helping them better use APIs in line with API provider goals. Hypermedia has the potential to not just make government assets and resources available, but ensure they are used in the best interest of each agency. Hypermedia is still getting traction in the private sector, but we are also seeing a handful of government groups take notice. Hypermedia holds a lot of potential for federal agencies, and the groundwork and education around this trend in APIs needs to begin.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelists Present</strong><br /> The first thing you notice when you engage with an government API, is nobody is home. There is nobody to help you understand how it works, overcome obstacles when integrating, there is no face to the blog posts, the tweets or the forum replies. Federal government APIs have no personality. Evangelists are desperately needed to bring this critical human element to federal government APIs. All successful private sector APIs have an evangelist or an army of evangelists, spreading the word, supporting developers, and making things work. We need open data and API evangelists at every federal agency, lettings us know some one is home.</p>
<p><strong>Read / Write</strong><br /> I know this is a scary one for government, but as I said above in the webhooks section&mdash;APIs need to be a two way street. There are proven ways to make APIs writeable without jeopardizing the integrity of API data. Allow for trusted access, let developers prove themselves. There is a lot of expertise, &ldquo;citizen cycles&rdquo;, and value available in a developer ecosystem. When a private sector company uses federal government data, improves on it, the government and the rest of the ecosystem should be able to benefit as well. The federal government needs to allow for both read and write on APIs&mdash;this will be the critical next step that makes government APIs a success.</p>
<p>These are just 14 of my recommendations for the next steps in the API strategy for the federal government. As I said earlier, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">none of this should be done without first strengthening what we all have already done in the federal government around open data and APIs</a>. However, even though we need to play catch up on whats already there, we can&rsquo;t stop looking towards the future and understand what needs to be next.</p>
<p>None of these recommendations are bleeding edge or technology just for technology sake. This is about standardizing how APIs are designed, deployed and managed across the federal government, emulating what is already being proven to work in the private sector. If the federal government wants to add to the <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/">OpenData500</a>, and establish those meaningful stories needed to deliver on the promise of open data and APIs--this is whats needed.</p>
<p>With the right leadership, education and evangelism, open data and APIs can become part of the DNA of our federal government. We have to put aside our purely techno-solutionism view of #OpenGov and realize this is seriously hard work, with many pitfalls, challenges, politics and that in reality it won&rsquo;t happen over night. However, if we dedicate the resources needed, we can not just change how government works, making it machine readable by default, we can forever alter how the private and public sector partners.</p>

<p>It has taken me a while to respond to a post I read this weekend, by Mike Caulfield (<a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a>) called <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/01/03/revenge-of-the-os/">Revenge of the OS</a>. In short he points out the fragment world we live in with all of our apps, and the shortcoming of tech companies to actually deliver a solution that truly works for end-users.</p>
<p>Our desktop computer has always been the doorway to our digital worlds, and then came the Internet, and the Web 2.0 age where iGoogle (now dead), Facebook Apps (how many apps do you use these days), and other &ldquo;mega-services&rdquo; promised to be the doorway to our now online digital worlds.</p>
<p>Mike talks about how his daughter, who 4 years ago depended on Facebook to access her world, now &ldquo;moves fluidly between Tumblr, Snapchat, Instagram, and Vine accounts, with the notifications panel her point of integration&rdquo;. Our devices have become the doorway to our online, digital lives.</p>
<p>All of this is the result of tech companies, driven by their VC overlords, pushing to become the point of control for user identity and the pipes in which that users data flows&mdash;-at all costs! Sure these companies pay lip service to the interoperability that could fix this and employ OpenID, oAuth and use APIs, but without true investment and an honest belief in interoperability with other platforms, even competitors, it all means absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>The tech giants have the power to lead, come together and establish strong openID or oAuth alliances, strengthening tools, simplifying user experience, but they don&rsquo;t. Innovative startups like <a href="http://oauth.io">oAuth.io</a> from Webshell, and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> are left to do the heavy lifting, and the user is still left with a fragmented, cumbersome experience as they jump from cloud to cloud, across potentially several devices like smart phone, laptop, xBox, and tablets.</p>
<p>This world is only going to get worse, tech companies of all sizes show very little interest in truly working together. Sure, there are anomalies, and every has their own APIs, but there are no meaningful API standards, very little sharing of API interface designs and no investment in common identity approaches and tooling.</p>
<p>This insanity will grow exponentially defined by the number of internet connected devices that we adopt, including phones and tablets, but is being extended to our cars, homes, clothing, glasses and much, much more.</p>

<p>Building on my thoughts around <a title="preparing your API for wholesale access" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/is-your-api-ready-for-wholesale/">preparing your API for wholesale access</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking through the problem of developer API access when you have API providers offering up each others APIs, and bundling them seamlessly as part of their own API stack.</p>
<p>In this scenario I&rsquo;m working through, API provider A has an API they offer up wholesale to partners, and API provider B wants to bundle API provider A&rsquo;s API along with their own, adding value to their API and developer community.</p>
<p>In this scenario API provider B doesn&rsquo;t want their developers to have to sign up for a separate API key with API provider A, the developer should just have to create one account and use one key for their application.</p>
<p>To make this seamless, both API providers need to have their own APIs for their API management system, allowing users and keys to be provisioned programmatically. All API provider A needs to do is create a service tier for their wholesale partners to have access to account and application provisioning, so their partners can seamlessly generate new accounts for their new developer accounts and switch API keys when developers uses the wholesale API.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just an academic exercise. It is possible when your <a title="API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers</a>. I just think API providers aren&rsquo;t thinking at this level yet, and thinking about how the future of how their APIs will be consumed in the future, and the potential of sharing users with their API partners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep exploring the various elements needed to make your API available in a wholesale way. Having an <a title="API for your API management infrastructure" href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/activedocs#/account_management_api">API for your API management infrastructure</a> is definitely essential, and next I will be looking at having a machine readable API definition, and permissible terms of service (TOS).</p>
