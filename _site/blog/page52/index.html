        <span class="post-date">17 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/19dMjBe" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-white-papers-history-of-apis.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Understanding our history is critical to understanding where we are going. &nbsp;I have been studying the <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/history/">history of web APIs</a> for the last three years. Even though I have been through the API strategies of pioneers like Salesforce and Amazon several times, each time I go back through, I learn more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In May I went back through the history of APIs and added several stories that I feel are key to introducing people to the API space, as well as helping developers and people who already work with APIs, about why this has all worked.</p>
<p>I break the history of APIs into 5 phases:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Commerce</li>
<li>Social</li>
<li>Business &amp; Marketing</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p>We are standing solidly within the mobile phase of APIs, looking forward at the next phase which is about the Internet of Things. The History of APIs is part of my API 101 series, which I publish to help introduce people to the world of APIs and prepare them for them for the API economy that will surround them.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://bit.ly/19dMjBe" target="_blank">download an updated copy of the History of APIs</a> via this blog post, and I will be adding an entirely new white paper section in the near future. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure and share the History of APIs with your friends and anyone you think would benefit learning about the space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/audrey-kin-paris.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm doing a keynote this weekend with the infamous, edtech rabble-rouser Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a> in Park City Utah, this Wednesday June 19th.</p>
<p>Audrey and I will be talking about the importance of data portability when it comes to education technology.  <a href="http://www.instructure.com/?utm_expid=41647821-3&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">Instructure</a>, the creators of Canvas, a next generation learning management system (LMS), has been so kind to bring us both out.</p>
<p>While Audrey and I spend a lot of time speaking at conferences, this is our first event where we will be both sharing the stage.  If you are unaware, Audrey and her&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>&nbsp;blog isn't just a partner in crime with <a>API Evangelist when it comes to data portability</a>, she has also played the role of my girlfriend for almost four years.</p>
<p>We are both super passionate about open data, open source, data portability, terms of use and privacy policies that protect and empower users. &nbsp;Because when it comes to education, those "users" are our kids, brothers, sisters, family and friends. Education is not just another Silicon Valley opportunity, it is way too important.</p>
<p>I'm stoked to be sharing the stage with Audrey in Park City, UT this Wednesday at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a>.  And thank you to the Instructure team for believing in us and bringing us out to cause trouble in Utah.</p>

<p>Coming on the heels of <a href="/2013/06/04/apidays-mediterranea-is-a-wrap/">API Days Mediterranea in Madrid Spain</a>, is the next event in the series, <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days San Francisco</a>.  We kicked off the API Days event series in Paris, at the end of last year, and now after the momentum in Spain, API Days has picked up enough speed to hop the ocean and land in the heart of technology.</p>
<p>The lineup is pretty rock'n, with talks from <a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a>, <a href="http://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a>, <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 Technologies</a>, <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a>, <a href="http://intel.com">Intel</a>, <a href="http://apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com/">DotCloud</a>, <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a>, <a href="http://mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, <a href="http://apispark.com">APISpark</a>, <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, <a href="http://soa.com">SOA Software</a>, <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>, <a href="http://fitbit.com">Fitbit</a>, <a href="http://sap.com">SAP</a>, <a href="http://mulesoft.com">Mulesoft</a>, <a href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphay</a>, <a href="http://webshell.io">Webshell</a>, <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>, <a href="http://helloreverb.com/">Reverb</a> and <a href="http://angelhack.com/">AngelHack</a>.</p>
<p>The theme for API Days San Francisco is the API Economy, so it makes sense there are even VC's talking from <a href="http://www.trueventures.com/">True Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.bvp.com/">Bessemer Venture Partners</a> and even Alex William from <a href="http://techcrunch.com">Techcrunch</a> will be there.</p>
<p>The headliner is ex-Calvin Klein underwear model, media junkie, stimulator of tech influencers and master of spin Mike Maney (<a href="https://twitter.com/the_spinmd">@the_spinmd</a>) of <a href="http://maneydigital.com/">Maney Digital</a>.  You can count on the event being a good time with the Spin MD, Mike Maney around.</p>
<p>API Days San Francisco is shaping up to be a pretty kick ass event.  I'd make sure you are there.  It is downtown SF, this weekend 6/21 and 6/22 at <a href="http://www.parisoma.com/">Parisoma</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be there and look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p>In 2007, a new API-as-a-product platform launched, called <a href="http://twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a>, which introduced a voice API allowing developers to make and receive phone calls via any cloud application.  Over the last 3 years Twilio has additionally released a text messaging and SMS short code API, making itself a critical telephony resource in many developers toolbox.</p>
<p>Twilio is held up as a model platform to follow when evangelizing to developers.  Twilio has helped define which technical and business building blocks are essential for a healthy API driven platform, set the bar for on the ground evangelism at events and hackathons, and worked hard to showcase, support and invest it its developer ecosystem.</p>

<p>Alongside <a title="Foursquare" href="/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-foursquare-api/">Foursquare</a> and <a title="Instagram" href="/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-instagram-api/">Instagram</a>, Twilio has come to define mobile application development, helping push APIs into the mainstream.  While Twitter has sometime been held up as a cautionary tale when it comes to APIs,&nbsp; Twilio has demonstrated, that when done right, API driven ecosystems do work.</p>
<p>By 2011 the bar for delivering APIs, via HTTP, has been well established by early pioneers like <a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">SalesForce</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, but Twilio has shown how mature the business of APIs has become with its evolution into the mobile period.&nbsp; However, mobile development via APIs, owes its roots to the foundation laid by the <a title="commerce, social and cloud API pioneers" href="/history/">commerce, social and cloud API pioneers</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2013</span>
        <h2>From Deployment to Management</h2>
<p>I have broken out API design and deployment into individual areas, separate from API management. However they are all intertwined and overlap is inevitable, but it is important to understand the overview of API deployment, from framework to gateway and where it fits in with API design and management.</p>
<p>API deployment was born out of SOA and the enterprise, and the API gateways have the longest history in API deployment. But over the last 10 years a wealth of frameworks and scrappier approaches to deploy APIs build on HTTP has evolved considerably. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After 10 years of evolving API frameworks, and RESTful approaches a new breed of API providers have emerged to provide the next generation of API deployments that will drive mobile apps and the Internet of Things. All of this is making API deployment something anyone can do.</p>
<p>API Evangelist is about educating the masses about the potential of APIs, and understanding API deployment is something that any savvy business person should have a grasp of, even if you won't be getting your hands dirty with the actual execution.</p>
<p>Maybe you have a wealth of data locked up in databases that you need to make available for mobile or tablet apps, and you just don't have the internal resources to design, develop and deploy you APIs. Five years ago, APIs were definitely a purely technical initiative, born out of IT. In 2014 anyone with a little tech curiosity can understand what is possible, and begin to put a plan in place and achieve deployment.</p>
<p>Now you should have a 100K foot view of the world of API deployment, and should now look to understand what is involved with managing an API in the wild.</p>

<p>In the early days, APIs were just about deployment and consumption--you were doing one or the other.&nbsp; Then from 2006 to 2012 API management was introduced from providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/10/history-of-apis-mashery/">Mashery</a>, then <a title="3Scale" href="http://3Scale.net">3Scale</a> and most recently <a title="Apiphany" href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphany</a>. In 2013 the API universe is expanding at a ever increasing pace, and the concept of API design is expanding, with new approaches, tools and even companies stepping up to provide services.</p>
<p>I'm deciding to frame my API design research as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the resulting definition of your API, that will eventually become the&nbsp; API you will use in production, which also might drive your documentation and generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate their apps.</p>
<p>Depending on our needs, API design may begin with learning about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition so you can generate interactive API documentation.</p>
<p>Ultimately your API design will be the definition of each endpoint, its methods, fields and much more. In a technical sense it is a JSON or XML blueprint that describes your API, and in a creative sense, API design is an art form and can possess a technical beauty, one that will also speak to the value an API delivers to end-users.</p>
<p>Thoughtful API design early on can save you a lot of mistakes down the road. In support of this, and as I do with al of my API research projects, I started a Github repository at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design.apievangelist.com</a></strong></span>. This project is not meant to endorse any particular approach or methodology, but provide a single resource where you can find the best information on API design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who like to share via email and PDFs, I also published the <a href="http://bit.ly/151yBNn">API Providers Guide to API Design as a PDF</a>, which you can download and share as you wish. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This API design project will be an open source repository containing the building blocks of API design, tools for assisting you in your API design, and companies that provide services in the area of API design.</p>
<p>This is a living project, that will be updated weekly. If you know of missing building blocks, or tools and services that should be included, or think I'm complete wacko, send your emails to <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a> or tweet at me.</p>

Now in 2014 we are stabilizing again, and the API universe is expanding around the area of API design, with new approaches, tools and entire companies emerging to provide services that are dedicated to helping companies design the best APIs they can.</span></p>
<p><span>I define the world of API design as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the definition of your API that will eventually be deployed as your production endpoints, drive your documentation, generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate, test, monitor, and allow your API to be found--through this lens, API design is fast becoming the driver for all areas of the API lifecycle.</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on our needs, API design may begin with understanding HTTP, and REST, or may learning more about applying hypermedia as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition, so you can generate interactive API documentation. I won&rsquo;t be going into the finer points of REST, Hypermedia or even Swagger definitions. My goal is to provide a 100K view of space, and highlight the various tools, services, and API design methodologies available today.</span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately your API design will be the definition of each endpoint, its methods, fields and much more. In a technical sense it is a JSON, YAML or markdown blueprint that describes your API, and in a creative sense, API design is an art that can possess a strange technical beauty, and speak to the value an API delivers to end-users. API design is far more than just how you structure URIs, or parameters, it is fast becoming a discipline, with a suite of services and tools to support a growing wave of API design professionals.</span></p>
<p><span>Thoughtful API design early on can save you a lot of mistakes down the road. This project is not meant to endorse any particular approach or methodology, but provide a single resource where you can find the best information on API design, and go there to find what you need. It can be difficult to stay up with the latest tools, and approaches, and API Evangelist looks to fill this gap.</span></p>
<p><span>This API design project will live as an open source repository, and resulting white paper containing the building blocks of API design, tools that assist you in your API design, and companies that provide services in the area of API design.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is a living project, that will be updated as I have time.. If you know of missing building blocks, or tools and services that should be included, send them to </span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">info@apievangelist.com</span></span></p>

<p>In November 2006, API the first API service provider Mashery came out of "stealth mode" to offer documentation support, community management and access control for companies wishing to offer public or private APIs--from blog post in TechCrunch titled&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/11/06/mashery-api-management-service-is-open-for-business/">API Management Service is Open for Business</a>.</p>
<p>At this point in time, in 2006, we were moving from the social period of APIs into the cloud computing phase with the introduction of Amazon Web Services. It was clear that the world of web APIs was getting real, and there was opportunity for companies to offer API management as a service.</p>

<p>While there were tools for deploying APIs, there was no standard approach to managing your API deployment. Mashery was the first to bring a standard set of services to API providers, that would help set the stage for the future growth of the API industry.</p>
<p>It would take almost six more years before the API industry would come of age. The space we all know today was defined by early API commerce pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">SalesForce</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, social pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Flickr" href="/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/2013/06/09/history-of-apis-del-icio-us/">Delicous</a>, and from Mashery who helped define what is now known as the business of APIs.</p>
<p>In 2013, Mashery was acquired by Intel, helping recently validate that the API industry truly has come of age.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Box" href="http://box.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/box/box-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Enterprise content sharing platform <a title="Box" href="http://box.com">box</a> launched a <a title="new developer revenue sharing program with its API developer ecosystem" href="http://developers.blog.box.com/2013/06/06/welcome-to-the-new-app-economy-introducing-box-rev/">new developer revenue sharing program for its API developer ecosystem,</a> called <a href="http://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215">$rev</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215">Box $rev</a> is pretty straightforward.  You just integrate the <a href="http://developers.box.com/">Box API</a> into your app, enroll it into the Box $rev program, and box will monitor, track and report your activity--sending you checks for up to 15% of the per seat price as a commission, each quarter.</p>
<p>As a PaaS provider, the core value driven by the box API is not about making money, it is based upon adding new users, and getting them to depend on box for their everyday needs.  Offering developers 15% of the revenue generated via the core box platforms makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p><a title="Box" href="http://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/box/box-rev.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>This approach to revenue share won't work for all API providers, but is a great way to incentivize developers when you have a core platform you need to drive new users to.</p>
<p>I like the Box $rev model, because it actually incentivizes developers to build meaningful, engaging applications that users will actually adopt.</p>
<p>Its nice to see API value quantified in engagement, allowing us to move beyond the eye-ball based economy we are drowning in currently.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42901" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/books/creatures-from-the-dark-cover.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the last two years I've seen the emergence of&nbsp; cloud platforms that focus on helping data administrators, owners and stewards, generate APIs from their data sources.</p>
<p>The new cloud services like <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=28">EmergentOne</a> will mount a MySQL database, spider the tables, and generate a web API for you, while providing you the basic tools you will need to manage access and consumption of that API.</p>
<p>In the same spirit of helping data owners generate APIs, I'd like to see the same types of tools, but designed for books and their authors or publishers.  When I create a book and generate the ePub version, I would like to be able to upload it to a cloud platform, where the service would spider the ePub file and help generate a simple, but meaningful API for the book allowing developers to search, annotate and interact with the books content via web, mobile or tablet applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/books/bw-epub-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My thoughts are still in the idea stage, I have done very little research on what is out there.  But I would envision something like this would work well will existing platforms like <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>.  As I do with all my ideas, I will share my thoughts here in real-time as I do the research.</p>
<p>I think in the future, providing default API access to all books will be critical to the syndication across all available distribution platforms.  You can find the seeds of this idea&nbsp; in what <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/apis">Pearson is doing with their product catalog</a>.</p>
<p>As the publishing world slowly wakes up to digital distribution, APIs will become a common tool in the toolbox of authors and publishers.</p>

<p><a href="https://delicious.com/">del.icio.us</a>&nbsp;is a social bookmarking service for storing, sharing and discovering web bookmarks to web pages, that was founded by Jousha Schachter in 2003.</p>
<p>Del.icio.us implemented a very simple tagging system which allowed users to easily tag their web bookmarks in a meaningful way, but also established a kind of folksonomy across all users of the platform. Which proved to be a pretty powerful way for cataloging and sharing web links.</p>

<p>The innovative tagging methodology used by del.icio.us allowed you to pull a list of your tags, or public web bookmarks by using the URL http://del.icio.us/tag/[tag name]/. So if I was searching for bookmarks on airplanes, I could http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane and I would GET a list of all bookmarks that have been tagged airplane. &nbsp;It was simple</p>
<p>When it came to the programmatic del.icio.us interface, the API was built into the site, creating a seamless experience--if you wanted the airplane tags via HTML you entered http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane, if you wanted RSS of the tags you entered http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/airplane, and if you wanted XML returned you used http://del.icio.us/api/tag/airplane. This has changed with the modern version of Delicious API.</p>
<p>del.icio.us was the first, concrete example of how the web could deliver HTML content, alongside machine readable like RSS and XML, using a URL structure that was simple and human readable. This approach to sharing bookmarks would set the stage for future APIs, in making APIs easy to understand for developers and even non-developers alike. Any slightly technical user could easily parse the XML or RSS, and develop or reverse engineer widgets and apps around del.icio.us content.</p>
<p>del.icio.us has been sold twice since its early popularity, which included to Yahoo! in 2005 and AVOS Systems on April, 2011. However del.icio.us was one of the pillar platforms that ushered in the social era of the API movement, establishing sharing via APIs as critical to the API economy, but also showing that simple rules when it comes to API design.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2013</span>
        <p>There are plenty of tools and services you can use to manage your API and its developer community.  But there is no platform that provides as much benefit and versatility as <a title="Github" href="http://github.com">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Github is a social coding platform that developers have grown to love and respect.  With a high level of adoption by developers, and the versatility of the features available on Github, API providers have developed many innovative ways to use the platform to manage an API.</p>
<p><a title="Github" href="http://github.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have documented eleven approaches to using Github for API management to date:</p>

</ul>
<p>This list does not represent all the uses of Github for an API, but the approaches I've seen used by open API providers.  Not all APIs are created or managed equally and these approaches to using Github can be applied in many different ways, even within private platforms.</p>
<p>Github is about social coding and file versioning, an approach that offers huge benefits to API management practices.  You want all aspects of your API operations to be social and versioned allowing it to evolve over time--Github handles this like no other platform.</p>
<p>Consider Github as the core of your API operations and think about which of these eleven approaches you can use to make sure your API is as successful possible.</p>

        <p><a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-days-madrid/api-days-editerranea-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just got back from Madrid, Spain, where I spoke at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIdays Mediterranea</a>.  I really enjoy the API Days format, because the events are small, intimate API learning and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>While at API Days I got to hang out with many of the usual suspects Andy Thurai of <a title="API Management" href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/api-management">Intel</a>, Guillaume Balas of <a title="API Management" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, Ronnie Mitra of <a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a>, Bruno Pedro of <a title="CloudWork" href="http://cloudwork.com">CloudWork</a>, Swift of <a href="http://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a> and API Days organizer Mehdi Medjaoui of <a href="http://webshell.io">WebShell</a>.</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to re-enforce some existing relationships in person, with Isabelle Mauny of <a title="API Management" href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>, Jeremiah Lee a UX researcher from SF and Eduardo Basterrechea and Elena Alvarez of <a href="http://www.apicultur.com/en/">Apicultur</a>.</p>

<p>API Days Mediterranea was a great introduction to the API innovation occurring in Spain, and a great opportunity to have conversations with companies and developers from the region, and hear the challenges they face in getting the word out about APIs in their country.</p>
<p>I really dig going to new regions and helping spreading the API gospel.  Thank you so much to Apicultur for bringing me out, and Webhsell and <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">Fabernovel</a> for helping organize.  Also don't forget 3Scale, Intel, <a title="Email" href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a> and WSO2 for organizing.</p>
<p>I can't wait for the next edition of API Days, the model really works well for planting the necessary seeds in new regions to get the API conversation going.  Next up is API Days San Francisco (no seed planting required), but there will be other cities added, so make sure and step up if you'd like to see API Days in your city!</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-urge-court-block-copyright-claims-oracle-v-google-api-fight"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/google-v-oracle-brief.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-urge-court-block-copyright-claims-oracle-v-google-api-fight">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recently filed a a brief</a> in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, urging the court to block copyright claims in the Oracle v. Google legal battle.  The EFF approached me several months ago to provide feedback for the brief.   I sent over my research and published some of my thoughts to <a href="/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">Help EFF Make Case For No Copryight on APIs</a> and why <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/12/08/api-copyright-would-restrict-api-interoperability/">API Copyright Would Restrict API Interoperability</a> and also lent my support as one of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">Signatories to the Computer Scientists&rsquo; Amicus Brief</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a summarized version of the arguement:</p>
<blockquote><em>As computer scientists, amici have relied on the open nature of APIs and the programs built on them to create and operate new software.  Amici depend on APIs remaining open to sustain wide spreads compatibility standards used by startups and incumbents alike.  Reversing the District Court would dangerously undermine the settled expectations of computer scientists who rely on the open nature of APis. </em><ol style="padding-left: 25px; list-style-type: upper-roman; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces were essential to the development of modern computers and the Internet</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>The BIOS of the Original IBM-Compatible PC</em></li>
<li><em>Major modern operating system reimplement the ground break UNIX API</em></li>
<li><em>The C programming language became universal because of its uncopyrightable interface</em></li>
<li><em>Computers rely on the uncopyrightable nature of APIs and network protocols to communicate over the Internet</em></li>
<li><em>The uncopyrightable nature of APIs for the industry standards for cloud computing</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces spur the creation of software that otherwise would not be written</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces allow software that makes different systems compatible<br /></em></li>
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces help programmers develop completely new capabilities for software</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Copyright in interfaces would creat an "orphan software" problem</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces protect both developers and users<br /></em></li>
<li><em>The orphan software problem disproportionately affects the public sector</em></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<blockquote><em> Conclusion: </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The freedom to reimplement and extend existing aPIs has undoubtedly led to robust software and hardware industries, but also to an explosion of technological advances that do more than merely increase companies' bottom line.  They open the world for the sharing of information, increased communication, and technological advances that could never have been contemplated.</em></blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-computer-scientists">full brief that was filed over at EFF</a>.  Keeping APIs open, and free from copyright is something I am passionate about and feel very strongly that it is critical to a healthy, vibrant online economy.</p>
<p>I'm confident that the Judge will throw out Oracle's case, but I do no think this is the last time we'll see a company step up and try to apply copyright to APIs.</p>
<p>I'm very thankful for the EFF and the other computer scientists who researched and supported the brief.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/29/have-you-checked-out-webshell-lately/">Have You Checked Out Webshell Lately?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://webshell.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Have you checked out what the <a title="Webshell.io" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell.io</a> team is up to lately? &nbsp;I know I haven't been in there for a couple months, and it looks like they've been heads down making some interesting improvements.</p>
<h3>New Cloud IDE</h3>
<p>Rather than re-invent the wheel, Webshell has integrated <a title="Cloud9" href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>&nbsp;web-based IDE, into the API scripting platform:</p>
<p><a href="ttps://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h3>New Documentation</h3>
<p>They overhauled their platform documentation on the continuous mission to make them more valuable by developers:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-2.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h3>New API Explorer</h3>
<p>They've changed the API explorer making playing with APIs a better experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-3.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-3.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3>New Codecademy Lesson</h3>
<p>They have created "Webshell 101" course, providing an easy way to understand how Webshell works:<br /><a href="http://7za.r.mailjet.com/redirect/0v8nhcjr7rysybw5poob6n/www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-Gux11/0/1" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" alt="image" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>That is four pretty significant building blocks from the Webshell platform. If your not familiar with some of the innovative API integration Webshell is doing, I recommend checking them out. &nbsp;Also if you haven't taken a fresh look in a while, like me, I recommend taking a moment.</p>
<p>The Webshell team gets the future of API usage, what they are doing via their platform represents a meaningful blend of the technology, business and politics of APIs, providing a model for the programmable web.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/29/api-aggregation-for-federal-government-with-fedapi/">API Aggregation For Federal Government with FedAPI</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Fed-API-Logo-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been tracking on what I call API aggregation for some time now.  I started seeing the <a href="/2010/11/19/universal-apis/" target="_blank">API aggregation trends in 2010</a>, then I saw this pick up in 2011 with the emergence of providers like <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=34" target="_blank">Singly</a> and <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=35" target="_blank">Adigami</a>.</p>
<p>While many new companies provide you with interoperability and automation between multiple APIs, I consider aggregators to be about bringing together multiple APIs into a single aggregated end-point for developers to use, then also providing potentially new APIs that are only possible, because of the aggregation.</p>
<p>Last year, after I started spending more time in Washington DC, I met a talented group of folks who were playing around with the idea of an aggregate API for federal government.  In the last couple weeks it looks like they were serious about it, and launched the debut version of <a href="http://fedapi.com/">Fed{API}</a>.</p>
<p>Fed{API} is looking to make government data more accessible and reusable by taking data from multiple sources, some easy to pull and some much more difficult, then collect, correlate and catalog into a single, aggregate API stack that developers can put to use.</p>
<p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/fedapi/fedapi-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API Aggregation</a>.  I think this is the future of standardizing APIs and data across many sources, but as I'm watching providers tackle this, you begin to realize what a massive undertaking it will be.  And FedAPI is looking to do this by opening up federal government data, which by itself is a massive challenge.  So FedAPI is tackling two pretty massive problems, as a core business model.</p>
<p>Even with the massive challenge ahead, I will be supporting FedAPI 100%, and doing what I can to make sure their initiative is successful. To do so, I think they will have to get two other groups involved:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Other API Aggregate Providers</strong> - FedAPI needs to make sure and reach out to Singly, Temboo, Adigami and the other API aggregators and see what they can learn, share knowledge and wisdom.  Aside from FedAPI, all these providers need to work together and not re-invent the wheel when it comes to Auth and API connectors</li>
<li><strong>Public At Large</strong> - FedAPI has to introduce tools that allow figure everyday Joe and Jane citizen into the equation.  Some users are going to be very knowledgable and passionate about specific areas, and there has to be ways to share the load and let them help clean and verify data, and other meaningful tasks</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/fedapi/fedapi-capital.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I don't think that API Aggregation is the answer to all the problems that plague API integration, but I think API aggregators will play a major role in helping standardize API interfaces, data formats and provide critical cross-provider, inter-agency knowledge and wisdom--something individual API providers may never be able to deliver alone.</p>
<p>One thing I want to lend a hand with, when it comes to FedAPI, is help create the blueprint of which federal agencies already have APIs and open data sets, and where these exists.  I can also be the aggregator of news, analysis and best practices across the federal API landscape.</p>
<p>I'm on board FedAPI, let's make this happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p>Expansion is in the air.  Quarterly reports are in, we are moving into summer and companies like Twilio, Evernote, Salesforce and Foursquare are expanding and growing at healthy, steady paces.</p>
<p>Mobile is king.  I'm having trouble keeping up with the new mobile players in different niche areas, as well as all the big players paying strong attention to the mobile space including Yahoo, SAP, Intel and beyond. BaaS will continue to be a dominate theme throughout 2013.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things is prominent with tech blogosophere coverage, webinars and new companies rolling out IOT APIs and technology. &nbsp;As we see the rhetoric step up on autombiles, homes, buildings and other fast growing IOT areas we'll continue to see new companies and investment, the trick will be to sort through it all and make sense.</p>
<p>API management is definitely on everyone's minds.  I'm seeing existing PaaS platforms make plays with API management tools, new database to API discussions and all the big players are as active &nbsp;as ever, even Mashery and Layer 7 after their recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>API testing, monitoring and other developer focused tools is my favorite new area to research lately.  I'm seeing an explosion in this area with high profile launches from Runscope, TheRightAPI and a strong presence from existing players like SmartBear and Pingdom.</p>
<p>A new area I'm adding to my API trends monitoring is around what is being called Single Page Applications (SPA).  There was a great talk by Steve Willmott of 3Scale this week at Gluecon on the relationship between SPA and APIs.  But I'm also seeing major movement from devs and API providers in use of SPA oriented frameworks and libraries like Angular.js, Ember.js, Knockout.js and Backbone.js.</p>
<p>Beyond testing and monitoring, security is an important theme.  As the API space expands, the concern for securing APIs and their accompanying web apps is growing.  We are seeing major providers continue the roll-out of two-step verification, as well as security and identity providers stepping up to offer services in the space.</p>
<p>Overall the space is showing healthy expansion.  New APIs, service provers and tools are emerging, while the existing players are expanding at a healthy rate.  It has been a good spring for the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-stack/api-stack-logo.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Over the last year I've worked hard to standardize and automate as much of my monitoring of the API space as I can. The amount of information I was monitoring daily was getting overwhelming--I needed to scale what I do, so I created what I call my <a href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API Stack Ranking</a>.</p>
<p>The API Stack Ranking is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not meant </span>to be a top 25 list, it is meant to be a ranking that I can sort companies by each week, giving me a meaningful stack of companies, who are doing interesting things in the API space.</p>
<p>Each week I publish my <a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank">API Stack</a>, but you can also see this influence on any of my research areas. &nbsp;If you go to <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> or the <a title="Backend as a Service (BaaS)" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">Backend as a Service (BaaS</a>) research projects, the providers are sorted by their ranking for the week.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing my stack each week, I'd like to also share the criteria I use to determine my stack. &nbsp;Currently I bundle my signals into three areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Signals within control of the companies I'm monitoring      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Has a Blog</li>
<li>Number of Blog Posts</li>
<li>Has a Twitter Account</li>
<li>Number of Tweets</li>
<li>Has Github Account</li>
<li>Number of Github Repositories</li>
<li>Number of Commits Across Repositories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>External</strong> - Signals from the public, outside of the companies control that I'm monitoring      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Number of Twitter Followers</li>
<li>Number of @Mentions for Twitter</li>
<li>Blogsphere (Techcrunch, GigaOm, ReadWrite, etc) Posts</li>
<li>Social Bookmark (Hacker News, Reddit, StumbleUpon) Links</li>
<li>Stack Exchange Reference</li>
<li>Number of Github Followers</li>
<li>Number of Github Stars</li>
<li>Number of Github Forks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analyst</strong> - Signals that are dependent on what I personally see and feel is important      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Curated News</li>
<li>Curated News I Write Notes About</li>
<li>Syndicate to Twitter</li>
<li>Syndicate to LinkedIn</li>
<li>Syndicate to G+</li>
<li>Publish story on API Evangelist</li>
<li>Vote Up&nbsp;</li>
<li>Vote Down</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My API Stack Ranking is always in flux.  I'm considering other signals like job postings, events as well as sentiment analysist, but this listing represents what I'm currently evaluating to generate my stack each week.</p>
<p>While internal signals give me a good idea of what a company is up to, and the external signals give me some idea regarding what the open developer community is saying, it all really comes down to the analyst part of the algorithm. &nbsp;A company may tweet a lot, but its up to me to decide if those tweets are valuable.</p>
<p>The API Stack Ranking isn't perfect. &nbsp;But it has allowed me to quadruple the amount of information I take in, and surface what I feel are the real stories and reflect the companies that are truly impacting the API space each week.</p>
<p>I have also been able to expand the API Stack Ranking to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> business or topical sector I wish now, much like I applied to <a title="BaaS" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">BaaS</a> I'm now evaluating <a title="Federal Government" href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com">federal government</a>, <a title="healthcare" href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com">healthcare</a> and other sectors in the same way.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me directly about the API Stack, and the data and content I produce each week. &nbsp;I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/28/new-features-from-baas-provider-anypresence/">New Features From BaaS Provider AnyPresence</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.anypresence.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/anypresense_logo_New.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm adding some new BaaS features I found in a recent press release from BaaS provider <a title="AnyPresence" href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a> titled, "<a href="http://www.anypresence.com/press-release/AnyPresence_Launches_4th-Generation_Mobile_Backend_as_a_Service_Platform.php">AnyPresence Launches 4th-Generation Mobile Backend-as-a-Service Platform with Unparalleled Enterprise Capabilities</a>", to my list of BaaS features. &nbsp;As I'm processing them I notice they are some pretty significant features:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Application Cloning -&nbsp;</strong>For organizations looking to build multiple apps that have common core functionality with only minor variations, this powerful feature allows them to create a copy of an existing app along with all data source, object, and user interface definitions, saving significant development effort.</li>
<li><strong>Automated App UI Testing -&nbsp;</strong>Developers who use AnyPresence to generate a starter mobile app user interface (UI), now get the added benefit of functional test scripts for native iOS, native Android, and jQuery Mobile web apps. These test scripts can be run to ensure the app is interacting with backend functionality as expected, saving time in testing and improving reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Server Extensions -&nbsp;</strong>While developers have always been able to add custom code to objects within AnyPresence, they can now create re-usable &ldquo;Extensions&rdquo; that can be shared across teams or lines of business. This also enables third parties to encapsulate their services as official AnyPresence Extensions, enabling a marketplace of add-ons that can be used across the AnyPresence customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise App Store Integration -&nbsp;</strong>AnyPresence now supports the ability to deploy apps to employees directly via enterprise app stores powered by Mobile Application Management (MAM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. Apperian EASE is first MAM partner solution to be integrated directly with the AnyPresence Designer.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure Management -&nbsp;</strong>For the default cloud backend server deployment to Heroku, administrators can now control the performance characteristics of their app, and choose from hundreds of Heroku add-ons, directly from the AnyPresence Designer. This seamless integration enables developers to plan for the required capacity and usage of each individual backend server instance, and manage them from one central location.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to interpret each BaaS provider's products and services, and establish any sort of common definition, but applicaiton cloning, automated testing, custom server extensions and enterprise app stores are pretty straight-forward and powerful BaaS features.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see where AnyPresence goes with their custom extensions. &nbsp;I think whoever can do this part of BaaS correctly will win the BaaS world championships! (That is an award, right?)</p>
<p>Lot's of exciting stuff coming from the BaaS sector lately! &nbsp;Fun space to watch.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/27/api-management-using-apiphany/">API Management Using APiphany</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 May 2013</span>
        <p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-logo-blue.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm working my way through all the <a title="API management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management providers</a>, making sure I'm up to speed on what service each provider is offering these days.  As part of this work I've been playing with the <a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank">Apiphany</a> platform, using a demo site the Apiphany team was so kind to setup for me.</p>
<p>Using Apiphany I can manage my APIs, and launch a portal which allows me to hang all my APIs, then manage all aspects of their operations. Apiphany focuses on the three main components of API deployment &amp; consumption:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - API resources and their operations you've deployed and would like to hang and manage via your Apiphany portal</li>
<li><strong>Products</strong> - Virtual products you create, which allow access to various combinations of API resources and operations</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - Applications that are registered with the platform, and consuming APIs via various product subscriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>The way Apiphany sets up the systems is very intuitive, giving you quick, administrative control over the systems you will need to execute on either a very simple, or even a very complex API strategy.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-apis.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>APIs</strong></span><br /> Apiphany provides all the basics for API management, allowing you to add to endpoints, manage the title, description and manage operations for each endpoint, allowing you to define service operations to enable service documentation, interactive API console, per operation limits, request/response validation, and operation-level statistics.  Beyond the basics you can mask APIs, implement sophisticated caching and import overall API definitions from a WADL, Google Discovery Document, Swagger or OData format.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/aiphany-import.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Products</strong></span><br /> After you have all your raw API resources defined, you can move to define your "products", composed from your valuable API resources. The Apiphany product manager allows you to provide names and descriptions for your products, choose who has access and whether their are published or unpublished and the terms of use for any developer who subscribes to a product.  API product management takes a lot of work, experience and creativity--the Apiphany management system makes it something anyone can do.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Policies</strong></span><br />The policies management area of Apiphany is where it gets seriously powerful.  Using the products, APIs and their operations, you can define granular level policies that are essential to API operations.  Policies can range from converting XML to JSON, providing JSONP or simply setting headers for specific APIs operations, and potentially within as specific product composition.  Policies gives you a library of common policies that are used across the API industry via easy to apply templates, but also allow you to define custom Node.js policies.  The ability to define and apply policies across products, APIs and their operations provides a very modular, reusable and granular control over all aspects of your API platform.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-policies-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>APIs, Products and Policies are the heart of the Apiphany API management solution.  These provide the essential operational building blocks every API owner will need to execute an API platform. Apiphany also provides the necessary CMS framework to manage and support the developer portal, which wraps around your products, APIs and operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Portal Management System</strong></span><br /> The APIPhany solution gives you full control over a developer portal to hang products, APIs and operations within--giving yuo control to customize the look, navigation of the portal with full page, content and media management. The Apiphany API Portal comes complete with the essential building blocks like documentation, blog, support and other CMS essentials to support an API platform.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-dashboard.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Analytics</strong></span><br /> Apiphany has added a pretty robust suite of API analytics that allow you manage the most common aspects of API operations, in the following three areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Usage - Calls and bandwidth</li>
<li>Health - Status code, cache and API response time</li>
<li>Activity - By developer, product, API and operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apiphany analytics package allow you to filter by products and operations broken down by default dates like today, yesterday and 7,30,90 day or custom timelines. It gives you the basics of what you will need to be in tune with your API operations and make short or long term decisions for your API roadmap.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Developers</strong></span><br /> Developers are central to any API operations and Apiphany provides the tools you will need to manage developer details and their subscriptions to products, and how their applications are using API resources. Apiphany gives you the control to block, reset and define access levels and roles for each of your developers, providing the control you need to manage your API ecosystem.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-developer.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is my first deep dive into the Apiphany API management platform. I like what I see.  It has all the tools you will need to define, secure, manage and evolve your APIs. Deploying APIs requires a certain level of understanding of APIs, but with Apiphany anyone could take a set of API endpoints and transform and evolve them into some meaningful API driven products.</p>
<p>After spending some time playing with what is possible with the Apiphany platform I'm left with thoughts about how I could craft products around the API resources I have.  I feel like I could easily define some pretty robust API products developers could subscribe to and integrate with.  But I also feel like I could easily iterate and add products, policies and create new APIs and operations to better meet potential consumers needs with very little effort.</p>
<p>I'm going to continue setting up my API infrastructure with Apiphany, and help me understand what is possible.  I'd love to have my core platform available on all self-service API platforms, helping me understand where the space is at, and what each company brings to the table.</p>

<p>I have been using <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> to manage my code for a couple years now, but in the last year I'm using Github more often for a variety of projects that don't always have code involved--examples ranging from <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/">hosting slide decks for my talks</a> to repositories for my <a href="/trends/">API research projects</a>.</p>
<p>In the last couple months I've noticed I'm not the only one using Github to organize projects, check out of a few of these examples:</p>

<p>Github lends itself to managing markup and markdown documents in a very collaborative way, allowing for tracking issues and revisions along the way.  There is something about the open source process that introduces transparency and visibility into the document creation and management process.</p>
<p>I'm wll keep tracking on the innovative ways I'm seeing Github used.  So far I'm pretty impressed with the different ways I'm seeing Github used. &nbsp;If you know of any other interesting ways, please send my way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 May 2013</span>
        <p>I wanted to share a quick visualization of the beneifts of&nbsp;<a title="Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama's Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API</a><span>, following&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a><span>, and part of the Whitehouse CIO's strategy, entitled "</span><a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a><span>" and the potential of the recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf">Open Data Executive Order and accompanying Open Data Policy</a>. </span></p>
<p>Each federal agency should have three things available online at their domain:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>agency.gov/digitalstrategy/</li>
<li>agency.gov/data</li>
<li>agency.gov/developers/</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are three pretty important signals in the API space. &nbsp;This represents each agencies technology roadmap, data and developer resources. Which can be some pretty interesting signals for the overall health of a federal agency.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, let's look at the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Let's go to: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy">http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy</a></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/energy-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/data/">http://energy.gov/data/</a></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/energy-data.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Then: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/developer/">http://energy.gov/data/</a></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/energy-developer.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>After the Department of Energy, let's take a look at another agency, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
<p>Let's go to: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://irs.gov/digitalstrategy">http://irs.gov/digitalstrategy</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Next: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://irs.gov/data">http://irs.gov/data</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Then: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://irs.gov/developer">http://irs.gov/developer</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Granted, these are two very different agencies.  But I can't help but think that the IRS should hand out a copy of the White House Open Data Policy internally, and figure out how they can begin to let a little light into their operations and culture.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://okfn.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-knowledge-foundation/open-knowledge-foundation-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm reading <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2013/05/24/irs-turn-over-a-new-leaf-open-up-data/">IRS: Turn Over a New Leaf, Open Up Data</a>, from the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> blog.  I'll let you read it in its entirety, but these are the points that are sticking with me:</p>
<blockquote><em>One of Mr. Werfel&rsquo;s first actions on the job should be the immediate implementation of the groundbreaking Presidential Executive Order and Open Data policy, released last week, that requires data captured and generated by the government be made available in open, machine-readable formats. Doing so will make the IRS a beacon to other agencies in how to use open data to screen any wrongdoing and strengthen law enforcement.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>By sharing readily available IRS data on tax-exempt organizations, encouraging Congress to pass a budget proposal that mandates release of all tax-exempt returns in a machine-readable format, and increasing the transparency of its own processes, the agency can begin to turn the page on this scandal and help rebuild trust and partnership between government and its citizens.</em></blockquote>
<p><em><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs/irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></em></p>
<blockquote><em>Making IRS data open won&rsquo;t solve every problem; the recent scandal has proven that the IRS must be more transparent about both the information it collects, but also how it manages that information. A commitment on day one to share the data it collects in a machine readable manner would show true leadership by Mr. Werfel and help solidify the Obama administration&rsquo;s legacy as an open government.</em></blockquote>
<p>From my vantage point, in the world of APIs--I can't help but feel the solution to our "big government" illnesses is a little API therapy. &nbsp;The Open Data Policy has set the bar, and its up to the individual agencies to pay attention.</p>
<p>APIs are not just a technical band-aid.   APIs start with a technical seed, but if a business or government entity internalizes the concepts around opening up, providing access, and setting up a feedback look with the public, partners or even with other departments, they will potentially let in a little sunlight.  Something that can go a long way in preventing many of the illnesses we often associate with "big government".</p>
<p>I'm optimistic that the IRS can regain its footing.  I'm <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">seeing a lot of API and open data innovation coming out of the federal government lately</a>.  For such a controversial entity like the IRS to recover, they will need to open up, and communicate with the public, in a way that only APis can provide.</p>

<p>Using the DeveloperForce sandbox you can create copies of your data, allowing you to develop, test or train against, not just a sandbox, but a relevant and meaningful copy of your company's data.</p>
<p>The Force.com sandbox has always allowed you to create a separate copy of your data, but now they let you create sandbox templates, allowing you to create specific data sets that you can reuse in different ways.</p>
<p>Seeing this feature coming out of Salesforce has prompted me to take a closer look at their approach to the DeveloperForce sandbox environment.  I'm sure there are other features and approaches to sandboxing we can learn from the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.</p>

<p>I just had a demo of some of the new features in the <a title="API Manager" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/">WSO2 API Manager</a>.   Since WSO2 is one of my partners, I have a regular call with them to discuss the space and I often get demos of their new products and features.</p>
<p>Today's topic was <a href="http://wso2.org/library/articles/2013/05/multitenant-api-management-new-wso2-api-manager-140">multi-tenacy in their API Management platform</a>, meaning&nbsp;you can easily deploy multiple API portals using the platform.  Not every company will need more than one API portal, but for some companies that are further along, it provides a pretty sophisticated way to engage with API consumers.</p>
<p>When it comes to slicing and dicing your APIs, we usually segment our API resources by service level, apps and users.  WSO2 introduces a fourth layer--by the domain.  So now you can group API resources under domains, crafting different "API storefronts" for your consumers.</p>
<p>I'm still thinking through all of the opportunities with API management multi-tenancy, but at first thought, it will help me counteract many of the questions I get around a company's concern that APIs have to be public.  Most companies have learned about APIs from the popularity of public APIs, so I spend a lot of time explaining the opportunities for internal or partner APis.</p>
<p>The WSO2 approach to API management multi-tenancy allows me to help companies understand that unlimited ways they can provide access to their valuable resources in not just public, private ways, but to any group, user base or target audience in a very organized and branded way.</p>
<p>You can hear me, and Chris Haddad VP, Technology Evangelism at WSO2 discuss multi-tenancy as part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2013/06/your-api-branding-strategy">Your API Branding Strategy</a> webinar on Thursday, June 13, 2013.</p>

<p>Cloud storage of documents is becoming commonplace. Individuals, companies, government and non-government organizations have increasingly seen the potential of storing files in the cloud using services like Amazon S3, Dropbox and Box.</p>
<p>As a web or mobile application developer, it is becoming more common to provide integration, syncing or even direct usage of popular cloud storage services like Dropbox as the application's storage system.</p>
<p>This last week I started playing with Dave Winer's (<a href="/admin/blog/davewiner">@davewiner</a>) simple idea outliner, notepad, todo list and project organizer--<a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>.</p>
<p>What caught my attention is Dave's use of Dropbox as the central storage for the app.  It reminds me of another application I use called <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a>, which uses Github as the central storage system for the app.</p>
<p>I really dig this approach to delivering, dead-simple, meaningful apps like Fargo, that don't re-invent the wheel and focus on delivering value on top of the existing tools and platforms we already use.</p>
<p>I asked Dave what his thoughts are on this approach, in which he simply replied:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">kinlane</a> -- works like a dream</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
</div>
<p>I like Dave's approach to app development which is about delivering simple, useful apps that that sensibly put APIs to use, and establish a foundation using open formats like OPML.</p>
<p>As the hardware and operating systems developers depend on continues being vritualized and migrating into the cloud, the usage of open formats and common, API driven cloud resources like storage from Dropbox, will be common among successful app developers.</p>
<p>I think Dropbox as your apps default file system is here to stay.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://datasift.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm increasingly finding a company's approach to using Github, a vital signal of the health of a company, their team, and the products and services they are delivering.</p>
<p>An example of this is with social data platform, <a href="http://datasift.github.io/">DataSift's new open source area</a>.  DataSift has thrown up a Github page which re-enforces the company's commitment to consuming and producing open source software, as well as a list of important, Github driven signals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Latest Updates</strong> - The latest repository updates acorss all of DataSift's repositories</li>
<li><strong>API Client Libraries</strong> - Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and other client libraries for the DataSift API</li>
<li><strong>Public Github Repos</strong> - Other tools and utilities that are avaiable via DataSift Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Job Vacancies</strong> - A listing of current job openings at DataSift</li>
</ul>
<p>I think DataSift approach is a very meaningful demonstration in the potential of being "open". &nbsp;As a company, DataSift provides access to valuable social signals, that any company can access via their interface and API, allowing them to develop insight and intelligence.  If you look closely at their approach to deploying their Github hosted, open source site, it provides four very critical signals.  API client libraries, open source code projects, job openings and updates across the company's Github profile.</p>
<p><a href="http://datasift.github.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-open-source.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Think about it.  The number of platforms supported for an API, the number of public open source code projects and the number and type of job postings for a company are pretty significant signals regarding the health of a company these days. &nbsp;These can be pretty difficult areas to fake, and in many cases will quickly show the activity, growth and stability of a company.</p>
<p>I like DataSift's approach to their Open Source area.  It doesn't just provide code and tools for developers to be successful, it provides us a deeper look into how DataSift operates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the 1,640 tech companies I monitor, 751 of them have Github accounts. &nbsp;I think many of these companies can learn a lot from DataSift's approach to open source and how you can put Github to use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/digital-services-innovation-center.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm working through the wave of API innovation coming out of our Federal Government recently. During normal days at API Evangelist, I'm pulling private sector API usage examples and crafting them into stories to help the Federal Government execute on their API own strategies.  Today, I'd like to showcase something the Federal Government is doing, in hopes that more companies in the private API sector will emulate as part of their API strategies.</p>
<p>The GSA's&nbsp;<a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/">Digital Services Innovation Center</a> has launched the <a href="http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/">Mobile Code Catalog</a>, an open source catalog of web and native applications that government agencies can use to jump-start their projects. Think application showcase, but all the applications are open source and allow for your API developers to download, fork and re-use code.</p>
<p>The idea of a code catalog is pretty interesting, and I see it as an evolution of several API building blocks I talk about--code samples, SDKs, starter kits and application showcase all rolled into one.  Imagine if your API consumers can come into your developer area and not just find code samples, they can find complete applications that they can download, reverse-engineer and put to use.  Talk about going from zero to API integration in as short of time as possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/mobile-code-catalog.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I know that many API owners compete with their ecosystems, by deploying their own version of their mobile, web or desktop apps, but for the others a code catalog is an excellent way to facilitate integrations with your platform.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about the Digital Services Innovation Center Mobile Code Catalog, is that the catalog itself is open source and hosted on Github.  This is a whole other aspect of the innovation around a code catalog, that the catalog itself can be downloaded, forked and published anywhere on a public website or private portal.</p>
<p>I envision hundreds of code catalogs available in the near future, across many business, government and NGO sectors.  While there is money in building proprietary apps on top of APIs, I think there is even more money to be made when you put meaningful, high quality apps in the hands of end-users.</p>

<p>I was looking through <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/the-api-and-appification-of-the-web">Steve Willmott's slide deck</a> from his talk at <a title="GlueCon" href="http://www.gluecon.com/">GlueCon</a> this week, called <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/the-api-and-appification-of-the-web">The API- &amp; App-ification of the Web</a>.</p>
<p>He talks about the evolution towards Single Page Web Applications (SPA).  Which is the migration <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">from</span> static web pages and database driven web apps to dynamically driven HTML, CSS and JavaScript apps designed using popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - Ember<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span> is an open-source client-side JavaScript web application framework based on the model-view-controller (MVC) software architectural pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page applications<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">[</span>1] by incorporating common idioms and best practices into a framework that provides a rich object model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, automatically-updating templates powered by Handlebars<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span>, and a router for managing application state</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running what <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">are known</span> as single-page applications. Its goal is to augment browser-based applications with model&ndash;view&ndash;controller (MVC) capability, in an effort to make both development and testing easier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - Backbone<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span> gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Single page applications have benefits like speed, no page reloads, mobile optimization, real-time pushes, notifications and they just look <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">freak'n</span> cool.  But there are also downsides like needing some healthy JavaScript talent to maintain, SEO issues and a general deviation from the linked, document driven web we are used to.</p>
<p>The popularity of frameworks and libraries like Ember, Angular and Backbone, and the Single Page Application approach isn't something just developers are noticing.  Some top platforms are seeing the potential, and providing code and toolkits for integrating using Ember, Angular and Backbone:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

</ul>
<p>With the popularity of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and growing number of <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">SPAs</span>, there is a huge opportunity for API providers to offer API driven libraries and widgets that are plug and play with frameworks like Angular and Ember, and are compatible with libraries like Backbone.</p>
<p>As I monitor the API space I will continue looking for examples of APIs doing interesting things with Ember, Angular and Backbone. Let me know if you see anything I should take a look at.</p>

<p>I just got back from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I visited Dallas last night to help kick off the first gathering of the DFW API Professionals Meetup.</p>
<p>We got together at Microsoft around 6PM and I talked from 6:30 until 8:00, evolving on my <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/api-meetup-dallas-tx/web-to-programmableweb-to-programmableworld/index.html#/" target="_blank">From Web, to ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld</a> talk.</p>

<p>The meetup was about 45 people ranging from developers to investors.  I showed up with a lot of content, but I wanted to make sure and cover the full API spectrum, while also introducing some new content about specifically about API consumption.</p>
<p>During the event I had some time to get to know the <a href="http://www.therightapi.com/">theRightAPI</a>, <a title="BAaS" href="http://www.proxomo.com/">Proxomo</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 Technologies</a>&nbsp;<span>and&nbsp;</span><a title="Tech Efficiency and Innovation" href="http://www.parivedasolutions.com/">Pariveda Solutions</a> folks--while connecting with the rest of the meet up group members.</p>
<p><a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/att-foundry.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Then, this morning theRightAPI crew brought me out to Plano, TX to the <a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/">AT&amp;T Foundry</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/attfoundry">@attfoundry</a>), where I got to talk with Vincent Button (<a href="https://twitter.com/vebutton">@vebutton</a>) and Jennifer Conley (<a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferconley">@jenniferconley</a>).  I was a little blown away by what I saw.  It wasn't what I was used when visiting the campuses of big telco companies in the past.  The facility was something you associate with Silicon Valley and Bay Area. Open layout with a variety of people working on things ranging from voice solutions to the internet of things.</p>
<p><a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/gravity-center/gravity-center-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards, Jennifer walked us up to the <a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/">Gravity Center</a>, which has been provided access to AT&amp;T and Alcatel-Lucent resources to support multiple startups in the North Texas area.  I got to meet to the <a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/">BookShout</a> team and hear about how they are navigating and working to change the book publishing space, while allowing people to discover books, and build social networks around books and authors.</p>
<p><a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bookshout/bookshout-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm pretty impressed with what I saw in Texas in the last 48 hours.  I met some pretty tech savvy people building interesting startups, putting APIs to use in meaningful ways, and a community around them that is investing in what they are doing. While I was there, I saw all the same elements for startup success I see in Silicon Valley, but without much of the hype.</p>
<p>I was stoked to be able to help kick off the DFW API Professionals Meetup Group.  I appreciate theRightAPI for bringing me out, and  Proxomo, Layer 7 and Pariveda Solutions for making it happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 May 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dark-matter.jpeg" border="0" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I encounter many enterprise folks who dismiss APIs as nothing more that just one of the technical building blocks of SOA.  Folks who, no matter how much I explain, will never see APIs beyond a technical specification and implementation.</p>
<p>API Evangelist solely exists to shed light on not just the technology of APIs, but the equally important business and politics of the APIs.  It is the business and political building blocks that help the concept of API grow beyond just its technical roots.</p>
<p>An API won't  find success just because you made a resource available via a URL. An API is successful because it is logically priced, possibly has revenue sharing, code samples to jumpstart integration and a support and resource network that a developer can tap into.  An API is successful because it is open and self-service, but sensibly secured, providing a terms of service that benefit API owners, and developers, while also protecting the interests of end users.</p>
<p>APIs bring together a unique blend of technology, business and politics into a transparent, self-service mix that can foster innovation. As someone who is heavily invested at the enterprise scope, it can be difficult to see things through this lens sometimes.  You will need to upgrade your prescription with the eye doctor.</p>
<p>Why "API" is working is not just a REST+JSON technical answer, there is a dark matter that binds the whole movement together, while also providing the right about of lubricant and oxygen necessary for innovation. In the enterprise you will often see this dark matter as governance, in the world of APIs it will have a lot of the same characteristics as your governance, but it is actually the exact opposite of governance.</p>
<p>I don't expect to convert all you enterprise folks to see APIs like I do. I don't think you are equipped to view the dark matter that keep the API movement expanding and moving forward. You are focused on seeing things through another lense of control and about the extraction of value--a lense that will always prevent you from seeing the dark matter that makes APIs an evolution beyond SOA.</p>

<p>I've been tracking on a trend in the API space that I call <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API aggregation</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://singly.com" title="Singly">Singly</a> and <a href="http://www.adigami.com/" title="Adigami">Adigami</a> are aggregating APIs into more meaningful API stacks, than any single API provider can deliver on their own.</p>
<p>In my regular monitoring, I'm always on the hunt for examples of the benefits of API Aggregation, and last week I saw some pretty interesting payment gateway data being provided by payment API aggregator <a href="http://spreedly.com" title="Payment API Aggregator">Spreedly</a>--which definitely reflects the positive effects I'm looking to shine light on in the space. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly is a cloud based credit card vault</a> that allows you to work with one or multiple payment gateways over time or simultaneously, and has published some pretty interesting <a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/">analysis of failed transaction rates across multiple payment gateways</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/spreedly/spreedly-success-failure-stats.png" border="0" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'll let you head over to Spreedly to <a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/">read the analysis</a>.  What I find interesting is that they are open to sharing this data with the public.  This type of information sharing by API aggregator providers is critical to the overall health of the space. I'm often frustrated by the lack of data that API providers share, because they so often are keeping their cards so close to their chest, trying to protect their valuable business data or often lack of business data.</p>
<p>There is huge opportunity for API aggregators to share information about their experience with the common APIs they integrate and aggregate with.  The whole industry can learn from this, but also work its way back upstream to the payment API providers, providing them with insight into how their APIs are operating, but also provide benchmarks of where they stand with their competitors, good or bad.</p>
<p>Let me know if you see any other examples of API aggregators sharing data like <a href="http://spreedly.com" title="Payment API Aggregator">Spreedly</a>.</p>

<p>After looking through the list of folks who have RSVP'd for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/">DFW API Professionals Meetup in Dallas tomorrow night</a>, it looks like an interesting mix of tech and business folk.  The tech group is definitely the larger, with a mix of mobile, web and enterprise.  The business folks look like a mix of VC, project manager, marketing and startups.</p>
<p>I'm heading out to Dallas in the morning, and I am spending my afternoon preparing my talk.  When it comes to meetups, I like to wait until the last moment, see who has RSVP'd and shift my talk to being more tech, more business or more API 101 depending on the audience.

        <span class="post-date">13 May 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/payments-api-broker-spreedly.png" border="0" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I'm monitoring the API space I'm trying to create meaningful grouping for companies to belong when tracking API trends.  My groupings are sometimes in alignment with what we hear in the tech blogosophere, but other times I try new definitions to help expand my monitoring definition and see if I can identify emerging patterns like I'm seeing with <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com" title="Backend as a Service">BaaS</a>.</p>
<p>Each week I do a little more exploration in concept of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com" title="API aggregation">API aggregation</a>, and this week after <a href="/2013/05/13/potential-for-api-aggregators-to-provide-valuable-industry-data/">studying payment API aggregator Spreedly</a>, I'm considering adding a new, overlapping area with aggregation, called API brokers.  Let's see if I can make this work.</p>
<p>API aggregators like <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> are providing personal data access to popular SaaS platforms by aggregating APIs.  You can pull a list of photos from Singly, for a user, and it could pull photos from Flickr, Instagram and Facebook.  This is pretty straightforward API Aggregation.</p>
<p>Other providers like <a href="http://temboo.com" title="Temboo">Temboo</a>, provide this functionality but focus more on the API interoperability or as i call it <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com" title="API reciprocity">API reciprocity</a> side of things.  Temboo does aggregate multiple APIs like Singly, but focuses on providing interoperability as well as aggregation.  While Singly does to, there are differences in their approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly</a> has all the telltale signs of an API aggregator.  They allow you to program against 48 payment gateways in 71 countries.  It has aggregation, but rather than interoperability it seems to be about brokering transactions.  Spreedly can help you choose the gateway based upon location, cost and availability.  Which has all the elements of what I'd consider an API broker.</p>
<p>I envision other new API brokers emerging, in niche areas like images, video or messaging.  Imagine if you could use Twilio, Tropo or other SMS API provider, but use through a broker who will give you the best availability and costs based upon various needs.  This type of API aggregation is not meant for providing users with access to multiple cloud silos via APIs, it is more about brokering API resources and establishing a marketplace.</p>
<p>Not all APIs can be brokered, and maybe Spreedly is unique, but I bet I will find more of this behavior from other companies, once I start looking.  Let me know if you know of any companies who broker API resources in a similar way to Spreedly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restful-labs/restful-labs-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Curently I'm immersed in discovering, vetting and tracking on signals that show me which companies are trending in the API space.  I'm looking for signals that will tell me which companies are making movements on a week to week basis, and when the blogosphere and developer communities are buzzing about these companies and technologies.</p>
<p>Three very important signals I use are blogs, twitter and Github.  These tools provide me with great signals I can use to tune into what a company is doing, when they push code, write a story or tweet about it.  They also provide me with signals of when developers are engaging with API owners, because they follow on Twitter and download, fork, favorite and follow Github repositories.</p>
<p>However, in some scenarios a companies blogs, twitter and Github accounts can also tell me when a company has given up and has run out of money or just stopped putting energy and resources into a project.  An example of this is with a company I came across during my monitoring last week, called <a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank">RESTful Labs</a>. RESTful Labs has all the eye candy to draw me in.  I mean they have REST in their name, and they build tools for developers!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restful-labs/restful-metrics.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>RESTful Labs provides API analytics tools for developers.  I'm pretty stoked anytime I find something like this, then I immediately look at the common signals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Check! - Last blog posted 11 months ago</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Check! - Last Tweet 8 months ago</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Check! - Last commit was 8 months ago</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface, RESTful Labs has all the right signal generators in having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts.  But immediately these signals start working against them, rather than the positive signals I would normally gather from someone having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts.</p>
<p>It is clear that RESTful Labs WAS something last year, but now it is all but a ghost town.  It is not a tool I will recommend anyone use because there is nobody home to support.  Since they have a Github account, there might be resources that can be picked from the bones of the startup, but not much else beyond that.</p>
<p>I keep companies like this in my database, as I want live examples like this to show people, and help them understand how to send the right signals that they are doing good things in the space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2013</span>
        <p>Does anyone else notice the evolution of the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter developer area</a>? The site has taken a page from the LinkedIn playbook and become more about embeddable buttons, badges and widgets than about APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-homepage-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Granted, you can click on documentation and get at the REST API v 1.1. &nbsp;I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing. &nbsp;I'm a big supporter of embeddable strategies for API providers. I think that evolution is very telling of Twitter's API strategy and what type of "developer" they want to support with the API.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with Twitter's overall API strategy, there is a lot to learn from their approach to API driven embeddable tools. &nbsp;I will produce more pieces aobut their approach to cards, timelines, buttons and other embeddable tools.</p>

<p>I've been working on expanding the amount of research and writing I can do via API Evangelist lately.  In the last couple weeks I rolled out new projects in three areas: <a title="API Toolkits" href="/2013/04/27/evolving-beyond-api-service-providers-and-api-tools-to-goal-based-api-toolkits/">API Toolkits</a>, <a href="/2013/04/28/api-trends/">API Trends</a>, <a title="API Priorities" href="/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a>.  This new approach is helping me focus on the areas I think are most important or exciting to the API space and generate as much, high quality news, analysis and white papers for the API space as I can.</p>
<p>The first of my white papers, using my new approach is finished.  The new paper is called <a title="Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space" href="https://apps.facebook.com/marketpage/mu07n26dfwwupqoy6k0xj/item/MWP6Hfn" target="_blank">Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space</a>, and is the aggregation of all my research into the BaaS space.   Here is a breakdown of the white paper:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What is BaaS?</li>
<li>How Does BaaS Differ From IaaS and PaaS?</li>
<li>What Are The Benefits of BaaS?</li>
<li>What Can You Build With BaaS?</li>
<li>Who Are The Top BaaS Providers?</li>
<li>What Are The Common Building Blocks of BaaS?</li>
<li>What Are the Common Approaches to BaaS Pricing?</li>
<li>What Are The Other Approaches to BaaS Pricing?</li>
<li>Who Are The Other BaaS Providers?</li>

<li>What Are The Opportunities in BaaS?</li>
<li>Summing Up BaaS</li>
<li>Appendix A: Full List of BaaS Features</li>
<li>Appendix B: Curated News Sources</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the research, news, analysis and data that went into this white paper is available at <a title="Backend as a Service" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">baas.apievangelist.com</a>.  As I do with most of my work, I will be publishing all my BaaS research to this Github project, allowing anyone to view, fork or download.  The BaaS project will also have a full version, <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/marketpage/mu07n26dfwwupqoy6k0xj/item/MWP6Hfn">available as a PDF for $99.00</a>.  My goal is to subsidize my research via sales of white papers and the support of my partners.  If you can't afford, tune into the BaaS project, but if you'd like to support what I do you can purchase a copy.</p>
<p>I'm working on other papers that are part of all of my <a title="API Toolkits" href="/2013/04/27/evolving-beyond-api-service-providers-and-api-tools-to-goal-based-api-toolkits/">API Toolkits</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/2013/04/28/api-trends/">API Trends</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="API Priorities" href="/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a> research areas.

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/xero/xero-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank">Accounting API platform Xero</a> has been taking a deeper look into the languages that their developers are using when integrating with the Xero API. Currently there are 1,600 active applications communicating with the Xero API, from a mix of Xero add-on partners to custom integrations engineered by 3rd party developers. &nbsp;But which programming languages were they using?</p>
<p>To create a snapshot of what tools developers are using, Xero needed to find the best source to obtain this data. Xero doesn't ask developers which platform they use upon registration, and since Xero doesn't require any sort of user agent or other identifying signature, it was difficult to know where to best acquire the data they needed.</p>
<p>The next best place to look for this data, is with the code samples themselves.  It would be nice, if Xero code samples were hosted using Github where they could track downloads, forks, followers, etc.  But the best they had, was the page views from the pages for each code library, within the Xero developer area.</p>
<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/xero/xero-2013-usage-chart.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using this approach, Xero was able to extract some pretty interesting data about which programming languages developers were clicking on.  Identifying the growing dominance of languages like PHP and the emergence of newer approaches using Node.js.</p>
<p>While Xero was able to learn a lot, I think we all should learn from Xero's story. There is a lot to be learned by other API providers: 1) API integration needs to be language agnostic 2) Working to understand which languages are beings used or in demand from developers, on a regular basis is important.</p>
<p>This seems like a pretty basic topic to some of us, but when an API is born out of a company that has a single language focus, it can be difficult to understand the needs of developers who are using other platforms and languages.</p>
<p>Make sure you prepare an approach to gathering and regularly evaluating data around which languages your API developers are needing to integrate ad work to support that as much as you possibly can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/api-billionaires-club.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the API space, we have to be constantly measuring and looking for signals that will help us understand where we should be focusing our resources, as part of an overall strategy.  One of the ways we measure value within the world of APIs (and business) is using KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators. Using KPIs we strive to measure the Return on our Investment (ROI), as we gamble with the technology, business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>One approach to quantifying the value, that has emerged from API providers, API service providers and the tech blogosphere is using the "API call". It is simple. You launch an API, so you quantify it by the number of times someone calls it.  Kind of like a page view, right?</p>
<p>Out of this eyeball derived reality(which is silly since APIs aren't for humans), the API space has become obsessed with the number of API calls, resulting in what is known as the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/">API billionaires club</a>.  The Billionaires Club is an elite group of tech providers who have billions of calls per month on their API.  It is a pretty simple algorithm. Have API + Have Billions of Requests = Your In The Billionaires Club. And if you are in the billionaires club, you are successful. &nbsp;End of calculation.</p>
<p>To quickly get to the point of my story, let's take one of my favorite members of the API billionaires club, Netflix. &nbsp;Billionaire Club Membership + Shutting Down Public API = Success. It is a different variation on the whole concept of measuring API success. The news, commonly held KPIs and definition of success doesn't immediately pan out in the whole Netflix story.</p>
<p>Netflix, along with Twitter are both &nbsp;API case studies for the history books. Both of these API stories reflect the ups and downs of the API world, and the often bipolar nature of the public API ecosystem and schizophrenic nature of the tech blogosophere.  In contrast, along with Amazon Web Services, Twitter and Twilio, Netflix is a constant player in the stories I tell about success in the API sector. But at the same time, Netflix is considered to be a failure by common public APIs measurements. Are you feeling the crazy? &nbsp;I do!!</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-square.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I've <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">covered before</a>, the blogosphere tends to associate closure of the Netflix, with the ecosystem failures of Twitter.  While this is an easy comparison to make, when you look further, you see a lot more going on. &nbsp;Which tells me we need better ways to measure API success and failure and tell the stories around the ups and downs.</p>
<p>After monitoring the API space for some time now, I'm looking for signals beyond what normal bloggers, analysts and pundits are following. In this hunt, Github is becoming an ever increasing gold mine of signals. &nbsp;To help demonstrate, let's take a look at the signals the <a href="https://github.com/netflix">Netflix Github account</a> puts out.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Priam">Priam</a></strong> - Co-Process for backup/recovery, Token Management, and Centralized Configuration management for Cassandra. (Last updated a day ago)</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/curator">curator</a></strong> - ZooKeeper client wrapper and rich ZooKeeper framework (Last updated 11 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/karyon">karyon</a></strong> - The nucleus or the base container for Applications and Services built using the NetflixOSS ecosystem (Last updated 12 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/edda">edda</a></strong> - Service to track changes in your cloud (Last updated 13 days ago)</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/archaius">archaius</a></strong> - Library for configuration management API (Last updated 17 days ago)</li>

<p>When I pulled this data, several days ago, there are 15 separate repositories, in four separate programming languages, including Python, Java, Groovy, Scala, that have all been updated in the last 30 days. &nbsp;The fact that Netflix has a Github account, has open sourced so much of their code, while also actively maintaining it all, point at some very meaningful signals that we can tune into and work to emulate.</p>
<p>While the number of calls against an API is a valid KPI to measure the potential success of an API, we have to have multiple KPIs when truly trying to understand the value of a company, the platform or any single API resource. &nbsp;Let's not get hung up on any single KPI, let's consider as many as we can--to see what makes sense and truly defines succcess.</p>
<p>There is so much to learn from reading between the lines in the world of APIs.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Internet of Things, APIs have a bright future. I tend to focus on the greater good when showcasing APIs, but occasionally I get tripped up by the market potential of APIs. I came across the <a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/baby-toys-get-an-app-extension/">Baby Toys Get an App Extension</a> post in the New York Times this week, and I can't think of a more lucrative market for API interaction via a smart phone, than a baby or toddler's toys.</p>
<p>First, can you image every mom or dad in America with access to their kids toys via their iPhone.  Talk about an emotional connection.  You have a real-time chord that is attached to a parents heart string.  So if you are at work, missing your child that is at home, in day care, or even when you are at home with them, you have the opportunity to interact with your child via their crib, playstation or other toy? I'm not even going to start profiling the toys and the opportunity here.</p>
<p>Second, can you imagine the data available for toy, clothing and other manufacturers?  You have a daily, permanent connection between a parent and their child via the toys that are most important to a child each day, and by default, what is important to the parent.  With API connectivity between this toy and a parents smart phone via the home wifi connection, there is an unlimited flow of data about what impacts a child's life, and their parents world each day.</p>
<p>As the connection between APIs and the Internet of Things comes into focus for me, I get excited about opportunities like connecting our children's worlds to our smart phone enabled worlds.  Then as soon as I get excited, I immediately get freaked out.  Think about the opportunity, for&hellip;well, exploitation.  We need to make sure there are best practices for terms of use, privacy and security in these fascinating, and new possibilities within the API space.</p>
<p>Lots to think about with APIs and the Internet of Things.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 May 2013</span>
        <p>BaaS stacks have the potential to be the operating of the next generation of computing. BaaS has a lot of the characteristics of what we have historically defined as an OS, but tailored for apps that run on devices and in the clouds vs the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows OS -&nbsp;</strong>Think of what the Windows operating system did for computing. It brought together a meaningful stack of resources into a single stack that could be installed on the new world of personal computers (PC). &nbsp;Windows provided application developers with a single platform they could build apps, targeting PC users. &nbsp;Windows provided a basic set of API resources developers could use, but ultimately it was open for the ecosystem to innovate in any business sector they desired.</li>
<li><strong>Server OS -&nbsp;</strong>When it comes to the server, many developers have migrated from desktop to web via Windows server operating systems. &nbsp;While to others they think of other OS flavors like Linux, BSD. &nbsp;These server environments provide developers with a base operating system for interfacing with user management, file system, database access and other libraries or APIs to develop either server side, network or web applications. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) -&nbsp;</strong>Cloud providers have moved the OS into the clouds--enabling developers to build at three different levels, providing a base OS, with set of often API driven resources for delivering site and apps to end users. &nbsp;The operating system has moved onto the world wide web, allowing for an entirely different approach to application development, usage and monetization.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualized BaaS OS -&nbsp;</strong>BaaS isn't just a new type of business. &nbsp;BaaS is a new way to deliver operating systems tailored for mobile and the next generation of devices, sensors and the Internet of Things. &nbsp;BaaS delivers the compute, storage, messaging and other essential OS features, while also bringing together other, potentially distributed resources in a single meaningful system for mobile developers to operate on and provide a meaningful experience for their users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using BaaS, providers can deliver virtualized operating system stacks, for general purposes, much like Windows has served for decades or deliver specialized operating systems meant specifically for telco or healthcare. &nbsp;Imagine virtualized OS stacks that could be delivered to support fixed installations like the energy grid or telco installations, all the way to temporary, high demand situations like disaster recovery or large scale events.</p>
<p>BaaS will allow us to keep much of the potential delivered by a hardened set of resources we become accustomed to with desktop and server OS's, but also realize the agility and flexibility that is delivered by loosely coupled, individual API resources. &nbsp;Allowing for a new approach to app design, development, deployment and life-cycle management that is much more organic and alive.</p>

        <p>BaaS is an evolution. &nbsp;Its not a revolution, gamer changer or ground breaking new technology. &nbsp;It is a logical response to the demand for mobile applications and how to logically bring together individual API driven resources into a loosely couple stack, that will allow mobile developers to build apps more efficiently.</p>
<p>If we do this right, we can meet the demand of our growing need for apps on our mobile and tablet devices as well as the backend compute resources needed for the other areas of the growing, Internet connected world.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/05/investment-in-baas/">Investment in BaaS</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 May 2013</span>
        <p>As BaaS evolves, we are seeing the huge investment from numerous start-ups, as well as grabbing the attention of a handful of larger tech companies, but we are also seeing the first signs of major investment in the space. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Acquisition of Parse -&nbsp;</strong>Facebook recently acquired on of the top BaaS providers in the space, Parse. &nbsp;While there has been rumors swirling around the tech space for some time, regarding Facebook's desires to manufacture their own mobile device and possibly their own mobile operating system to rival iOS and Android, the Parse acquisition seems a little closer to reality. Facebook's investment in the BaaS space acknowledges that mobile dominance won't always be about device dominance, and the potential of well tuned, meaningful, virtualized stacks of resources for mobile developers. &nbsp;Facebook is looking to invest in mobile and BaaS represents that path forward. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Intel Investment in BaaS -&nbsp;</strong>In the same timeline as the Parse acquisition, &nbsp;BaaS platform FeedHenry announces a 9M investment from Intel Capital--showing more investment in mobile by the chip-maker. &nbsp;Revealing more of the mobile aspirations of Intel, the chip-maker recently announced the acquisition of enterprise mobile service provider Aeopona.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Lucent Mobile Acquisition of Proxomo </strong>-&nbsp;Lucent Mobile, Inc. reached a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Proxomo Software, Inc., a BaaS provider. As part of the transaction, Lucent Mobile, Inc. a private investor-backed company will operate going forward under the Proxomo name.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a small slice of the investment going on in the space. &nbsp;To understand the market opportunity, white papers such as the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/baas.asp">report&nbsp;published</a><span>&nbsp;by&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/">MarketsandMarkets</a><span>.</span> will provide that, but to understand the innovation opportunity, much more experimentation and research needs to occur on exactly what resources current developers are needing to truly be successful.</p>
<p>The research and development environment for the future of API resources will play out within the BaaS industry, through the efforts of small start-ups as well as from the major tech companies.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>The definition of what is a BaaS provider has not just an evolving meaning, but also means different things to different people. API Evangelist is looking to help define the space, and formulate a way for discovering new providers, while defining the different types of existing providers, potentially establishing a harder definition for BaaS.</p>
<p>When it comes to BaaS there are a handful of clear leaders who are dominating the space. &nbsp;These leading BaaS providers are delivering the features that developers are demanding, while also working define the best of breed services that are leading the space in new directions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After reviewing the space, monitoring the blogging and tweet volume of each provider, their activity on Github as well as references to them in top blogs like TechCrunch and GigaOM, and discussion about them on Reddit and Hacker News, it is easy to identify the leaders. &nbsp;Because of their own efforts, but also the conversations of analysts and developers, a pattern for BaaS success begins to emerge.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>While there are clearly leaders in the BaaS movement, there are 37 other companies working to make their mark on the space and serve the mobile app developer community. Each of these providers have their own approach to delivering their BaaS stack, but many are emulating the successful patterns of the BaaS pioneers.</p>
<p>Some BaaS providers are looking to enable mobile developers to build cross-platform apps on any device in any business sector. &nbsp;While other are looking to serve a niche like gaming or focus exclusively on strengthening the marketing efforts of companies via this fast growing world of consumer devices. &nbsp;</p>
