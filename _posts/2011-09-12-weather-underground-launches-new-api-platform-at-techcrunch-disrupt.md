The [Weather Underground Weather API][1] provides access to data from more than 19,000 users contributing local observations from personal weather stations, providing up-to-the-minute weather conditions for the most finely targeted areas.

The Weather API is RESTful with responses available in a JSON format, with access free for developers making 500 requests per day, and paid tiers for requests starting at 5K requests per month up to 1M requests per month.

[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/weather-underground/Wunderground-Weather-API.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />][1]"Weather Underground already distributes its weather data to many of the worldâ€™s leading media companies, weather applications and smaller web properties," said [Alan Steremberg][4], President and co-Founder of Weather Underground. "Our new self-service API platform will open up our data to thousands more developers working on web and mobile programs, big and small."

The Weather Underground provides a very robust developers area allowing developers to signup, manage their keys and choose the appropriate pricing plan. They provide the necessary API documentation and code samples to get up and going, and even throw in some analytics showing your access and usage of the API.
