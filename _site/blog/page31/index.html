        <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-work-in-progress.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I am stopping and collecting some of my thoughts, as I work through my API stack.</a> I'm thinking about the more difficult aspects of defining APIs, this time it is for the APIs I depend on to operate my own company. I am working to define the APIs I depend on from over 30 companies, partly to help me better understand the APIs I use, but also partly as theater here for API Evangelist.</p>
<p>To profile APIs, I use OADF and APIs.json as my machine readable definition formats. Not all APIs are created equal, so it takes different approaches to crafting their OADF, from doing it by hand for the easier ones, to scrape scripts that take consistent (static) documentation, and generate an OADF version. As I do this work, here is where the hard work is (will be) in all of this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface</strong> - Finding and documenting the surface area (endpoints + headers + parameters + security). There is just no way to automate this, you only know what you know.</li>
<li><strong>Response</strong> - Documenting the response, and schema using Charles Proxy. The first version of my API definitions rarely have the response modeled, as I depend on Charles Proxy plus a custom API I developed for generating JSON schema from HAR files.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json </strong>- Bring together with an APIs.json index, which is fairly automated for me from my central API monitoring system, publishing a single, machine readable index of all the APIs available, as well as the wider API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> - As I complete around 30 of these, I realize that I will need some sort of machine readable, APIs.json driven menu, which puts a list of APIs in a certain order, and maps responses, to following request parameters, so I can daisy chain APis together for more automated tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Updates</strong> - Like knowing the surface area of an API, we only know what we know, and as Rumsfeld says, there are also the known unknowns, as well as the unknown unknowns. I see updates of API definitions, that are done externally being a constantly evolving process, which will never be perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more APIs I define, the easier some of this gets. However, there will be areas that are going to always require the trained eye of an API expert, comparing definitions to live documentation, and keeping an ear to the ground for any updates. Ideally all of this work gets done by API providers themselves, but until all the benefits are evident, it just isn't going to happen. I am sure there will always be some API providers who never see the value of properly defining the valuable APIs they operate, but my mission is to reduce those numbers</p>
<p>Once I am in API definition mode, I find it hard to do anything else--it just takes over a dedicated portion of my brain, requiring an intense focus. Luckily there is also a certain amount of satisfaction, when you have a "complete" API definition for a popular API. When you see what is possible, once an API is properly defined, the quest to achieve a proper definition can become a little addictive. While i do enjoy doing this, there are simply too many APIs for one person to do, and I will need the help of other passionate API consumers, as well as providers to get the job done properly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-scale-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">As I conclude the first phase of profiling the APIs that I depend on</a>, I am thinking about my API usage at scale, and some new questions are arising, that I wasn't thinking about before. I find my API consumption, and API integration thinking historically has been on an individual API basis, which something that I hope to evolve upon in 2016.</p>
<p>Here are a handful of questions that have arose in my notebook, as I worked to profile these APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do I login / register for a service?</li>
<li>What are the security definitions?</li>
<li>Where do I get support?</li>
<li>Where do I get updates?</li>
<li>How do I manage my keys / tokens?</li>
<li>What are the details of applications I have created?</li>
<li>What are my rate limits? Plan levels available to me?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Where am I at with my rate limits? Overall consumption?</li>
<li>What am I spending across my API usage?</li>
<li>Do I have plan B for any of these? Even possible?</li>
<li>What SDKs do I depend on for integration?</li>
<li>What are my code, content, and data licensing concerns?</li>
<li>Am I adhering to branding requirements appropriately?</li>
<li>Can I increase my API usage? Are there new fetaures I am not using?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the questions that I wrote down, as I profiled the surface area of each of my APIs. <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I'm just creating OADF, API Blueprint, and Postman Collections, that allow me understand each endpoint, and the parameters across this almost 35 APIs I use</a>. The next phase of my work involves profiling the security and data definitions for these APIs--a process which I'm sure will surface even more questions.</p>
<p>I am not confident I will be able to answer all of these questions in the near future. Many API providers just do not make it easy for me, resulting in the addition of another manual process, which in a world of limited resources means it probably won't get done. Even with the added work, I still want to ask these questions, and spend time thinking about my API usage at scale, in preparation for a future where I am depending on not just 3-5, or 30-50 APIs, but 300-500 public APIs to get business done.</p>

<p class="p1">As I approach 2016, I'm stepping back, and looking at the big picture of what it is that do, and using what I learn to help guide what I will accomplish in 2016. I tend to not subscribe to the concept of predictions, and instead focus on what change I personally would like make within the API space, and this strategy is key to me achieving this vision.</p>
<p class="p2">First, let's start with what do I do? I track on the world of APIs, with eye towards how we can better execute on the tech, business, and politics of APIs, based upon a better understanding of approaches established by existing API providers, and the features being offered by service providers who target the space.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2010, I started tracking on API management, and in 2015 this has expanded to almost 35 areas:</p>

<p class="p2">Originally I saw these research projects as just various lines along the API life cycle or journey, but increasingly I'm also seeing these as just the "first" stack of API resources that I study. Meaning, in 2016 these aspects of the API journey are themselves increasingly API driven--API deployment, management, monitoring, and many other areas are being automated via APIs.</p>
<p class="p2">Over the last five years, I've conducted my research by studying the approach of successful API providers like Amazon, SalesForce, Google, Twitter, and the longer tale of lesser known government, university, and utility APIs available today. Along the way, these APIs have started organizing themselves into logical groups for me, some based upon the industry they operate in, while others are more about specific business or developmental goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">I call these groupings "stacks"--they also go by other names like hubs, industries, categories, but one important aspect of stacks for me, is the ability to mix and match to meet various objectives, as if the APIs were legos. Some of these objectives are more individual or consumer-focused, with others being more commercial or industrial, giving me as much flexibility as I can in assembling meaningful stacks of useful API driven resources for any possibility.</p>
<p class="p1">With my core API life cycle and journey research coming into focus so nicely in 2015, I am also working to do the same with other API stacks in 2016--here are the main areas I'm focusing on out of the gate:</p>
<ul>
<li>social</li>
<li>messaging</li>
<li>users</li>
<li>storage</li>
<li>compute</li>
<li>documents</li>
<li>commerce</li>
<li>payments</li>
<li>photos</li>
<li>videos</li>
<li>music</li>
<li>audio</li>
<li>voice</li>
<li>search</li>
<li>content</li>
<li>language</li>
<li>news</li>
<li>travel</li>
<li>mapping</li>
<li>places</li>
<li>businesses</li>
<li>links</li>
<li>events</li>
<li>weather</li>
<li>movies</li>
<li>advertising</li>
<li>accounting</li>
<li>shipping</li>
<li>government (city)</li>
<li>government (state)</li>
<li><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">government (fed)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://home.apievangelist.com">home</a></li>
<li><a href="http://automobile.apievangelist.com">auto</a></li>
<li>wearables</li>
<li>energy</li>
<li>space</li>
<li>healthcare</li>
<li>environment</li>
<li>education</li>
<li>libraries</li>
<li><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university</a> (faculty)</li>
<li>university (student)</li>
<li>sharing economy</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The how and why I craft each stack varies. Many of these stacks I consider to be the essential aspects of the modern Internet experience, like compute and storage, or photos and videos, while others are more business sector focused like energy, healthcare, and education.</p>
<p class="p1">As I dive into a stack, the chances of it expanding and evolving increases significantly. You can see this with my&nbsp;<a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://sms.apievangelist.com/">SMS</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://mms.apievangelist.com/">MMS</a>&nbsp;research, or with my&nbsp;<a href="http://financial-news.apievangelist.com/">financial news</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://news.apievangelist.com/">news</a>&nbsp;research. While I try to capture any individual area, the chances it will spawn entirely new research areas, or share affinity with other existing areas are pretty great.</p>
<p class="p2">Ok, so what actually happens in all this "research", "monitoring", and what not? The value from the exhaust...I move things forward using several working models:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Analyst Model -</strong>&nbsp;Generation of&nbsp;short form (blog posts), a project area (on Github Pages), and industry guides (HTML &amp; PDF) in each area of research. You can see this in action for the 35 lines (stacks) for the API lifecycle, and the handful of topical stacks I've done in messaging, news, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Companies -</strong>&nbsp;What companies are involved?</li>
<li><strong>Individuals -&nbsp;</strong>When relevant, what individuals are involved?</li>
<li><strong>APIs&nbsp;</strong>- What APIs exist in an area, complete with OADF + API Blueprint + Postman + APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -</strong>&nbsp;Common elements derived from features, and API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Tooling</strong>&nbsp;- What open source tooling is available beyond services.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities</strong>&nbsp;- Where are the gaps in what is being done vs. what is needed?</li>
</ul>
<p>While the majority of my research is publicly available, and openly licensed, in some sectors I will keep guides, and building blocks private, essentially available behind a paywall. All my partners are welcome to co-brand any of my public guides, and I am actively looking for sponsors of specific areas of research when it comes to doing initial research, to cobranding content and putting behind lead gen.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Strategy Model -&nbsp;</strong>Individual and industry level guides for others to follow, when planning and crafting their own strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -&nbsp;</strong>Individual building block examples for companies, such as rate limits for AWS EC2, or SendGrid email.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Operational Bluprints -</strong>&nbsp;Blueprints for API operations, example would be cloud computing, SMS provider, video provider.</li>
<li><strong>APIs (Definitions) -</strong>&nbsp;OADF, and APIs.json collections that provide a machine readable blueprint for use in strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Journeys -</strong>&nbsp;Walk though of series of analysis and building blocks, in specific areas, with specific outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the exhaust from my analyst model, some of my strategy work will be publicly available, and openly licensed, but this is the area where i will keep a little more information behind a paywall, requiring some action, or money to access my hard work and expertise.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>APIs in Infrastructure Stack -</strong>&nbsp;Design, development, and management of focused API that deliver value somewhere along the API life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail&nbsp;</strong>- Design, development, and management of APIs that deliver on specific stops along the API life cycle, made available as self-service resource.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale&nbsp;&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;Design, development, and management of APIs that deliver on specific stops along the API life cycle, made available as on-premise resource.</li>
<li><strong>Journey -</strong>&nbsp;APIs in support of strategy journeys, allowing users to build strategy, and revisit and evolve strategy, using custom designed APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">This is a new area for me in 2016, but will allow me to better serve gaps that I identify in the overall API life cycle. I will not be launching APIs to compete with regular API providers in the space, and keeping my work focused on APIs that deliver API infrastructure resources.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tooling for Infrastructure Stack -</strong>&nbsp;Design, develop, and operate JavaScript tooling, that runs as micro-apps on Github pages, running locally and / or using API infrastructure I've deployed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Page Apps -</strong>&nbsp;Develop, operate, and evolve simple JavaScript apps that support the API life cycle, using my Github Pages model for deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization -</strong>&nbsp;I will be playing with different models of access ranging from open, free, to paid, and advertising support options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Development of these types of applications for revenue, like API design, deployment, and management will be new for my operations, and an area where I will also focus on applications that support the API life cycle. Like APIs, all apps will do one thing, and do it well, with a very modular approach to operations.</p>
<p>The analyst portion of my operations is 100% based upon my own work, and is something I will not be scaling, relying on my own process, APIs, and tooling to scale. However when it comes to publishing of guides, strategy blueprints, and API and tooling deployment, I will be aligning myself with specific partners across the space. These partners will bring proven value to specific areas of the API life cycle I am working to bring to life in my research, analysis, and content, API, and tool creation.</p>
<p>As always, the more I do, the more I learn, and the more this plan will evolve--this post is just meant to be a guide that will help me get started in 2016.</p>

        <p>The existence, membership, and activity around local API Meetup groups is one of the overall health indicators in the API space. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">I've long been a proponent of local API meetups</a>, helping jumpstart the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/18/api-craft-san-francisco/">early API Craft gatherings</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/13/my-talk-tomorrow-night-at-the-dallasforth-worth-api-professionals-meetup/">helping new Meetup groups get off the ground</a>.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a>, we use these numbers to help us decide where to put API conferences on, as on the ground support is crucial to making the event a success. I also consider the activity around these local Meetups a sign of how well the space is doing when it comes to outreach and evangelism across the entire industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I missed an API Meetup in your community, please let me know. If you'd like to start an API Meetup in your community, also please reach out, as I may be able to help you jumpstart your efforts with speakers, sponsors, and attendeess. However, ultimately you will have to do all the hard work of finding venues, and getting the word out locally, which if you do right, can be a very rewarding journey in my opinion.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-technology-of-apis.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>A handful of the most iconic APIs out there, which I also happen to depend on for my own operations, are some of the more frustratingly designed APIs I know. There are many API design offenses we all commit, but one of the most frustrating for me is when you use a single URL, and depend on a single parameter, for accessing everything an API has to offer.</p>
<p>A couple of my favorite APIs, Flickr and Amazon EC2 both employ this approach. A single URL, and a single parameter for working with a wealth of API driven resources. This is a classic mistake of the technologist, delivering what you need, but making it difficult to actually learn about an API. This approach to API design delivers upon the functionality desired, but makes very difficult to document using common approaches available to us like OADF, and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>When it comes to Amazon EC2, and Flickr, there is so much more value to be articulated in the API design by itself. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr organizes their API methods by grouping them on the main page for the API</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/OperationList-query.html">Amazon just groups each method for Amazon EC2 on their documentation page</a>--something <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">you can get in a single list if you like</a>, if you prefer. It doesn't' take much work to expose the richness available within these APIs, but when documenting using OADF, it can be hard to articulate the value brought to the table by each resource.</p>
<p>Amazon and Flickr both rely on all API calls utilizing GET, but rely on a query parameter to define each unique API call. When you document using OADF, this ends up being a single API endpoint, with a parameter, and any number of parameters to pull out the value an API offers. I needed to define each endpoint as /?method=XXXX, while still allowing each underlying parameter to be defined as a collection for each endpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that each parameter gets appended, using another ?, resulting in /?method=XXXX?variable1=XXXX. This design flaw, just appends the next variable to my method, messing with the whole mojo of the API call. To hack it, all I did was add a sort of shock absorber set of variables to each method call, with the first parameter working in concert.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/method=XXXX&amp;k=1?l=1&amp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In both AWS and Flickr scenarios, k, and l variables are just concatenated and absorbed, and every variable that follows is processed as you'd except. I chose the two variables for two reasons, one they are letters in the middle of the alphabet (reducing chance they will be used), and also the fact that they are my initials. It is a stupid little hack, but it seems to work (so far), for the APIs I am looking to define.</p>
<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">This little hack has helped me to better document AWS EC2 and RDS, as well as Flickr</a>. I know of some other APIs out there, that I've neglected documenting because of this design flaw. Now that I have a little hack, I can better design using this little hack, and hopefully represent a little more of the value that exists within--which is the gateway to a heightened API awareness in my opinion.</p>

<p>I'm down in the detail of how we craft our API plans, looking at the approaches of almost 100 different providers, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">working to establish a common schema for cataloging the plans of these popular APIs</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/dialing-in-your-api-pricing-down-to-the-endpoint-and-verb-level/">I have already talked about dialing in your API pricing down to the endpoint and level,</a> but was something I wanted to take a little bit further.</p>
<p>In my previous story, I talked about how mature API providers charge different rates for POST, and PUT requests, than they did for GET requests. Using this scenario, what if we wanted to incentivize and reward behavior through variable rate pricing at the HTTP verb level, to give developers more ownership over an API, including better access and pricing structures the more they contribute.</p>
<p>Lets use a standard business directory like say Crunchbase as a model. Everyone wants this data, and you only get so many GET requests, based upon the rate limits limits they've set. What if I was given access to more GET requests, based upon the number of POST and PUT requests I made? Meaning the more data I had added, and updated, the more access I was given when pulling data. Something I think could incentivize developers to be more involved, and improve on the overall quality of content or data via an API.</p>
<p>Of course, there would be ways people could game this, but I'm pretty sure you could identify the bad actors using modern API management approaches. You would also need other checks and balances, and quality control elements to make this a reality, but I wanted to focus on the service composition aspect. Could you incentivize internal, partner, or even public API developers to take more ownership of a resource, and help make it better, by applying variable rate controls at the GET level, that are influenced by controls at the POST, and PUT levels?</p>
<p>Something to think about. It is also something I will keep an eye out for more, as I'm making my way the portals, documentation, and pricing pages of APIs that I review. It doesn't seem like something that would take much work. I know this would be possible with my 3Scale API infrastructure, which allows me to configure pricing on a plan, as well as customized individual basis. It would not take much to adjust this rate based upon rate limits met, exceeded for specific API calls, or <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">other influencing metric I decided</a>.</p>

<p>There are more <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/companies.html">HTTP client tools</a> out there than I can shake a stick at (I've reached that point, I'm shaking sticks at things), and in 2016 I predict there will be even more entrants into the space. <a href="http://apis.how/gwbjyujag1">I'd say Postman was a pioneering force in the evolution of the HTTP client when it comes for web API space</a>, but is <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">something that it is beginning to collide with API design tooling from Apiary</a>, as well as being <a href="http://apis.how/syulwzictt">morphed by new players like Stoplight.io</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I am playing with more of these environments than the average API consumer is, because of what I do for a living, but I have to say, I am getting tired of "importing" my API definitions. Don't me wrong. I am stoked that all tools support the importing of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">machine readable API definitions like OADF, and API Blueprint</a>, but I cannot help&nbsp;always looking to what should be next, and I want to be able to just run each API, in my HTTP client of my choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">For all of my own APIs, I provide a Postman icon, and link to a Postman Collection</a>. It just gives you quick access to the machine readable currency that all services I depend on speak, OADF, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection. However, I still have to import it into Postman, or other HTTP API client, or service I will be using. While this is a good start, and is something I recommend other API providers do, I think we can still do better.</p>
<p>If you are operating one of the HTTP API clients, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/04/api-client-tool-garage-hub-playground-studio-workbench-and-builders/">planning one of the next generation&nbsp;API cleints, tools, garage, hub, playground, studio, workbench, or builder</a>, can you please provide a "run in XXXX" embeddable button please? I would like to see pretty little icons throughout API portals, and the service providers we depend on across the API space, that empower me run any API via the client I depend on every day.</p>
<p>Think the Twitter and Facebook share buttons, but for API integration, and the currency is OADF and API Blueprint definitions. I appreciate all you HTTP API client providers considering my crazy requests. If done right, I think it could result in some potential new users, depending how you'd handle the process for users who clicked, but didn't actually have an account with your platform yet--anyway, food for thought. #onward</p>

<p>I am continuing to build on the subway map exploration work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">that I talked about at @Defrag and @APIStrat last month</a>, and have a more static version of my API life cycle explorer ready, which I'm simply calling the API journey. <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/journey/index.html">I have only rolled this out for my API plans research</a>, but so far I'm happy with the results, something that shouldn't be too difficult to light up for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the other 30+ areas I'm researching</a>.</p>
<p>There is quite of bit of research that goes into the work that I publish, and the subway analogy is allowing me to share more it, making more parts of it more accessible, in ways I was never able to before. Currently you can take the journey through each of the stops along the API plans portion of my research, and learn about in details about some of the common patterns I'm seeing across the space.</p>
<p>For each stop I provide a title, and description for the stop, but if I have related organizations, tools, links, and even specific APIs or questions to ask at this stop in the life cycle for any API. My goal is to take the building blocks from leading API platforms, and the features offered by companies offering services to the space, and make accessible to anyone who wants to learn for their own operations.</p>
<p>The narrative for my API plans journey isn't 100% there, and some of the stops are lacking in description, as well as related organizations, tools, and other links. However it gives me an excellent framework to further flush out my research, while also sharing it with my readers, in a potentially interactive way. Eventually I'd like for you to be able to actually select the pieces that are important to you, and save it as a customized list at the end--soon!</p>
<p>For now, it is helping me flush out the narrative around my research, and connect the dots a little more, when it comes to relationships within. All of this will contribute to the overall subway experience I am playing with. Soon, I want will be connecting up different stops, with the other related stops on other lines within the life cycle. If I talk about virtualization in my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>, it should link to the related area, or stop on the <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">API virtualization research</a> line--soon!</p>
<p>Anyways. I will fire up the journeys for each of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the other 30 research areas over the next couple days</a>. Then I will work to make sure the narratives are a little more coherent, and show as much of the research behind as I can, at each stop along the way. Oh, another thing. Right now I have a complete journey, I am playing with an essential version, as well as dimensions that focus on the technical, business, or political stops along the life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am curious to see what this looks like when applied tomy other areas of research, like API management, or maybe API design.</p>

<p>I am going through each of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">35+ areas of the APi space that I monitor</a>, working to bring alive <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-different-subway-journey-experiences-for-my-api-life-cycle-explorer/">the over 900 stops along the API life cycle</a>, that I have&nbsp;identified through my research. I'm still working through prototypes for my life cycle explorer, but <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/journey/beta/">the current version has organizations, tools, links, and questions, along with the title and description of each stop of the life cycle journey I am trying to bring into focus</a>.</p>
<p>Part of my approach in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">identifying the different lines, areas, and stops along this life cycle</a> involves taking a look at the approach of leading API providers, as well as service being offered by companies selling their solutions to these API providers--giving me two sides of the API life cycle coin. In the last couple months I have also found another way to identify potential building blocks, and round off the ones I have, through the API definitions of leading API providers.</p>
<p>All I do, is craft an OADF file for each of the API service providers I track on, within each area of my research. I'm spending time tonight working on my <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring research</a>, so I look at three of the service providers I track on, who have APIs. The OADF specs are not complete, but provide me a baseline definition for the surface area of each API, something I'll round out with more use. Here are the endpoints I have from each provider so far.</p>

<p>When you compare the definitions for these API service providers, you are comparing apples to oranges, even though they exist in the same layer of the API space. To me, having them defined, will allow me to slowly weave them into <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my master list of common building blocks for API monitoring</a>.</p>
<p>What really excites me, is that for each potential stop along the API monitoring line, I might be able to actually link to specific API endpoints, and even down to the verb level. For example, I could link to the endpoint for creating a new test for API Science, APIMetrics, and Runscope, with a single button or widget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find the API definitions for API service providers to be more interesting them some of the features they showcase via their site. I will be continuing to identify the API service providers that I track on who have APIs, and defining them using OADF. <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apis.json">You can find the APIs for my API monitoring research available in the projects APIs.json file</a>, as well as <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/companies.html">each individual APIs.json and OADF files listed on the API monitoring service providers page</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-plan.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>How to monetize APIs is on of the top questions I get from companies, right after concerns around security and control. I have separated my research into two main buckets, the <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">first is focused on the questions I should be asking around API monetization as I'm planning my strategy</a>, with <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">the second focused on the actual plans for the operations of leading API providers</a>. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but I guess API monetization is more strategy, and API plans is more about operations.</p>
<p>When I started my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization research</a>, it was very focused on how do you make money from your APIs, resulting in the poorly crafted title. I'm not making the same mistake with my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>, which is meant to help define a wide range of motivations for providing APIs. I think every API should have an API monetization plan, to cover the costs of acquisition, deployment, and management in a sensible way, and all APIs should have a plan--not all APIs need to have pricing.</p>
<p>This is why I labeled my research into API plans the way I did, instead of just focusing on API pricing. Not all APIs have a straightforward API monetization strategy that can be translated into "pricing", from the dark side of platforms that are just content farms, to the brighter side where platforms are focused on the social good. There are many motivations behind API operations, this is why <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">I'm trying to come up with some common ways to reference these motivations in a machine readable way</a>.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan research</a>, as I'm rapidly evolving the <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that go into planning your API operations</a>. I am also <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">publishing some common, machine readable definitions from leading API players like AWS, Twilio, and more</a>. All of this is very alpha work, so it might seem cluttered at first, but I am working to slice it up into a 101, 201, and 301 series, as well as some sections that are dedicated to learning, with others more focused on strategy and then execution.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work left to be done before I can compare the pricing of cloud storage APIs like Amazon and Microsoft, or messaging like Twilio and Tropo, but in the short term, the ability to find APIs that depend on donations like <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/">Court Listener</a>, and easily identify the data and content farms like Crunchbase and AngelList, who don't have real business models that API consumers can benefit from, is important to my operations.</p>
<p>Ultimately there are two primary motivations here--one, getting a machine readable way to discover and compare APIs and the resources they are providing. Second, I want to provide a way for API providers to easily understand the common patterns available across the API sector, and provide tooling they can use to craft the API plan that works best for them, based upon the successful plans already being put to work across the space.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-solution-discovery.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>During my API discovery session talk at <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIStrat Austin this last November</a>, I talked about what I see as an added dimension to the concept of API discovery, one that will become increasingly important when it comes to actually moving things forward --- discovering solutions that are API driven vs. API discovery, where a developer is looking for an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might not seem that significant to developers, but SaaS services like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/om0bbjpmec">DataFire</a>, and <a href="http://cloud-elements.com">API hubs like Cloud Elements</a>, bring this critical new dimension to how people actually will find your APIs. As nice as ProgrammableWeb has been for the last 10 years, we have to get more sophisticated about how we get our APIs in front of would-be consumers. We just can't depend on everyone who will put our API to work, immediately thinking that they need an API--most likely they are just going to need a solution to their problem, and secondarily need to understand there is an API driving things behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Of of many examples of this in the wild, could be in the area of tech support for your operations. Maybe you use Jira currently, because this is what your development team uses, but with a latest release you need something a little more public facing. When you are exploring what is possible with API reciprocity services like Zapier, and API hubs like Cloud Elements, you get introduced to other API driven solutions like Zendesk, or Desk.com from SalesForce.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how APIs can make an impact on the average business user, and will be the way API discovery happens in the future. In this scenario, I didn't set out looking for an API, but because I use API enabled service providers, I am introduced to other alternative solutions that might also help me tackle the problem I need. I may never have even known SalesForce had a help desk solution, if I wasn't already exploring the solutions Cloud Elements brings to the table.</p>
<p>As an API provider, you need to make sure your APIs are available via the growing number of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API aggregation</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">reciprocity providers</a>, and make sure the solutions they bring to the table are easily discoverable. You need to think beyond the classic developer focused version of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, and make sure and think about API driven solution discovery meant for the average business or individual user.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2015</span>

<p>As part of evaluating 50+ companies, and their business approach to delivering APIs, I came across the Box platform. As I am looking through this diverse slice of API companies, I am looking to better understand the motivations behind providing APIs, and how sophisticated the monetization or overall planning are for their operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most APIs, there is either no evident monetization strategy, the strategy is directly coupled with API access, or indirectly part of larger monetization strategy around existing devices, products, advertising, software as a service, or any other type of service. When it came to Box, they have a clear <a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/">SaaS pricing model</a>, as well as <a href="https://developers.box.com/pricing/">one specifically for their API ecosystem</a>--of course they are both intertwined, but the fact there are separate dimensions I felt made it worth highlighting.</p>
<p>Box has obviously put a lot of thought into their business model. In addition to having a separate set of plans for their SaaS, and developer areas, they have the developer page broken down into packages by Box platform, content, and view--which I don't fully grasp yet, and will continue to evaluate. Out of the 50+ companies I looked at, Box was the only to have such a significant separation between the SaaS and developer layers, whie also being very tightly coupled, leading to me putting aside for further consideration.</p>
<p>This latest sprint in my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan research</a> was limited. I am guessing that the more companies I find that operate like Box, the more this will all come into focus. I'm guessing at Box central there is a command and control center with a master plan on the wall of how the SaaS side of things works with the API side, as well as a breakdown of the tiers that is based upon their operational experience over the years.</p>
<p>The best I can do from the outside is try document the patterns across SaaS and API pioneers like Box, and understand the role in plays in the API landscape. While I do see a number of successful patterns across successful API driven platforms, I do not see the holy grail of API business models, due to the number of individual resource contracts (aka documents), and specific industry constructs (aka regulation). This doesn't stop me from trying to understand all the building blocks, and sharing what I can on API Evangelist.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/12/apis-in-the-most-mature-sectors-have-pricing-apis/">I'm looking at the pricing APIs offered by some of the API providers that are further along in their API journey</a>. This is just one example of how API providers are offering more operational level APIs to their developers, giving them control over their own integration, allowing programmatic control over account settings, billing, rate limits, and pricing.</p>
<p>I've talked about the need to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">allow for more automation</a> of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">modern API life cycle</a>, allowing API consumers to better manage their consumption across the many APIs they are depending on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/30/making-sure-everything-you-offer-as-an-api-service-provider-is-portable/">This is why I'm spending a greater amount of time focusing on API service providers in the space practicing what they preach, and making simple, easy to use APIs available for the services they offer</a>.</p>
<p>When API service providers do this, it make it easier for API providers to extend API driven operations to their consumers. The fact that my 3Scale API management infrastructure has an API, allows me to proxy and deliver a pricing, plans, and rate limit API to my API consumers. All of these elements are present in the service composition 3Scale provides me, and the fact that they have an API allows me to extend it as part of my own API stack to my consumers.</p>
<p>This does not stop with just the API management line of my API life cycle. I can provide programmatic access to my API monitoring, because <a href="http://apis.how/h1h2mnxnc4">API Science</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a> has APIs, and to my SDKs via <a href="http://apis.how/ix4raakqkd">APIMATIC</a>, and multi-format versions of my API definitions using the <a href="http://apis.how/okfoexmpcm">API Transformer API.</a> Every stop along my API life cycle involves my API consumers, and in addition to me being able to automate my API operations using APIs, my developers should be able to automate their API consumption as well.</p>
<p>The moral of this story I guess, is that if you are providing services to API providers--have all of your services available via an API. Once you have done this, start thinking about how your customers will be needing to extend these services to their own consumers. Thank you for helping me understand and manage my API operations, but also assist me in helping my developers better manage their own API integration--using APIs. #thanks</p>

<p><span>I am spending a significant amount of time looking through the pricing pages for leading API providers, working to get a sense for some of the common approaches to API monetization in use across the space. Along the way I am also finding some simple and unique approaches from API providers that I wanted to share as bit-size API planning stories here on the blog.</span></p>
<p>As the API service composition of leading providers evolve in the space you see platforms getting more granular in not just how they control access to their API resources, but also how they incentivize consumption. When I say granular, I am talking about API pricing for APIs available down to the endpoint, or even HTTP verb level. Here is a description, straight from Amazon S3:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/"><em>PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests = $0.005 per 1,000 requests ,GET and all other Requests = $0.004 per 10,000 requests, with delete requests being free</em></a></p>
<p class="p1">This approach represents a sophisticated view of API <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">planning</a> and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a>. Companies who are earlier on in their API journey often only use their GET verb, afraid of the repercussions of opening up PUT, POST, or DELETE. This is where API service composition comes into play, and gives you greater control over your resources, while also opening up access, and incentivizing the type of behavior that is beneficial to both API provider and consumer.</p>
<p><span>I've come across a number of providers who are taking this approach, and will link to them more within my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan researc</a>h. I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up. I will try to space them out, alongside other stories, but you will just have to suffer a little as I spend time expanding on my&nbsp;<a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a>&nbsp;research areas.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>

<p>As I was working to understand the coupling between the <a href="https://www.box.com">Box SaaS business model</a>, and the one applied to their API, I noticed an interesting element, <a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/">that was part of their enterprise API plan--custom terms of service</a>. At first glance it doesn't seem like much, but making elements of your TOS dynamic, allowing them up to be used as a metric within your API plans, opens up a whole world of possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to note, this option is only available in the enterprise plan, which means only those with the most resources get this opportunity, but I still think its presence is meaningful. Right now, most terms of service and privacy policies are immovable shadows that guide how we do business and conduct our personal lives online, so the ability to think of them more dynamically, and one that could be tied to specific API access plans has huge potential. Unfortunately in the true Silicon Valley spirit, only some of this potential will be good, much of it will be in the name of exploitation, and the shifting of how power flows.</p>
<p>I have terms of service listed as a potential metric in my API plans research--we'll see where this goes, as my work evolves. I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up.

<p>I am seeing more operations focused API tooling emerge lately, like Stoplight.io, and as I'm <a href="https://datafire.io/">adding API reciprocity platform DataFire</a> to <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">my list of integration, automation, and interoperability providers</a>, I'm asking myself -- where is the API reciprocity platform designed specifically for managing API operations?</p>
<p>I am talking about the <a href="http://apis.how/mqashcq6gb">Zapier</a>, but just for API providers and consumers. With Datafire, I see things have a little more business and operations edge, than I've seen from more consumer offerings like Zapier. What I am hoping for, is someone to build a platform that lets you automate, integrate, and orchestrate all of your API focused operational needs across the cloud.</p>
<p>This new platform will automatically setup monitoring using <a href="http://apis.how/hobnzhnazs">API Science</a> or <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a>, when a new containerized microservice fires up. I could have recipes for automatically <a href="http://apis.how/zu8ty0v34u">registering public APIs.json indexes</a>, with <a href="http://apis.how/pufzfljcge">APIs.io, the open source API search engine</a>. Whenever a new developer registers via my <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, I could profile them on FullContact, and queue up their Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github profiles for me to engage with as part of my evangelism efforts.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, regarding tasks that I need automated across my API operations, and about how the services that I employ are providing me with APIs to manage things. All of this is making the potential for integration, interoperability, automation, transformation, and most importantly reciprocity within my API operations increase pretty dramatically. Hopefully someone will follow the lead of Zapier, and newer offerings like DataFire, and bring a solution to the table that will help alleviate some of the challenges we face daily, in the operations of our APIs.</p>

        <p><a href="/admin/blog/design.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/auth0-pricing-fma.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am spending a significant amount of time looking through the pricing pages for leading API providers, working to get a sense for some of the common approaches to API monetization in use across the space. Along the way I am finding some simple approaches from API providers that I wanted to share as bit-size API planning stories here on the blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing">After recently landing on the pricing page for identity service provider Auth0</a>, I saw that they included a simple message and link to the latest blog post about API pricing changes. It is a simple, subtle, yet very prominent approach to making sure your API consumers are aware of pricing changes that may impact their integration. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/04/educating-api-developers-with-each-login-over-at-cloudelements/">I recently wrote about providing a messaging area to reach developers upon platform login</a>, but this approach from Auth0 is about providing relevant messaging no matter where you are at in the developer portal--not just at login.</p>
<p>Couple of lessons for me, extracted from this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prominent FMA - </strong>Providing a prominently placed, flexible messaging area, can help make sure your API consumers stay up to speed on the latest, when it comes to platform operations.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Pricing Storytelling - </strong>Telling the story around each change in pricing is a critical aspect of operation. Publishing a story on your blog, syndicating out through your social channels, and prominent placement via a FMA is key.</li>
</ol>
<p>This help rekenforce the fact that we should make sure to regularly communicating out our decisions around API monetization. Also making sure there is a saturation factor to our messaging, and that it is available via our blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn, and any other relevant page or channel used to reach API consumers.</p>
<p>I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up. I will try to space them out, alongside other stories, but you will just have to suffer a little as I spend time expanding on my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a> research areas.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-machine-readable-pricing.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://history.apievangelist.com">A lot can be learned from the pioneers of the API space</a>. Companies like Amazon and Twilio have been used as a model by many providers, and are something I reference often across my research and storytelling. These providers have been playing the API game for a while, so they have a wealth of experience to bring to the table, but they also are working with well defined, and highly valuable API driven resources which we can learn from.</p>
<p>I'm neck deep in evaluating the pricing of modern APIs, and Amazon and Twilio both provide a wealth of things to consider when it comes to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>. One of the common patterns that has emerged for me, is the presence of pricing APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-price-list-api/">AWS Price List API</a></strong> - In order to meet the needs of these customers and to foster the development of even more tools that focus on cost management, budgeting, and the like, we are launching the AWS Price List API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/pricing">Twilio Pricing API</a> </strong>- The Pricing REST resource provides a simple API to pull real time, account-specific pricing for Twilio's messaging, voice and phone number products.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Amazon says on their page, "Many AWS customers and partners have been asking for a programmatic way to access prices for AWS services. Current customers and partners would like to make sure that their budgeting, forecasting, and analytics tools are able to analyze AWS prices without having to resort to scraping our web site." These types of API resources provide the rest of us with a glimpse at what the future possibly holds for our own APIs.</p>
<p>The world of cloud computing, voice, and messaging APIs are significantly more mature than other areas being served by APIs, but how the leading API providers are monetizing their APIs, and develop tooling for their consumers, gives us elements we should all be considering for our own road maps. I hope you are ready for a time, where the resources you are serving up via your API, are as well defined, and &nbsp;as competitive as cloud computing resources is right now.</p>
<p>it is easy to think about our APIs within the silo of our community, but when you begin to think about API consumers who will be using not just 2-3 APIs, but 20-30, or even 200-300 APIs, the importance of there being a pricing API to assist with cost management becomes very clear. For API providers, all aspects of our developer facing solutions should be API driven, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">allowing API consumers to automate their applications, keys, usage, and other vital aspects of API integration and consumption</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rss-icon.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></p>
<p>A blog RSS feed is still my number one way to monitor what is happening across the API space. I also use RSS from <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> and <a href="http://www.talkwalker.com/en/social-media-intelligence/">TalkWalker</a> to monitor a variety of leading API industry keywords. RSS is an important information gathering format, and I wanted to help some of my non-developer followers, understand how they can aggregate RSS feeds across a variety of topics, clean up, and publish a centralized API for all feeds.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this advice, you will need to have three separate accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a></strong> - API reciprocity provider, helping you move your bits and bytes around online.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://accounts.google.com/">Google</a></strong> - Online spreadsheet solution, which can be used to deploy APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a></strong> - API deployment and management as a service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have accounts with these three services, you can take advantage of the features each brings to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pull RSS From Providers</strong> - Using Zapier, you can setup Zaps, which will allow you to connect RSS feeds, and route them to your Google Sheets. Setup a recipe for each RSS feed you will want to pull, store, and make available later.</li>
<li><strong>Google Sheet Content Store </strong>- Google Sheets provides you a data store, which your Zapier recipe will route all new RSS posts to. Depending on how many feeds you pull, and aggregate, you can setup one or many documents, and worksheets.</li>
<li><strong>Publish Central API -</strong> Using Restlet, you can setup what is called an entity store, which pulls the content of your spreadsheet(s), and stores them locally for publishing as an API. Once deployed, you can then setup a web API, which provides all content pulled via RSS, as a single API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, many developers are going to ask me, "why the hell would you do this"? First, this isn't for you--it is for folks without programming experience. This post is meant to be the outline, for an actual API integration how-to series I am working on, and is about introducing non-developers to what is possible with Zapier, Google Sheets, and Restlet.</p>
<p>My goal, is to help establish a robust toolbox that non-developers can put to work for them, and take more control of their worlds. Publishing APIs using the wide variety of approaches available to us via Zapier, Google, and Restlet, puts a lot of power and control into the hands of the average business user. Once I get a handful of API deployment examples, I will work on providing more examples of how these business users can then put that API to work in their own world.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/12/07/minimum-viable-api-service-provider-blueprint/">Minimum Viable API Service Provider Blueprint</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-minimum-viable.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are some pretty good examples (in my opinion), of well defined API service providers across the API landscape right now-- companies, who are selling services specifically to API providers. You know how you can tell a good provider? They do one thing, or just a handful of things well, it is well presented, and they also have an API -- who woulda thought that? Companies selling services to API providers should also do so via an API!</p>
<p>I am most definitely biased in showcase these companies, but a couple examples of this in action can be found with <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="/admin/blog/3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="https://securedb.co/">SecureDB</a>, and <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">API Scrience</a>. These are all companies that I support, but I support them because they offer valuable services to companies who are operating APIs, and they do it in a simple, well thought out way, complete with an API.</p>
<p>When you are crafting the strategy for the API service provider you would like to launch, here are my recommendations of what you should be including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website</strong> - Simple, modern, and informative website for your customers to discover, and on-board with the services you offer.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Have a genuine, active Twitter account that actually engages in conversations with community.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Establish an active, and meaningful Github presence via user account or organization, and make it your open work bench.</li>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Provide a thoughtful, active, and informative blog to comunicate with the community, your customers, and the public.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - If you are selling APIs to API providers, you need to make sure and be drinking the kool-aid with an API of your own.</li>
<li><strong>SaaS</strong> - Follow the principles of software as a service. I do not want to deal with old ways of purchasing and licensing software.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - Offer tiered pricing, so that we can kick the tires, and small companies (or groups) like myself can actually afford what you are offering.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> - Make sure you are there to support me as an API service provider--I am depending on you to scale my business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are many other elements I could also recommend, but I think this is a minimum viable API service provider definition. This isn't rocket science, or my unique view of the space. This is how API service providers should be operating as we go into 2016, and reflects the successful providers I keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The most telling characteristic for me in all of this, is when an API service provider does not have an API. I fundamentally believe that a service provider cannot help me be successful with my API operations, unless they also execute their own successful API strategy. When you look through the website of someone trying to sell you a service, and you cannot find a publicly available API -- turn around and go look for another provider.</p>
<p>As I think about the most valuable services in the space, and the ones that are helping me operate my business, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/12/03/if-i-cannot-scale-it-on-my-own-or-use-a-service-provider-i-do-not-scale-it/">beyond what I can scale on my own</a>, they are often small companies, focusing on a specific problem set. 3Scale focuses on API management, while Runscope and API Science focus on API monitoring, and APIMATIC addresses my SDK needs. Ultimately in 2015, I need my API services just like need the rest of my digital resources, as simple, intuitive, easy to use APIs, so that I can orchestrate them as I see fit.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-relational-data.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spent the weekend adding a <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren media type</a> to my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/buildingblock/">API building blocks API</a>, in support of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">my API life cycle map</a>&nbsp;work. Every time I dive into using Siren, and begin applying hypermedia constraints to my API design, I'm pleasantly surprised by what I learn. I am not a hypermedia evangelist, I am just trying to share what I learn, as I go evolve, and hopefully add to some of the existing knowledge that is floating around out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This work on my building blocks API is still very much a work in progress, when it comes to my own understanding of hypermedia, but also how I can use it to craft a more meaningful story around API(s). The first major benefit I realized, was instead of just have a basic JSON representation of my API building blocks, I was immediately forced to consider some very important dimensions around the JSON data I was serving up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Properties -</strong> What are the properties of the collection returned, or individual data sets.</li>
<li><strong>Entities -</strong> What are the actual structured objects that I am returning, and how do they relate.</li>
<li><strong>Actions - </strong>What actions can be taken around my data, and how can a developer engage with it.</li>
<li><strong>Links - </strong>What relevant links about the entities, and the information it contains are present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before this, I would just have a JSON array or object, which is essentially what I have under properties now, but now that I'm using Siren, I also have other meaningful relationships between my data present as entities. I also can provide relevant actions and links that any developer will potentially need, when they are working with the data provided.</p>
<p>For me, this evolution is significant. It isn't just about alleviating my version control challenges, or providing &nbsp;the perfect client (well I do have some client ambitions in doing this), it is just about helping think more deeply about the relationships between all of my data, as well as the meaningful actions that can be taken with it. It takes me well beyond about ticking off a checkbox, that I've vomited up JSON instead of HTML, and pushing me to think more critically about my data, and how it will actually be used.</p>

<p><a href="http://restlet.com/http-status-codes-map">It made me happy to see the folks over at Restlet playing with the same concept</a>&nbsp;(we didn't coordinate on it honestly), to help articulate HTTP status codes, which is a very important topic for the space, and we need more education tools, and stories around it. Using the subway map analogy, Restlet provides a representation of the five areas of status codes, providing a simple way to explore them, and find a description of each individual status code.</p>

<p>The subway map they provide is currently a static map, but this is one of the biggest potential areas in using this analogy for me, is that with the right JavaScript + JSON voodoo, you can make it real-time, and interactive. This is something I'm working on to bring the entire lifecycle to the forefront this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice work Restlet team, I enjoy these efforts by providers to help educate the space, especially when they do it in creative and fun ways like this.</p>

<p>I started API Evangelist, because I saw a huge deficiency in the overall API conversation--nobody was talking about the business of all of this, and how you actually make money doing this emerging web API thing. Over time, I also discovered that very few people were also studying, and discussing the politics of APIs. Sure, when something flares up around terms of service violations, or there is an acquisition that the community dislikes, we discuss it, but we have to talk about the political issues in real-time, not at polarize-time.</p>
<p>From my vantage point, the business and politics of API operations, internal as well as external influences, continue to be the number one things that negatively impact API operations, over anything technical. Let's just look at a couple examples of this in action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money -</strong> How are you going to operate an API without any money? Either from paying customers, or internally from other sources.</li>
<li><strong>Doers -</strong> If your business has been built on traditional sales and support models, evolving consumers to a doers mentality will not be an easy.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Interests -</strong> Various groups within an organization competing for budget, attention, and any other way regular current operations impact your API vision.</li>
<li><strong>Management Change -</strong> Your CTO had your back, and the new one not so much. It could be about lower level or mid-management support, all the way to the top. When the champions leave, API programs often dry up on the vine.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Regulation -</strong> Silicon loves to be in denial of the larger world, and the regulatory frameworks that are in place across many industries--once you grow big enough, or operate in the right space, this will become clearer.</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong> - How big are things? Software? Teams? Systems? Processes? There are many things that are big in the enterprise and even small businesses, that will resist decoupling and unbundling. People just do not think of things in small, bite-size chunks--it just isn't what they've been taught.</li>
<li><strong>You</strong> - Your vision might not be a fit for a business, organization, or industry, and you may be coming to the table with unrealistic expectations of what APIs can do.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the common business and political roadblocks you will encounter doing APIs. I do not care how solid your API design, and deployment strategy might be, when you come up against many of these currents listed above, the tech does not always win. I've seen API effort, after API effort fail because of these common challenges, that we all face.</p>
<p>For us technologists, it can be easy to sit at our corners, and craft a vision of the perfect world we want, but often it is oil, in a water filled world. I am not saying your API vision can't make change, but you have to equipped to understand that 75% of your efforts in the enterprise, organizations, and government agencies will be about culture, politics, and business--not technical.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2015</span>
        <p>I am spending some time taking another look at my "<a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client research</a>", which started out as just about Postman and PAW, but now contains ten separate services I'm and bundling into this area of research. As with all my research areas, these project repos shift, evolve, split and marge with time, as the API space changes, and my awareness of it grows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I &nbsp;completely understand the term "client" doesn't provide an adequate label for this bucket of research, but for now, it will have to do. As I add a couple of new services to the bucket, and made my way through some of the existing ones I had, I wanted to step back and look at what they were offering, but more importantly the message that went around quantify what tehse companies were offering.</p>
<p>When it comes to what I call "lines along the API lifecycle", I saw these areas represented.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-client-lifecycle-1.png" alt="" width="80%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>This is where the API client line potentially intersects with all of these other API life-cycle lines. However, When you start to analyze the features or building blocks offered by these service providers, you begin to see each stop along along the API client line, which becomes pretty critical to other areas of the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-client-lifecycle-2.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I know that what I am saying might not be completely clear, it isn't for me either. That is why I tell stories, to try and find the patterns, and learn how to articulate all the moving parts. I'm still trying to figure out what to call my research, alongside all of these API service providers working to define just exactly what it is they are selling as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-client-lifecycle-3.png" alt="" width="80%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>The more time I spend with <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">my API client research</a>, the more all of this comes into focus. The problem is that these companies are rapidly adding in new features, in demand to what their customers are needing, which keeps me on my toes, as well as increases overlap with other lines that I track on along the API life-cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to take a moment, update my research, and take another look at the companies, and tooling at play.</p>

<p>This is another one of those topics I talk a lot about, but only found few examples of me talking about on the blog--API service composition. If you aren't familiar with the concept, it is the art of taking digital resources (aka APIs), and mix and match them in different ways, until you find the right approach to delivering APIs, that provides value for both provider and consumer.</p>
<p>API service composition is about taking the basic building blocks of any web API, the URL, path, and VERBS (ability to get, add, update, and delete), and put them into as many different configurations as you think makes sense. Limiting who can access, how much they use, restrict by time frame, and crafting different pricing for different users or groups, require trial periods, setup costs, and even restricting to specific countries. API service composition is all about taking your APIs, <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">and if you are using modern API infrastructure like from 3Scale</a>, you can compose any service you desire, serving it up to anyone, in a secure way, using the open Internet.</p>
<p>This is the magic of modern API-driven solutions, when an API can be any digital resource, from simple data and content, to media like images, audio, and video, all the way to an increasing number of devices like fitness trackers, thermostats in our homes, and even our cars. When you have all of these resources at your finger tips, and the ability to compose them into any possible package, to satisfy any group of consumers--you have unlimited potential.</p>
<p>This is why so many companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are jumping on the API train. When you do APIs right, you gain a new level of control over the increasing amount of digital resources that are dominating our lives. API service composition is the key to all of this, and is one of the parts of the journey I enjoy the most--composing meaningful API service that offer value to consumers, and have the potential to change how business, industries, and even government can work.</p>

<p>I'm working my way through some of the low hanging fruit in my API notebook, when it comes to stories, and found a story thread I was working on regarding automating API key management. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/14/storing-api-keys-in-the-private-master-github-repository-for-use-in-github-pages/">I'm personally storing my keys, across the private master branch for my API reps, because I don't have any super-sensitive data, and it helps me manage across hundreds of APIs, in a central way</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">I've talked about the need to automate API key management in the past</a>--with the number of APIs we are using, to reach the level of security we will need, the lower level of keys will need a global refresh and management process. This level of keys most likely won't ever result in large scale security breaches, but will cause plenty headaches for both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p>If you use one of the following API management solutions, they provide you with an API for managing your API keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs"><strong>3Scale</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://apigee.com/docs/management/apis"><strong>Apigee</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://tyk.io/v1.8/rest-api/api-key-management/"><strong>Tyk</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This will help you manage your keys, if you are an API provider, but doesn't do a lot for you to manage your API keys across providers, as an API consumer. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Amazon provides a key management solution</a>, but at first glance it appears to be something you can use to manage keys across your AWS infrastructure (am I wrong?)--which makes sense for supporting AWS objectives. ;-)</p>
<p>When I wrote my last post on the growing need for API key management solutions, I received a number of email and DMs, which yielded two pretty interesting open source key management solutions, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault">Vault</a> and <a href="https://github.com/square/keywhiz">Keywhiz</a>. I'm going to evaluate these solutions for their viability as a back-end for an API driven, API key management solution, but I have a lot more work to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also working with a partner of mine, <a href="https://securedb.co/">SecureDB, and consider the possibility fo developing an encrypted API key management solution</a>, which then would be accessible via their secure API. They are looking for some interesting solutions like this to be developed on their platform, so if you are a developer, and looking for a viable micro startup idea--let me know.</p>
<p>As with everything in my world, the concept of automating API keys using APIs, and managing of keys across API platforms, is a work in progress--stay tuned!</p>

<p>I've done this a couple of times now. I took&nbsp;<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, and created my Screenshot API, and used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to create my Image Manipulation API. These are two openly licensed software solutions, which I took, and am using as an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are my licensing considerations? If I keep my server side code licensed according to the specifications, am I fine? PhantomJS is licensed under BSD, and ImageMagick is Apache 2.0. Does the licensing extend itself to the commercial services I would potentially offer via an API interface? There are lots of questions to satisfy, before I move forward--I guess I am looking for a precedent.</p>
<p>I am evaluating at a number of openly licensed software solutions right now to deliver a variety of stops along the API life-cycle, ranging from design, to deployment, virtualization, and much more. As always, I am trying to better understand the layers involved, and how software licenses, patent, and potentially copyright might apply.</p>
<p>Just putting it out there to the universe, and curious to see what comes back.</p>

<p>As I came across, I was also considering <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">different access plans across my APIs</a>, with some of the plans allowing for updating existing content in the system--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-bad-actors-on-both-sides-of-the-api-fence/">the topic of abuse of API access was on my mind</a>. I'm curious if ORES could be applied to any sort of content or data post via a PUT / PATCH API request?</p>
<p><span>Even if it didn't 100% out of the repo, maybe it could it be evolved to help manage the PUT / PATCH layer of API operations, allowing platforms to open up a little bit more, and open up more of their HTTP verbs, to a wider audience. Something like this could go a long way to helping API providers secure, and stabilize their API operations, and loosen service composition restrictions a little further.</span></p>
<p><span>Just a thought, as I'm kicking the tires of some of the open source API offerings I come across. Seems like to me, there is an opportunity for someone to deploy these open solutions as a service, and help API providers open up a little more. Just sharing with my audience, as a possible service that would benefit the API space, and hopefully make someone a little beer money--who knows!</span></p>

<p>I have been learning about hypermedia over the last three years now, and only earlier this year, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">I began playing with Siren to help me craft a better experience around my API industry news and link curation API</a>. My motivations in going down this hypermedia road was never about easing my client side pain, or helping me with future versions of my API--I am just not that sophisticated of an operation.</p>
<p>I started playing with hypermedia to help evolve the experience around the API news I was curating each week, making it so you could browse week by week, month by month, but also by topic, company, author, etc. I'm still trying to figure it out all out, and honestly the project is currently in the ditch after hitting the wall this fall, and not really giving a shit about the flow of API news. (I am better now, thx!)</p>
<p>Now in December, I'm trying to take my building block API, which provides access to over <a href="http://apievangelist.com/list-of-things-i-am-thinking-about-tonight.html">600 of the common patterns I've tracked on across the API space</a>. These are the features offered by API service providers, and the competitive advantage brought to the table by the successful API providers I keep an eye on, and they are all potential stops along the API life-cycle I am working to define.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">My API building block API</a> is a pretty standard content API, providing each element broken down by category, and type, with other supporting details. However, now I need to be able to plot them on a subway map, with an endless number of configurations, and dimensions to the journey. Via my building block API, I need to return any single stop along the API life-cycle, but along with it I need to provide the next stop in the line, the previous stop (paging 101), but then if I hit a transfer station, or other element, I need to offer an unlimited number of dimensions.</p>
<p>While I am concerned with the behavior of my client, it isn't the normal hypermedia-focused arguments I usually hear. I need to be able to deliver a subway-like transport experience for over 600 stops along the API lifecycle, for any possible API you can image. A simple API design just isn't going to cut it, I need a request and response model that can dynamically deliver the API life-cycle transport experience that I am looking to extend to my users.</p>
<p>I wish I had thought this out more, when I first got started designing my building block API. ;-(</p>

<p>Most of the tooling and services I come across in the API space, are designed for developers. As I play with more services, and put tools to work, trying understand their role in the API space, some take a lot of work to figure out, while others are pretty clear--it will be these tools and services that the masses of business users adopt, as part of the API evolution that is occurring online currently.</p>
<p>There are just a handful of services out there right now, that I think are mainstream ready, and are something that the average business user of the web, should be playing with right now--here are three of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a></strong> - Deploy API from a Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a></strong> - Use APIs in a Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.form.io/">Form.io</a></strong> - Deploy an API as form, via Single Page App.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other services and tools out there that will help you deploy and consume APIs, but these stand out, because they help the average business user solve real world business problems they are facing, without needing to write code. They also anchor there solutions in existing tooling that are ubiquitous, and part of every day business operations--the spreadsheet and the form.</p>
<p>Developers might care about the technical details of APIs, and evangelists like me might be able to convince some of the average business users of the potential of APIs, but before we can bring the masses on-board, we will need the right tools. Restlet, Blockspring, and Form.io have the potential to be these tools, and help the "normals" become active participants in the API economy, but more importantly find the (API driven) solutions they need for the problems they face every day.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-virtulization.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>This conversation has come up over 10 times this month, at <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">APIStrat</a>, and online conversations via Skype and GHangouts. The concept of API virtualization solutions. I am not talking about virtualization in the cloud computing and Docker sense, although that will play a fundamental role in the solutions I am trying to articulate. What I am focusing on is about providing sandbox, QA environments, and other specialized virtualization solutions for API providers, that make API consumers worlds much easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've touched on examples of this in the wild, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/05/api-sandbox-and-simulator-from-carvoyant/">my earlier post on&nbsp;API sandbox and simulator from Carvoyant</a>, which is an example of the need for virtualization solutions that are tailored for the connected automobile solution. Think of this, but for every aspect of the fast growing Internet of Things space. The IoT demand is about the future opportunity, I've talked about the current need, when I published, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/11/i-wish-all-apis-had-sandbox-environment-by-default/">I Wish All APIs Had Sandbox Environment By Default</a>.</p>
<p>I see envision 1/3 of these solutions being about deploying Docker containers on demand, 1/3 being about virtualizing the API using common API definitions, and the final 1/3 being about the data provided with the solutions. This is where I think the right team(s) could develop some pretty unique skills when it comes to delivering specialized simulations tailored for testing home, automobile, agriculture, industrial, transportation, and other unique API solutions.</p>
<p>We are going to need "virtualized" versions of our APIs, whether or not it is for web, mobile, devices, or just for managing APIs throughout their life cycle. You can see a handful of the <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com/">current API virtualizations out there on my research in this area</a>, but I predict the demand for more robust, and specialized API virtualization solutions is going to dramatically increase as the space continues its rapid expansion. I just wanted to put it out there, and encourage all y'all to think more about this area, and push forward the concept of API virtualization as you are building all the bitch'n tooling you are working on.</p>

<p>I get regular links sent to me, and foiks telling me that freemium API access is a bad idea. That it doesn't help your API sales funnel, and was something that was just a thing, for a brief moment in time. The folks who always bring me these stories, are not API consumers, they are business folks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree, there are some really bad examples of freemium in play across the API space, and with the bad behavior we see from API consumers, I fully understand why stories make their rounds--leaving a bad taste in the mouths of API providers for freemium access.</p>
<p>The disconnect that allows this to happen in my opinion, is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/30/how-do-i-price-my-api-resources/">folks not thinking through their monetization, plans, and pricing in an API centric way</a>. Folks approach it as a across the board monetization approach, and do not think of it as a tool to apply on a resource by resource basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freemium is just one tool in your toolbox, and should evaluated at every step in the monetization planning for your APIs, and used, or not used, based upon your well planned on-boarding funnel for your API consumers.</p>
<p>Consider educational access to your API resources (also one tool in your toolbox), which is a common offering from API providers. You wouldn't offer this in all scenarios, it just doesn't make sense, but you aso wouldn't just dismiss it as a bad idea--you keep in your toolbox for when it makes sense.</p>
<p>I see API operations let by business folks dismiss freemium as a bad idea because they don't experience on how it influences in the on-boarding process, but I also see API operations let by developers dismiss the need for traditional sales approaches, and hurt themselves in similiar ways.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I recommend iterating through the list of common API monetization building blocks I've aggregated from leading API providers,</a> for each resource you are planning to release. <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">If you have a modern API infrastructure provider like 3Scale</a>, you will be able to define individual plans, using a variety units of value, at different rates, rooted in who you are targeting with your API resources--make sure you have as many tools as possible in your toolbox, don't throw any away.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a> began as a news site, and evolved into a directory of the APIs that I monitor in the space. <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I published APIs.json indexes for the almost 1000 companies I am trackig on, with almost 400 OADF files for some of the APIs I've profiled in more detail</a>. My mission around the project so far, has been to create an open source, machine readable repo for the API space.</p>
<p>I have &nbsp;had two recent occurrences that are pushing me to expand on my API Stack work. First, I have other entities who want to contribute monitoring data and other elements I would like to see collected, but haven't had time. The other is I that I have started spidering the URLs of the API portals I track on, and need a central place to store the indexes, so that others can access.</p>
<p>Ultimately I'd like to see the API Stack act as a public repo, where anyone can grab the data they need to discovery, evaluate, integrate, and stay in tune with what APIs are doing, or not doing. In addition to finding OADF, API Blueprint, and RAML files by crawling and indexing API portals, and publishing in a public repo, I want to build out the other building blocks that I index with APIs.json, like pricing, and TOS changes, and potentially monitoring, testing, performance data available.</p>
<p>Next I will publish some pricing, monitoring, and portal site crawl indexes to the repo, for some of the top APIs out there, and start playing with the best way to store the JSON, and other files, and provide an easy way explore and play with the data. If you have any data that you are collecting, and would like to contribute, or have a specific need you'd like to see tracked on, let me know, and I'll add to the road map.</p>
<p>My goal is to go for quality and completeness of data there, before I look to scale, and expand the quantity of information and tooling available. Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback.</p>

<p>While it will never be 100% complete or perfect, I finally have <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">my API stack</a> in a way that lets me add, evolve, scale, and deprecate the endpoints as I need. I've been centralizing all of my APIs, <a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane">underneath a single Github organization</a>, with each API as a single repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each API has from one to around 50 endpoints, existing in its own repo, with the master branch set to private, and the gh-pages branch existing as a public repository, and contains the public face of the API (aka portal). This approach is giving me standardized way to manage my fast growing API stack, in a way that I know how to find anything, anytime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the API itself runs on a series of AWS EC2 instances, the private repository is the blueprint for its operation, with server side code, database backups, and details of its overall configuration. The public, or Github Pages branch of the API, acts as the public portal, with docs, client code, OADF file, and of course an <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json">APIs.json file</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">Within my master API Github organization I have 33 separate API repos</a>, with a single master public page, which acts as the central index of all APIs, with a single portal portal with APIs.json file. I use this page to navigate to all my APIs, and I rely on Github heavily to manage the public, and private side of my API operations (emphasis on public).</p>
<p>Now that I have my house somewhat in order, when I'm looking to start a new API, I simple create a new repo, add an APIs.json, and OADF file, and begin crafting the API resource that I need. Every other <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">stop along the API life cycle from deployment to deprecation</a> uses this central Github repo, and it's API definitions, as its central source of truth and operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have a lot of housekeeping left to do, to get things in order, but I can't help myself, and I keep adding new APIs. I'm hoping I can keep automating my API lifeycle using this approach, allowing me to tackle a growing API stack, while staying a one person operation.</p>

<p>I am continuing my series on helping non-developers realize they can publish, and put APIs to work, without having an API expert in their pocket, using <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a>, and <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>. Its no secret that Restlet is an API Evangelist partner, and they are my partner because they are the easiest way to deploy a web API--something I am trying to help the "normals" understand the untapped potential of.</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">As I finish up my @APIStrat conference again</a>, for the sixth time, I'm reminded that I need to harvest the essential Twitter exhaust from the conference, otherwise if I wait too long, I won't be able to get it. You see, Twitter limits what you can grab from the Twitter API by either time, or number of Tweets, so I can only gather X amount of Tweets, and if I wait too long, I'm often out of luck. It is critical that I do this right away, and depending on how loud the Twitter exhaust is, I need to do it while the event is still going on.</p>
<p>To start, you obviously need a Twitter account, but you will also need a Zapier, Google and Restlet account. Then using Zapier you can gather the following Twitter data points, and send to a Google Sheets:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Mentions</li>
<li>New Followers</li>
<li>New Favorites</li>
<li>New Tweets</li>
</ul>
<p>How you store these in Google Sheets is up to you, but I recommend breaking each data point down as its own sheet, and even by separate time-frame like day, week, or month. It helps to keep things broken up into smaller chunks, when you are using Google Sheets as a data store--tricks of the trade!</p>
<p>Zapier gives you everything you need to setup the Zaps that route mentions, followers, favorites, and your tweets to the Google Sheet(s), and once they are there, you can clean up, edit, and organize as you see fit. Next Restlet comes into the picture, allowing you deploy an "entity store" from your Google Spreadsheet. Once you have your entity store connected to the Google Spreadsheet, using their simple wizard, you can then deploy as a web API--Restlet walks you through the entire process, no code necessary.</p>
<p>What you do with your API is up to you, but the important part for me, is I have the references to the Tweets and followers from Twitter that are important to me. When I need to reference the mentions for an event back in 2013, I can do it. When I need to create a special outreach list to anyone who Tweeted at our most recent event, I can do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple API solutions, using Zapier, Google Sheets, and Restlet, are empowering to the average business and organizational user who is looking to just get their work done, track on what is important to them, but in an API-centric way which will then allow the information to be then used in web and mobile apps, but also spreadsheets, widgets, and other API driven goodies.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-http.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've seen something at an ever increasing pace lately, situations where very intelligent software engineers hit a wall, and realize they do not understand the fundamental building blocks of HTTP, and the web that we are all using daily. It makes my heart ache, because I remember when I found myself in the same place, and still suffer from the deprivation I experienced.</p>
<p>Whether it was my time programming in Microsoft-land, Drupal, WordPress, or any other Web 2.0-land, I eventually realized how much was hidden from me behind the curtain. When you bundled this with the fact I'm a fairly privileged white male software engineer who can be fairly clueless about what is around me, I missed a lot. Something I still find myself recovering from in 2015, even after five years of exclusively studying web APIs--you know, the ones that use HTTP for transport?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not stupid, but with my lazerfocus &trade;, I often miss a lot. I feel that many of the smart people I know suffer from a similar illness, but do not have the fortitude for transparency, or the humbleness to accept, that will allow them to move on. Programming language dogma, and platform or framework dependencies can be a powerful thing, but they can also do a lot protect us from what we need to learn to actually be successful, and grow.</p>
<p>At this point, i question everything. What I know. What a platform might be hiding from me, to sell back to me as feature, and what is the bigger picture of the Internet that I use everyday, and often take for granted.</p>

I will also be studying the portability of services that are being sold to API providers, and pushing for more import / export features like Runscope offers.</p>
<p>I will be tracking on the API definitions used by service providers like Runscope, across the 26+ areas I monitor, and trying to better understand the JSON schemas they are using to encourage the portability of their services. The API definition, response, and request models put forth by companies, tells a lot about the service they offer in my opinion, and I'd say the overall portability of services is another strong characteristics I will be keeping an eye out for.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-bad-actors-on-both-sides-of-the-api-fence/">As I think about the bad behavior that occurs on the API consumption side of API operations</a>, I'm considering ways that I can help API providers address these problems when they arise within their ecosystems. What can you do when bad actors have access to your APIs? Also more critically for some providers, what can you do to prevent bad actors from on-boarding with your API program at all?</p>
<p>I strongly believe that companies should be as public with their API efforts as possible, but when it comes to which developers you let in, and which ones you don't, I'm finding I'm becoming more conservative in my thoughts--as long as you are transparent about the process. I'm still forming all of my thoughts around this (hence the blog post), and I'm sure is something that will keep evolving as I continue to push forward my awareness of the API space.</p>
<p>When I see a new sign-up for my own APIs, I like to be able to verify who the new consumer is. I like to see a real name, and potentially a company name, but also when I Google the combination, I like to see an active Twitter, LinkedIn, or Github account. It is easy to tell real people, from personas that live n the shadows, and I prefer verifiable people use my APIs.</p>
<p>If you are a public API consumer, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask you to maintain some sort of public presence, to verify who you are, and what you do. I know for many enterprise developers this is insanity, which is why I put LinkedIn profiles in the mix--I do not expect everyone to be super popular on Twitter, and a die-hard Github user. However, in 2015, you really should consider!</p>
<p>As I'm going through my own API on-boarding process, trying to make smoother (it isn't the best right now), I am considering how I will articulate what behavior I expect of my API consumers--in plain English. This post is just part of my iteration, putting my thoughts out to the universe, getting feedback when I can, but ultimately knowing that I am the sole decision maker when it comes to setting the tone in my own API community.</p>
<p>What tone are you setting? Do you verify your API consumers? What is the bar you set for a place at the table?</p>

<p>I am continuing to push my research around API <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a>, <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">plans</a>, and <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">partners</a> forward, whilep preparing for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">my API lifecycle keynote at @Defrag and @APIStrat</a>. Along the way, I am also exercising some of my API pricing and planning strategies with my partner in crime at <a href="http://apiware.io">APIware</a>, as we think through some new products that we are developing.</p>
<p>How I approach pricing for API products, is on a resource by resource basis, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">considering all of the API monetization tools in my toolbox</a>. For example, when i launch two new API endpoints for <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/11/27/adding-a-new-alpha-endpoint-to-explode-api-oadf-into-separate-files-for-each-unique-endpoint/">exploding API definitions</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/11/27/adding-a-new-alpha-endpoint-to-tell-me-how-big-my-api-endpoints-are/">telling me how big my APIs are</a>, I quickly run down my list of monetization building blocks to see which areas will apply to these new resources. The reality is, until these APIs leave an alpha stage, they will just exist in my internal consumption tier.</p>
<p>Even though these APIs aren't ready for prime time yet, I am already thinking through which of my API monetization building blocks will apply. Will I charge for access? Are they available in the freemium tier? Do I offer only a trial version of them? Ultimately it all comes down to who I will be targeting with these resources, and in this case it will be primarily hardcore API architects--something that helps me define how I will price these resources, and which service tiers I make them available in.</p>
<p>When it comes to generating revenue from APIs, rarely are there a one size fits all solution. You should be considering each resource based upon the value it brings to the table, who you are targeting with this resource, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">weighing all the tools in a modern API monetization toolbox</a>. Remember the business of APIs resembles the technology of APIs, where you do things in small chunks, and you iterate, until you find the optimal value proposition that works for the platform, and your consumers.</p>

<p>I am still catching up on my feeds, and open browser tabs, and one tab that has been open for a couple of weeks is <a href="https://medium.com/@lukestokes/why-your-colleagues-still-don-t-understand-hypermedia-apis-1a5a2cf82540">Why Your Colleagues Still Don&rsquo;t Understand Hypermedia APIs</a>, by Luke Stokes (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukestokes">@lukestokes</a>) of <a href="http://www.foxycart.com/">FoxyCart</a>. The post is very thought provoking for me, and represents what I feel is the very pragmatic front of the hypermedia movement, from someone who has helped move the concept of a hypermedia API from academic discussion to reality, with the <a href="https://api.foxycart.com/docs">FoxyCart API</a>.</p>
<p>His challenges at the end of his post really set the stage for me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So how do we find a balance between idealism about what Hypermedia API documentation systems &ldquo;should&rdquo; be and what they practically are? How can we move the whole ecosystem forward by encouraging client developers to code to link relationships instead of hard-coded URLs? How do we help pave the way for the future but not look like unsophisticated outsiders in the process? What pragmatic steps should we take to be like the other cool kids using standard documentation presentations while at the same time saying, &ldquo;Um, yeah, don&rsquo;t do that. Don&rsquo;t code to the URL, code to the link relationship instead.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For me, his questions illuminate the canyon between where the API community is currently with API design, and the vision of where we should be going with our API design practices. The more I play and learn with hypermedia, the less I see it as the lofty vision for the future, and the more I see it as a set of practical design patterns that will make my API work more meaningful.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of API definitions like Swagger (now OADF), is that it was designed for documenting your API, after it was already designed--awesome, but not remotely about API design. Where the concept of hypermedia is all way back the other direction, where you have to put some serious thought into your API design, before you ever roll up your sleeves to write code--big gap between these worlds.</p>
<p>J<a href="http://apiary.io">akub, Z, and the Apiary.io</a> team has done some amazing work to bring the mainstream conversation closer towards API design, much than hypermedia folks had ever done--until recently. What Luke asks, reflects the work we have left to bridge the divide, and emphasizes that it has to be something that scales. This is why Swagger was successful, because it provided the section of the bridge that API architects needed to solve an immediate problem that on the table, at scale--documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, the masses are pretty short-sighted, and often unwilling to the heavy learning and lifting needed to "code to link relationships, instead of hard-coded URLs". Unfortunately we will need more tooling to help us build more sections of the bridge (beyond Swagger), as we won't be able to it all at once. I think the important thing with this tooling, is we need make sure with each section of the bridge that we build, we are also educating API architects, and client developers around HTTP, media types, link relations, and other empowering hypermedia concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, Luke got me pumped with his questions. I do not know what the answers are either, but I want to lend a hand to help figuring it out, and will be asking these questions over and over in my head, showcase solutions that y'all are working on, and tell stories here on the blog, until we make some progress.</p>

<p>I'm neck deep in government open data again, and as we are gearing up for the presidential election, you really begin to see the potential for accurate, real-time election data via APIs. There are a number of leading election-related APIs at the federal level like we have from the&nbsp;<a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, and you see the emergence of high value APIs out of government like the&nbsp;<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/07/08/openfec-api/">Federal Election Commision (FEC) API from the 18F</a>, but with the amount of money in politics, and scope of what is at stake, I can't help but feel there is a huge opportunity out there for more election APIs.</p>
<p>Seems to me that there is an opportunity for some API savvy activistpreneur to step up at the city, county, state, and even the federal level. I'm not just talking about election districts, candidate, and other common building blocks of elections we experience, but real-time sentiment, superpac spending, and other influential information that if availablle for distribution via APIs, could shift the balance one way or another. It would take a healthy assessment of the current landscape, but I think you could identify some low hanging fruit to get started with.</p>
<p>One you get going on the API journey around election data, if you do it right, you will learn a lot, and discover other valuable content or data sources, and see patterns that the rest of might not see. The use of social platforms over the last 8+ years of elections was all API driven, and is just the tip of the iceberg--an API dedicated to elections seems like a huge opportunity to me, in coming months and years.</p>

<p>I've always been a strong advocate for the API consumer, which is one of the primary motivations for me working to define best practices that API providers can follow across their operations. The majority of my negative experiences, when it comes to APIs, has been as an API consumer, not as an API provider.</p>
<p>As I do this API Evangelist thing longer, and longer, the bad behavior by API consumers becomes more clear to me, and I'd say rivaling much of the bad behavior by API providers that I have seen, and in some cases helping actually drive it. I do not have any bad actors in my API community, but through conversations I have had with leading API providers, I'm hearing some pretty crazy stories.</p>
<p>Badly behaved API consumers range from signing up for multiple accounts, rather than paying for higher levels of access, to trolling within the community, treating other developers badly, platform owners horribly, and just being a shitty API community citizen. You will never truly understand how badly API consumers can behave, until you've operated an API platform, and had a large number of consumers putting an API to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I will always keep my critical stance towards API providers, as I feel they often set the tone for a community, I am increasingly more understanding when platforms have to tighten things down, and get more critical when it comes to the public availability of API resources. In the end, I will always push for more public transparency around every aspect of API operations, but I am increasingly advising companies to have a tight grip on their API service composition, and what resources developers get access to, before they prove they are trustworthy.</p>

I spent two weeks pushing my research forward in preparation for these talks, and wanted to take a moment to gather my thoughts, and share the narrative of my talk.</p>
<p>When I first gave this title and abstract for both the Defrag and APIStrat keynotes, I called it "the 17 stops along a modern API lifecycle". After pushing my research forward, to support these talks, it became 26 stops, then those became what I am calling "lines", resulting in me just call the talk "the API life-cycle".</p>
<p>I use my public speaking as a vehicle for my API research, helping me polish my work, and ultimately pushing me to craft better narratives around my work, but most importantly, make it more coherent, and make sense to the average individual. One way that I do this, is to root my stories in history, build upon the earlier work in the tech space, and anchor them to other relevant areas of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Everything I do as the API Evangelist is built on the hard work of men and women who came before me.</p>
<p>From the 1940s...</p>

<p>The 1990s...<strong><br /></strong></p>

<p>The 2000s...</p>

<p>Getting us to the current decade, where I saw the potential of delivering the compute resources we needed for the mobile devices, that were quickly becoming ubiquitous in our daily personal as well as business lives. Designing, deploying, and managing APIs in support of mobile was the catalyst for my research as the API Evangelist in the summer of 2010.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/compute-2010s.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>As the API Evangelist, all that I do is map out what I am seeing across the API space, mapping out what API pioneers like Amazon and Salesforce are doing, as well as how recent API darlings like Twilio, SendGrid are executing on their API operations. I take this awareness, and map it against the services that leading API service providers are offering, in hopes of establishing a more coherent view of the overall API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I conduct my research in hopes of helping API providers better understand how to establish a more successful strategy, but with a focus on being able to articulate this not just internally, but with developers, partners, and potentially the public at large. APIs are important. They are increasingly the pipes that are driving our personal, and professional worlds, and it is important that we do them as well as possible, so that they benefit everyone involved.</p>
<p>In 2015, I feel like I am the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck">Henry Beck of the API space</a>. If you aren't familiar with his work, he was one of the original minds behind a different way of thinking about mapping, designed for public transportation, that is still used today to describe major transit operations in cities around the globe.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/henry-beck.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>In 1933, Henry Beck created a map of the London Underground, that was decoupled from earlier ways of mapping and communicating around transit resources, in a way that was focused on how the resources would be experienced by end-users, evolving beyond a focus on the transit resources themselves, and their location in our physical world.</p>
<p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Beck_Map_1933.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Earlier approaches to mapping out the subway reflected traditional mapping techniques, and were bound to legacy physical elements like roads, rivers, mountains, and buildings. While maps like this one from 1889, were technically accurate, they didn't always convey an increasingly complex subway system to end-users as they experienced it.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/1889small.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Even into the new century, subway maps were plotted along roads and rivers, leaving them coupled to legacy elements, and ways of thought,&nbsp; ignoring the fact that end-users of the subway were not thinking in these terms as they put the transit system to use. Riders just wanted to know how they needed to get where they were going, and not be burdened with these legacy elements they often do not even see.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/1902small.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>By 1915, public transit engineers like Henry Beck were rethinking how they mapped the transit infrastructure, in a way that helped them better communicate their increasingly complex infrastructure internally, but most importantly, in a way that helped them communicate externally to the public.</p>
<p>In 2015, this is what I feel like I am doing. Mapping out all the stops along the increasingly complex API life-cycle, in a way that helps API providers better understand their own life-cycle, but also like the subway map infrastructure, in a way that helps them communicate to consumers, and end-users.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/api-lifecycle-tag-cloud.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>At this point in my research, I am asking myself how&nbsp; I take the 26+ common areas of an API life-cycle and create standardized lines, that I could possibly be communicated in a common way, using the subway map analogy. As I approach the end of 2015, I have&nbsp;809 building blocks, in 149 categories, across these 26 common areas--I need a more universal approach to plotting these out, and the subway map is providing me with one possible way of doing this.</p>

<p>The problem I am facing, is how do I properly map out these lines, in a way that reflect the role the play in an overall life-cycle? This is the difficult place I find myself currently, but will be working to solve using the subway map tools I am developing. They beauty of this analogy, is that I will be able to create multiple iterations over time, as well as be able to fork, and evolve maps for different platforms--similar to how multiple cities use the same subway map for their cities unique infrastructure.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<!--Begin Layer 2 -->
<p><br />Even once I find a rhyme and rhythm to mapping out the lines, stops, stations, and flows for my version of the API life-cycle, how will I do the same for the actual APIs themselves? I will need each API to follow a version of the API lifecycle, but also potentially possess its own, entirely separate journey, unique to a single API or potentially a stack of APIs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-resources-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />Eventually I envision a world where I don't just have my entire API life-cycle mapped out, as well the journey involved with each of my APIs, and the API collections I define, I want a real-time visualization for my entire infrastructure. I want to see where each API is on the API life-cycle, as well as see where each of my API consumers, and even API users are on their own journey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might seem like a pretty tall order, but when you take a closer look at things, you realize that over 75% of the elements present in my API life-cycle definition, also has an API. <a href="http://3scale.net">My API management with 3Scale has an API</a>, and my <a href="http://apiscience.com">API monitoring with API Science has an API</a>. I'm increasingly choosing API service providers that have an API, because I need them to be a real-time contributor to my overall API lifecycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />With my API infrastructure being API driven, I can now think of my API life-cycle subway map in API terms. I can dynamically plot out each API I operate as a journey, depicted as its own subway line, and also make sure each API interacts with its respective API life-cycle journey--all using APIs. *mind blown*</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-resources-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />But wait there is more! It gets even better--it just so happens that <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">I also have an API for the subway map</a>. It is just an alpha version, but using this API, I can dynamically plot out the map of each area of my API life-cycle, as well as for each individual API, and its own journey on the life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Subway-Map-API.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>I'm not sure where all of this API life-cycle mapping will go. I'm hoping it will help me think through the API life-cycle, in the context of my overall API industry research, as well as my own APIs that I operate. I am hoping the process will help me decouple the way I approach my APIs from some of my legacy ways of thinking, built up over the last 25+ years a software architect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping I will start to see my APIs in a new light, breaking away from thinking about them in a linear way, through the lens of the applications I build on top of them, as well as the resources they are developed from. I want my APIs to be decoupled from much of their legacy constraints, and reflect more how they will be consumed by developers, and experienced by end-users.</p>
<p>I am not under any illusions that this process will be easy, and it will probably take a great deal of time, and iterations, much like it did for early subway architects, when it came to mapping out early transit infrastructure.</p>

<p>Until finally, I'm hoping I will find a way to describe my own API life-cycle, and APIs, in a universal way, that could work for other API providers, and even API service providers. It took over 15 years of iterating on early London Underground maps, before they finally landed on this design in 1933.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Beck_Map_1933.jpg" alt="" width="85%" /></p>
<p>Beck developed an approach to mapping transit infrastructure that would also work for defining complex transit infrastructure over almost a century later. The approach he helped define, is still applied as part of how we map out, as well as communicate transit infrastructure, around the globe in 2015. I hope I can apply some of the same principles to begin defining the virtual API infrastructure we are increasingly depending on in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/tubemap.gif" alt="" width="85%" /></p>
<p>While Ian Bogost was tweeting in jest about using a subway map for all written and visual communications, the tweet was very timely and relevant for me. It came across my Twitter timeline, just as I was crafting my subway map keynotes for Defrag and APIStrat. While I do not favor the subway approach for "all written and visual communications", I do think it has potential for "discursive synthesis" of the potentially complex API infrastructure that we are building in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/ian-bogost-twitter.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Through my work, I am hoping to establish a sort of subway map line "toolbox" for communicating around the API life-cycle that I have spent the last five years defining. I am looking for this toolbox to give me a way of communicating&nbsp; and collaborating with others in a way that reflects common API industry approaches, while also being able to customize for specific platform needs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-key.png" alt="" width="660" /></p>
<p>In addition to having a toolbox that reflects a modern API life-cycle, I am hoping the subway map approach gives me a set of tools I can use to visual the life-cycle of every individual API within my control. I desperately need a common way visualize my APIs, as well better understand where they exist within my overall API life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-key-resources.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Having a common way to describe and communicate around transit infrastructure is critical to society operating, and the global economy. I feel pretty strongly that having a common way to describe and communicate around the API infrastructure we are increasingly depending on is just as critical&nbsp;critical to society operating, and the global (API) economy.</p>
<p>We need an approach that reflects how companies around the globe are already operating their APIs, acknowledging the value of existing successful patterns of interoperability, established by the Amazons and Twitters of the world, but also allows for the flexibility, customizablity, and unique needs of individual companies, and industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standardization, as well as uniqueness of what I'm talking about can be seen in the beautiful array of subway maps for major cities around the globe. These amazing maps meet the transit needs of each cities, while also embracing the principles laid out by early transit planners like Beck.</p>

<p>My storytelling at events like Defrag and APIStrat, as well as on my blog, always reflects where I am at with my research. Next I will be crafting more meaningful version of subway maps for each area of the API life-cycle, as well as an overall view showing all&nbsp;809 building blocks, in 149 categories, across the 26 areas I track on as part of my research.</p>
<p>I am anticipating that I will hit some areas where the subway map analogy fails me. I am already thinking about some ways of augmenting API specific elements on the approach, to help me better communicate specifically about API infrastructure. An example of where I'm bending this, is the concept that an individual API can have its own map, and line, as well as be a passenger on other lines--I just need to come up with a sort of wormhole station connector element that helps communicate this relationship and / or transition.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">As always, you can find my research on the home page of API Evangelist</a>. As I complete subway maps for each of the 26 areas, as well as the overall map, I will make sure they are available as part of the navigation between each areas of my research. I am hoping to also use some JavaScript magic, in conjunction with the subway map analogy, to make navigating my research more of a journey, than just clicking around my site.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-power-button.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just read <a href="https://medium.com/@TomSteinberg/the-pill-versus-the-bomb-what-digital-technologists-need-to-know-about-power-b1aede7facc9#.y28fb5vb6">The Pill versus the Bomb: What Digital Technologists Need to Know About Power</a>, by&nbsp;Tom Steinberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/steiny">@steiny</a>), and I'm reminded of the important role APIs will (hopefully) continue to play in helping provide a transparent window into some of the power structures being coded into the algorithms we are increasingly relying on in this digital world we are crafting.</p>
<p>In this century, we are seeing a huge shift in how power flows, and despite the rhetoric of some of the Silicon Valley believers, this power isn't always being democratized along the way. Much of the older power structures is just being re-inscribed into the algorithms that drive network switches, decide pricing when purchasing online, via our online banking, and virtually ever other aspect of our personal and business worlds.</p>
<p>APIs give us a window into how these algorithms work, providing access to 3rd party developers, government regulators, journalists, and many other essential actors across our society and economy. Don't get me wrong, APIs are no magic pill, or nuclear bomb, when it comes to making algorithmic power flows more transparent and equitable, but when they are done right, they can have a significant effect.</p>
<p>If APIs are a complete (or near complete) representation of the algorithms that are driving platforms, they can be used to better understand how decisions behind the algorithmic curtain are made, and exactly how power is flowing (or not) on web, mobile, and increasingly connected device platforms--API does not equal perfect transparency, but will help prevent all algorithms from being black boxes.</p>
<p>We may not fully understand Uber's business motivations, but through their API we can test our assumptions. We may not always trust Facebook's advertising algorithm, but using the API we can develop models for better understanding why they serve the ads they do. Drone operators may not always have the best intentions, but through mandatory device APIs, we can log flight times and locations. These are just a handful of examples that APIs can be used to map out digital power.</p>
<p>All of this is one of the main reasons that I do API Evangelist. I feel like we have a narrow window of opportunity to help ensure APIs act as this essential transparent layer for ALL API operations across industries. As the established power structures (eye of Sauron) turn their attention to the web, and increasingly APIs, their powers of transparency are becoming more diminished. It is up to us API Evangelists, to help make sure APIs stay publicly available to 3rd party developers, government, journalists, end users, and other key players--providing much needed transparency into how algorithms work, and how power is flowing on the web and mobile Internet.</p>

<p>It can be easy to stumble across the base URL for one of my APIs out on the open Internet. I design my APIs to be easily distributed, shared, and as accessible as possible--based upon what I feel the needs for the resource might be. You can find most of my APIs, as part of my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master stack</a>, but there are other APIs like my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/screen-capture/">screen capture API</a>, or maybe my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/screen-capture/">image manipulation API</a>, that are often orphaned, which I know some people could use some help identifying more of the resources that are behind API operations.</p>
<p>To help support discovery across my network of APIs, I'm going to be supporting requests for Content-Type: application/apis+json for each endpoint, as well as an <a href="http://apisjson.org">apis.json file</a> in the root of the API, and supporting portal. An example of this in action, can be seen with my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog API</a>, where you can look into the root of the portal for API (<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json">kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json</a>), and in the root of the base URL for the API (<a href="http://blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json">blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json</a>), and for each individual endpoint, like the (<a href="http://blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/">blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/</a>) endpoint, you can request the&nbsp;Content-Type:&nbsp;application/apis+json, and get a view of the APIs.json discovery file.</p>
<p>It will take me a while to this rolled out across all of my APIs, I have worked out the details on my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">API</a> APIs. Providing discovery at the portal, API, and endpoint level just works. It provides not just access to documentation, but the other critical aspects of API operations, in a machine readable way, wherever you need it. It is nice to be on the road to having APIs.json exist as the media type (application/apis+json), something that isn't formal yet, but we are getting much closer with the latest release, and planned releases.</p>
<p>Next, I will push out across all my APIs, and do another story to capture what things look at that point. Hopefully it is something I can encourage others to do eventually, making API discovery a little more ubiquitous across API operations.</p>

<p>I am back home in Los Angeles, after another great edition of <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice--this time in Austin, TX</a>. I have had a few day to decompress, and took a day to reboot my brain by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/23/sharing-235k-api-definitions-with-the-english-language-api-recipe-book/">crafting 235K+ API definitions for the English language</a>, resulting in some time to reflect on what happened last week in Austin.</p>
<p>First of all I want to thank <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. Without the API infrastructure provider, APIStrat would not happen. Second I want to <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/sponsors/">thank all the sponsor s who get involved</a>, without your support the conversation wouldn't happen. Third, I want to thank the speakers and attendees for making it such a meaningful conversation.</p>
<p>I tend to use that word, "conversation" a lot when describing APIStrat, but I feel pretty strongly that it is the conversation that occurs at APIStrat that helps move the entire API community in a very meaningful way. The conference always renews my energy, and strengthens my relationships with other important folks in the space that I rely on for my research and storytelling.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to everyone who came to Austin last week and participated, and special thanks to Steve and the 3Scale team for investing so much into the API community, while asking for so little in return.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-copyright.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I needed a side project to reboot my mind after @APIStrat this last weekend, so I opened up my notebook and picked a project that I've been meaning to give some attention to, one that would help me clean my slate, and let me get back to my regular work levels. The project I picked is one that I came up with a little over a year ago, but recently had flushed out my vision further, as I hung out at my favorite watering whole drinking an IPA.</p>
<p>It took me several iterations before I landed on a name for this project, but my working title is <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/">the English Language API Recipe Book</a>. I find myself in an awkward position these days, when it comes to the concept of API copyright, which is something I have taken a firm stance on with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">my work around the Oracle v Google ava API copyright case</a>, and the release of the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API licensing format API Commons</a>, but is something, in the end, I just do not believe in.</p>
<p>You see, in my opinion, API definitions should NOT fall under copyright. Like recipes and menus, API definitions should not be open for anyone to use. To help me make my point, I wanted to craft <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/">the English Language API Recipe Book</a>, publishing an open API definition for almost every word in the English dictionary. I found a reasonably complete list of every English word, and auto-generated an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Open API Definition Format (OADF)</a> specification for each of the 235K+ words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each API definition, I cover the base GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs for each word, providing a basic query via a parameter, and return a name, and description as the basic underlying data model. I am already playing with other variations of database models, and have also generated another dimension for each word, by again iterating through each word, and adding it as a secondary level resource. I am also playing with other relationships, and ideas for expanding the dimensions of this recipe book, but wanted to get this first version out the door.</p>

<p>Overall, I just want to show how easy it is to programmatically generate API definitions, and add this English Language API Recipe Book to my already growing number of API definitions, <a href="http://theapistack.com">from popular APIs that I include in the API Stack</a>. Through this work, I wanted to emphasize, that no matter how much work you put into the naming, ordering, and design of your API definitions, they are not creative works that you should lock up and defend--your API definitions should be open, easily accessible, shared, and designed for reuse.</p>
<p>While I do not think any of the 235K+ API definitions should have copyright applied, I will putting all of these into public domain, using a Creative Commons license, as act two of this production. This is more theater than anything, but using API Commons, I will make sure every word in the English dictionary, crafted as a basic web API, is available for anyone to use, anytime, anywhere (as it should be, DUH). I recently stated in a keynote, after launching API Commons, that I was going to be the "Johnny Fucking Appleseed" of publishing openly licensed API definitions, out in front of slower moving corporations like Oracle--the English Language API Recipe Book is just the beginning of this.</p>
<p>Next up, I will be crafting a series of OADF API definitions for <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a> and use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to bundles as a more meaningful collection. I will be using these data models to further automate the English Language API Recipe Book, and establish additional dimensions to this collection. <a href="https://github.com/english-language-api-recipe-book">You can find the English Language API Recipe Book on Github</a>. I have published as a Github organization, with a separate sharded repository for each letter of the alphabet, containing a separate OADF definition for each word in the dictionary, and indexed using APIs.json to index each letter, <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/apis.json">as well as for the overall recipe book collection</a>--making it all machine readable by default.</p>

<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com">This is the 6th edition of API Strategy &amp; Practice, happening in Austin, TX next week</a>. As one of the organizers, I can say that pulling together the perfect lineup of speakers and topics is always a daunting challenge, but then at some point before the event happens, the schedule always seems to take on a life of its own.</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">The APIStrat Austin schedule</a> has reached that point again. We have enough killer speakers and companies present, it has attracted other killer speakers and companies, resulting in a mindblowing 3 days of workshops, keynotes, panels, and sessions--if you haven't taken a look <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">at the schedule lately</a>, take a few moments.</p>
<p>I was going through, looking for problems, missing photos, etc, and the scope of the people and companies present just struck me how amazing it has become, and I had to share. If you aren't registered, make sure and do so, and if there is someone you think that should be in attendance, feel free to ping me directly--you won't want to miss it.</p>
<p>See all y'all in Austin next week!</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-licensing-stack.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">I've spent a lot of time thinking through the licensing we apply to APIs, as part of my work on the Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>. The licensing around APIs is still in flux, with the current precedent being that APIs are copyrightable. Even though I do not believe this stance, I encourage API designers to make sure and apply one of the more liberal Creative Commons licenses to your API definitions, taking a pre-emptive stance in the conversation.</p>
<p>In my experience most API providers, let alone consumers and the public at large, do not understand the separation between an APIs definition, and the code that runs the API, and often even the code that consumes an API. To help us visualize the separation, as well as think through the licensing implications of each layer, <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">I have setup a specific research project that addresses API licensing</a>, in hopes of spending time regularly researching the topic, as well as telling stories that help people navigate how to license their APIs.</p>
<p>Here is how I'd break down the five most common layers of the API licensing stack, and some ideas for how you can apply licenses to these layers of API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Server Code -</strong>&nbsp;For many APIs, your server code will be your secret sauce and kept proprietary, but for those of you who wish to open source this critical layer, here are some options. To help you navigate the licensing, I recommend using&nbsp;<a href="http://choosealicense.com/">Github's Choose a License</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Apache License is a free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). The Apache License requires preservation of the copyright notice and disclaimer. Like other free software licenses, the license allows the user of the software the freedom to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software, under the terms of the license, without concern for royalties.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a></strong>&nbsp;- The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is the most widely used[6] free software license, which guarantees end users (individuals, organizations, companies) the freedoms to run, study, share (copy), and modify the software. Software that allows these rights is called free software and, if the software is copylefted, requires those rights to be retained.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a></strong>&nbsp;- The MIT License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a permissive free software license, meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data&nbsp;</strong>- Serving up data is one of the most common reasons for deploying an API, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://opendatacommons.org/">Open Data Commons</a>, provides us with some licensing options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/">Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)</a></strong> &mdash; The PDDL places the data(base) in the public domain (waiving all rights).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/">Attribution License (ODC-By)</a></strong> &mdash; You are free to share, create, and adapt, as long as you attribute the data source.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">Open Database License (ODC-ODbL)</a></strong> &mdash; You are free to share, create, and adapt, as long as you attribute the data source, share-aloe, and keep open.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Content -</strong>&nbsp;Separate from the data, APIs are being used to server up short, and long form content, where liberal&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Common</a>&nbsp;licenses should be considered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></strong>&nbsp;- This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">CC BY-SA</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to copyleft free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a></strong>&nbsp;- Use this universal tool if you are a holder of copyright or database rights, and you wish to waive all your interests in your work worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Definition -&nbsp;</strong>The part of the discussion be defined (unfortunately) by the Oracle v Google Java API copyright legal battle, and in light of the ruling, I urge you to consider one of the more liberal&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Common</a>&nbsp;licenses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></strong>&nbsp;- This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a></strong>&nbsp;- Use this universal tool if you are a holder of copyright or database rights, and you wish to waive all your interests in your work worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Client Code -</strong>&nbsp;Separate from your server side code, you should make sure all of your client side code SDKs, PDKs, and starter kits have an open source license applied-o-remember you are asking them to potentially integrate this into their business operations. Again&nbsp;I recommend using&nbsp;<a href="http://choosealicense.com/">Github's Choose a License</a>&nbsp;to help you navigate this decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Apache License is a free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). The Apache License requires preservation of the copyright notice and disclaimer.

</ul>
<p>This list does not reflect all of the licensing opportunities available to you. These reflect the licensing options that I recommend you consider, as part of your API operations. I want as many APIs to thoughtfully consider the licensing for their entire API stack, and I'm kick-starting these research to provide a short, concise guide for API providers to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I get my way, every layer of the API stack will be licensed as openly as possible, however I add some extra concern for the <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition layer</a>. I know many of my readers will argue that this is just code, and should be licensed along side your server side code, but this is not true-modern API definitions are increasingly available as JSON, YAML, Markdown, that is telling a very important story that is having a significant impact on how we do business, and live our personal lives--a story that should be able to retold and echoed across the digital landscape, without licensing restrictions.</p>
<p><a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">My API licensing research</a> is just getting going. I will be rounding it off with examples of the approach used by leading API providers, news and stories I curated from across the space, as well as more&nbsp;<a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>&nbsp;tooling that helps you define the licensing for your API, and share in a machine readable way.</p>

<p>We reached another significant milestone in the API space today, after being acquired by SmartBear this spring, the Swagger specification is being moved into a Linux Foundation grouped called the <a href="https://openapis.org/">Open API Initiative (OAI)</a>.</p>
<p>SmartBear has been working with the core group of vendors including 3Scale, Apigee, Capital One, Google, IBM, Intuit, Microsoft, PayPal, and Restlet over the summer to hammer out the details of the organization, and the charter that drives the group forward.</p>
<p>Its no secret, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/22/how-to-build-an-api-brand-through-consistent-storytelling/">I am a pretty big support of the specification</a>, and happy to see it be reborn, within the community driven group, as a community driven open spec. I&rsquo;m looking forward to continuing my development of interesting things on top of the OADF  specification, and telling stories about what the community is building as well.</p>
<p>If you have a cool tool or service that you have built on the spec, make sure and let me know, so I can share the story with my network.</p>
