{% include JB/setup %}<p>I had a great response to my Learning Management System (LMS) APIs round-up last week after Startup Weekend Seattle EDU.After posting I quickly updated with another LMS suggestion I got for Sakai.Then a couple days ago the PR director for Instructure introduced me to their LMS platform, Canvas.Canvas is a open-source LMS created by Instructure and released under the AGPLv3 license.Instructure also provides a cloud version, with all the features of the open source version of Canvas, but comes with hosting, mobile apps, services integration, and automated provisioning.</p>
