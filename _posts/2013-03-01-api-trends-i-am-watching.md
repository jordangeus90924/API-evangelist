{% include JB/setup %}<p>Photo Credit: AVnet I try to keep API Evangelist a place where API newbies and API experts can both find what they are looking for.To meet this demand I’m constantly moving the site around, trying to uncover more information, in a logical way that speaks to everyone.To change things up a little I moved a couple of the most important trends in APIs out of the trends section, and put them on the right hand menu, making them accessible from any page.There are four trends I think are important to how APIs are being used right now: Aggregation - Merging various APIs together into not just meaningful new stacks of resources, but entirely new resources, as a result of merging BaaS - The promise of Backend as a Service is to bundle together resources developers need to build mobile apps more efficiently. Some providers are rolling their own stacks, while others are using a hybrid approach with wise use of 3rd party API resources Reciprocity - The integration, interoperability, automation and transformation of data between cloud services, in a way that respects the relationshiop between user and platform, that uses APIs.</p>
