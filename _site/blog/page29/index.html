<p>title: ‘The Continuing Netflix API Story’</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-square.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>I have <a title="Netflix API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">written about the well publicized failure of the Netflix public API</a>&nbsp;before, and how in the API space things are often not what they seem. By my measurement Netflix is a massive API success story, it is just not the classsic open API success story we all really want to be true.
<p>In the end the experiment that was the Netflix API didn't pan out, but that is ok.  Netflix has found success with APIs internally, something I think will be the case with the majority of companies embarking on an API odyssey. And with Netflix continuing to tell the story of their successes and failures, everyone can learn from their hard work.
<p>As I continue to follow the Netflix API story, I'm seeing new narrative emerge, one that is equally about open source software, than about open APIs. When I do my monitoring I am constantly seeing new blog posts coming from the Netflix tech blog, announcing the latest OSS release from the Netflix tech team.
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/netflix/netflix-open-source-center.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>Netflix is up to 34 public repositories currently, and before you dig into the details of their releases, Netflix also wins in the presentation of their Github open source site. Nice job!!
<p>I wish someone would dive deeper into everything Netflix is releasing.  At first glance it looks like like everything I have been asking for when it comes to open source software for the API management space. Netflix isn't in the space of offering API management as a service, but they run one of the biggest API platforms out there--resulting in some serious skills, experience and technology.
<p>If I had more time I'd go through the Netflix Open Source Center and see how it all applies to the larger API picture. As with the rest of the Netflix story, I'm sure there are some great lessons in what they are producing.

<p>title: ‘API Evangelist, Healthcare.gov and Hacker Storytelling’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-github.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://github.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I've been slowly evolving API Evangelist from a single site, into an interconnected network of individual API projects.  API Evangelist started as a research project back in July 2010, making its shift to be a network of smaller, inter-connected research projects is fitting.
<p>While API Evangelist currently still runs on my home brew CMS, shortly it will finish the migration to completely run on Github, making it merely a "hollywood front" for what is c<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/07/01/the-expanding-api-evangelist-network/">urrently 37+ API related, living research projects</a> of mine.
<p>I call my evolving approach to projects, <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>. I made up the name, but the approach is borrowed from several other philosophies which starts with concept of data journalism, but then has also evolved from conversations last year in Washington DC from very smart folks including Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>), Gray Brooks (<a href="https://twitter.com/gbinal">@gbinal)</a>, and the very forward thinking work of the <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a> team.  Then of course I add my own style and approach to what I've learned.
<p>As I move my own network of research projects to run on Github, using this new approach, I'm also seeing other positive signs coming out of Washington on the same front.  First the <a href="https://project-open-data.github.io/">White House Open Data Policy</a> released in May was created and published on Github, but then I just finished reading <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/healthcaregov-code-developed-by-the-people-and-for-the-people-released-back-to-the-people/277295/">Healthcare.gov: Code Developed by the People and for the People, Released Back to the People</a>, by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>). His post outlines how the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)launched Healthcare.gov to support the Affordable Care Act -- AKA "Obamacare".  The website was built iteratively, in public, over the last couple months and it was completely done using Github, using a similar approach to my Hacker Storytelling.  Seeing all of this, really makes me hopeful for my next year in Washington.
<p>Alex does an amazing job of telling the story behind Healthcare.gov, I highly recommend reading his post. After reading, I wanted take a fresh walk through my approach, and talk about the importance of this new approach managing my projects, that I think will change the web, how we govern and conduct business.
<p>My personal approach is derived from a need to quickly turn research into public stories, allowing people to take my work and put it to use in their worlds. Since my mission is to educate the masses of the benefits of APIs, and reach the largest audience possible, I needed a new approach that was fast, efficient and scaled--the result is Hacker Storytelling.
<p>To manage my projects and tell my stories, I'm using a handful of building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog Posts</li>
<li>Static Pages </li>
<li>Widgets</li>
<li>Open Data</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part about these building blocks is that they only use, lightweight, open protocols:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>JSON</li>
</ul>
<p>Each project becomes an open source repository, that I host at Github. Some projects start as private repositories, but if possible <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EVERYTHING</strong></span> becomes public.  If you are unfamiliar with how Github and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> works, Github is a cloud service that provides version control for code. However since code is usually just files, you can apply the same open source code process to web site or documents you can build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.
<p>I don't know about you. But I can build some pretty fast websites, prototype applications and even full blown production apps in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.  If you want to see the extreme version of what I'm doing, head over to <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a> and see what they are up to.  They are producing some mind blowing projects, using this approach
<p>The really powerful thing about all of this, is this can run anywhere. You can run the <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2011/08/Jekyll-amazon-s3.html">same configuration of site on Amazon S3</a>, Dropbox, or anywhere you can setup hosting. This isn't just something for alpha geeks, look closer at the Amazon S3 example, that is the CTO of Amazon running his blog using this approach.
<p><strong><em>So why am I doing this?</em></strong> There are so many reason, and to help me wrap my head further around them, I thought I would take a crack at listing as many as I could.
<p><strong>Decoupling</strong> <br />This approach to my research and storytelling has allowed me to decouple the individuals pieces of my original API Evangelist work, which after three years has become very bloated.  I have a lot of content and structured data about the API industry. This has allowed me to decouple one very big project into 35 smaller projects, with the potential for many more in the future.
<p><strong>Planning</strong> <br />When I kick off a new project, I start off the planning process with a new Github repository, with a fresh README file.  Then using the native Github features I can make the project public or private and invite other people to join me in the planning process.  The README quickly becomes an outline, giving a backbone to my project.
<p><strong>Research</strong> <br />Once a project has been kicked off, I kick of researching and publishing all notes, bookmarks and other relevant assets to Github after each session.  Pretty soon there is a wealth of knowledge located within the repository, with every step of the way versioned, allowing me to manage additions, removals and potential conflicts.
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> <br />Github has made the process of developing open source software, a social adventure.  You can create repositories within individual Github accounts or underneath the umbrella of an organization.  You can invite any other Github user to participate in the process, using open source software process, built into Github. Once you make public, you can also add <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and solicit public comments, if if so desired.
<p><strong>Versioned</strong> <br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> is the central core of Github. Git was developed by Linus Torvalds to help him manage the developed of the open source operating system, Linux. Every document that is submitted to a Git(hub) repository, is versioned, allowing you to manage changes, accept contributions and even roll back to earlier versions when necessary. Git is well suited to open source, collaborative software development, but also works well for many other types of projects as well.
<p><strong>Storytelling</strong> <br />My approach, that of <a href="http://Healthcare.gov">Healthcare.gov</a>, and Development Seed all uses <a href="/admin/blog/design.apievangelist.com">Jekyll</a> alongside each project deployment.  Jekyll is a simple, blog aware static site framework that runs very well on Github. Jekyll gives you a very simple, but powerful way to manage your pages as well as maintain a blog.  This has changed my view of what a blog is for, making it as simple as four chronological journal entries for a single project or powering the 800+ blog entries of API Evangelist.  Jekyll was actually developed by Tom Preston-Warner, the founder of Github, but the framework is so univeral it can run anywhere such as Amazon S3 and Dropbox.
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> <br />While this approach is not for everyone. I enjoy making projects open by default from birth to death. Hosting on Github, allowing it to be licensed openly and allowing collaboration and public input makes for a healthier overall project.  Transparency can let the sunlight into any process, providing a sort of disinfectant to the overall process. Something I feel is essential in all my work.
<p><strong>Living Projects </strong><br />Most of the projects I embark on will be living, allowing me to keep updated weekly, monthly or as often as necessary.  Because I can open up projects to collaborators and public feedback, it opens up my work to even live beyond the attention I can give the project.  I can even transfer ownership and administration of a project to someone else, or they can fork my work and take in an entirely new direction, breathing life into my work I could never imagine.
<p><strong>Portable</strong> <br />Each Github repository can be forked or downloaded as a zip file.  Allowing the entire project to be moved, unpacked and setup at a new location--not in hours but often in minutes. This type of portability is essential in this crazy, cloud based world we've created for ourselves.  It also allows me to easily deploy a project within the firewall of a company or government agency.
<p><strong>Syndication</strong> <br />Github possesses one of the most powerful syndication tools, which is called "forking". Any Github user can fork one of my projects and set to work making it their own. Adding to it, cleaning it up and when appropriate make "pull requests" back to the original project, which allows me potentially to accept their work back into the central copy. After I add common social sharing tools, and you consider the native social features built into Github, this approach offers unlimited potential for syndication.
<p><strong>Analytics</strong> <br />Each project I fire up, gets Google Analytics added. Allowing me to track all traffic and usage of my projects. Beyond the page views, visits and other common metrics, Github gives me a whole other layer of metrics for tracking how many favorites, forks, downloads, commits and other vital data about how projects are doing.
<p><strong>Common Formats </strong><br />Every project I build uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON. All of these common formats can be opened by simple text editors and do not require any proprietary software to create, access or edit. HTML and CSS is very accessible to many, and depending on how tech savvy you are, JavaScript and JSON are pretty easy to wield, with a little training.
<p><strong>Open By Default </strong><br />Everything is open by default. Publicly available, collaboration, open formats and open licenses go a long way in setting the right tone for a project. Open by default takes away a lot of stress for me, and opens projects up for the widest possible collaboration, re-use, distribution and ultimately attribution to me and my work.
<p><strong>Machine Readable By Default </strong><br />All data is stored via simple, lightweight JSON files. Every listing, chart, graph within a project has a JSON data source. The entire contents of a project can have a simple JSON manifest, allowing programmatic indexing of a project's content and data sources.  Machine readable by default, using JSON has changed the way I look at data management.
<p><strong>Scalable</strong> <br />I do not have to scale the infrastructure for any my projects. I've run IT infrastructure for years and very capable in doing this for myself, but I don't have time. All projects automatically are scaled as needed, to meet, not just my projects demands, but everyone on the platform. For me, the backend has been reduced to my internal systems and a handful of APIs. Everything that is public is automatically scaled in the clouds.
<p><strong>Speed</strong> <br />The usage of simple, light-weight open formats like HTML, CSS, JavaSCript and JSON. Plus all the benefits of the Github platform. Equal a pretty sweet opportunity for fast loading web pages. Everything is easily cached, providing for very fast page loads in addition to scalability. If projects are hosted on Amazon S3, there are additional opportunities for caching and distribution of content to regions around the globe using CloudFront.
<p><strong>Security</strong> <br />Along with the need to run back-end infrastructure, much of the concern with securing sites and applications goes away. I'm pretty confident that Github, Amazon and Dropbox have fairly decent security teams and with all projects being static sites and apps, using open formats, much of the opportunity for exploitation has been removed.
<p><strong>Low Cost </strong><br />Github repositories are free, if they are public. Another incentive for being open by default. Even if you pay for repositories with Github, the costs are dollars each month. Amazon and Dropbox are both extremely affordable, further evolving past models for web hosting or rolling out costly infrastructure for projects. The cloud has enabled entirely new approaches deploying web sites, applications, as well as content and data oriented projects.
<p><strong>Lifecycle</strong> <br />The entire life cycle of my projects has changed for the positive. I can start new projects, on a whim. Fire up new repository and generate an outline during planning stages, invite all participants and have a public site up in minutes. Some projects I work on for hours each week, others I give just minutes a month to make sure they have my latest research published. I can easily walk away from projects, passing the torch and potentially keeping a project alive.  Projects can be forked, downloaded and evolved, adding layers to the lifecycle that are totally out of my control. The potential for my research and stories to reach a larger audience has grown significantly, extending both the reach and the life of my work.
<p><strong>Web Literacy </strong><br />When this approach is employed, each individual involved receives a healthy dose of web literacy. Introducing them to essential building blocks of our growing digital world, like DNS, HTML, CSS, JSON, Git and more.  The portability of this approach allows you to truly own your projects, enabling you to deploy them wherever you choose. Web literacy is critical in this day and age, for everyone.
<p><strong>Empowering</strong>&nbsp;<br />For me, Hacker Storytelling has empowered me to do more research, tell more stories and reach a wider audience. I've only been doing it for six months. At first, all of this can seem daunting to learn, but once you get a grasp of all the building blocks at play, it can be very empowering.  It is something non-developers can employ to solve the problems they face everyday, in a way that encourages collaboration and even programmatic integration with other systems or projects.  It has the potential to empower each of us to innovate and work together in new ways.
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />Hacker Storytelling is my version of this new way to build sites and apps. Development Seed and the HHS are developing their own approach as well. While there are lot of common building blocks, each individual or organization can develop their own style and set of tools and building blocks that work best for them.
<p>That is 21 reasons I'm moving my projects to this new approach to publishing sites and applications on the Internet.  I'm choosing to do this because it makes me more efficient at my research and storytelling, which is essential to my career.
<p>I'm hoping to share my approach with as many people as I can.  I'm watching my girlfriend Audrey discover how easy it is to setup new projects, and publish her work there. Setting everything I listed above into motion for her world, developer her own approach.
<p>I don't think this methodology is for everyone, but if you are interested I'm happy to share.  I will be adding more widgets and tools to my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storyteling</a> project.  While also point you to other similar implementations like <a href="http://HealthCare.gov">HealthCare.gov</a>, and people who are innovating with this approach like <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>.

<p>I've been organizing much of my research around APIs into groupings that I call "stacks".  The term allows me to loosely bundle common API resources into meaningful "stacks" for my readers to learn about.
<p>I'm adding a new project to my list of 30+ stacks, that is intended to bring together the most commonly used API resources, into a single, meaningful stack of resources any web or mobile developer can quickly put to use.

<p>This is just a start.  I will publish a full stack, complete with logos, descriptions and links.  For now I'm just flushing out my thoughts regarding what are some of the top resources that are currently available for developers.
<p>I will be making another pass over the APIs I track on in the coming weeks, as well as add to the list each week as part of my monitoring.
<p>If you see anything missing, that should be in there...let me know!

<p>As the API universe expands, I'm trying my best to stay in tune with where its going and try to help people understand the space, whether you are a newbie or API veteran--I want you to find what you are looking for at API Evangelist.
<p>To support the fast moving space, as well as my ADHD working style, I've broken up API Evangelist into individual projects. Each project runs using my <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, which in short means each projects lives as a Githb repository, allowing me to publish the research, data, short form and long form content to an open source repository that anyone can browse, fork and download.
<p>To help you (and me) see the entire API Evangelist network, i wanted to publish an outline of all 37 projects I'm curently working on:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>* Projects that are still in progress of being setup</em></strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">My goal with this new format that I've rolled out over the last six months, is to give me specific project areas to do research within, each week. Some projects will get love an attention, while others will simmer in the background--moving everything forward in small chunks.
<p style="text-align: left;">All of these projects are accessible via landing pages on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, which I will be keeping as the main portal for the business of APIs. &nbsp;You can also find my work on the politics of APIs at <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a>, and you can keep up with my weekly monitoring via <a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a>, which is the seed for all of these projects.
<p style="text-align: left;">Each project is meant to produce the following output:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog Posts</strong> - Stories and analysis from each area of the API space</li>
<li><strong>Research Data</strong> - Lists of companies, individuals, APIs, tools and building blocks</li>
<li><strong>Research Links</strong> - Curated links to important work by others in the space</li>
<li><strong>Presentation / Talks</strong> - Presentations and talks I've given around the world</li>
<li><strong>White Papers</strong> - Long form, summary white papers providing overview of individual projects</li>
<li><strong>Blue Prints </strong>- Specific blue prints of how to execute specific campaigns within the API space</li>
</ul>
<p>The research for some of these projects is funded by my partner network, while much of it is done on my own steam. If you are interested in making sure specific projects happen, please <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d1b8bfb7be91b0a1b8b4a7b0bfb6b4bdb8a2a5ffb2bebc">feel free to reach out and get involved</a>.
<p>I will be adding projects in the future, and you may see some of the existing projects stagnate from time to time, when I run out of time, or it might be possible the space is not producing new work. Based upon page views, funding, time and other variables projects will rise to the top.
<p>Thanks to everyone who supports what I'm doing, its been an amazing 3 years so far. I look forward to the next 3 years.

<p>title: ‘Trends in API Aggregation’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aggregation-trend.png</p>

<hr />

<p>One trend in API usage I'm closely watching is the <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation of APIs by a new wave of startups</a>. As the world adopts more cloud services, the need to aggregate content across multiple APIs is growing.
<p>I'm currently tracking on <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">15 API aggregators</a>, who focus on bringing together data and content in 10 areas:
<p><a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/trends/aggregation-trend.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Cloud Storage</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Government</li>
<li>Invoicing</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Social</li>
</ul>
<p>The companies I'm watching on may provide other services, such as integration or automation between cloud services.  However I focus on the aggregation of content and data, and the creation of new, aggregated APIs across multiple services.
<p>Some comapnies also provide entirely new APIs with data, features and functionality that can only be uncovered by aggregating across multiple services.
<p>In 2013 we will continue seeing API aggregation providers emerge, providing a new layer on top of the most popular API services that we are quickly growing dependent on.

<hr />

<p><a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/webscript/webscript-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p>While <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/23/a-great-time-at-api-days-san-francisco/">I was at API Days this weekend in San Francisco</a>, I managed to catch a handful of talks Saturday afternoon after I landed at OAK. While listening to each talk, I kept hearing one technical API building block, over and over--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">webhook</a>.
<p>Webhooks are a common way for API providers to make API integration a two ways street for consumer. Developers, or even non-developers, can setup webhooks via common API platforms, and receive notifications about different events and activities that occur.
<p>Webhooks are also a common tool for <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API automation and reciprocity platforms</a> like <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=38">Zapier</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=39">IFTTT</a>.  Users can setup webhooks, that respond to just about any action across multiple, API driven platforms.
<p><a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/webscript/webscripts-io-webhook-script-example.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>After hearing webhooks mentioned so often, I wondered if anyone out there is offering web hook as a service (WHaaS) (LOL).  Sure enough, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) pointed me to <a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank">webscript.io</a>.
<p>Webscripts are short scripts, written in Lua, that run in the cloud servers, and can respond to any HTTP requests.
<p>Exactly what I was looking for. I had heard of webscript.io before, but for some reason it didn't stick in my mind.  It is precisely the simple approach I was looking for, and has many common examples like sending emails, counters, parsing RSS and Tweeting.
<p>I really like dead simple implementations like <a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank">webscript.io</a>, that solve real world problems in such granular, yet powerful ways.  Nice work <a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>.

<p>I had several important things happen over the last week. One of them was sharing the stage for the first time with my partner in crime, Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>).
<p>Although I spent most of the week in Washington DC, Tuesday night I flew out to Park City, UT and shared the stage Wednesday morning for a keynote with Audrey at <a title="InstructureCon" href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a>, put on by the LMS platform <a title="LMS by Instructure" href="http://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a>.
<p>Audrey and I delivered a talk on education, the LMS and data portability.  Audrey opened up and closed out the talk, you can read <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/06/19/the-lms-as-portal-instructurecon/">her perspective on Hack Education</a>, but I wanted to make sure and provide the overview of my section, as described by Audrey as&nbsp;<em>[Kin spoke here about the history of APIs and what APIs do.]</em>
<p>To help understand how mainstream Internet technology has influenced the LMS and education portal history Audrey has laid out, I wanted to bring the history of the web API to the table, helping people understand what APIs do:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs allow computers to talk to each other, and applications to inter-operate </li>
<li>Websites deliver HTML for humans to read, and APIs deliver JSON for other applications to use</li>
</ul>
<p>The earliest approaches to APIs on the Internet, can be seen from providers starting in 2000, as <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Roy Fielding publishes his dissertation on REST</a>.
<p>The early API pioneers were looking to enable commerce around their products, sales efforts and auctions using early web enabled APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Salesforce API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">2000 - Salesforce</a></strong> - The CRM and sales management provider Salesforce was the first pioneer to begin using web APIs to start developing an ecosystem of integration providers, planting the seeds of what we'd later call Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Ebay API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">2000 - Ebay</a></strong> - Ebay identified early on, the role web APIs could play in expanding its auction marketplace, allowing business and individual to manage their online auctions via a programmatic interface</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Amazon E-Commerce API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">2002 - Amazon</a></strong> - Early on the fast growing bookseller identified the potential of APIs in expanding its ecosystem of e-commerce storefronts, delivering on the commerce vision of early API pioneers</li>
</ul>
<p>After this wave of commerce APIs, a new approach to interacting, collaborating and building relationships on the web emerged, introducing a new flavor of API driven platforms:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Flickr API" href="/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">2004 - Flickr</a> </strong>- The founders of Flickr identified APIs a potential new approach to handling business development. Allowing partners a self-service way to integrate with the photo sharing platforms, allowing Flickr to use the API as a filter to help establish which companies they should partner with</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Delicious API" href="/2013/06/09/history-of-apis-del-icio-us/">2004 - Delicious</a></strong> - The social bookmarking platform Delicious introduced the world to a simpler way to bookmark documents on the web, social sharing, tagging, a new way to organize your online world.  Delicious was the the first to introduce an approach to APIs that used HTTP to deliver XML responses alongside common HTML pages</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Facebook API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/">2006 - Facebook</a></strong> - Following the lead of social API pioneers like Flickr and Delicious, Facebook deployed its developer platform, providing programmatic access to the social network, setting off a wave of social application development across sectors from events to online gaming</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/">2006 - Twitter</a></strong> - The social API evolution continued with the launch of an API by fast growing micro-blogging platform Twitter.  The social microblogging network relied on its API and developer community to deliver every aspect of the platform from mobile applications to analytics, as well as embeddable buttons and widgets</li>
</ul>
<p>As the social API phase continue to evolve with the introduction of platforms from Facebook and Twitter, an earlier API pioneer Amazon <a href="/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">put APIs to use in a way that would change the way would develop software forever</a>.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis-amazon-s3/">2006 - Amazon Web Services</a></strong> - After Amazon found success with its e-commerce APIs, the company adopted APIs internally, an approach that would eventually evolve into a new type of API driven service we now know as cloud computing.  AWS started with basic  resources like storage and compute, but would rapidly to evolve and deliver a suite of API resources for companies to use in building all types of applications</li>
</ul>
<p>There was one more ingredient necessary, before APIs would open up web portals that were established in the early days of the world wide web. A new type of phone was being developed, one that was smarter than earlier feature phones.  The new generation of smart phones, led by Apple and its iPhone would legitimize APIs as the preferred channel for delivering the distributed resources that developers of web and mobile apps would need.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Foursquare APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-foursquare-api/">2009 - Foursquare</a></strong> - The location-based social networking website for mobile devices emerged on the landscape providing developers with a set of APIs that they would need to build the localized apps for smart phones.  Foursquare has made applications locally aware, and allowing mobile users to discover and checking to the local world around them</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Instagram API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-instagram-api/">2011 - Instagram</a></strong> - After a rogue API was deployed on top of the fast growing photo platform, Instagram responded with an official API launch, providing read and write access to the rich media content, which soon would attract the attention of earlier social API pioneer, Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p>While APIs provided essential ingredients for web and mobile applications development like commerce, social and cloud it is also providing some other essential elements that deliver value to end-users.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">Integration</a></strong> - APIs allow for integration between the multiple platforms and services we have adopted as part of our online, digital worlds.  Integration in an online world is critical aspect of user adoption and the future growth of any online platform</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a></strong> - Beyond integration, APIs allow for reciprocity, not just delivering bits and bytes between platforms and services, it protects the interests of the companies behind these systems as well as acting on behalf of the end-users of applications built on top of these API driven systems</li>
<li><strong><a title="Real-Time APIs" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">Real-Time</a></strong> - Web and mobile phones have connected us, and users now desire more and more of our information, data and relationships in real-time.  APIs provide the ability to be the real-time channel developers need allowing self-service, instant access to resources, but also open up a two street that pushes information back to web and mobile applications via API technologies like Web Hooks and Websockets</li>
</ul>
<p>As this new approach to developing platforms has evovled, one that challenges earlier portals and platforms like AOL, other patterns emerge that are identified as successful ingredients of all next generation platforms.  These are elements that aren't necessarily technical, but are critical components that allow often very technical resources to be accessed and used in a safe and secure way.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Visibility</strong> - APIs provide partners, developers and end-users who are key stakeholders in a platform or portal the visibility they need to be educated and informed, providing a healthy base for any online community</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - APIs let the sunlight in to companies, organizations, government agencies or even individuals who expose their resources via the web. Embracing transparency is an essential aspect of any successful API strategy</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - As with any website, security is an important part of planning, deploying and managing API resources.  Security is primary concern for any API effort and its community</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong> - Silently the terms of use for each API driven platform or service is defining interactions, relationships and the health of anything we do on the web and in the cloud.  Terms of use are definitely one of the single most important aspects of portals and online services, providing a single point of failure or exploitation of users, as well as potentially providing a wealth of opportunities for some thoughtful platforms and developers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Privacy of any platform and service is defined via the availability of an API. Opening up access to a companies, platform or services resources via an API must consider privacy of its users.  Privacy is not an after thought in education, it mandatory</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs will provide the essential access, transparency and data portability that will be necessary for the platforms and services we are depending on across the education space. Every company listed above has affected how the world works, and provide blueprints for platforms and services that are targeting just about any business sector, including education.
<p>APIs are necessary to enable 3-legged conversations in the education space, elminating the education walled garden.

<p>The news is finally out.  I will be <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/24/new-round-innovators-joins-us-government-tackle-big-challenges">heading to Washington DC to spend a year as a White House Innovation Fellow</a>. APIs, open data and our government has been a passion of mine for my whole career, something that has escalated over the last year with my work on the White House Digital Strategy and Open Data Policy.
<p>Now my passion for APIs+Government is being taken to a whole new level, and &nbsp;I will be heading to Washington DC, to<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/round-2-fellows"> join 41 very talented individuals from the private sector</a>, to tackle some of the biggest challenges in our federal government.  I will be enjoying the full backing of the White House, to employ APIs to help stimulate innovation within government.
<p>I will be specifically working on the Veterans Affiars
<p>(VA) modernization team with two other very talented individuals, Mollie Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>) and Ben Willman (<a href="https://twitter.com/benwillman">@benwillman</a>).  We will be working on various projects, with the overall goal of streamlining the VA claims process.
<p>When I received the call from the VA, asking me to come to Washington and help, I could not say no.  I'm pretty mission driven, when it comes to APIs, but helping out veterans and using APIs is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ultimate</span> mission for me.
<p>I have not one, but two dads who were Vietnam Veterans.  Both are passed on now, but I have personal experience seeing the VA process in operation.  I couldn't think of a more important mission for me to embark on, but to help streamline this process.
<p>I will be keeping API Evangelist alive during my time in DC, but will not be taking on any new speaking engagements or projects. I will be dedicating myself 100% to my work at the VA.  However I would do the agency a disservice if I did not maintain my awareness of the overall API space.
<p>Thank you to everyone who assisted in making this possible, and I look forward to this next step in my career.

<p>I went to <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days SF</a> yesterday. Unfortunately, due to an unexpected obligation on the other coast I was unable to make it in time for the Friday kick-off.  But after my plane landed at OAK yesterday I headed over to enjoy the last few talks, participate in a panel and network with everyone in attendance.
<p>I really like the API Days format.  I've done all 3 of the events now including Paris, Madrid and now San Francisco.  Each event is an intimate mix of API experts, craftspeople and the API curious.
<p>You can easily rub elbows with everyone and learn from everyone there.  All speakers are accessible, and the spaces are always small enough that you have some amazing conversations, while enjoying good food and drink.
<p><a href="http://sf.apidays.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-days-san-francisco/api-design-at-api-days-san-francisco.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'd love to see more API Days pop up around the world, I really think it is a great format for introducing APIs into new region and spread the API best practices, knowledge and wisdom we often take for granted here in Silicon Valley.
<p>The <a href="http://apidays.io/2013/06/09/fork-my-conference-it-aint-a-franchise-its-open-source/">API Days event model is an open source approach to throwing API events</a>, so if you think you'd like to throw your own API Days gathering in your city, you can!  The community is extremely supportive and we will do what we can to help make sure you are successful, you just have to provide the local ingredients.
<p>I know there is another, original API Days Paris planned for the end of the year, but I'd love to see the format spread to other locations around the globe.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-2015.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>APIs are quickly moving into the mainstream.  In 2012, companies, organizations and government agencies all took notice of the need for deploying and consuming APIs.  In 2013 there is still a lot of evangelism to be done, to make people aware of what an APIs is, and why their company should have one, but I think we are approaching the phase where APIs will be the default for any company.
<p>If you frequent the tech conferences like I do, you've heard folks like John Musser say that in 1995 we were asking, "Do we need a website?", and by 2000 website was becoming the default. Fastforward to 2010, and we were asking, "Do we need an API?", and I believe by 2015 APIs will be default for companies, just like websites in 2000.
<p>APIs are built on HTTP just like our websites. They are not just a new technology trend. Your website is a critical part of your company, telling the world about your company, and the products and services you provide.  If you are a company without a website in this century, you probably are pretty irrelevant in your industry.
<p>By 2015 if your company's products and services are not available in both HTML and JSON on the web, you will not be accessible via web and mobile applications, including voice enabled platforms such as Siri. Resulting in pretty much the same irrelevance as not having a website.
<p>I'm not saying there isn't a lot of work to be done, in educated folks about what APIs are, and why they are important.  But as I leave Washington DC this week, and I'm seeing our federal government solidly on track to institutionalize APIs and open data into their culture and operations. Government is known for always being several years behind the mainstream when it comes to technology.  So if your company is behind the government on APIs, you are seriously behind and may not be able to catch up to your competition.

<p>I went to Spain at the beginning of the month to <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/04/apidays-mediterranea-is-a-wrap/">speak at API Days</a>.  While there I had the pleasure of connecting with the team from <a href="http://www.apicultur.com/en/">Apicultur</a>.  If you are not familiar with Apicultur, they are a platform for linguistic APIs, providing resources ranging from word frequency, synonyms and sentiment analysis to word games.
<p>Apicultur is relevant because language APIs <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WILL</strong></span> be central to evolution of not just mobile, but also the Internet of Things. Also, Apicultur isn't just trying to build the best linguistics API in the world, they are working to assemble a <a href="https://store.apicultur.com/">marketplace of the worlds linguistic API resources</a>.
<p>The value of the API resources Apicultur is developing attracted me to them, but then I learned more about their overall business model, and was really hooked.  They want you to hang your valuable linguistics API in their marketplace, side by side with the ones they develop.  They truly want to build the most valuable marketplace of API driven, language resources from around the world.
<p>The Apicultur team is in San Francisco this weekend for <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days</a>, if you are a complimentary API I recommend you connecting with them. Also if you have a business that could use the resources they offer, I also recommend reaching out.  You can ping them @apicultur or feel free to contact me, and I'll hook you up. Or maybe just head down to API Days at Parisoma.
<p>What Apicultur is doing, reflects the next iteration of APIs from an all the APIs directory like ProgrammableWeb, to niche marketplaces of valuable resources developers will be needing to build the next generation of applications.

<p>Understanding our history is critical to understanding where we are going. &nbsp;I have been studying the <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/history/">history of web APIs</a> for the last three years. Even though I have been through the API strategies of pioneers like Salesforce and Amazon several times, each time I go back through, I learn more. &nbsp;
<p>In May I went back through the history of APIs and added several stories that I feel are key to introducing people to the API space, as well as helping developers and people who already work with APIs, about why this has all worked.
<p>I break the history of APIs into 5 phases:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Commerce</li>
<li>Social</li>
<li>Business &amp; Marketing</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p>We are standing solidly within the mobile phase of APIs, looking forward at the next phase which is about the Internet of Things. The History of APIs is part of my API 101 series, which I publish to help introduce people to the world of APIs and prepare them for them for the API economy that will surround them.
<p>You can <a href="https://bit.ly/19dMjBe" target="_blank">download an updated copy of the History of APIs</a> via this blog post, and I will be adding an entirely new white paper section in the near future. &nbsp;
<p>Make sure and share the History of APIs with your friends and anyone you think would benefit learning about the space.

<p>I'm doing a keynote this weekend with the infamous, edtech rabble-rouser Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a> in Park City Utah, this Wednesday June 19th.
<p>Audrey and I will be talking about the importance of data portability when it comes to education technology.  <a href="http://www.instructure.com/?utm_expid=41647821-3&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">Instructure</a>, the creators of Canvas, a next generation learning management system (LMS), has been so kind to bring us both out.
<p>While Audrey and I spend a lot of time speaking at conferences, this is our first event where we will be both sharing the stage.  If you are unaware, Audrey and her&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>&nbsp;blog isn't just a partner in crime with <a>API Evangelist when it comes to data portability</a>, she has also played the role of my girlfriend for almost four years.
<p>We are both super passionate about open data, open source, data portability, terms of use and privacy policies that protect and empower users. &nbsp;Because when it comes to education, those "users" are our kids, brothers, sisters, family and friends. Education is not just another Silicon Valley opportunity, it is way too important.
<p>I'm stoked to be sharing the stage with Audrey in Park City, UT this Wednesday at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a>.  And thank you to the Instructure team for believing in us and bringing us out to cause trouble in Utah.

<p>Coming on the heels of <a href="/2013/06/04/apidays-mediterranea-is-a-wrap/">API Days Mediterranea in Madrid Spain</a>, is the next event in the series, <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days San Francisco</a>.  We kicked off the API Days event series in Paris, at the end of last year, and now after the momentum in Spain, API Days has picked up enough speed to hop the ocean and land in the heart of technology.
<p>The lineup is pretty rock'n, with talks from <a href="https://runscope.com">Runscope</a>, <a href="http://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a>, <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 Technologies</a>, <a href="https://netflix.com">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://intel.com">Intel</a>, <a href="https://apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com/">DotCloud</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a>, <a href="http://mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, <a href="http://apispark.com">APISpark</a>, <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, <a href="http://soa.com">SOA Software</a>, <a href="https://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>, <a href="http://fitbit.com">Fitbit</a>, <a href="http://sap.com">SAP</a>, <a href="https://mulesoft.com">Mulesoft</a>, <a href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphay</a>, <a href="http://webshell.io">Webshell</a>, <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>, <a href="http://helloreverb.com/">Reverb</a> and <a href="http://angelhack.com/">AngelHack</a>.
<p>The theme for API Days San Francisco is the API Economy, so it makes sense there are even VC's talking from <a href="http://www.trueventures.com/">True Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.bvp.com/">Bessemer Venture Partners</a> and even Alex William from <a href="http://techcrunch.com">Techcrunch</a> will be there.
<p>The headliner is ex-Calvin Klein underwear model, media junkie, stimulator of tech influencers and master of spin Mike Maney (<a href="https://twitter.com/the_spinmd">@the_spinmd</a>) of <a href="http://maneydigital.com/">Maney Digital</a>.  You can count on the event being a good time with the Spin MD, Mike Maney around.
<p>API Days San Francisco is shaping up to be a pretty kick ass event.  I'd make sure you are there.  It is downtown SF, this weekend 6/21 and 6/22 at <a href="http://www.parisoma.com/">Parisoma</a>.
<p>I'll be there and look forward to seeing you there!

<p>In 2007, a new API-as-a-product platform launched, called <a href="https://twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a>, which introduced a voice API allowing developers to make and receive phone calls via any cloud application.  Over the last 3 years Twilio has additionally released a text messaging and SMS short code API, making itself a critical telephony resource in many developers toolbox.
<p>Twilio is held up as a model platform to follow when evangelizing to developers.  Twilio has helped define which technical and business building blocks are essential for a healthy API driven platform, set the bar for on the ground evangelism at events and hackathons, and worked hard to showcase, support and invest it its developer ecosystem.

While Twitter has sometime been held up as a cautionary tale when it comes to APIs,&nbsp; Twilio has demonstrated, that when done right, API driven ecosystems do work.
<p>By 2011 the bar for delivering APIs, via HTTP, has been well established by early pioneers like <a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">SalesForce</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, but Twilio has shown how mature the business of APIs has become with its evolution into the mobile period.&nbsp; However, mobile development via APIs, owes its roots to the foundation laid by the <a title="commerce, social and cloud API pioneers" href="/history/">commerce, social and cloud API pioneers</a>.

<h2>From Deployment to Management</h2>
<p>I have broken out API design and deployment into individual areas, separate from API management. However they are all intertwined and overlap is inevitable, but it is important to understand the overview of API deployment, from framework to gateway and where it fits in with API design and management.
<p>API deployment was born out of SOA and the enterprise, and the API gateways have the longest history in API deployment. But over the last 10 years a wealth of frameworks and scrappier approaches to deploy APIs build on HTTP has evolved considerably. &nbsp;
<p>After 10 years of evolving API frameworks, and RESTful approaches a new breed of API providers have emerged to provide the next generation of API deployments that will drive mobile apps and the Internet of Things. All of this is making API deployment something anyone can do.
<p>API Evangelist is about educating the masses about the potential of APIs, and understanding API deployment is something that any savvy business person should have a grasp of, even if you won't be getting your hands dirty with the actual execution.
<p>Maybe you have a wealth of data locked up in databases that you need to make available for mobile or tablet apps, and you just don't have the internal resources to design, develop and deploy you APIs. Five years ago, APIs were definitely a purely technical initiative, born out of IT. In 2014 anyone with a little tech curiosity can understand what is possible, and begin to put a plan in place and achieve deployment.
<p>Now you should have a 100K foot view of the world of API deployment, and should now look to understand what is involved with managing an API in the wild.

<p>In the early days, APIs were just about deployment and consumption--you were doing one or the other.&nbsp; Then from 2006 to 2012 API management was introduced from providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/10/history-of-apis-mashery/">Mashery</a>, then <a title="3Scale" href="http://3Scale.net">3Scale</a> and most recently <a title="Apiphany" href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphany</a>. In 2013 the API universe is expanding at a ever increasing pace, and the concept of API design is expanding, with new approaches, tools and even companies stepping up to provide services.
<p>I'm deciding to frame my API design research as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the resulting definition of your API, that will eventually become the&nbsp; API you will use in production, which also might drive your documentation and generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate their apps.
<p>Depending on our needs, API design may begin with learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition so you can generate interactive API documentation.
<p>Ultimately your API design will be the definition of each endpoint, its methods, fields and much more. In a technical sense it is a JSON or XML blueprint that describes your API, and in a creative sense, API design is an art form and can possess a technical beauty, one that will also speak to the value an API delivers to end-users.
<p>Thoughtful API design early on can save you a lot of mistakes down the road. In support of this, and as I do with al of my API research projects, I started a Github repository at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design.apievangelist.com</a></strong></span>. This project is not meant to endorse any particular approach or methodology, but provide a single resource where you can find the best information on API design.&nbsp;
<p>For those of you who like to share via email and PDFs, I also published the <a href="https://bit.ly/151yBNn">API Providers Guide to API Design as a PDF</a>, which you can download and share as you wish. &nbsp;
<p>This API design project will be an open source repository containing the building blocks of API design, tools for assisting you in your API design, and companies that provide services in the area of API design.
<p>This is a living project, that will be updated weekly. If you know of missing building blocks, or tools and services that should be included, or think I'm complete wacko, send your emails to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31585f575e715041585447505f56545d5842451f525e5c"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e58c8b838aa584958c8093848b8280898c9691cb868a88">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or tweet at me.

<h2>Overview of The API Design Space</h2>
<p><span>In the early days of APIs, everything was just about deploying and consuming&mdash;you were doing one or the other.&nbsp; Then by 2006 we saw the stabilization of common API management practices emerge from providers like Mashery, and then 3Scale. Now in 2014 we are stabilizing again, and the API universe is expanding around the area of API design, with new approaches, tools and entire companies emerging to provide services that are dedicated to helping companies design the best APIs they can.</span>
<p><span>I define the world of API design as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the definition of your API that will eventually be deployed as your production endpoints, drive your documentation, generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate, test, monitor, and allow your API to be found--through this lens, API design is fast becoming the driver for all areas of the API lifecycle.</span>
<p><span>Depending on our needs, API design may begin with understanding HTTP, and REST, or may learning more about applying hypermedia as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition, so you can generate interactive API documentation. I won&rsquo;t be going into the finer points of REST, Hypermedia or even Swagger definitions. My goal is to provide a 100K view of space, and highlight the various tools, services, and API design methodologies available today.</span>
<p><span>Ultimately your API design will be the definition of each endpoint, its methods, fields and much more. In a technical sense it is a JSON, YAML or markdown blueprint that describes your API, and in a creative sense, API design is an art that can possess a strange technical beauty, and speak to the value an API delivers to end-users. API design is far more than just how you structure URIs, or parameters, it is fast becoming a discipline, with a suite of services and tools to support a growing wave of API design professionals.</span>
<p><span>Thoughtful API design early on can save you a lot of mistakes down the road. This project is not meant to endorse any particular approach or methodology, but provide a single resource where you can find the best information on API design, and go there to find what you need. It can be difficult to stay up with the latest tools, and approaches, and API Evangelist looks to fill this gap.</span>
<p><span>This API design project will live as an open source repository, and resulting white paper containing the building blocks of API design, tools that assist you in your API design, and companies that provide services in the area of API design.&nbsp;</span>

<p>In November 2006, API the first API service provider Mashery came out of "stealth mode" to offer documentation support, community management and access control for companies wishing to offer public or private APIs--from blog post in TechCrunch titled&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/11/06/mashery-api-management-service-is-open-for-business/">API Management Service is Open for Business</a>.
<p>At this point in time, in 2006, we were moving from the social period of APIs into the cloud computing phase with the introduction of Amazon Web Services. It was clear that the world of web APIs was getting real, and there was opportunity for companies to offer API management as a service.

<p>While there were tools for deploying APIs, there was no standard approach to managing your API deployment. Mashery was the first to bring a standard set of services to API providers, that would help set the stage for the future growth of the API industry.
<p>It would take almost six more years before the API industry would come of age. The space we all know today was defined by early API commerce pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">SalesForce</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, social pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Flickr" href="/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/2013/06/09/history-of-apis-del-icio-us/">Delicous</a>, and from Mashery who helped define what is now known as the business of APIs.
<p>In 2013, Mashery was acquired by Intel, helping recently validate that the API industry truly has come of age.&nbsp;

<p>Enterprise content sharing platform <a title="Box" href="https://box.com">box</a> launched a <a title="new developer revenue sharing program with its API developer ecosystem" href="https://developers.blog.box.com/2013/06/06/welcome-to-the-new-app-economy-introducing-box-rev/">new developer revenue sharing program for its API developer ecosystem,</a> called <a href="https://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215">$rev</a>.
<p><a href="https://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215">Box $rev</a> is pretty straightforward.  You just integrate the <a href="https://developers.box.com/">Box API</a> into your app, enroll it into the Box $rev program, and box will monitor, track and report your activity--sending you checks for up to 15% of the per seat price as a commission, each quarter.
<p>As a PaaS provider, the core value driven by the box API is not about making money, it is based upon adding new users, and getting them to depend on box for their everyday needs.  Offering developers 15% of the revenue generated via the core box platforms makes a lot of sense.
<p><a title="Box" href="https://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/box/box-rev.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>This approach to revenue share won't work for all API providers, but is a great way to incentivize developers when you have a core platform you need to drive new users to.
<p>I like the Box $rev model, because it actually incentivizes developers to build meaningful, engaging applications that users will actually adopt.
<p>Its nice to see API value quantified in engagement, allowing us to move beyond the eye-ball based economy we are drowning in currently.

<p>In the last two years I've seen the emergence of&nbsp; cloud platforms that focus on helping data administrators, owners and stewards, generate APIs from their data sources.
<p>The new cloud services like <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=28">EmergentOne</a> will mount a MySQL database, spider the tables, and generate a web API for you, while providing you the basic tools you will need to manage access and consumption of that API.
<p>In the same spirit of helping data owners generate APIs, I'd like to see the same types of tools, but designed for books and their authors or publishers.  When I create a book and generate the ePub version, I would like to be able to upload it to a cloud platform, where the service would spider the ePub file and help generate a simple, but meaningful API for the book allowing developers to search, annotate and interact with the books content via web, mobile or tablet applications.
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/books/bw-epub-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>My thoughts are still in the idea stage, I have done very little research on what is out there.  But I would envision something like this would work well will existing platforms like <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>.  As I do with all my ideas, I will share my thoughts here in real-time as I do the research.
<p>I think in the future, providing default API access to all books will be critical to the syndication across all available distribution platforms.  You can find the seeds of this idea&nbsp; in what <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/apis">Pearson is doing with their product catalog</a>.
<p>As the publishing world slowly wakes up to digital distribution, APIs will become a common tool in the toolbox of authors and publishers.

<p><a href="https://delicious.com/">del.icio.us</a>&nbsp;is a social bookmarking service for storing, sharing and discovering web bookmarks to web pages, that was founded by Jousha Schachter in 2003.
<p>Del.icio.us implemented a very simple tagging system which allowed users to easily tag their web bookmarks in a meaningful way, but also established a kind of folksonomy across all users of the platform. Which proved to be a pretty powerful way for cataloging and sharing web links.

<p>The innovative tagging methodology used by del.icio.us allowed you to pull a list of your tags, or public web bookmarks by using the URL http://del.icio.us/tag/[tag name]/. So if I was searching for bookmarks on airplanes, I could http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane and I would GET a list of all bookmarks that have been tagged airplane. &nbsp;It was simple
<p>When it came to the programmatic del.icio.us interface, the API was built into the site, creating a seamless experience--if you wanted the airplane tags via HTML you entered http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane, if you wanted RSS of the tags you entered http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/airplane, and if you wanted XML returned you used http://del.icio.us/api/tag/airplane. This has changed with the modern version of Delicious API.
<p>del.icio.us was the first, concrete example of how the web could deliver HTML content, alongside machine readable like RSS and XML, using a URL structure that was simple and human readable. This approach to sharing bookmarks would set the stage for future APIs, in making APIs easy to understand for developers and even non-developers alike. Any slightly technical user could easily parse the XML or RSS, and develop or reverse engineer widgets and apps around del.icio.us content.
<p>del.icio.us has been sold twice since its early popularity, which included to Yahoo! in 2005 and AVOS Systems on April, 2011. However del.icio.us was one of the pillar platforms that ushered in the social era of the API movement, establishing sharing via APIs as critical to the API economy, but also showing that simple rules when it comes to API design.

<p>There are plenty of tools and services you can use to manage your API and its developer community.  But there is no platform that provides as much benefit and versatility as <a title="Github" href="https://github.com">Github</a>.
<p>Github is a social coding platform that developers have grown to love and respect.  With a high level of adoption by developers, and the versatility of the features available on Github, API providers have developed many innovative ways to use the platform to manage an API.
<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I have documented eleven approaches to using Github for API management to date:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/10/22/open-source-your-api-with-github/">Design and Code</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/10/24/version-control-your-api-documentation-with-github/">Documentation</a></li>

<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/29/managing-api-terms-of-service-privacy-and-branding-with-github/">Terms of Service, Privacy, and Branding</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This list does not represent all the uses of Github for an API, but the approaches I've seen used by open API providers.  Not all APIs are created or managed equally and these approaches to using Github can be applied in many different ways, even within private platforms.
<p>Github is about social coding and file versioning, an approach that offers huge benefits to API management practices.  You want all aspects of your API operations to be social and versioned allowing it to evolve over time--Github handles this like no other platform.
<p>Consider Github as the core of your API operations and think about which of these eleven approaches you can use to make sure your API is as successful possible.

<p>I just got back from Madrid, Spain, where I spoke at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIdays Mediterranea</a>.  I really enjoy the API Days format, because the events are small, intimate API learning and networking opportunities.
<p>While at API Days I got to hang out with many of the usual suspects Andy Thurai of <a title="API Management" href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/api-management">Intel</a>, Guillaume Balas of <a title="API Management" href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, Ronnie Mitra of <a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a>, Bruno Pedro of <a title="CloudWork" href="http://cloudwork.com">CloudWork</a>, Swift of <a href="http://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a> and API Days organizer Mehdi Medjaoui of <a href="http://webshell.io">WebShell</a>.
<p>I also had the opportunity to re-enforce some existing relationships in person, with Isabelle Mauny of <a title="API Management" href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>, Jeremiah Lee a UX researcher from SF and Eduardo Basterrechea and Elena Alvarez of <a href="http://www.apicultur.com/en/">Apicultur</a>.

<p>API Days Mediterranea was a great introduction to the API innovation occurring in Spain, and a great opportunity to have conversations with companies and developers from the region, and hear the challenges they face in getting the word out about APIs in their country.
<p>I really dig going to new regions and helping spreading the API gospel.  Thank you so much to Apicultur for bringing me out, and Webhsell and <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">Fabernovel</a> for helping organize.  Also don't forget 3Scale, Intel, <a title="Email" href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a> and WSO2 for organizing.
<p>I can't wait for the next edition of API Days, the model really works well for planting the necessary seeds in new regions to get the API conversation going.  Next up is API Days San Francisco (no seed planting required), but there will be other cities added, so make sure and step up if you'd like to see API Days in your city!

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-urge-court-block-copyright-claims-oracle-v-google-api-fight"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/google-v-oracle-brief.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-urge-court-block-copyright-claims-oracle-v-google-api-fight">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recently filed a a brief</a> in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, urging the court to block copyright claims in the Oracle v. Google legal battle.  The EFF approached me several months ago to provide feedback for the brief.   I sent over my research and published some of my thoughts to <a href="/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">Help EFF Make Case For No Copryight on APIs</a> and why <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/12/08/api-copyright-would-restrict-api-interoperability/">API Copyright Would Restrict API Interoperability</a> and also lent my support as one of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">Signatories to the Computer Scientists&rsquo; Amicus Brief</a>.
<p>Here is a summarized version of the arguement:
<blockquote><em>As computer scientists, amici have relied on the open nature of APIs and the programs built on them to create and operate new software.  Amici depend on APIs remaining open to sustain wide spreads compatibility standards used by startups and incumbents alike.  Reversing the District Court would dangerously undermine the settled expectations of computer scientists who rely on the open nature of APis. </em><ol style="padding-left: 25px; list-style-type: upper-roman; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces were essential to the development of modern computers and the Internet</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>The BIOS of the Original IBM-Compatible PC</em></li>
<li><em>Major modern operating system reimplement the ground break UNIX API</em></li>
<li><em>The C programming language became universal because of its uncopyrightable interface</em></li>
<li><em>Computers rely on the uncopyrightable nature of APIs and network protocols to communicate over the Internet</em></li>
<li><em>The uncopyrightable nature of APIs for the industry standards for cloud computing</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces spur the creation of software that otherwise would not be written</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces allow software that makes different systems compatible<br /></em></li>
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces help programmers develop completely new capabilities for software</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Copyright in interfaces would creat an "orphan software" problem</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces protect both developers and users<br /></em></li>
<li><em>The orphan software problem disproportionately affects the public sector</em></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<blockquote><em> Conclusion: </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The freedom to reimplement and extend existing aPIs has undoubtedly led to robust software and hardware industries, but also to an explosion of technological advances that do more than merely increase companies' bottom line.  They open the world for the sharing of information, increased communication, and technological advances that could never have been contemplated.</em></blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-computer-scientists">full brief that was filed over at EFF</a>.  Keeping APIs open, and free from copyright is something I am passionate about and feel very strongly that it is critical to a healthy, vibrant online economy.
<p>I'm confident that the Judge will throw out Oracle's case, but I do no think this is the last time we'll see a company step up and try to apply copyright to APIs.
<p>I'm very thankful for the EFF and the other computer scientists who researched and supported the brief.
<p>Thank you!

<p>Have you checked out what the <a title="Webshell.io" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell.io</a> team is up to lately? &nbsp;I know I haven't been in there for a couple months, and it looks like they've been heads down making some interesting improvements.
<h3>New Cloud IDE</h3>
<p>Rather than re-invent the wheel, Webshell has integrated <a title="Cloud9" href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>&nbsp;web-based IDE, into the API scripting platform:
<p><a href="ttps://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" alt="image" /></a>
<h3>New Documentation</h3>
<p>They overhauled their platform documentation on the continuous mission to make them more valuable by developers:
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-2.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-2.png" alt="image" /></a>
<h3>New API Explorer</h3>
<p>They've changed the API explorer making playing with APIs a better experience.
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-3.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-3.png" alt="" /></a>
<h3>New Codecademy Lesson</h3>
<p>They have created "Webshell 101" course, providing an easy way to understand how Webshell works:<br /><a href="http://7za.r.mailjet.com/redirect/0v8nhcjr7rysybw5poob6n/www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-Gux11/0/1" target="_blank"></a>

<p>That is four pretty significant building blocks from the Webshell platform. If your not familiar with some of the innovative API integration Webshell is doing, I recommend checking them out. &nbsp;Also if you haven't taken a fresh look in a while, like me, I recommend taking a moment.
<p>The Webshell team gets the future of API usage, what they are doing via their platform represents a meaningful blend of the technology, business and politics of APIs, providing a model for the programmable web.

<p>title: ‘API Aggregation For Federal Government with FedAPI’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Fed-API-Logo-2.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Fed-API-Logo-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I've been tracking on what I call API aggregation for some time now.  I started seeing the <a href="/2010/11/19/universal-apis/" target="_blank">API aggregation trends in 2010</a>, then I saw this pick up in 2011 with the emergence of providers like <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=34" target="_blank">Singly</a> and <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=35" target="_blank">Adigami</a>.
<p>While many new companies provide you with interoperability and automation between multiple APIs, I consider aggregators to be about bringing together multiple APIs into a single aggregated end-point for developers to use, then also providing potentially new APIs that are only possible, because of the aggregation.
<p>Last year, after I started spending more time in Washington DC, I met a talented group of folks who were playing around with the idea of an aggregate API for federal government.  In the last couple weeks it looks like they were serious about it, and launched the debut version of <a href="http://fedapi.com/">Fed{API}</a>.
<p>Fed{API} is looking to make government data more accessible and reusable by taking data from multiple sources, some easy to pull and some much more difficult, then collect, correlate and catalog into a single, aggregate API stack that developers can put to use.
<p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/fedapi/fedapi-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API Aggregation</a>.  I think this is the future of standardizing APIs and data across many sources, but as I'm watching providers tackle this, you begin to realize what a massive undertaking it will be.  And FedAPI is looking to do this by opening up federal government data, which by itself is a massive challenge.  So FedAPI is tackling two pretty massive problems, as a core business model.
<p>Even with the massive challenge ahead, I will be supporting FedAPI 100%, and doing what I can to make sure their initiative is successful. To do so, I think they will have to get two other groups involved:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Other API Aggregate Providers</strong> - FedAPI needs to make sure and reach out to Singly, Temboo, Adigami and the other API aggregators and see what they can learn, share knowledge and wisdom.  Aside from FedAPI, all these providers need to work together and not re-invent the wheel when it comes to Auth and API connectors</li>
<li><strong>Public At Large</strong> - FedAPI has to introduce tools that allow figure everyday Joe and Jane citizen into the equation.  Some users are going to be very knowledgable and passionate about specific areas, and there has to be ways to share the load and let them help clean and verify data, and other meaningful tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think that API Aggregation is the answer to all the problems that plague API integration, but I think API aggregators will play a major role in helping standardize API interfaces, data formats and provide critical cross-provider, inter-agency knowledge and wisdom--something individual API providers may never be able to deliver alone.
<p>One thing I want to lend a hand with, when it comes to FedAPI, is help create the blueprint of which federal agencies already have APIs and open data sets, and where these exists.  I can also be the aggregator of news, analysis and best practices across the federal API landscape.
<p>I'm on board FedAPI, let's make this happen.

<p>title: ‘The API Stack for May 20th, 2013’</p>

<p>image:</p>

<hr />

<p>Expansion is in the air.  Quarterly reports are in, we are moving into summer and companies like Twilio, Evernote, Salesforce and Foursquare are expanding and growing at healthy, steady paces.
<p>Mobile is king.  I'm having trouble keeping up with the new mobile players in different niche areas, as well as all the big players paying strong attention to the mobile space including Yahoo, SAP, Intel and beyond. BaaS will continue to be a dominate theme throughout 2013.
<p>The Internet of Things is prominent with tech blogosophere coverage, webinars and new companies rolling out IOT APIs and technology. &nbsp;As we see the rhetoric step up on autombiles, homes, buildings and other fast growing IOT areas we'll continue to see new companies and investment, the trick will be to sort through it all and make sense.
<p>API management is definitely on everyone's minds.  I'm seeing existing PaaS platforms make plays with API management tools, new database to API discussions and all the big players are as active &nbsp;as ever, even Mashery and Layer 7 after their recent acquisitions.
<p>API testing, monitoring and other developer focused tools is my favorite new area to research lately.  I'm seeing an explosion in this area with high profile launches from Runscope, TheRightAPI and a strong presence from existing players like SmartBear and Pingdom.
<p>A new area I'm adding to my API trends monitoring is around what is being called Single Page Applications (SPA).  There was a great talk by Steve Willmott of 3Scale this week at Gluecon on the relationship between SPA and APIs.  But I'm also seeing major movement from devs and API providers in use of SPA oriented frameworks and libraries like Angular.js, Ember.js, Knockout.js and Backbone.js.
<p>Beyond testing and monitoring, security is an important theme.  As the API space expands, the concern for securing APIs and their accompanying web apps is growing.  We are seeing major providers continue the roll-out of two-step verification, as well as security and identity providers stepping up to offer services in the space.
<p>Overall the space is showing healthy expansion.  New APIs, service provers and tools are emerging, while the existing players are expanding at a healthy rate.  It has been a good spring for the API space.

<hr />

<p><a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-stack/api-stack-logo.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a>
<p>Over the last year I've worked hard to standardize and automate as much of my monitoring of the API space as I can. The amount of information I was monitoring daily was getting overwhelming--I needed to scale what I do, so I created what I call my <a href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API Stack Ranking</a>.
<p>The API Stack Ranking is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not meant </span>to be a top 25 list, it is meant to be a ranking that I can sort companies by each week, giving me a meaningful stack of companies, who are doing interesting things in the API space.
<p>Each week I publish my <a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank">API Stack</a>, but you can also see this influence on any of my research areas. &nbsp;If you go to <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> or the <a title="Backend as a Service (BaaS)" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">Backend as a Service (BaaS</a>) research projects, the providers are sorted by their ranking for the week.
<p>In addition to sharing my stack each week, I'd like to also share the criteria I use to determine my stack. &nbsp;Currently I bundle my signals into three areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Signals within control of the companies I'm monitoring      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Has a Blog</li>
<li>Number of Blog Posts</li>
<li>Has a Twitter Account</li>
<li>Number of Tweets</li>
<li>Has Github Account</li>
<li>Number of Github Repositories</li>
<li>Number of Commits Across Repositories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>External</strong> - Signals from the public, outside of the companies control that I'm monitoring      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Number of Twitter Followers</li>
<li>Number of @Mentions for Twitter</li>
<li>Blogsphere (Techcrunch, GigaOm, ReadWrite, etc) Posts</li>
<li>Social Bookmark (Hacker News, Reddit, StumbleUpon) Links</li>
<li>Stack Exchange Reference</li>
<li>Number of Github Followers</li>
<li>Number of Github Stars</li>
<li>Number of Github Forks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analyst</strong> - Signals that are dependent on what I personally see and feel is important      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Curated News</li>
<li>Curated News I Write Notes About</li>
<li>Syndicate to Twitter</li>
<li>Syndicate to LinkedIn</li>
<li>Syndicate to G+</li>
<li>Publish story on API Evangelist</li>
<li>Vote Up&nbsp;</li>
<li>Vote Down</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My API Stack Ranking is always in flux.  I'm considering other signals like job postings, events as well as sentiment analysist, but this listing represents what I'm currently evaluating to generate my stack each week.
<p>While internal signals give me a good idea of what a company is up to, and the external signals give me some idea regarding what the open developer community is saying, it all really comes down to the analyst part of the algorithm. &nbsp;A company may tweet a lot, but its up to me to decide if those tweets are valuable.
<p>The API Stack Ranking isn't perfect. &nbsp;But it has allowed me to quadruple the amount of information I take in, and surface what I feel are the real stories and reflect the companies that are truly impacting the API space each week.
<p>I have also been able to expand the API Stack Ranking to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> business or topical sector I wish now, much like I applied to <a title="BaaS" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">BaaS</a> I'm now evaluating <a title="Federal Government" href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com">federal government</a>, <a title="healthcare" href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com">healthcare</a> and other sectors in the same way.
<p>Feel free to contact me directly about the API Stack, and the data and content I produce each week. &nbsp;I'd love to hear your thoughts.

<p>title: ‘New Features From BaaS Provider AnyPresence’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/anypresense-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.anypresence.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/anypresense_logo_New.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm adding some new BaaS features I found in a recent press release from BaaS provider <a title="AnyPresence" href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a> titled, "<a href="http://www.anypresence.com/press-release/AnyPresence_Launches_4th-Generation_Mobile_Backend_as_a_Service_Platform.php">AnyPresence Launches 4th-Generation Mobile Backend-as-a-Service Platform with Unparalleled Enterprise Capabilities</a>", to my list of BaaS features. &nbsp;As I'm processing them I notice they are some pretty significant features:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Application Cloning -&nbsp;</strong>For organizations looking to build multiple apps that have common core functionality with only minor variations, this powerful feature allows them to create a copy of an existing app along with all data source, object, and user interface definitions, saving significant development effort.</li>
<li><strong>Automated App UI Testing -&nbsp;</strong>Developers who use AnyPresence to generate a starter mobile app user interface (UI), now get the added benefit of functional test scripts for native iOS, native Android, and jQuery Mobile web apps. These test scripts can be run to ensure the app is interacting with backend functionality as expected, saving time in testing and improving reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Server Extensions -&nbsp;</strong>While developers have always been able to add custom code to objects within AnyPresence, they can now create re-usable &ldquo;Extensions&rdquo; that can be shared across teams or lines of business. This also enables third parties to encapsulate their services as official AnyPresence Extensions, enabling a marketplace of add-ons that can be used across the AnyPresence customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise App Store Integration -&nbsp;</strong>AnyPresence now supports the ability to deploy apps to employees directly via enterprise app stores powered by Mobile Application Management (MAM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. Apperian EASE is first MAM partner solution to be integrated directly with the AnyPresence Designer.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure Management -&nbsp;</strong>For the default cloud backend server deployment to Heroku, administrators can now control the performance characteristics of their app, and choose from hundreds of Heroku add-ons, directly from the AnyPresence Designer. This seamless integration enables developers to plan for the required capacity and usage of each individual backend server instance, and manage them from one central location.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to interpret each BaaS provider's products and services, and establish any sort of common definition, but applicaiton cloning, automated testing, custom server extensions and enterprise app stores are pretty straight-forward and powerful BaaS features.
<p>I'm curious to see where AnyPresence goes with their custom extensions. &nbsp;I think whoever can do this part of BaaS correctly will win the BaaS world championships! (That is an award, right?)
<p>Lot's of exciting stuff coming from the BaaS sector lately! &nbsp;Fun space to watch.

<p>title: ‘API Management Using APiphany’</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-logo-blue.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm working my way through all the <a title="API management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management providers</a>, making sure I'm up to speed on what service each provider is offering these days.  As part of this work I've been playing with the <a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank">Apiphany</a> platform, using a demo site the Apiphany team was so kind to setup for me.
<p>Using Apiphany I can manage my APIs, and launch a portal which allows me to hang all my APIs, then manage all aspects of their operations. Apiphany focuses on the three main components of API deployment &amp; consumption:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - API resources and their operations you've deployed and would like to hang and manage via your Apiphany portal</li>
<li><strong>Products</strong> - Virtual products you create, which allow access to various combinations of API resources and operations</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - Applications that are registered with the platform, and consuming APIs via various product subscriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>The way Apiphany sets up the systems is very intuitive, giving you quick, administrative control over the systems you will need to execute on either a very simple, or even a very complex API strategy.
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-apis.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>APIs</strong></span><br /> Apiphany provides all the basics for API management, allowing you to add to endpoints, manage the title, description and manage operations for each endpoint, allowing you to define service operations to enable service documentation, interactive API console, per operation limits, request/response validation, and operation-level statistics.  Beyond the basics you can mask APIs, implement sophisticated caching and import overall API definitions from a WADL, Google Discovery Document, Swagger or OData format.
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/apiphany/aiphany-import.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Products</strong></span><br /> After you have all your raw API resources defined, you can move to define your "products", composed from your valuable API resources. The Apiphany product manager allows you to provide names and descriptions for your products, choose who has access and whether their are published or unpublished and the terms of use for any developer who subscribes to a product.  API product management takes a lot of work, experience and creativity--the Apiphany management system makes it something anyone can do.
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Policies</strong></span><br />The policies management area of Apiphany is where it gets seriously powerful.  Using the products, APIs and their operations, you can define granular level policies that are essential to API operations.  Policies can range from converting XML to JSON, providing JSONP or simply setting headers for specific APIs operations, and potentially within as specific product composition.  Policies gives you a library of common policies that are used across the API industry via easy to apply templates, but also allow you to define custom Node.js policies.  The ability to define and apply policies across products, APIs and their operations provides a very modular, reusable and granular control over all aspects of your API platform.
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-policies-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>APIs, Products and Policies are the heart of the Apiphany API management solution.  These provide the essential operational building blocks every API owner will need to execute an API platform. Apiphany also provides the necessary CMS framework to manage and support the developer portal, which wraps around your products, APIs and operations.
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Portal Management System</strong></span><br /> The APIPhany solution gives you full control over a developer portal to hang products, APIs and operations within--giving yuo control to customize the look, navigation of the portal with full page, content and media management. The Apiphany API Portal comes complete with the essential building blocks like documentation, blog, support and other CMS essentials to support an API platform.
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-dashboard.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Analytics</strong></span><br /> Apiphany has added a pretty robust suite of API analytics that allow you manage the most common aspects of API operations, in the following three areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Usage - Calls and bandwidth</li>
<li>Health - Status code, cache and API response time</li>
<li>Activity - By developer, product, API and operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apiphany analytics package allow you to filter by products and operations broken down by default dates like today, yesterday and 7,30,90 day or custom timelines. It gives you the basics of what you will need to be in tune with your API operations and make short or long term decisions for your API roadmap.
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Developers</strong></span><br /> Developers are central to any API operations and Apiphany provides the tools you will need to manage developer details and their subscriptions to products, and how their applications are using API resources. Apiphany gives you the control to block, reset and define access levels and roles for each of your developers, providing the control you need to manage your API ecosystem.
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-developer.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>This is my first deep dive into the Apiphany API management platform. I like what I see.  It has all the tools you will need to define, secure, manage and evolve your APIs. Deploying APIs requires a certain level of understanding of APIs, but with Apiphany anyone could take a set of API endpoints and transform and evolve them into some meaningful API driven products.
<p>After spending some time playing with what is possible with the Apiphany platform I'm left with thoughts about how I could craft products around the API resources I have.  I feel like I could easily define some pretty robust API products developers could subscribe to and integrate with.  But I also feel like I could easily iterate and add products, policies and create new APIs and operations to better meet potential consumers needs with very little effort.
<p>I'm going to continue setting up my API infrastructure with Apiphany, and help me understand what is possible.  I'd love to have my core platform available on all self-service API platforms, helping me understand where the space is at, and what each company brings to the table.

<p>I have been using <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> to manage my code for a couple years now, but in the last year I'm using Github more often for a variety of projects that don't always have code involved--examples ranging from <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/talks/">hosting slide decks for my talks</a> to repositories for my <a href="/trends/">API research projects</a>.
<p>In the last couple months I've noticed I'm not the only one using Github to organize projects, check out of a few of these examples:

<p>Github lends itself to managing markup and markdown documents in a very collaborative way, allowing for tracking issues and revisions along the way.  There is something about the open source process that introduces transparency and visibility into the document creation and management process.
<p>I'm wll keep tracking on the innovative ways I'm seeing Github used.  So far I'm pretty impressed with the different ways I'm seeing Github used. &nbsp;If you know of any other interesting ways, please send my way.

</ul>
<p>Those are three pretty important signals in the API space. &nbsp;This represents each agencies technology roadmap, data and developer resources. Which can be some pretty interesting signals for the overall health of a federal agency.
<p>To demonstrate, let's look at the Department of Energy.
<p>Let's go to: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy">http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy</a></strong>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-strategy/energy-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Next: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/data/">http://energy.gov/data/</a></strong>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-strategy/energy-data.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>Then: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/developer/">http://energy.gov/data/</a></strong>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-strategy/energy-developer.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>After the Department of Energy, let's take a look at another agency, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
<p>Let's go to: &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.irs.gov/digitalstrategy">http://irs.gov/digitalstrategy</a></strong>
<p><strong><br /></strong>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>Next: &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.irs.gov/data">http://irs.gov/data</a></strong>
<p><strong><br /></strong>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>Then: &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.irs.gov/developer">http://irs.gov/developer</a></strong>
<p><strong><br /></strong>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>Granted, these are two very different agencies.  But I can't help but think that the IRS should hand out a copy of the White House Open Data Policy internally, and figure out how they can begin to let a little light into their operations and culture.

<p>I'm reading <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2013/05/24/irs-turn-over-a-new-leaf-open-up-data/">IRS: Turn Over a New Leaf, Open Up Data</a>, from the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> blog.  I'll let you read it in its entirety, but these are the points that are sticking with me:
<blockquote><em>One of Mr. Werfel&rsquo;s first actions on the job should be the immediate implementation of the groundbreaking Presidential Executive Order and Open Data policy, released last week, that requires data captured and generated by the government be made available in open, machine-readable formats. Doing so will make the IRS a beacon to other agencies in how to use open data to screen any wrongdoing and strengthen law enforcement.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>By sharing readily available IRS data on tax-exempt organizations, encouraging Congress to pass a budget proposal that mandates release of all tax-exempt returns in a machine-readable format, and increasing the transparency of its own processes, the agency can begin to turn the page on this scandal and help rebuild trust and partnership between government and its citizens.</em></blockquote>
<p><em><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-strategy/irs/irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></em>
<blockquote><em>Making IRS data open won&rsquo;t solve every problem; the recent scandal has proven that the IRS must be more transparent about both the information it collects, but also how it manages that information. A commitment on day one to share the data it collects in a machine readable manner would show true leadership by Mr. Werfel and help solidify the Obama administration&rsquo;s legacy as an open government.</em></blockquote>
<p>From my vantage point, in the world of APIs--I can't help but feel the solution to our "big government" illnesses is a little API therapy. &nbsp;The Open Data Policy has set the bar, and its up to the individual agencies to pay attention.
<p>APIs are not just a technical band-aid.   APIs start with a technical seed, but if a business or government entity internalizes the concepts around opening up, providing access, and setting up a feedback look with the public, partners or even with other departments, they will potentially let in a little sunlight.  Something that can go a long way in preventing many of the illnesses we often associate with "big government".
<p>I'm optimistic that the IRS can regain its footing.  I'm <a href="https://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">seeing a lot of API and open data innovation coming out of the federal government lately</a>.  For such a controversial entity like the IRS to recover, they will need to open up, and communicate with the public, in a way that only APis can provide.

<p><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> is doing some pretty <a href="https://blogs.developerforce.com/tech-pubs/2013/05/sandbox-templates-and-a-new-look.html">interesting stuff with the sandbox environment</a> for <a href="http://developer.force.com/">DeveloperForce</a>.
<p>Using the DeveloperForce sandbox you can create copies of your data, allowing you to develop, test or train against, not just a sandbox, but a relevant and meaningful copy of your company's data.
<p>The Force.com sandbox has always allowed you to create a separate copy of your data, but now they let you create sandbox templates, allowing you to create specific data sets that you can reuse in different ways.
<p>Seeing this feature coming out of Salesforce has prompted me to take a closer look at their approach to the DeveloperForce sandbox environment.  I'm sure there are other features and approaches to sandboxing we can learn from the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.

<p>As the API universe expands, I'm seeing a greater need for me to study and tell stories around API testing, monitoring, sandboxing and the best practices around API development and integration.

<p>I just had a demo of some of the new features in the <a title="API Manager" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/">WSO2 API Manager</a>.   Since WSO2 is one of my partners, I have a regular call with them to discuss the space and I often get demos of their new products and features.
<p>Today's topic was <a href="http://wso2.org/library/articles/2013/05/multitenant-api-management-new-wso2-api-manager-140">multi-tenacy in their API Management platform</a>, meaning&nbsp;you can easily deploy multiple API portals using the platform.  Not every company will need more than one API portal, but for some companies that are further along, it provides a pretty sophisticated way to engage with API consumers.
<p>When it comes to slicing and dicing your APIs, we usually segment our API resources by service level, apps and users.  WSO2 introduces a fourth layer--by the domain.  So now you can group API resources under domains, crafting different "API storefronts" for your consumers.
<p>I'm still thinking through all of the opportunities with API management multi-tenancy, but at first thought, it will help me counteract many of the questions I get around a company's concern that APIs have to be public.  Most companies have learned about APIs from the popularity of public APIs, so I spend a lot of time explaining the opportunities for internal or partner APis.
<p>The WSO2 approach to API management multi-tenancy allows me to help companies understand that unlimited ways they can provide access to their valuable resources in not just public, private ways, but to any group, user base or target audience in a very organized and branded way.
<p>You can hear me, and Chris Haddad VP, Technology Evangelism at WSO2 discuss multi-tenancy as part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2013/06/your-api-branding-strategy">Your API Branding Strategy</a> webinar on Thursday, June 13, 2013.

<p>Cloud storage of documents is becoming commonplace. Individuals, companies, government and non-government organizations have increasingly seen the potential of storing files in the cloud using services like Amazon S3, Dropbox and Box.
<p>As a web or mobile application developer, it is becoming more common to provide integration, syncing or even direct usage of popular cloud storage services like Dropbox as the application's storage system.
<p>This last week I started playing with Dave Winer's (<a href="/admin/blog/davewiner">@davewiner</a>) simple idea outliner, notepad, todo list and project organizer--<a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>.
<p>What caught my attention is Dave's use of Dropbox as the central storage for the app.  It reminds me of another application I use called <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a>, which uses Github as the central storage system for the app.
<p>I really dig this approach to delivering, dead-simple, meaningful apps like Fargo, that don't re-invent the wheel and focus on delivering value on top of the existing tools and platforms we already use.
<p>I asked Dave what his thoughts are on this approach, in which he simply replied:
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">kinlane</a> -- works like a dream

<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
&lt;/div&gt;
<p>I like Dave's approach to app development which is about delivering simple, useful apps that that sensibly put APIs to use, and establish a foundation using open formats like OPML.
<p>As the hardware and operating systems developers depend on continues being vritualized and migrating into the cloud, the usage of open formats and common, API driven cloud resources like storage from Dropbox, will be common among successful app developers.
<p>I think Dropbox as your apps default file system is here to stay.

<p>I'm increasingly finding a company's approach to using Github, a vital signal of the health of a company, their team, and the products and services they are delivering.
<p>An example of this is with social data platform, <a href="https://datasift.github.io/">DataSift's new open source area</a>.  DataSift has thrown up a Github page which re-enforces the company's commitment to consuming and producing open source software, as well as a list of important, Github driven signals:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Latest Updates</strong> - The latest repository updates acorss all of DataSift's repositories</li>
<li><strong>API Client Libraries</strong> - Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and other client libraries for the DataSift API</li>
<li><strong>Public Github Repos</strong> - Other tools and utilities that are avaiable via DataSift Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Job Vacancies</strong> - A listing of current job openings at DataSift</li>
</ul>
<p>I think DataSift approach is a very meaningful demonstration in the potential of being "open". &nbsp;As a company, DataSift provides access to valuable social signals, that any company can access via their interface and API, allowing them to develop insight and intelligence.  If you look closely at their approach to deploying their Github hosted, open source site, it provides four very critical signals.  API client libraries, open source code projects, job openings and updates across the company's Github profile.
<p><a href="https://datasift.github.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-open-source.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>Think about it.  The number of platforms supported for an API, the number of public open source code projects and the number and type of job postings for a company are pretty significant signals regarding the health of a company these days. &nbsp;These can be pretty difficult areas to fake, and in many cases will quickly show the activity, growth and stability of a company.
<p>I like DataSift's approach to their Open Source area.  It doesn't just provide code and tools for developers to be successful, it provides us a deeper look into how DataSift operates. &nbsp;
<p>Of the 1,640 tech companies I monitor, 751 of them have Github accounts. &nbsp;I think many of these companies can learn a lot from DataSift's approach to open source and how you can put Github to use.

<p>I'm working through the wave of API innovation coming out of our Federal Government recently. During normal days at API Evangelist, I'm pulling private sector API usage examples and crafting them into stories to help the Federal Government execute on their API own strategies.  Today, I'd like to showcase something the Federal Government is doing, in hopes that more companies in the private API sector will emulate as part of their API strategies.
<p>The GSA's&nbsp;<a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/">Digital Services Innovation Center</a> has launched the <a href="https://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/">Mobile Code Catalog</a>, an open source catalog of web and native applications that government agencies can use to jump-start their projects. Think application showcase, but all the applications are open source and allow for your API developers to download, fork and re-use code.
<p>The idea of a code catalog is pretty interesting, and I see it as an evolution of several API building blocks I talk about--code samples, SDKs, starter kits and application showcase all rolled into one.  Imagine if your API consumers can come into your developer area and not just find code samples, they can find complete applications that they can download, reverse-engineer and put to use.  Talk about going from zero to API integration in as short of time as possible.
<p><a href="https://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-strategy/mobile-code-catalog.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>I know that many API owners compete with their ecosystems, by deploying their own version of their mobile, web or desktop apps, but for the others a code catalog is an excellent way to facilitate integrations with your platform.
<p>Another cool thing about the Digital Services Innovation Center Mobile Code Catalog, is that the catalog itself is open source and hosted on Github.  This is a whole other aspect of the innovation around a code catalog, that the catalog itself can be downloaded, forked and published anywhere on a public website or private portal.
<p>I envision hundreds of code catalogs available in the near future, across many business, government and NGO sectors.  While there is money in building proprietary apps on top of APIs, I think there is even more money to be made when you put meaningful, high quality apps in the hands of end-users.

<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - Ember<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span> is an open-source client-side JavaScript web application framework based on the model-view-controller (MVC) software architectural pattern.

<p>Single page applications have benefits like speed, no page reloads, mobile optimization, real-time pushes, notifications and they just look <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">freak'n</span> cool.

<p>The popularity of frameworks and libraries like Ember, Angular and Backbone, and the Single Page Application approach isn't something just developers are noticing.  Some top platforms are seeing the potential, and providing code and toolkits for integrating using Ember, Angular and Backbone:

</ul>
<p>With the popularity of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and growing number of <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">SPAs</span>, there is a huge opportunity for API providers to offer API driven libraries and widgets that are plug and play with frameworks like Angular and Ember, and are compatible with libraries like Backbone.
<p>As I monitor the API space I will continue looking for examples of APIs doing interesting things with Ember, Angular and Backbone. Let me know if you see anything I should take a look at.

<p><a title="DFW API Professional Meetup Group" href="https://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/dfw-api-meetup-group/dfw-api-meetup-group.jpeg" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I just got back from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I visited Dallas last night to help kick off the first gathering of the DFW API Professionals Meetup.
<p>We got together at Microsoft around 6PM and I talked from 6:30 until 8:00, evolving on my <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/talks/api-meetup-dallas-tx/web-to-programmableweb-to-programmableworld/index.html#/" target="_blank">From Web, to ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld</a> talk.
<p><a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://www.therightapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/therightapi-logo-2.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>The meetup was about 45 people ranging from developers to investors.  I showed up with a lot of content, but I wanted to make sure and cover the full API spectrum, while also introducing some new content about specifically about API consumption.
<p>During the event I had some time to get to know the <a href="http://www.therightapi.com/">theRightAPI</a>, <a title="BAaS" href="http://www.proxomo.com/">Proxomo</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 Technologies</a>&nbsp;<span>and&nbsp;</span><a title="Tech Efficiency and Innovation" href="http://www.parivedasolutions.com/">Pariveda Solutions</a> folks--while connecting with the rest of the meet up group members.
<p><a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/att/att-foundry.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>Then, this morning theRightAPI crew brought me out to Plano, TX to the <a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/">AT&amp;T Foundry</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/attfoundry">@attfoundry</a>), where I got to talk with Vincent Button (<a href="https://twitter.com/vebutton">@vebutton</a>) and Jennifer Conley (<a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferconley">@jenniferconley</a>).  I was a little blown away by what I saw.  It wasn't what I was used when visiting the campuses of big telco companies in the past.  The facility was something you associate with Silicon Valley and Bay Area. Open layout with a variety of people working on things ranging from voice solutions to the internet of things.
<p><a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/gravity-center/gravity-center-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>Afterwards, Jennifer walked us up to the <a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/">Gravity Center</a>, which has been provided access to AT&amp;T and Alcatel-Lucent resources to support multiple startups in the North Texas area.  I got to meet to the <a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/">BookShout</a> team and hear about how they are navigating and working to change the book publishing space, while allowing people to discover books, and build social networks around books and authors.
<p><a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/bookshout/bookshout-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm pretty impressed with what I saw in Texas in the last 48 hours.  I met some pretty tech savvy people building interesting startups, putting APIs to use in meaningful ways, and a community around them that is investing in what they are doing. While I was there, I saw all the same elements for startup success I see in Silicon Valley, but without much of the hype.
<p>I was stoked to be able to help kick off the DFW API Professionals Meetup Group.  I appreciate theRightAPI for bringing me out, and  Proxomo, Layer 7 and Pariveda Solutions for making it happen.

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/dark-matter.jpeg" border="0" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I encounter many enterprise folks who dismiss APIs as nothing more that just one of the technical building blocks of SOA.  Folks who, no matter how much I explain, will never see APIs beyond a technical specification and implementation.
<p>API Evangelist solely exists to shed light on not just the technology of APIs, but the equally important business and politics of the APIs.  It is the business and political building blocks that help the concept of API grow beyond just its technical roots.
<p>An API won't  find success just because you made a resource available via a URL. An API is successful because it is logically priced, possibly has revenue sharing, code samples to jumpstart integration and a support and resource network that a developer can tap into.  An API is successful because it is open and self-service, but sensibly secured, providing a terms of service that benefit API owners, and developers, while also protecting the interests of end users.
<p>APIs bring together a unique blend of technology, business and politics into a transparent, self-service mix that can foster innovation. As someone who is heavily invested at the enterprise scope, it can be difficult to see things through this lens sometimes.  You will need to upgrade your prescription with the eye doctor.
<p>Why "API" is working is not just a REST+JSON technical answer, there is a dark matter that binds the whole movement together, while also providing the right about of lubricant and oxygen necessary for innovation. In the enterprise you will often see this dark matter as governance, in the world of APIs it will have a lot of the same characteristics as your governance, but it is actually the exact opposite of governance.
<p>I don't expect to convert all you enterprise folks to see APIs like I do. I don't think you are equipped to view the dark matter that keep the API movement expanding and moving forward. You are focused on seeing things through another lense of control and about the extraction of value--a lense that will always prevent you from seeing the dark matter that makes APIs an evolution beyond SOA.

<p>I've been tracking on a trend in the API space that I call <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API aggregation</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://singly.com" title="Singly">Singly</a> and <a href="http://www.adigami.com/" title="Adigami">Adigami</a> are aggregating APIs into more meaningful API stacks, than any single API provider can deliver on their own.
<p>In my regular monitoring, I'm always on the hunt for examples of the benefits of API Aggregation, and last week I saw some pretty interesting payment gateway data being provided by payment API aggregator <a href="http://spreedly.com" title="Payment API Aggregator">Spreedly</a>--which definitely reflects the positive effects I'm looking to shine light on in the space. &nbsp;
<p><a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly is a cloud based credit card vault</a> that allows you to work with one or multiple payment gateways over time or simultaneously, and has published some pretty interesting <a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/">analysis of failed transaction rates across multiple payment gateways</a>.
<p><a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/spreedly/spreedly-success-failure-stats.png" border="0" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'll let you head over to Spreedly to <a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/">read the analysis</a>.  What I find interesting is that they are open to sharing this data with the public.  This type of information sharing by API aggregator providers is critical to the overall health of the space. I'm often frustrated by the lack of data that API providers share, because they so often are keeping their cards so close to their chest, trying to protect their valuable business data or often lack of business data.
<p>There is huge opportunity for API aggregators to share information about their experience with the common APIs they integrate and aggregate with.  The whole industry can learn from this, but also work its way back upstream to the payment API providers, providing them with insight into how their APIs are operating, but also provide benchmarks of where they stand with their competitors, good or bad.
<p>Let me know if you see any other examples of API aggregators sharing data like <a href="http://spreedly.com" title="Payment API Aggregator">Spreedly</a>.

<p>After looking through the list of folks who have RSVP'd for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/">DFW API Professionals Meetup in Dallas tomorrow night</a>, it looks like an interesting mix of tech and business folk.  The tech group is definitely the larger, with a mix of mobile, web and enterprise.  The business folks look like a mix of VC, project manager, marketing and startups.
<p>I'm heading out to Dallas in the morning, and I am spending my afternoon preparing my talk.  When it comes to meetups, I like to wait until the last moment, see who has RSVP'd and shift my talk to being more tech, more business or more API 101 depending on the audience.   I like the mix of people I'm seeing RSVP'd for tomorrow night.
<p>I'm pulling together a talk from some of my regular material, but updating for what is going on right now.  Resulting in the following outline I'm calling, "From ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld":

<p>As I'm monitoring the API space I'm trying to create meaningful grouping for companies to belong when tracking API trends.  My groupings are sometimes in alignment with what we hear in the tech blogosophere, but other times I try new definitions to help expand my monitoring definition and see if I can identify emerging patterns like I'm seeing with <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com" title="Backend as a Service">BaaS</a>.
<p>Each week I do a little more exploration in concept of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com" title="API aggregation">API aggregation</a>, and this week after <a href="/2013/05/13/potential-for-api-aggregators-to-provide-valuable-industry-data/">studying payment API aggregator Spreedly</a>, I'm considering adding a new, overlapping area with aggregation, called API brokers.  Let's see if I can make this work.
<p>API aggregators like <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> are providing personal data access to popular SaaS platforms by aggregating APIs.  You can pull a list of photos from Singly, for a user, and it could pull photos from Flickr, Instagram and Facebook.  This is pretty straightforward API Aggregation.
<p>Other providers like <a href="http://temboo.com" title="Temboo">Temboo</a>, provide this functionality but focus more on the API interoperability or as i call it <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com" title="API reciprocity">API reciprocity</a> side of things.  Temboo does aggregate multiple APIs like Singly, but focuses on providing interoperability as well as aggregation.  While Singly does to, there are differences in their approach.
<p><a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly</a> has all the telltale signs of an API aggregator.  They allow you to program against 48 payment gateways in 71 countries.  It has aggregation, but rather than interoperability it seems to be about brokering transactions.  Spreedly can help you choose the gateway based upon location, cost and availability.  Which has all the elements of what I'd consider an API broker.
<p>I envision other new API brokers emerging, in niche areas like images, video or messaging.  Imagine if you could use Twilio, Tropo or other SMS API provider, but use through a broker who will give you the best availability and costs based upon various needs.  This type of API aggregation is not meant for providing users with access to multiple cloud silos via APIs, it is more about brokering API resources and establishing a marketplace.
<p>Not all APIs can be brokered, and maybe Spreedly is unique, but I bet I will find more of this behavior from other companies, once I start looking.  Let me know if you know of any companies who broker API resources in a similar way to Spreedly.

<p>Curently I'm immersed in discovering, vetting and tracking on signals that show me which companies are trending in the API space.  I'm looking for signals that will tell me which companies are making movements on a week to week basis, and when the blogosphere and developer communities are buzzing about these companies and technologies.
<p>Three very important signals I use are blogs, twitter and Github.  These tools provide me with great signals I can use to tune into what a company is doing, when they push code, write a story or tweet about it.  They also provide me with signals of when developers are engaging with API owners, because they follow on Twitter and download, fork, favorite and follow Github repositories.
<p>However, in some scenarios a companies blogs, twitter and Github accounts can also tell me when a company has given up and has run out of money or just stopped putting energy and resources into a project.  An example of this is with a company I came across during my monitoring last week, called <a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank">RESTful Labs</a>. RESTful Labs has all the eye candy to draw me in.  I mean they have REST in their name, and they build tools for developers!
<p><a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/restful-labs/restful-metrics.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>RESTful Labs provides API analytics tools for developers.  I'm pretty stoked anytime I find something like this, then I immediately look at the common signals:

<p>On the surface, RESTful Labs has all the right signal generators in having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts.  But immediately these signals start working against them, rather than the positive signals I would normally gather from someone having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts.
<p>It is clear that RESTful Labs WAS something last year, but now it is all but a ghost town.  It is not a tool I will recommend anyone use because there is nobody home to support.  Since they have a Github account, there might be resources that can be picked from the bones of the startup, but not much else beyond that.
<p>I keep companies like this in my database, as I want live examples like this to show people, and help them understand how to send the right signals that they are doing good things in the space.

<hr />

<p>Does anyone else notice the evolution of the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter developer area</a>? The site has taken a page from the LinkedIn playbook and become more about embeddable buttons, badges and widgets than about APIs. &nbsp;
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/twitter/twitter-homepage-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>Granted, you can click on documentation and get at the REST API v 1.1. &nbsp;I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing. &nbsp;I'm a big supporter of embeddable strategies for API providers. I think that evolution is very telling of Twitter's API strategy and what type of "developer" they want to support with the API.
<p>Whether or not you agree with Twitter's overall API strategy, there is a lot to learn from their approach to API driven embeddable tools. &nbsp;I will produce more pieces aobut their approach to cards, timelines, buttons and other embeddable tools.

<p>I've been working on expanding the amount of research and writing I can do via API Evangelist lately.  In the last couple weeks I rolled out new projects in three areas: <a title="API Toolkits" href="/2013/04/27/evolving-beyond-api-service-providers-and-api-tools-to-goal-based-api-toolkits/">API Toolkits</a>, <a href="/2013/04/28/api-trends/">API Trends</a>, <a title="API Priorities" href="/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a>.  This new approach is helping me focus on the areas I think are most important or exciting to the API space and generate as much, high quality news, analysis and white papers for the API space as I can.
<p>The first of my white papers, using my new approach is finished.  The new paper is called <a title="Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space" href="https://apps.facebook.com/marketpage/mu07n26dfwwupqoy6k0xj/item/MWP6Hfn" target="_blank">Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space</a>, and is the aggregation of all my research into the BaaS space.   Here is a breakdown of the white paper:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What is BaaS?</li>
<li>How Does BaaS Differ From IaaS and PaaS?</li>
<li>What Are The Benefits of BaaS?</li>
<li>What Can You Build With BaaS?</li>
<li>Who Are The Top BaaS Providers?</li>
<li>What Are The Common Building Blocks of BaaS?</li>
<li>What Are the Common Approaches to BaaS Pricing?</li>
<li>What Are The Other Approaches to BaaS Pricing?</li>
<li>Who Are The Other BaaS Providers?</li>

<li>What Are The Opportunities in BaaS?</li>
<li>Summing Up BaaS</li>
<li>Appendix A: Full List of BaaS Features</li>
<li>Appendix B: Curated News Sources</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the research, news, analysis and data that went into this white paper is available at <a title="Backend as a Service" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">baas.apievangelist.com</a>.  As I do with most of my work, I will be publishing all my BaaS research to this Github project, allowing anyone to view, fork or download.  The BaaS project will also have a full version, <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/marketpage/mu07n26dfwwupqoy6k0xj/item/MWP6Hfn">available as a PDF for $99.00</a>.  My goal is to subsidize my research via sales of white papers and the support of my partners.  If you can't afford, tune into the BaaS project, but if you'd like to support what I do you can purchase a copy.
<p>I'm working on other papers that are part of all of my <a title="API Toolkits" href="/2013/04/27/evolving-beyond-api-service-providers-and-api-tools-to-goal-based-api-toolkits/">API Toolkits</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/2013/04/28/api-trends/">API Trends</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="API Priorities" href="/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a> research areas.

<hr />

<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/xero/xero-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank">Accounting API platform Xero</a> has been taking a deeper look into the languages that their developers are using when integrating with the Xero API. Currently there are 1,600 active applications communicating with the Xero API, from a mix of Xero add-on partners to custom integrations engineered by 3rd party developers. &nbsp;But which programming languages were they using?
<p>To create a snapshot of what tools developers are using, Xero needed to find the best source to obtain this data. Xero doesn't ask developers which platform they use upon registration, and since Xero doesn't require any sort of user agent or other identifying signature, it was difficult to know where to best acquire the data they needed.
<p>The next best place to look for this data, is with the code samples themselves.  It would be nice, if Xero code samples were hosted using Github where they could track downloads, forks, followers, etc.  But the best they had, was the page views from the pages for each code library, within the Xero developer area.
<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/xero/xero-2013-usage-chart.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>Using this approach, Xero was able to extract some pretty interesting data about which programming languages developers were clicking on.  Identifying the growing dominance of languages like PHP and the emergence of newer approaches using Node.js.
<p>While Xero was able to learn a lot, I think we all should learn from Xero's story. There is a lot to be learned by other API providers: 1) API integration needs to be language agnostic 2) Working to understand which languages are beings used or in demand from developers, on a regular basis is important.
<p>This seems like a pretty basic topic to some of us, but when an API is born out of a company that has a single language focus, it can be difficult to understand the needs of developers who are using other platforms and languages.
<p>Make sure you prepare an approach to gathering and regularly evaluating data around which languages your API developers are needing to integrate ad work to support that as much as you possibly can.

<p>title: ‘Make Sure And Have Multiple KPIs For Your APIs’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-billionaires-club.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/programmableweb/api-billionaires-club.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>In the API space, we have to be constantly measuring and looking for signals that will help us understand where we should be focusing our resources, as part of an overall strategy.  One of the ways we measure value within the world of APIs (and business) is using KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators. Using KPIs we strive to measure the Return on our Investment (ROI), as we gamble with the technology, business and politics of APIs.
<p>One approach to quantifying the value, that has emerged from API providers, API service providers and the tech blogosphere is using the "API call". It is simple. You launch an API, so you quantify it by the number of times someone calls it.  Kind of like a page view, right?
<p>Out of this eyeball derived reality(which is silly since APIs aren't for humans), the API space has become obsessed with the number of API calls, resulting in what is known as the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/">API billionaires club</a>.  The Billionaires Club is an elite group of tech providers who have billions of calls per month on their API.  It is a pretty simple algorithm. Have API + Have Billions of Requests = Your In The Billionaires Club. And if you are in the billionaires club, you are successful. &nbsp;End of calculation.
<p>To quickly get to the point of my story, let's take one of my favorite members of the API billionaires club, Netflix. &nbsp;Billionaire Club Membership + Shutting Down Public API = Success. It is a different variation on the whole concept of measuring API success. The news, commonly held KPIs and definition of success doesn't immediately pan out in the whole Netflix story.
<p>Netflix, along with Twitter are both &nbsp;API case studies for the history books. Both of these API stories reflect the ups and downs of the API world, and the often bipolar nature of the public API ecosystem and schizophrenic nature of the tech blogosophere.  In contrast, along with Amazon Web Services, Twitter and Twilio, Netflix is a constant player in the stories I tell about success in the API sector. But at the same time, Netflix is considered to be a failure by common public APIs measurements. Are you feeling the crazy? &nbsp;I do!!
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-square.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>As I've <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">covered before</a>, the blogosphere tends to associate closure of the Netflix, with the ecosystem failures of Twitter.  While this is an easy comparison to make, when you look further, you see a lot more going on. &nbsp;Which tells me we need better ways to measure API success and failure and tell the stories around the ups and downs.
<p>After monitoring the API space for some time now, I'm looking for signals beyond what normal bloggers, analysts and pundits are following. In this hunt, Github is becoming an ever increasing gold mine of signals. &nbsp;To help demonstrate, let's take a look at the signals the <a href="https://github.com/netflix">Netflix Github account</a> puts out.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Priam">Priam</a></strong> - Co-Process for backup/recovery, Token Management, and Centralized Configuration management for Cassandra. (Last updated a day ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/aminator">aminator</a></strong> - A tool for creating EBS AMIs. This tool currently works for CentOS/RedHat Linux images and is intended to run on an EC2 instance. (Last updated 2 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/astyanax">astyanax</a></strong> - A Cassandra Java Client (Last updated 2 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/asgard">asgard</a></strong> - Web interface for application deployments and cloud management in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Binary download: http://netflix.box.com/asgard Twitter: http://twitter.com/AsgardOSS (Last updated 3 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava">RxJava</a></strong> - A library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM. (Last updated 4 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/denominator">denominator</a></strong> - (Last updated 5 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/blitz4j">blitz4j</a></strong> - Logging framework for fast asynchronous logging (Last updated 6 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy">SimianArmy</a></strong> - Tools for keeping your cloud operating in top form. Chaos Monkey is a resiliency tool that helps applications tolerate random instance failures. (Last updated 8 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">ribbon</a></strong> - Ribbon is a Inter Process Communication (remote procedure calls) library with built in software load balancers. The primary usage model involves REST calls with various serialization scheme support. (Last updated 9 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/frigga">frigga</a></strong> - Utilities for working with Asgard named objects (Last updated 10 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/curator">curator</a></strong> - ZooKeeper client wrapper and rich ZooKeeper framework (Last updated 11 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/karyon">karyon</a></strong> - The nucleus or the base container for Applications and Services built using the NetflixOSS ecosystem (Last updated 12 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/edda">edda</a></strong> - Service to track changes in your cloud (Last updated 13 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/brutal">brutal</a></strong> - A multi-network asynchronous chat bot framework using twisted (Last updated 17 days ago)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/archaius">archaius</a></strong> - Library for configuration management API (Last updated 17 days ago)</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pulled this data, several days ago, there are 15 separate repositories, in four separate programming languages, including Python, Java, Groovy, Scala, that have all been updated in the last 30 days. &nbsp;The fact that Netflix has a Github account, has open sourced so much of their code, while also actively maintaining it all, point at some very meaningful signals that we can tune into and work to emulate.
<p>While the number of calls against an API is a valid KPI to measure the potential success of an API, we have to have multiple KPIs when truly trying to understand the value of a company, the platform or any single API resource. &nbsp;Let's not get hung up on any single KPI, let's consider as many as we can--to see what makes sense and truly defines succcess.
<p>There is so much to learn from reading between the lines in the world of APIs.

<p>When it comes to the Internet of Things, APIs have a bright future. I tend to focus on the greater good when showcasing APIs, but occasionally I get tripped up by the market potential of APIs. I came across the <a href="https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/baby-toys-get-an-app-extension/">Baby Toys Get an App Extension</a> post in the New York Times this week, and I can't think of a more lucrative market for API interaction via a smart phone, than a baby or toddler's toys.
<p>First, can you image every mom or dad in America with access to their kids toys via their iPhone.  Talk about an emotional connection.  You have a real-time chord that is attached to a parents heart string.  So if you are at work, missing your child that is at home, in day care, or even when you are at home with them, you have the opportunity to interact with your child via their crib, playstation or other toy? I'm not even going to start profiling the toys and the opportunity here.
<p>Second, can you imagine the data available for toy, clothing and other manufacturers?  You have a daily, permanent connection between a parent and their child via the toys that are most important to a child each day, and by default, what is important to the parent.  With API connectivity between this toy and a parents smart phone via the home wifi connection, there is an unlimited flow of data about what impacts a child's life, and their parents world each day.
<p>As the connection between APIs and the Internet of Things comes into focus for me, I get excited about opportunities like connecting our children's worlds to our smart phone enabled worlds.  Then as soon as I get excited, I immediately get freaked out.  Think about the opportunity, for&hellip;well, exploitation.  We need to make sure there are best practices for terms of use, privacy and security in these fascinating, and new possibilities within the API space.
<p>Lots to think about with APIs and the Internet of Things.

<p>title: ‘The Future Is About Virtualized Operating Systems’</p>

<p>image:</p>

<hr />

<p>BaaS stacks have the potential to be the operating of the next generation of computing. BaaS has a lot of the characteristics of what we have historically defined as an OS, but tailored for apps that run on devices and in the clouds vs the desktop.
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows OS -&nbsp;</strong>Think of what the Windows operating system did for computing. It brought together a meaningful stack of resources into a single stack that could be installed on the new world of personal computers (PC). &nbsp;Windows provided application developers with a single platform they could build apps, targeting PC users. &nbsp;Windows provided a basic set of API resources developers could use, but ultimately it was open for the ecosystem to innovate in any business sector they desired.</li>
<li><strong>Server OS -&nbsp;</strong>When it comes to the server, many developers have migrated from desktop to web via Windows server operating systems. &nbsp;While to others they think of other OS flavors like Linux, BSD. &nbsp;These server environments provide developers with a base operating system for interfacing with user management, file system, database access and other libraries or APIs to develop either server side, network or web applications. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) -&nbsp;</strong>Cloud providers have moved the OS into the clouds--enabling developers to build at three different levels, providing a base OS, with set of often API driven resources for delivering site and apps to end users. &nbsp;The operating system has moved onto the world wide web, allowing for an entirely different approach to application development, usage and monetization.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualized BaaS OS -&nbsp;</strong>BaaS isn't just a new type of business. &nbsp;BaaS is a new way to deliver operating systems tailored for mobile and the next generation of devices, sensors and the Internet of Things. &nbsp;BaaS delivers the compute, storage, messaging and other essential OS features, while also bringing together other, potentially distributed resources in a single meaningful system for mobile developers to operate on and provide a meaningful experience for their users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using BaaS, providers can deliver virtualized operating system stacks, for general purposes, much like Windows has served for decades or deliver specialized operating systems meant specifically for telco or healthcare. &nbsp;Imagine virtualized OS stacks that could be delivered to support fixed installations like the energy grid or telco installations, all the way to temporary, high demand situations like disaster recovery or large scale events.
<p>BaaS will allow us to keep much of the potential delivered by a hardened set of resources we become accustomed to with desktop and server OS's, but also realize the agility and flexibility that is delivered by loosely coupled, individual API resources. &nbsp;Allowing for a new approach to app design, development, deployment and life-cycle management that is much more organic and alive.

<hr />

<p>BaaS is an evolution. &nbsp;Its not a revolution, gamer changer or ground breaking new technology. &nbsp;It is a logical response to the demand for mobile applications and how to logically bring together individual API driven resources into a loosely couple stack, that will allow mobile developers to build apps more efficiently.

<hr />

<p>As BaaS evolves, we are seeing the huge investment from numerous start-ups, as well as grabbing the attention of a handful of larger tech companies, but we are also seeing the first signs of major investment in the space. &nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Acquisition of Parse -&nbsp;</strong>Facebook recently acquired on of the top BaaS providers in the space, Parse. &nbsp;While there has been rumors swirling around the tech space for some time, regarding Facebook's desires to manufacture their own mobile device and possibly their own mobile operating system to rival iOS and Android, the Parse acquisition seems a little closer to reality. Facebook's investment in the BaaS space acknowledges that mobile dominance won't always be about device dominance, and the potential of well tuned, meaningful, virtualized stacks of resources for mobile developers. &nbsp;Facebook is looking to invest in mobile and BaaS represents that path forward. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Intel Investment in BaaS -&nbsp;</strong>In the same timeline as the Parse acquisition, &nbsp;BaaS platform FeedHenry announces a 9M investment from Intel Capital--showing more investment in mobile by the chip-maker. &nbsp;Revealing more of the mobile aspirations of Intel, the chip-maker recently announced the acquisition of enterprise mobile service provider Aeopona.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Lucent Mobile Acquisition of Proxomo </strong>-&nbsp;Lucent Mobile, Inc. reached a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Proxomo Software, Inc., a BaaS provider. As part of the transaction, Lucent Mobile, Inc. a private investor-backed company will operate going forward under the Proxomo name.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a small slice of the investment going on in the space. &nbsp;To understand the market opportunity, white papers such as the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/baas.asp">report&nbsp;published</a><span>&nbsp;by&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/">MarketsandMarkets</a><span>.</span> will provide that, but to understand the innovation opportunity, much more experimentation and research needs to occur on exactly what resources current developers are needing to truly be successful.
<p>The research and development environment for the future of API resources will play out within the BaaS industry, through the efforts of small start-ups as well as from the major tech companies.

<hr />

<p>The definition of what is a BaaS provider has not just an evolving meaning, but also means different things to different people. API Evangelist is looking to help define the space, and formulate a way for discovering new providers, while defining the different types of existing providers, potentially establishing a harder definition for BaaS.
<p>When it comes to BaaS there are a handful of clear leaders who are dominating the space. &nbsp;These leading BaaS providers are delivering the features that developers are demanding, while also working define the best of breed services that are leading the space in new directions. &nbsp;
<p>After reviewing the space, monitoring the blogging and tweet volume of each provider, their activity on Github as well as references to them in top blogs like TechCrunch and GigaOM, and discussion about them on Reddit and Hacker News, it is easy to identify the leaders. &nbsp;Because of their own efforts, but also the conversations of analysts and developers, a pattern for BaaS success begins to emerge.

<p>While there are clearly leaders in the BaaS movement, there are 37 other companies working to make their mark on the space and serve the mobile app developer community. Each of these providers have their own approach to delivering their BaaS stack, but many are emulating the successful patterns of the BaaS pioneers.
<p>Some BaaS providers are looking to enable mobile developers to build cross-platform apps on any device in any business sector. &nbsp;While other are looking to serve a niche like gaming or focus exclusively on strengthening the marketing efforts of companies via this fast growing world of consumer devices. &nbsp;

<p>title: ‘What Makes BaaS Relevant to APIs?’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/baas-apis.png</p>

<hr />

<p>Unless you are a BaaS provider or a mobile application developer, the linkage between BaaS and APIs may not be immediately clear. But once you study the space, you quickly notice that APIs are the heart of BaaS, providing platforms with the flexibility and resources they need to meet mobile developers needs.
<p>BaaS and APIs are working together in several ways:
<ul>
<li><strong>Native BaaS APIs </strong>- Each BaaS provider offers up a default set of REST APIs for manipulating core data and object stores, providing programmatical access to almost every part of the BaaS platform</li>
<li><strong>Custom APIs</strong> - Most BaaS providers allow for the design, deployment and configuration of custom REST APIs from data an objects defined via the system. Turning many BaaS platforms into API deployment frameworks, opening up a whole new channel for development</li>
<li><strong>Deploy BaaS Platforms&nbsp;</strong>- The growth in number of APIs resources, coupled with the BaaS movement opens up the opportunity for new providers to step up and deliver BaaS stacks, using their own API resources, bundled 3rd party APIs or a combination of the two.</li>
<li><strong>An API Blueprint</strong> - The patterns that are emerging among BaaS providers provide an excellent blueprint of what types of API resources mobile developers are demanding. &nbsp;Closely watching the BaaS space has potential to provide a blueprint of what API resources are in demand, which aren't and potential opportunities for new API resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>BaaS is a natural progression of APIs from single uses to meaningful stacks of resources for developers. As the number of APIs a developer might use in an app grew from 1 or 2, to potentially 10 separate APIs, the need for aggregation and consolidation of resources grew as well. &nbsp;Mobile app developers don't have time or resources to maintain infrastructure as well as discover, qualify, integrate and maintain relationships with 10 separate API providers. &nbsp;
<p>APIs have helped identify and make available essential resources developers depend on like compute, storage, messaging and authentication, and within the BaaS framework, the next generation of essential API resources are being identified like geo, voice, targeting, friends and virtual commerce. &nbsp;
<p>There is a danger that BaaS will move us back to more rigid, platform approaches to application development, but BaaS has the potential to be a kind elastic glue, that will bring together authentication and other essential resources into a permanent or temporary, but meaningful stack for developers to put to use.

<p>title: ‘What Are The Other Approaches to BaaS Pricing?’</p>

<p>image:</p>

<hr />

<p>API calls and passing on cloud storage costs are the most common ways to approach BaaS pricing. &nbsp;But beyond these two areas, there are numerous other ways BaaS providers are pricing BaaS services for developers.
<p>With mobile app users being the center of the world in mobile app development, it makes a per user charge charge for BaaS services seem logical. A per user fee, potentially couples a BaaS provider monetization strategy with their developers. &nbsp;In this approach a provider may assume their developers will be monetization each end-user of their platform, thus can afford to pay more as they add users.
<p>Other BaaS providers state that charging developers based upon API calls and number of active uses results in a kind of success tax. &nbsp;Meaning the more successful your app is, the more active users and API calls you will have, equally a significantly larger BaaS bill. &nbsp;There is still a lot of open discussion around this point.
<p>BaaS pricing is far from standardized. &nbsp;It is much more a reflection of the IaaS layer beneath the BaaS providers than it is about the end users of the platforms. However there is a lot of experimentation going on in Baas, resulting in numerous other approaches to pricing across 45 BaaS providers.

<hr />

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> doesn't focus on market or investment opportunities. I keep an eye out for product and innovation opportunities, which are a much different beast. These represent places where there are gaps in the delivery of API driven resources that developers will need to deliver the generation of not just apps, but compute.
<p>There are numerous opportunities for innovation within the umbrella that is being defined as BaaS in the areas that are obvious and fast growing in market spaces.
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile -&nbsp;</strong>We are 2-3 years into the solid growth of the mobile smartphone market. &nbsp;This is nothing new. &nbsp;But with the adoption rate, the hype and the potential within emerging markets, we can ignore the opportunity within the mobile sphere. As the demand for mobile apps grow, the demand for efficiencies in mobile app development will grow exponentially. If a business can efficiently go to market with steady flow of high quality apps designed for web, mobile and a wide variety of mobile platforms, it will succeed in the current space</li>
<li><strong>Tablets -&nbsp;</strong>Tablets are displacing the desktop, and even laptop computers. The world of developing apps for mobile is rapidly morphing into a blurry world of hundreds of different devices from iOS to Android. &nbsp;There is a lot of potential for delivering BaaS platforms that focus specifically on the needs of emerging tablet devices across manufacturers</li>
<li><strong>Readers -</strong>Devices are blurring the lines between phone, tablet and dumb terminals. Across the publishing industry, from providers like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Nobles, we are seeing reader devices like the Kindle and Nook. &nbsp;As we see publishing applications like Flipboard and Zite find an audience we will see a growth in demand for backend services that support reader and other consumption focused devices</li>
<li><strong>Niche -&nbsp;</strong>Most BaaS providers are about delivering a general purpose stack of resources, allowing developers to design, develop and deploy apps across any business sector. &nbsp;Among the current pool of BaaS providers there are already the emergence of niche or specialty platforms in the area of gaming, e-commerce and advertising. &nbsp;There is a lot of opportunity to deliver BaaS platforms that deliver specialized area such as education, finance, government or beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Transport -&nbsp;</strong>Technology is penetrating every aspect of our daily lives. Automobiles are becoming a platform for digital deliver, with auto companies like Ford and GM getting into the API game. BaaS is a universal backend platform that can be tailored to any implementation. &nbsp;Our vehicles will have very different requirements if we are a soccer mom or a fleet of delivery vehicles in NYC. Lots of opportunities to understand the world of BaaS in the service of transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Things -&nbsp;</strong>The Internet of Things is the catch all bucket for "everything else" in the world of Internet enabled devices. &nbsp;We put everything from quantified self and 3D printing to smart grid technology into the Internet of Things bucket. &nbsp;This is the biggest, yet to be fully explored opportunity in BaaS. &nbsp;With the special needs of the power grid or public water supply it only makes sense there would be backends dedicated to each sector. &nbsp;This leaves a whole world of opportunity and speculation within the Internet of Things.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to delivering a precise, meaningful backend that drives technology, there will be unlimited opportunities for new platforms. &nbsp;When you view BaaS as a relevant stack of valuable API resources, bundled with a sensible business model, the model can be applied into many business sectors.
<p>Beyond just mobile, tablets, readers and niche opportunity, once the world of Internet of Things expands, the opportunity for BaaS to connect our physical worlds to our virtual worlds will be unlimited.

<hr />

<p>After reviewing the top BaaS providers like Appcelerator, Appery.io Kinvey, Parse and StackMob, a pattern of building blocks begin to emerge. Building blocks that BaaS providers are using to assemble their platforms into meaningful stacks that developers can put to use. &nbsp;While each BaaS provider has their own approach, a handful of common building blocks emerge, allowing a coherent definition of what is a BaaS provider to emerge.
<p>Using this list of common building blocks I looked to find other companies that offer similar backend services, resulting in the discovery of 45 total BaaS providers. After reviewing each BaaS provider, each feature of their offering was entered into a database--uncovering a common blueprint, of which building blocks mobile developers are seeking.
<p>Over 200 building blocks have been identified in over 40 areas, across 45 BaaS providers. 37 building blocks in over 18 areas have been identified as common between at least 3 providers before they are included within my common BaaS blueprint.
<p>This common BaaS blueprint represents one potential blueprint for using APIs, that are just not about consuming single API for a mobile app, but aggregating them to improve the overall delivery, management and life-cycle of mobile applications.

<hr />

<p>The approaches to BaaS pricing are still evolving. &nbsp;Most of the providers have gone with an API call or storage cost approach to pricing, but there still is much debate about just which pricing model is most beneficial to developers and will ensure BaaS providers are profitable.
<p>The struggle in BaaS pricing reflects a struggle between BaaS platform providers covering their costs, while generating a profit for investor,s and the demands of developers who are often needing to start with a freemium tier, but may have radically different needs once their applications are in production, serving potentially hundreds or thousands of users.
<p>Today, you see most BaaS providers pricing reflect the platform in which they are built on. &nbsp;Many of the current BaaS providers operate on Amazon Web Services, so the BaaS pricing is currently reflecting their upfront platform costs, compute and storage.

<p>The mobile app development space has grown into such an opportunity, it has begun to attract the attention of some of the heaviest hitters in the API space, Amazon Web Services, SalesForce and RackSpace.
<p>These tech giants are evolving their approach to delivering the cloud resources so that it better meets the demands of mobile developers, &nbsp;This movement signals the beginning of consolidation in the BaaS space, and the Commoditization of many of the common BaaS building blocks.
<p>While it is a positive for the space that analysts are identifying as a $7.7 billion opportunity by 2017,&nbsp;and that top players like AWS, RackSpace and SalesForce are noticing, it could point to the beginning of the end for many of the start-up BaaS providers.

<h1>Backend as a Service</h1>
<p>There is an emerging trend in mobile application development, that people are calling backend as a service (BaaS), also known sometimes known as mobile backend as a service (MBaaS). With the growth in the number of mobile devices like iPhone from Apple, Android from Google, Windows Phones from Microsoft and the historic contender Blackberry, a number of BaaS providers are emerging to meet the demand for building, deploying and managing the mobile app life-cycle.
<p><strong>What is BaaS?</strong>
<p>BaaS is an approach for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to connect their applications to backend cloud storage and processing while also providing common features such as user management, push notifications, social networking integration, and other features that mobile users demand from their apps these days.
<p>This new breed of BaaS services are provided via custom software development kits (SDK) and application programming interfaces (APIs). BaaS is a relatively recent development in cloud computing, with most BaaS start-ups dating from 2011 or later. The global BaaS market is&nbsp;estimated to grow from $216.5 million in 2012 to $7.7 billion in 2017 from a <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/baas.asp">report&nbsp;published</a> by <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com">MarketsandMarkets</a>.
<p><strong>How Does BaaS Differ From IaaS and PaaS?</strong>
<p>Baas has evolved out of frustration around deployment of IaaS platforms like Amazon Web Services, just to fire up a single new mobile application--accompanied with the fact that the traditional PaaS offerings have not stayed on top of what is needed for mobile developers. BaaS is about abstracting away the complexities of launching and managing your own infrastructure, then bridging a stack of meaningful resources targeting exactly what developers need to build the next generation of mobile apps.
<p>BaaS, has a lot of the same intent as PaaS, to speed up the application development process, but BaaS is purely a backend, providing an infrastructure that automatically scales and optimizes, bundled with a set of essential resources developers require, like content, data, messaging tools and all best 3rd party, API driven services they are used to like Facebook, Twitter and Dropbox. &nbsp;
<p><strong>What Are The Benefits of <strong>BaaS</strong>?</strong>
<p>BaaS is all about making developers lives easier. BaaS is born out of a shortage of mobile developer talent and an overwhelming demand for high quality mobile apps, not just on iOS, but across Android, Windows and Blackberry devices. &nbsp;
<p>BaaS Delivers:

<li><strong>Efficiency Gains</strong> - Reducing overhead in all aspects of mobile app development, increasing efficiency at all stages of development</li>
<li><strong>Faster Times to Market </strong>- Reducing the obstacles to take a mobile app from idea to production and overhead with operations once in production</li>
<li><strong>App Delivery With Fewer Resources</strong> - BaaS supports development with fewer developers and supporting data and IT resources</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for Mobile and Tablets</strong> - BaaS providers have put a lot of time and resources into optimization of data and network for mobile apps, and reduce fragmentation problems across multiple platforms and devices.</li>
<li><strong>Secure and Scalable Infrastructure </strong>- BaaS provides a bundled infrastructure that deals with scalability, security, performance and other operational headaches, leaving developers to do what they do best</li>
<li><strong>Stack of Common API resources</strong> - BaaS brings common and essential 3rd party API resources into a single stack, preventing developers from having to go gather them separately</li>
</ul>
<p>BaaS tends to reflect what is consider to be a no-ops development environment that allows companies and developers focus just on building the best applications with the most unique feature set. &nbsp;All of the infrastructure deployment and management that is historically associated with developing applications is abstracted away into a single backend platform.
<p><strong>What Can You Build With BaaS?</strong>
<p>While BaaS is primarily focused on mobile application development, the approach has characteristics that can easily be used across multiple areas of development:
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Development</strong> - While BaaS is focused on mobile application development, it provides a much more flexible approach to development web applications. It provides all the opportunity of PaaS, with less interface restrictions, just a meaningful stack of resources to build &nbsp;variety of web apps.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Apps</strong> - BaaS is designed with developing mobile apps in mind. &nbsp;BaaS providers are focusing on optimizing data for mobile, bringing together essential resources like geo-location, social, places and other critical elements of mobile apps.</li>
<li><strong>Readers -</strong> Publishing to Kindle and other devices that are intended to support the world of book and magazine publishing. &nbsp;Devices like Kindle, Nook and other healthcare or education specific devices are emerging and being driven by BaaS</li>
<li><strong>Launch APIs </strong>- BaaS platforms provide easy to deploy API frameworks as part of their data and object stores. BaaS provides a quick way to launch APIs and other infrastructure around data and resources, potentially making it available to mobile or web developers</li>
</ul>
<p>What is possible with BaaS varies depending on the platform provider, but we are starting to see some common building blocks emerge from the 40+ BaaS providers on the landscape currently.
<p>BaaS is a natural response to software development being moved into the cloud, and the decoupling of common resources into individual APIs. &nbsp;In 2013 we know we need our platforms to perform and scale in the cloud, while bringing the resources we depend on into meaningful sets that we can efficiently build apps around, without having to go gather them from around the web.

<p>title: ‘What Does The API Evangelist Do?’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/kin-lane-in-api-we-trust.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/kin-lane/kin-lane-in-api-we-trust.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I sent three emails this morning to people, explaining what it is that I do and how they can get involved. This process reminded me that I need to do the same here via the blog on a regular basis, to help people understand what API Evangelist is, and my vision for it. &nbsp;
<p>Despite popular belief I do not evangelize any single API to developers, my role (self-appointed) is to evangelize <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> APIs to the masses, most importantly beyond the developer community--penetrating business, marketing and other key groups.
<p>At API Evangelist I monitor the entire API space. To do this I track on 2000 of the best of the APIs out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've gone through the entire <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb Directory</a> and hand pick the ones that are worth paying attention to, and I continue doing this in real-time as they are added. Its not that the rest aren't worthy of use, just not an approach I feel is worth showcasing to other API owners.
<p>700+ of these APIs have blogs, 1000+ have Twitter accounts and many have Github accounts. I monitor all in real time. I also track on 250+ blog feeds from mainstream tech blogs (TC, Gigaom, etc) as well as lesser known feeds. &nbsp;
<p>I watch all this in real-time and tag everything using a centralized system I've developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I derive my blog posts and generate what I call my&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/"><span class="s1">API Stack</span></a>. The API Stack isn't meant to be a definitive list of who are the best, in a single order, but a living stack of which APIs are worth paying attention to, and are doing innovative things on a week to week basis.
<p>I generate The API Stack using my home grown ranking system which is based upon 3 types of signals:&nbsp;
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;- Number of blog posts, tweets, github repos and other internal activity from the APIs themselves</li>
<li><strong>External -</strong>&nbsp;@mentions of twitter, stack exchange, hacker news, tech blogosopher, github repo follwers and activity</li>
<li><strong>Analsyst -</strong>&nbsp;My curation, flagging w/ notes, voting up and writing stories about an API or company</li>
</ul>
<p>From all of this weekly process I have carved several areas I focus deeper on:
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="95%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p><strong>API Service Providers</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">

</ul>
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
<p>These areas will evolve and grow as my research continues and the space changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;From all of this research I produce short form analysis (blog posts, project sites) and long form content (whitepapers, books).&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep things simple I provide a single standard monthly subscription to partners wishing to access of all this for $1500.00 / month.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li class="li4"><strong>Writing&nbsp;</strong>- Access to all of my long form content.&nbsp;&nbsp;White papers, research, etc.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Data</strong>&nbsp;- I generate a lot of data exhaust tracking, ranking and curating the API space.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have JSON data available across all aspects of my work.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Logo</strong>&nbsp;- Placement of maximum 250px width logo on right hand menu of API Evangelist properties.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>4 Consulting Hours</strong>&nbsp;- Four hours of conversation via phone, skype or hangout each month.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Keywords</strong>&nbsp;- Your company name plus one other keyword or key phrase of choice which will link to URL of your choice.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Weekly / Monthly Summary -</strong>&nbsp;I produce a weekly and monthly summary of the top APIs and industries, with curated news and my analysis from the API industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>This monthly subscription provides access to all research, data and writing I produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm willing to negotiate other relationships, but this helps me keep a nice pool of clients, and me knowing I'll be in operation next month.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps me focused on research and not chasing new customers all the time.
<p>Sometimes I also do specific industry research looking for patterns and opportunities as well going deeper by targeting specific APIs, like Twitter or Twillio, but I try to keep targeted research feeding into my overall pool of industry data, providing value to the bigger picture and overall space.
<p>Hope this helps you understand what it is I do, and if you'd like to get involved, feel free to reach out.

<p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p>I am tracking on 2000 APIs that I have deemed worthy enough to pay attention, out of the 9000 on <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, 13,000 in <a href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and numerous APIs in <a href="http://mashape.com">Mashape's marketplace</a>.  In addition to these APIs, I'm also closely watching <a title="backend as a service providers" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">30+ backend as a service providers</a>, <a title="reciprocity providers" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">20+ reciprocity providers</a> and emerging big data, analysis, visualization and other emerging platforms who are using APIs in new ways.
<p>I was reading some of the great research coming out of <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>, which is a "Open-Source, Web-Based, Framework for Integrating Applications with Cloud-based Services and Personal Cloudlets"--specifically the post on <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/openi-api-framework-part-i-studying-the-landscape-of-cloud-based-services/">OpenI API Framework: Studying the Landscape of Cloud-Based Services</a>.
<p>What is great about OPENi, is they are doing all this research and planning, and sharing the process with everyone publicly.  Which is great for everyone, but will take some time to play out, as they study, plan and execute in the space.
<p>As I watch aggregate API providers like <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> plow forward and reciprocity providers like <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> deliver some amazing integrations, using APIs, and bridging some of the most meaningful cloud platforms in our world--I can't help but think about how much redundant work is going on amongst startups.
<p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/openi-api-framework-part-i-studying-the-landscape-of-cloud-based-services/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/baas/openi/OPENi-Blog-API1.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>When it comes to the definitions of specific APIs, the nuances of their interface and authentication, each of these service providers is doing their own work, in a silo. In a perfect world, API providers would provide Swagger definitions, standard oAuth implementations, etc.  API owners would do a lot of the legwork for these providers. &nbsp;As we know, this isn't the reality, and each of these aggegrators, reciprocity providers, analytics tools are all mapping these API connections on their own.
<p>I can't help but think about, how if providers stepped up, communicated with each other, they could establish some sort of commons for all of these API definitions to reside. &nbsp;They could colloaborately develop a way they could identify the meaningful APIs, hang Swagger definitions and code for connecting and authenticating in a multitude of programming languages.
<p>Each provider could still maintain their secret sauce, what happens before and after each API connection, allowing them to have their own unique approach to API aggregation, reciprocity, analysis, visualization or real-time tools. But by sharing the API definitions and working together on the connections, they could spend more time on what makes their companies unique, rather than hand-rolling each API connection in isolation.
<p>Just some random thoughts, as I navigate the world of APIs, from within my own silo!

<p>Hey everyone.  I'm heading out to the Dallas-Fort Worth area the week after next, Tuesday, May 14, to kick off the <a title="DFW API Professional Meetup Group" href="https://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/">DFW API Professionals Meetup</a>.
<p><a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://therightapi.com">TheRightAPI</a>&nbsp;team were so kind to invite me out to speak, hang out and talk APIs, to help kick-off the area API group. Both&nbsp;<a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://therightapi.com">TheRightAPI</a>&nbsp;and backend as a service (BaaS) provider <a href="http://www.proxomo.com/">Proxomo</a> are sponsoring the shindig.
<p>The group will be meeting at the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=7000+Texas+161%2C+Irving%2C+TX">Microsoft Campus, 7000 Texas 161, Irving, TX</a>.  We are thinking we'll kick it off with food and drinks from 6:00 - 6:45 PM, and I'll start talking around 7:00 PM.
<p>After that we can just hang out and talk about APIs and see what all y'all are doing with APIs in Texas.  Ping me if your in the DFW area, so that I know you will be there.
<p>Look forward to seeing you there and connecting.

<p>title: ‘How Much Do You Spend Attracting and Supporting Freemium API Developers?’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/freemium-customers.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/freemium-customers.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I had a question from an API owner land in my inbox.  It is regarding the amount of attention and resources that should be spent on on-boarding new customers.  Directly from the email:
<blockquote><em>How would you suggest companies place a quantifiable value on free API users?  I know that it is very important to have a lot of people use your API so that they can make great things with your API and also give people a chance to really understand the value of what the API offers, but do you have any thoughts on how companies should decide how much to spend on an API conversion (AdWords, Hackathons, etc.)</em></blockquote>
<p>Let's first address the freemium part of the question.  It is my opinion that every API should have a freemium layer.  But only as one part of a well planned developer incentive ladder.  This freemium tier is the top layer of your funnel.  It will provide a way for people to test drive your API, understand what it does and the value it can deliver in their world.
<p>Your freemium layer should be easy to access, no billing required and provide a sensible access to your API resources--also your freemium tier should never appear as if it is in danger of going away. &nbsp;But freemium should be that first step, with clear, meaningful next steps towards on-boarding users as paid customers.  Provide clear paths to becoming a solid, revenue generating and contributing participant in the platform.
<p>Make it clear to developers that at a freemium level they don't get support, that they have to pay to get that.  Don't let this tier of users dominate you.  With this said you better have good docs, code samples, active forum, FAQ and other essential building blocks for your self-service, freemium customers to use.  But the amount of resources dedicated to your freemium customers should be minimal.
<p>In my opinion, your resources should go into supporting your paid tiers of customers, the one who fee your revenue model, communicate and provide feedback to your platform and deliver value to your platform and business--reciprocating the value you have provided them.  API ecosystems are a two-way street.
<p>The second part of the question I think is regarding how much resources you should spend to attract developers into the top part of your funnel, potentially bringing them into your freemium tier, with hopes of quickly converting them into paid.  I have a different perspective on this than probably many other companies.  I'm a fan of organic campaigns vs. paid campaigns.
<p>My approach to API Evangelism is about generating organic content that will help explain what an API does and the value it delivers.  I hack PHP, Python, Ruby or mobile projects against the API. I find problems to solve, that may reflect what my target audience is trying to solve.  I just don't think very many people are ever going to look for an API. They are going to be looking for a solution to their problem, and it may just be the solution your API provides.  So advertising and traditional marketing is harder to dial in.  I prefer identifying, coding, solving the problem and telling the story that speak to the customers I'm looking for.
<p>The downside of an organic API evangelism campaign is it takes time to work.  It takes months before you see anything. It is a very SEO driven approach, but it is how I've built API Evangelist over 3 years.  Its lower cost than Google Adwords spend and hackathons, but takes someone with passion and domain expertise, mad programming skills and the ability to write stories, publish to Github and work social media like kung foo master--to execute!
<p>The moral of the story is, that you should spend as little as you possibly can on bringing in developers into your funnel, and supporting them in operating at your freemium tier.  Don't let the freeloaders rule your world.  But this is easier said than done.  Its a lot of work to generate resources that will bring the right customer in the door, in an organic way, and it <a href="/2012/09/18/simple-api-developer-tracking-framework/">takes a lot of outreach to engage with the customers</a> you have in the door to develop a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">sensible developer and partner framework</a>.
<p>I think I have several more stories to derive from this great question, so stay tuned.

<p><a href="https://parse.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/baas/parse-cloud.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I don't personally use <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a> or any other <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">backend as a service</a> (BaaS) provider to build mobile applications.  I'm just playing role as analyst when it comes to the backend as a service space, but I am a developer so I can tell when any technology provider is speaking to developers or just marketing and hock'n their wares.
<p>Each week I monitor the tech blogosphere, the API space and where it has expanded into the backend as a service space and driving mobile development.  I pull 300 + feeds from random blogs and 700+ feeds from APIs providers.  I see the contrast between what Techrunch, GigaOm and NextWeb produce alongside what API and BaaS providers publish to their blogs.
<p>Day after day you can really start smelling the bullshit. The positive side is that this high profile bullshit really makes good quality posts, that are actually about solving problems, stand out.
<p>I see a lot of posts come out of BaaS providers, and day after day, Parse is producing high quality posts, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/04/29/versioning-and-verification-for-your-aws-security-group-configuration/">Versioning and Verification for your AWS Security Group Configuration</a> and <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/04/09/six-creative-ways-to-use-push-notification-marketing-in-your-mobile-app/">Six Creative Ways to Use Push Notification Marketing in Your Mobile App</a>.  When you read their blog, it is mostly posts that are about solving problems that developers are facing, and goes beyond just using Parse.
<p>There are a number of reasons Parse was an attractive investment for Facebook, but I think the Parse blog is a very positive signal that Parse is more than just about building a company for acquisition--Parse is building a platform that solves developers problems. Another important aspect of this, is they tell the story of how they do this in real-time. &nbsp;Without telling the story, you can be doing some amazing things and nobody will know about it--Parse gets this.
<p>Another sign of Parse's conviction, is the blog post rhythm hasn't changed since the acquisition of Facebook. I get the feeling that I will continue showcasing Parse's approach, much like I have done with Twilio, because they just get it.

<p>Listening to an episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a> yesterday, renewed a concept that John Sheehan(<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), founder of <a title="Runscope" href="https://www.runscope.com/signin?next=%2F">Runscope</a> made in an <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/03/12/apis-are-dead-long-live-apis/?fromcat=all">article he wrote for NextWeb back in March</a>. In the post, John walks us through his &ldquo;Three Commandments for Using Someone Else&rsquo;s API&rdquo;, which, after listening to him talk about his story on <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/post/46485798823/episode-8-im-going-to-withdraw-my-objection">Episode 8 of Traffic and Weather</a>, I couldn't stop thinking about commandment #2:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>An open API is a great way to test drive an integration, but it does not absolve you from the responsibility of building a relationship with the provider. If you can&rsquo;t reach someone, that should be all the reason you need not to use that API.
<p>This commandment comes out of Johns unique experience which spans:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twilio - Experience managing large, successful developer ecosystem</li>
<li>IFTTT - Experience being consumer of not just one, but many APIs</li>
<li>Runscope - Providing tools that make API developers lives easier</li>
</ul>
<p>This experiences is what make John&rsquo;s perspective unique.  He doesn&rsquo;t just understand delivering APIs and managing developers, he knows what it is like to be a developer and consumer of APIs.  Which I think makes him either just the right balance or he&rsquo;s his own worst enemy, not sure--could be both.
<p>Anyways, regarding John&rsquo;s commandment: <em>Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person</em>.  In the past I have put a lot of pressure on API providers to consider <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">different potential layers of their API ecosystem</a>, and work hard to have a consistent approach to communicating, supporting and engaging with your developer ecosystem.  While this all holds true, and API owners should focus on healthy developer outreach, it is a two sided coin, in which developers are accountable too.
<p>The target audience for API Evangelist is API owners, so I guess my point is that as an API owner you have to craft a healthy communication and support framework, but also explain to developers when they sign up or are getting started, that while you&rsquo;ll work to support them, it is up to them to step up and meet you halfway.
<p>In the hype fueled tech blogosphere it's easy to take sides, rather than actually discuss the nuances of API ecosystems, and give sustainable advice--something that only comes from domain experts like John Sheehan.

<p>Have you taken a moment and looked at the APIs AT&amp;T is offering through their <a href="https://developer.att.com/">developer program</a> lately? I think it is an interesting spread of API resources for a leading telco to offer, and is very telling about their strategy.
<p>This is one thing I like about my API monitoring platform, is that I'm forced to dive deeper into companies that are ubiquitous in the space, and make sure I'm kep in tune with where they are actually going.
<p>I thought <a href="https://developer.att.com/developer/basicTemplate.jsp?passedItemId=12500043">AT&amp;T's API catalog</a> was interesting in its current state:

</table>
<p>Some of the APIs they offer are pretty straightforward like MMS, SMS, Location and Speech. &nbsp;But the TV, Healthcare, Notary and even advertising seem like they are from a different planet. Which is a signal in itself I think.
<p>AT&amp;T pops up on my radar a lot because of their presence at hackathons, and coverage in the blogosphere. &nbsp;I'd like to make more time to dissect AT&amp;T's approach to APIs from an outside perspective. I think there is a lot to learn from their strategy, both good and bad. &nbsp;
<p>Stay tuned...

<p>title: ‘API Priorities’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/priorities.png</p>

<hr />

<p>I spend a lot of time on API Evangelist getting excited about APIs.  Going on three years doing this, I'm getting a little more hardened in my view on what is "good" in the API space.  Along with that evolution, I'm getting my priorities in order.
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/att/priorities.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>While I may get excited about cloud computing APIs or quantified self APIs, there are other areas I think are straight up priorities--ones that we can't ignore.  To support this I'm launching several research projects into areas I have labeled as API priorities:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Federal Government" href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Federal Government</a></li>
<li><a title="City Government APIs" href="http://city-government.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">City Government</a></li>
<li><a title="Education APIs" href="http://education.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Education</a></li>
<li><a title="Library APIs" href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Healthcare</a></li>
<li><a title="Library APIs" href="http://libraries.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Libraries</a></li>
<li><a title="University APis" href="http://university.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Universities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These represent areas I'm actively doing research in, looking for the best APIs, tools, services, building blocks and news while also generating as much analysis and white papers as I can to help define what is going on.
<p>As with all of the API Evangelist network of research projects, everything is a work in progress and represents what I have time to dive into.  If you see anything missing, or feel some priority areas are not represented, let me know.

<p>title: ‘Helping People Understand APIs Through Real World Examples’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/commercial-fueling-network.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.cfnnet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/commercial-fueling-network/commercial-fueling-network.jpg" alt="" width="170" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm always looking for easy, dead simple approaches to explaining APIs to people.  Having real world examples, that folks can relate with, go along way in helping people wrap their heads around the very abstract concepts that are APIs.
<p>While going for a walk today I was thinking back when I use to build technology for my parents trucking company, when one of the fuel expenses was for <a href="http://www.cfnnet.com/" target="_blank">Commercial Fueling Network</a> (CFN), which is a self-service commercial fueling station.
<p>Whether your a long haul trucker or local contractor, you can use CFN to get at an essential resource for your business, whatever the application. Any business can apply and join CFN, get a "key" to access fuel resources in a self-service way.
<p>APIs are the same approach to selling any "virtual" online resource, as CFN is to selling a "physical" fuel resource. CFN doesn't just put free gas alongside the road for anyone to take.  They have a portal where you know to go to get your resources, providing you with a key to access the fuel resources you need.  CFN then bills you for the usage of their resource.  You can be sure CFN has extensive data on how much fuel they sell and who it was sold to.
<p>With virtual resources, whether you are a iPhone developer or website developer you can use APIs to get at essential resources you will need for your business, whatever the type of applications you are developing. &nbsp;Any developer can apply to use an API, and get a "key" to access the resources in a self-service way.
<p>The best part about the online approach is you can turn ANYTHING into a resource.  Your resource can be data in a database, specialized code you've developed or interact with anything in the physical world.
<p>This example works well for helping people to understand how APIs work, by using a real world example they may have experience with.  The best thing is, you can continue evolving this example by talking about the payment APIs used to process credit cards while fueling or the usage of APIs to interface with accounting or other administrative systems for businesses who use CFN.
<p>I'm adding this to my list of white papers and see if I can create a more polished version of it.

<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/services/universe-expansion.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>As the universe of APIs expands, I&rsquo;m working to find new ways that I can discover, educate myself, then organize information around the most meaningful areas in the API space.  As part of this effort I&rsquo;m reorganizing <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> site into a network of small story groups, so that I can focus on a specific piece of this expanding API universe.
<p>Each portion of API Evangelist will run using what I call my <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com" target="_blank">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, where I use Github Page, Jekyll along with a variety of JSON driven widgets that tell a story around a specific topic.
<p>The first story group I&rsquo;m tackling is redefining two of my main sections which I had called <em>&ldquo;service provider&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;tools&rdquo;</em>. My original intent was to find resources people could use to deploy APIs, and if it was an online service I put it in service providers and if you could download and install, it went under tools.
<p>I&rsquo;m abandoning this approach and dismantling these sections and breaking them into goal oriented stories:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Design</a></li>
<li><a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Deployment</a></li>
<li><a title="API Managemet" href="http://management.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Management</a></li>
<li>Evangelism</li>
<li>Monetization</li>
<li><a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Discovery</a></li>
<li>Consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't have evangelism, monetization or consumption ready to go yet, but design, deployment, management and discovery are coming together nicely. You will be able to get at news, analysis, services and tools within these areas, as well as some overall thoughts about each area of the API universe.
<p>I'm doing this to help me focus on each aspect of the API space, allowing me to see just the news and the best of the companies who are active in that area. This approach really helps me curate and write very focused stories and white papers that serve each topic. I hope it offers similar value for you.
<p>My objective is to allow people to find information from two main areas, either using APIs or providing APIs. You can then navigate to individual areas within those two goal areas, with some overlap between them. In addition to toolkits for using or providing APIs, I'm also rolling out other story groups in the areas of API trends, priorities and opportunities.
<p>So stay tuned&hellip;<a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> is always a living research project.

<p>It is has been a while since I updated any of my research around APIs &amp; the Federal Government.  In May 2012, I started monitoring the progress of the White House Digital Strategy, where I setup a <a href="/federal_government.php">monitoring system that pings all 246 agencies</a> to see if they have published their digital strategy yet.
<p>As we approach the one year anniversary, I expect we'll see a lot more news emerge around what various agencies are doing as part of the original mandate by the White House.  As of today there are now 23 federal agencies who have published their Digital Strategy at their domain.
<p>I have published <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">all of my research around my APIs &amp; the Federal Government research at a permanent Github repository</a>.  I will continue pushing all my research, curated stories and analysis there in real-time.  I have also published a handful of JSON data sets I have generated as part of the research:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-with-social.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Social</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-digital-strategy.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-digital-strategy-with-social.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy &amp; Social</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the JSON data for these areas, along with the PHP script I used to harvest, store and publish this data using the JSON version of each agencies Digital Strategy.
<p>While you can pull a list of federal agencies via <span>from the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Agency Directory API</a><span>, and each agencies social data using the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Social Media Registry API</a>, the logos included with each agency is something I hand-rolled, so you won't find it anywhere other than here. &nbsp;I gave the data to the GSA, and I hope they incorporate the agency logos into the Federal Agency Directory API.
<p>My <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">Federal Government Github project</a> will be a permanent, living place for me to publish stories, news, data and the scripts I create around my research in the area.  I'm using my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format to keep everything up to date, openly licensed, while also keeping everything machine readable by default.
<p>I'm categorizing this project under "API Priorities".  It is a critical area that we need as many people involved as possible.  If you need an idea for a project, let me know.  I have endless ideas to suggest on how we can evolve our government using open data and APIs.

<p>There was a lot of buzz in the API space over the last two weeks.  I'm not a big on being first with news from the world of APIs, I leave this approach to the tech blogs like Techcrunch, RWW, GigaOm, The Next Web and others.  I'd rather simmer on things for a bit, think beyond the press release, and craft a post that offers value beyond the initial announcement and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churnalism">churnalism</a>.
<p>To get everyone up to speed,  four major things happened in the API space over the last two weeks:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/04/17/intel-acquires-mashery">Intel Buys Mashery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ca.com/us/content/Integration/Layer-7-Technologies.aspx">Computer Associates Buys Layer 7 Technologies</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2013/04/23/programmableweb-joins-mulesoft/">MuleSoft Acquires ProgrammableWeb</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.3scale.net/2013/04/thank-you-to-investors-and-customers/">3Scale gets $4.2M in Funding</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no arguing that these are some pretty significant signs the API industry is picking up the pace, especially when you have companies like Intel and Computer Associates taking notice and making investments.  I've been tracking on the space for 3 years now, with round-ups of API service providers in <a title="API Service Providers 2011" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">2011</a> and <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">2012</a>. For 2010, 2011 it was all an uphill battle, but in 2012 I started seeing things heat up with the <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">introduction of several new API service providers</a>,&nbsp;then really stepping up in November 2012 with the <a href="/2012/11/13/axway-acquires-api-management-service-provider-vordel/">acquisition of Vordel by Axway</a>. But, the last couple of weeks are pretty outstanding, with not just acquisition of two separate API service providers, but also the fact that one of them is API pioneer Mashery, being purchased by chipmaker Intel.  Love or hate Mashery, they help define the space and have been at it a while a while, and we all have an industry, partly due to their work.
<h3>VC Cycles More Than API Cycles</h3>
<p>Personally I feel the recent acquisitions are indeed positive signals for the industry, but I think they are also just part of the natural cycle that is set in motion by the types of businesses, companies like Mashery and Layer 7 are looking to build. These are companies that are designed for an exit, an with Mashery raising almost $40M, after multiple rounds, as well as Layer7 at $20M, with just a handful of rounds.  I don't do predictions, but I would say that Apigee is next with their $70M, in a Series E round.  Any takers IBM?  AT&amp;T? Oracle? &nbsp;The signals are more that these companies are ripe for picking, than it is a sign that the API space is booming.
<h3>The Enterprise Opportunity</h3>
<p>The acquisitions of&nbsp;Vordel, Mashery and Layer7 tell me that the enterprise is interested in APIs, whether it is for mobile, big data or the internet of things--the enterprise wants in. Duh?  That really isn't much of a signal. It is logical, and if you are building an API service provider company, that is looking for an exit, you are going to build your company so that it appeals to the enterprise. It isn't really API business, it is just business. I know that this is what many of you focus on as "being the opportunity", but in the end it is just short-sighted and doesn't reflect the real potential of APIs.
<h3>The API Opportunity</h3>
<p>The real opportunity in the API space is about making sure that <strong>EVERYONE</strong> can design, develop, manage, discover and consume APIs, allowing them to significantly change their company or the industry they exit in.  This is why ProgrammableWeb (PW) finding a new home at MulSsoft, and the $4.2M in funding by 3Scale excites me more than the acquisitions of Mashery or Layer 7.
<p>First, ProgrammableWeb is the grandfather of API discovery, it's history and future are important to how we market our APIs as well as discover APIs for consumption, two sides of a very important coin. &nbsp;So it is critical that PW remain live and being a vibrant piece of the API industry, something I believe that MuleSoft can deliver on, in a way that makes sure PW has a signficant a role in the future of API discovery. Alcatel-Lucent was completely abandoning their API efforts and it would have been a huge blow to the space if PW went down the toilet with Alcatel-Lucent's self-destructive vision of the future.
<h3>Why The 3Scale Investment is Important</h3>
<p>I know all my haters will laugh, but I think the meager $4.2M investment made in 3Scale, is truly a positive sign for the API space.  3Scale isn't building an API service provider company for an exit.  3Scale has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only freemium API service provider in the space since the beginning</span>.  Over the last 3 years, I've had multiple arguments with people across the space that the API opportunity for APIs is about unlocking enterprise resources with APIs, when in reality I feel the true API opportunity is about making sure every single business, organization and government entity understands APIs, stands one up, manages, iterates and evolves it until they get it right, without spending a fortune and being locked into contracts that are ultimately about boosting the numbers of a company intent on their exit.  3Scale has been doing this for years, and the $4.2M is just enough to grow and scale to the next logical and sustainable level.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-craft/API-Craft-SFO-July-2012.png" alt="" width="335" align="right" />
<p>I know the 3Scale approach it is not the sexy "startup way" or the "big numbers" that the TechCrunch and Silicon Valley audience loves, but to me it is a healthy way to approach what the API space truly needs. &nbsp;3Scale's approach to running their business, and helping people stand up and manage their APIs is a realistic, healthy and sustainable way that API owners, developers and the overall space really needs.  3Scale is profitable and sought a sensible next round of funding to do more of what they are already doing. They aren't brining in customers to boost numbers or strictly pandering to the enterprise, ultimately seeking an exit over delivering a quality product.  3Scale focuses on delivering the resources, tools and services that people need to understand and successfully manage their APIs. The sign that 3Scale can get the funding they need to keep moving forward, shows the space has a healthy edge.
<h3>Meaningful Services, Tools and Educational Resources</h3>
<p>Successful acquisitions of API service providers, by large enterprises, will not define the API space as "healthy". To deliver on the OG API vision, we will need a wealth of API resources, tools and services that make APIs accessible to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYONE</span></strong>.  There will be lots of money to be made when every individual company, organization or government organization can stand-up, run and iterate and find success with APIs for whatever their personal objectives or monetization goals are.
<p>There is opportunity in the API space! &nbsp;This is demonstrated by the buzz in the last couple weeks.  But lets not get distracted by the opportunity to make money and selling to the enterprise. Let's focus on the opportunity that APIs afford individuals, companies, organizations and our government, and the impact APIs can make on the end-users or customers these companies sell to, or are in service of.
<p>Ubiquitous API knowledge, tools and resources represent a much bigger opportunity for everyone, beyond the big money deals that seem to catch the headlines and dominate our attention.
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale and Intel are both API Evangelist partners. &nbsp;Although I have never actually taken money from 3Scale. &nbsp;Maybe things are different now that they have the big bucks!! :-)

<p>title: ‘From CPU to API for Intel’</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://intel.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/intel/Intel-logo.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>
<p><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/04/17/intel-acquires-mashery">Intel is reportedly buying API service provider Mashery for &ldquo;a range of $120 million to $180 million&rdquo;</a>, according to ReadWrite(Web). As I reflect on this, two main questions come to mind:
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Was it a smart acquisition for Intel, and worth their money?</li>
<li>Is this a logical move for Intel since they are a chip maker?</li>
</ol>
<p>Was Intel&rsquo;s acquisition smart for Intel?  If they are serious about playing in the API game, which all signals I&rsquo;ve seen say yes, I think it was smart.  They didn&rsquo;t buy Mashery for their tech, although their tech was a nice add-on to <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/">Intel's existing API Gateway</a>.&nbsp;They bought Mashery to buy their market share.
<p>Is the acquisition worth 120-180M?  I&rsquo;m not sure about that.  I don&rsquo;t think Masherys current market share is worth all that, so I think this is an investment in the past and the future more than current market share.  Mashery is the pioneer of the API space, owning that history has value, if you can deliver on the future of the API space.  Which I think Intel is more capable of than Mashery was all by itself.
<p>Next is this a logical move for Intel?  They are maker of physical things like  motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphic chips, embedded processors, not of things virtual like APIs.
<p>Intel is known for making the thing essential ingredients &ldquo;inside&rdquo; our PCs, laptops, servers, smart phones and digital devices.  They have been the driving force of &ldquo;compute&rdquo; for the last 40 years, basically my entire life.  I&rsquo;ve heard lots of chatter today that Intel moving from building the physical ingredients, to virtual APIs is too big of a switch for Intel, and they will fail.
<p><a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/intel/intel-Expressway-Service-Gateway-Whiteboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>Obviously I don&rsquo;t know shit about chip manufacturing, but if Intel wants to be the leader in the next 40 years of computing, moving from central processing units (CPU) to distributed processing units (DPU) makes sense.  In the past they have provided the computer, memory, graphics, networking and other essential elements we needed for personal, server or mobile computing.  While these elements are still relevant at the physical level, compute has moved into the clouds and when it comes to the components or resources we will need to deliver the next generation of laptop, tablet, mobile, server, automobile or anything in the realm of Internet of Things, you will need hardened and secure API compute resources.
<p>Intel will not be building and deploying APIs for fun and games on the Internet.  Intel will be the gateway of the essential resources that are driving our mobile apps like SMS, voice, video encoding, etc, all the way to vital healthcare, climate monitoring and military grade API resources that will drive everything from the private sector to governments and NGOs worldwide.
<p>I feel the Intel vision of APIs won&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t apply to all aspects of web APIs, open data, and various aspects of the open web. But I think Intel has what it takes to deliver the hardened and secure compute resources we are going to need to drive the next 40 years of web enabled technology.
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Intel is a partner of API Evangelist and Mashery has never been a partner of API Evangelist. :-)

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/person-building-blocks.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>On a regular basis I review my API consumption to evaluate how I&rsquo;m using various APIs, and what I&rsquo;m paying for them.   <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">I depend on around 20 APIs to make API Evangelist work</a>, and I need to make sure I&rsquo;m using them to their fullest potential while also being mindful of budget.
<p>As a part of my regular review, I am looking at the differences in pricing between three key services:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/developer/">FullContact API</a> -</strong> I use FullContact for all my company and individual contact intelligence.  I go through phases of light or heavy use depending on research projects I have going on.  Full Contact provides me with per API call rates depending on the endpoint and call volume, and they limit me between four packages Trying It out (Free), Getting Started ($19/month), Gaining Traction ($99/month) and Rolling ($499/month)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">Alchemy API</a> -</strong> I use Alchemy API to primarily pull text content from blog posts, so I can use it internally for indexing.  With Alchemy I get access to three packages Free, Small Business ($250.00) and Basic ($800.00)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS APIs</a> -</strong> I use AWS for all my computer, storage, database and DNS API services.  With AWS I pay by the resource, bandwidth transfer and storage and the other parts and pieces or specific actions in cloud computing.  There are no packages, just modular API resources I use and get billed for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m just one use case, but figured I&rsquo;d share my thoughts on how I use these three API resources within my little world.
<p>For Full Contact the jump from $19/month to $99/month isn&rsquo;t too bad.  I&rsquo;ll lump all my processing together into a single month and get lots of work done.  So I tend to toggle each month between these two tiers based upon my needs.
<p>For Alchemy API I operate within the free tier and stick with the rate limit of 1,000 API calls per day.  If a blog post doesn&rsquo;t get pulled because I hit my limit, I queue it for another day when I have room within my daily limit.   The jump from zero to $250.00 / month is really just too big of a jump for me to make.
<p>My Amazon Web Services bill runs between $250.00 and $1,000.00 / month.  Depending on how much traffic, harvesting, processing and other crazy stuff I&rsquo;m doing.  I have a buffet of compute, storage, database, IP address, monitoring,DNS and other cloud computing modules that I have developed and associated with pricing in my head, so that I can make decisions in the moment about whether I can afford to process a bunch of data, launch new API, website etc.
<p>I have a few good friends in the API space that feel API rate limits stimulate creativity, innovation and work-arounds.  I agree with that statement, and think every API has to understand its own consumer and make the decision they feel is best.  But in the end, I personally like single API resource pricing based upon units, that I can scale infinitely as needed in any moment.  I&rsquo;m am more likely to integrate services into my world when they are independent bite size chunks, with pricing not restricted by other services or service tiers.  Each module tends to have different value in my world and I like to make independent decisions about how to use just that resource, disconnected from all the other resources.
<p>The world is starting to look different when I depend on 10-20 APIs vs 1-2 APIs, and I can imagine when I reach the point where I'm depending on 100-200 APIs I will have an even greater need to have API resources be priced independent of other services or limiting pricing tiers. &nbsp;

<p>title: ‘Conflicting Emotions About API Providers’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/conflict-with-myself.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/conflict-with-myself.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m a walking conflict most of the time.  You should try being me, it can be tense about 40% of the time.   I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of example of what I mean to help bring you a little closer to what I experience each day.
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with what I consider to be the 2nd most important API of all time (#1 being AWS), Twitter.  I love / hate Twitter.  They really deliver on everything around their API except in regards to:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong> - Their rate limits suck!</li>
<li><strong>Competition</strong> - They don&rsquo;t approach potential competition sensibly</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - They aren&rsquo;t good communicators</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than those three <em>"simple areas"</em>, Twitter delivers a damn good API.  I find it very hard to criticize what they do, except for the fact that having suffocating rate limits, and shutting off access for integrations you view as competitive, can well, be a pretty quick downer.
<p>An example of Twitter in action is with their recent post about <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/symbols-entities-tweets">Symbols entities for Tweets</a>.  I love this idea, I&rsquo;m working through thoughts that are similar, when it comes to <a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">markup APIs or what I&rsquo;m calling dictionary APIs</a>.  I think that a dictionary, symbol or other lookup functionality around an API is cool and has a lot of potential...right up until the point you realize they are have been <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/30/why-isnt-the-ftc-looking-into-twitters-increasingly-anti-competitive-practices/">sharecropping a lot of this innovation from the Twitter Ecosystem</a>.
<p>In the end, I just have to live at odds with the way I feel about Twitter.  I can&rsquo;t stop showcasing the cool stuff they are doing, just because I do not agree with their approach to API rate limits, communication, competition and sharecropping (or is it cropdusting?)
<p>Another similar conflict in my life is around the <a title="Pearson API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/apis">Pearson API</a>.  As a company I&rsquo;m not 100% in agreement with what Pearson is up to, but from an API perspective, I am a big fan of the companies approach.  They follow what I consider to be a lot of the best practice for the space, and have a model API program I think other publishers should follow.  This canyon is made even wider by the fact I live and work with <a href="http://hackeducation.com">notorious ed-tech trouble maker Audrey Watters</a> who is not shy about sharing her hatred of Pearson.
<p>In the end, I think my inner conflicts make for a better lense to see the API space through.  I will keep sharing the good, the bad and the ugly as I see it.  I really believe that Twitter is the second most important API around, and I can&rsquo;t help but showcase what they are doing, while also holding them up as them up as the poster child of how to do it both right and wrong at the same time!

<p>The ability for me to own <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>, point it at a server, host a website and a blog has been an critical part of my online world and professional career for over 12 years now.  My blog goes back to June of 2007, but I have had a site and portfolio up there since around 2000.  Having control over my domain has enabled me to store years of my writing, research and projects in a central location that I have control over, allowing me to land jobs, contracts or evolve into entirely new domains that have expanded my audience in ways I never imagined, like with&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.
<p>Anytime I can teach this approach to someone else and empower them to own their own domain, I&rsquo;ve jumped at the chance, resulting in numerous individuals who have their own thriving domains--including my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://audrewyatters.com">Audrey Watters</a> with her blog <a title="Hack Education" href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.  Understanding what is necessary to purchase, own and manage your domain, servers, sites, applications and other portions of our digital lives is something everyone should do! But be careful, you just might change the world, and make a significant impact like Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audrewyatters</a>) has.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/reclaimyourdomain/mit-media-lab-phillip.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>Last weekend while at MIT, I had a chance to work on a project that takes this concept of owning your domain and looks to make it an educational resource anyone can take advantage of.  I ended up at the MIT Media Lab after being summoned for an&nbsp;<a title="open learning hackathon" href="http://open.media.mit.edu/hackathon.html">open learning hackathon</a>&nbsp;by MIT and Phillip Schmidt (<a href="https://twitter.com/schmidtphi">@schmidtphi</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>. &nbsp;During the event&nbsp;I had the pleasure of plotting and scheming with infamous technology educator Jim Groom (<a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>) and education rabble rouser Audrey Watters on an&nbsp;<a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/a-domain-of-ones-own-to-community-syndication-hubs/">idea Jim brought with him</a>, that was born out of the <a href="http://umwdomains.com/">University of Mary Washington Domain of One's Own Project</a>.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/reclaimyourdomain/kin-jim-brainstorming.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>After the hackathon was kicked off properly Friday afternoon, Jim and I spent the afternoon of whiteboarding, followed up by a quality evening of beer drinking, in which Jim, Audrey and I hatched a plan we called #ReclaimYourDomain, which would act a hub to allow anyone to easily learn about taking control over their domain, complete with the tools for actually delivering on the promise.
<h3>#ReclaimYourDomain Hub</h3>
<p>Allowing users to take control of their domain will start at a centralized hub where anyone can begin learning about the nuts and bolts of domain ownership, but also find a wizard that will walk them through the sometimes confusing process.  The #ReclaimYourDomain hub is an open source platform that could be launched by a teacher or department within a school, career training center, or any other institution that would like to help individuals own their own domain, and be the central support for them until they could operate completely on their own.
<p>Right now the #ReclaimYourDomain Hub will run as stand-alone service at <a title="reclaimyourdomain.org" href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org">reclaimyourdomain.org</a>, but eventually it will be available for anyone to deploy on any server.  The #ReclaimYourDomain Hub will start with a simple home and about page, but focus on a simple wizard that will walk an individual through purchasing and setting up their own online domain.
<h3>#ReclaimYourDomain Wizard</h3>
<p>The focal point of#ReclaimYourDomain is a simple, six step wizard that will walk any user through owning their own domain:&nbsp;
<ol class="olist">
<li><strong>Claim Your Domain</strong> - Allow users to select, purchase and setup domain</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - Select from common resources such as a blog</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> - Where resources like a blog will be located using services like Github, Dropbox or Amazon S3 or EC2</li>
<li><strong>Details</strong> - Title, summary, photo and a full bio of the domain owner</li>
<li><strong>Contact</strong> - Provide contact information for the domain user that visitors can use to contact them</li>
<li><strong>Hello World </strong>- Something to kick off the launch of a domain like writing the first blog</li>
</ol>
<p>When done running the #ReclaimYourDomain wizard, the service will purchase a top level domain, setup a basic profile site for the user and configure the resources (like a blog), chosen during the wizard. Right now the only resource #ReclaimYourDomain will offer is a blog, but will deliver in other resource areas in the future. To start I'd like to see several definitions of what a blog is:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog @ Local Server with Wordpress</li>
<li>Blog @ AWS EC2 Linux + Amazon RDS + Linux with Wordpress</li>
<li>Blog @ Github Pages with Jekyll</li>
<li>Blog @ Dropbox with Jekyll</li>
<li>Blog @ Amazon S3 with Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to successfully setup a domain, landing page and blog for a user, but the mission is to educate the user about the process ,different resources, location configurations by providing a series of learning objects and migration paths which will allow users to make educated decisions about which options are best for them.  If you want to understand more about why this is important read Audrey's <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/04/11/reclaim-your-domain/">Reclaim Your Domain: A #ReclaimOpen Hackathon Project</a> and Jim's <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-open-learning/">Reclaim Open Learning</a>, located at their domain blogs.
<p><a title="Brain Gears" href="http://fineartamerica.com/featured/4-brain-design-by-cogs-and-gears-setsiri-silapasuwanchai.html" target="_blank"><img style="pading: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/gears-brain.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<h3>Learning Objects</h3>
<p>With digital literacy the mission, #ReclaimYourDomain will provide a series of structured learning objects that will educate users at every step of the setup, configuration and management of their domain.
<p>Learning objects will be available via a centralized help center, while also being linked individually throughout the domain setup wizard and management process so users can access whenever needed, at just the right moment.
<p>As Audrey says, the goal of #RelcaimYourDomain is not just to provide an easy button for buying a domain and setting up a blog, it is to actually educate users about the process, equipping them with essential web literacy skills along the way.
<h3>Domain</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain user will be given their own domain, complete with a static home, about and contact pages.  The domain will always provide a user with a single landing page that will represent their online persona. A #ReclaimYourDomain domain site will provide users with two key services:
<p><a title="Sir Edmund Hilary - Mount Cook by Vanessa (EY), on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/vanchett/424399237/"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/174/424399237_b60c7e1732.jpg" alt="Sir Edmund Hilary - Mount Cook" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - The ability to add different resources like a blog, and configure what application is used and where the blog is hosted within their domain</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - A tool for adding titles and urls that link to existing services a user might depend on like Flickr, Facebook and LinkedIn--services that are unlikely to ever be hosted as a local resource</li>
</ul>
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain is designed to educate users about all the services we depend on, while providing the knowledge and tools to incrementally take control over their:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Online Domain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Critical Services</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personal Data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The process of educating average Internet users about taking control of their worlds in these three essential areas is no easy task, it will be a process that will never fully be complete--requiring a constant flow of open educational resources to empower domain owners about our ever changing digital worlds.
<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain site will have a dashboard allowing each individual to manage their details, contact information, resources and links. The dashboard will be tighlty coupled with the help center, which will provide access to all learning objects, but also provide meaningful analytics that will help users understand the activity that occurs within their domain.
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain site will also have a programmatic layer allowing discovery of profile detail, resources and links.  The #ReclaimYourDomain user domain site will automatically generate not just an HTML home page, but an XML and JSON version providing a programmatic directory for accessing domain details, links and valuable resources like your blog RSS or Twitter accounts.
<h3>Domain Modules</h3>
<p><a title="Reclaim" href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org" target="_blank"><img style="pading: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/reclaimyourdomain/puzzle-cloud-services.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain will initially employ a handful of modules, but eventually could provide access to a robust library of common or niche components.  While the goal is to empower users to set up application within their domain, the platform will easily support common cloud services like Tumblr, Flickr, Evernote and others--with the intention of educating users about the pros and cons of each service, with clear migration paths between resource services and various locations.
<p>Each domain module will come complete with setup, management, migration and even backup, storage and syndication options allowing each module to work independently while providing domain owners with the largest amount of control. &nbsp;
<p>All domain modules will have their own learning objects to support educating users about all the parts and pieces of domain literacy, exposing the technology, business and political layers each resource and its underlying services possess. &nbsp;
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a title="Reclaim" href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org" target="_blank"><img style="pading: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/fist.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>Currently Jim, Audrey and I have a mocked up version of <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">#ReclaimYourDomain Hub</a> and a <a href="http://template.reclaimyourdomain.org/">#ReclaimYourDomain domain site</a>. &nbsp;All the buttons and lnks work, so make sure and click around to see it in action. &nbsp;I need to gather my thoughts from the project, then I will be publishing all #ReclaimYourDomain code and a framework for planning via Github.
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain is not just about setting up a domain and blog.  It is much more than that.  It is meant to be a hands on, digital literacy platform to teach anyone about reclaiming, owning and managing their online domain.
<p>Giving someone the ability to own their domain can look as simple as having a place to put your thoughts via a blog, but could also evolve into an aggregate location to store and link all of a peron's projects, allowing them to be used as part of your online CV and potentially a digital badge or credential system. The possibilities are really endless. However to achieve this vision, we have to educate people about the building blocks of a domain, the importance of taking control over essential services within your domain, and asserting ownership over as much of our personal data as we possibly can, through this enlightening process.
<p>Stay tuned for more on #ReclaimYourDomain, and if you&rsquo;d like to get involved feel free to <a href="http://kinlane.com/contact/">contact me</a> directly or stay tuned and I&rsquo;ll have the Github project up shortly.

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/studeio-sketchpad-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/studio-sketchpad/studeio-sketchpad-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I wrote yesterday&rsquo;s piece on <a href="/2013/04/09/api-education-with-codecademy/">API education with Codecademy</a> back in February.  I didn&rsquo;t publish because I wanted to do more research on suggested areas of improvement for the Codecademy team to balance my criticism.
<p>The point of yesterday's post was not to bash Codecademy, it is to incentivize them to make their platform better.  Until then, I can't really recommend as an <a title="API Building Block" href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a>.
<p>The publishing of my post yesterday was triggered after seeing an example of what is possible after seeing another learn to code platform called <a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank">Studio Sketchpad</a> by Ari Bader-Natal (<a href="https://twitter.com/studiosketchpad">@studiosketchpad</a>).  Studio Sketchpad is an open studio platform for creating beautiful code, aiming to be a open studio for individuals learning to sketch beautiful code on the web canvas--built on a mashup of the Sketch from <a title="Processing" href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing</a> and the Pad from <a href="http://etherpad.com/">EtherPad</a>.
<p>Studio Sketchpad, while still a work in progress has many of the essential elements I feel should be part of any learn to code with API tool.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Learn By Yourself</strong> - You can select lessons and learn online at your own pace</li>
<li><strong>Learn With Instructor </strong>- You can learn in real-time with the assistance of instructor</li>
<li><strong>Create Lessons</strong> - Instructors can build and record lessons and publish to a gallery, providing code walkthrough, with audio (using SoundCloud), complete with playback</li>
<li><strong>Cloning</strong> - You can clone a sketch (lesson) and tweek, edit and make learning more hands on</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong> - You can see the, interact and fork sketches at any point in the evolution of the script</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - You can embed the sketch within your site, allowing for use on your site</li>
<li><strong>Render</strong> - All code renders so you can see the results of the lesson and your modifications</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> - Allow you to share to your social networks</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong> - You can export code lessons to use outside of Studio Sketchpad</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong> - Sketches are openly licensed allowing for reuse, remix and learning</li>
</ul>
<p>I found nine additional features, beyond what is available via Codecademy.  I strongly feel both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embeddability</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learn with instructor</span> are critical to API education. &nbsp;My primary arguement in yesterday's post is I can&rsquo;t endorse sending our API users away to learn about an API.  API education is an hands-on, iterative process, and we have invested too much in our API ecosystems to ship our users off to boarding school.
<p><a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/studio-sketchpad/studio-sketchpad-example.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Secondarily API education is not just people learning about your API, it is about you learning from your API consumers and making your API endpoints, resources and community better.  As API owners there is so much to learn through interacting with our API consumers as they learn and integrate with a platform.  API education isn&rsquo;t a one way street.
<p>I understand everyone in Silicon Valley is cheering for Codecademy, but I think that we are setting the bar too low.  What Ari has created with Studio Sketchpad raises the bar, and really delivers a platform that can help people truly learn about programming.  His implementation is for learning about Canvas, and would take some work to retrofit for PHP, Python, Ruby and would need some sort of emulator to work for iOS and Android, but the important elements are all there.
<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned with where Codecademy has opted to set the bar, since they are a YCombinator company, based on the fact that the technology Studio Sketchpad is built Eitherpad has its origins in YCombinator <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=977015">before Google bought it</a>, and in its early incarnation as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppJet">AppJet</a>.  There seems to be some sort of broken feedback loop at YCombinator, and I don&rsquo;t think Codecademy is consciously ignoring the past, but I think there is a lot they can learn from their own investor's technology history, our <a href="http://guide.hackeducation.com/techies.php">rich history of teaching people to program</a> and some of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">proven building blocks for API support and education</a>.
<p>I hope Codecademy and other platforms who are looking to teach people to use APIs receive both my posts as constructive criticism on how they can evolve their platforms to better serve not just the API consumer, but also API owners--resulting in truly helping educate the masses about the potential of APIs.

<p>title: ‘Imagine What Would Be Possible If Twitter Cards Were Open?’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fist.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/fist.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>Last week Twitter expanded its Twitter Cards initiative to <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/04/02/looking-to-find-new-apps-twitter-adds-third-party-app-discovery-and-deep-links/">allow 3rd party app developers to include links to download apps within Tweets</a>, opening up new opportunities for app discovery via Twitter.  Yay, for app developers...
<p>I won&rsquo;t try to explain the <a title="history of Twitters approach to their ecosystem" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">history of Twitter's approach to their ecosystem</a>, their <a title="Twitters tight fisted approach to cards" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/13/twitter-launches-new-not-so-open-graph-aka-twitter-cards/">tight fisted approach to Twitter Cards</a>, and how it affects this latest app discovery announcement.  Matthew Ingram does an amazing job (as always) of capturing the essence with <a title="Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards" href="https://gigaom.com/2013/04/03/twitter-plays-its-platform-hand-and-it-is-the-one-holding-all-the-cards/">Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards</a>.
<p>My point is, their announcement isn&rsquo;t that exciting. Could you imagine what would be possible if Twitter decide to actually use an open standard like <a title="Open Graph" href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a>, and allowed developers to innovate within Tweets using Twitter Cards?
<p>I fully understand Twitter wants control over their platform, and I don&rsquo;t deny any platform the right to assert control.  And yes, Twitter allows their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/twitter-certified-products">approved partners</a> to play in this arena.  But that isn&rsquo;t open! &nbsp;And, it isn&rsquo;t part of the OG vision that Twitter was built on.
<p>In my opinion, Twitter is missing out on soooo much opportunity for innovation in the space that exists within a Tweet.  Sure, not every developer idea would be good or even viable, but without opening it up, we will never know what is possible, and what end-users would want and embrace. &nbsp;It is all up to Twitter.&nbsp;
<p>So much missed opportunity for innovation, in the name of control. :-(
<p><strong>Correction:</strong>&nbsp;I call Open Graph a Standard. &nbsp;I should have said protocol. &nbsp;I will leave as is, and just admit my error.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/finger-pointing.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />How To Get Your Grandma, Mother, Daughter and Sister to Understand APIs? You stop using gendered approaches when explaining what an API is.  I&rsquo;m not going to cite any of the past or recent examples of this (you know who you are). And I don&rsquo;t care <em>"how you didn&rsquo;t even mean to do this"</em>, when you wrote your API example.  There really isn&rsquo;t a line between sexism and ignorant sexism.
<p>If you really want everyone to understand what an API is, provide well written, plain english examples, that are framed around solving a problem your grandma, mother, daughter or or sister will understand--using problems they truly face in their lives.
<p>It really is that simple.  As long as you are using gendered terms to describe what we are doing, you are raising the barrier to entry. &nbsp;And when you do this, you are talking down to a person and making them feel small, stupid and all the other power trips that go with sexism.  And yes, those thing are still there even if you <em>"didn&rsquo;t mean to do it"</em>.
<p>So let &lsquo;s make sure and keep API examples about solving problems and putting the valuable API resources to use, and not about gender, and get EVERYONE on board.
<p>End of story! And if ever step over this line, call me out. I welcome it, cause I'm not perfect or exempt.

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/codecademy/codecademy-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>As I do with many of my stories, I&rsquo;ve been stewing on the news that online education platform Codecademy started offering API programming lessons for popular APIs like Twilio and NPR back in January.  While at first glance this seems like an important evolution in API education, I wanted to really think through all the details of API on-boarding before I passed judgement.
<p>Codecademy&rsquo;s claim to fame is a pretty slick code view where you can edit your code and then a view window, which will process and run your code, letting you know if you&rsquo;ve done it right or not.  Each class is broken into several lessons, allowing you to finish at your pace, with a accompanying Q&amp;A forum, glossary and scratch pad--with a badge showing you passed the course.
<p>Codecademy offers API classes for YouTube, SoundCloud, Parse, Twilio, SendGrid, NPR, Sunlight Foundation, Bitly, PlaceKitten and Stripe APIs and handful of others, with each class using Python, Ruby or JavaScript as the programming language. &nbsp;
<p>I think Codecademy is a novel idea for helping existing developers understand the ins and outs of learning a new programming language or learning an API, using their wizard driven, code tutorials.  But it shouldn&rsquo;t be the only tool in your toolbox for helping people understand your API.
<p>First I don&rsquo;t think people (especially non-developers) want to &ldquo;learn a programming language&rdquo; or want to &ldquo;learn an API&rdquo;.  In my opinion, APIs are about opening up access to resources that anyone can take advantage of, even non-developers.  Because many APIs are built on HTTP and use simple key authentication, it makes them extremely hackable and something that anyone can put to use.  I don&rsquo;t think we need to require people to be programmers to use APIs, we can allow varying grades of coders, scripters and hackers to put APIs to use to solve problems they face in their everyday worlds.
<p>When looking to educate your potential consumers about your API, you should focus on some sort of project that your target audience will relate with.  I&rsquo;m assuming you have done a great deal of due diligence on the market you have entered, as well as profiled any developers who are already registered for your API.  So you have a good idea of the types of problems your API will solve and potentially how users will put it to use.  With this knowledge you should be building lessons that speak specifically to these problems, not generically &ldquo;learn your API&rdquo;.
<p>Next there are plenty of established building blocks like interactive documentation, blog, forum, frequently asked questions, youtube and Twitter that you can use to build lessons that focus on specific projects or problems your known target audience will need to solve.  I just can&rsquo;t advocate sending users away from your site to learn about your API, when you already have the building blocks you need to teach them in your API area.
<p>Additionally, by using existing building blocks to construct specific lessons for potential users you will receive the SEO benefit, which will draw in new users looking to solve the problems you&rsquo;ve identified.  Most users won&rsquo;t know they need to learn your API, they will be Googling that they need to solve a problem, and come across your API.  You will miss out on this if you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">solely rely</span> on an online platform like Codecademy.
<p>Beyond SEO, you will deprive new users of the additional benefits provided by your API ecosystem, like direct and community support.  On Codecademy you won&rsquo;t be there to answer their questions along the way, and they won&rsquo;t be able to access the knowledge and wisdom of your existing developer community--an essential aspect of taking your API from just an area, to a community and ultimately an ecosystem.
<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/codecademy/codecademy-api-page.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>My objective on API Evangelist is to help API owners be successful in their API initiatives by understand the best practices to deploying and managing their APIs.  I think Codecademy is a very cool platform and if you have the resources it is something you should add to your toolbox.  But if your API team resources are short (as they are in most), you need to rely on many of the existing building blocks you have and build meaningful education material for your API that users can find and put to use within your API area, where you can make sure and support them in real-time.
<p>Looking at the lessons Codecademy has, I don&rsquo;t think they have the resources to offer lessons on all the top APIs, and I think they should focus on lessons around other common building blocks that API owners could put to use educating users, such as HTTP, oAuth, JSON, etc.  I think its easy for all of us 8% alpha geeks to get excited about tools like Codecademy, but when the rubber meets the road with the mainstream I think we have to think deeper about how we approach teaching people about tech and APIs.

<p>title: ‘Moving Beyond API Pricing to API Price Reduction’</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/amazon/aws-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I get a lot of inquiries from API owners about how they should price their API access in a way that will make sense to developers, but also help them generate revenue from their valuable API resources.
<p>As most of us are still trying to figure out sensible pricing for our new APIs, or better understand how to adjust and evolve pricing to better suit existing developers--Amazon is busy reducing their cloud API pricing. &nbsp;
<p>I got a simple email from Amazon today:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear Amazon S3 Customer,</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We are excited to announce that we are reducing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=2SXVU4T3VRUWB&amp;C=J2HG6JVZ1C5L&amp;H=PVA7GS7QEGLCGOTDJIF9KXXMGHEA&amp;T=C&amp;U=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fs3%2Fpricing%3Fref_%3Dpe_12300_29052180_8" target="_blank">Amazon S3 request prices</a>&nbsp;in all nine of our regions. We are lowering the prices for GET requests by 60% and the prices for PUT, LIST, COPY, and POST requests by 50%. For example, in the US Standard Region, we are reducing the price of every 1,000 PUT requests from $0.01 to $0.005 and the price of every 10,000 GET requests from $0.01 to $0.004.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We are happy to pass along these savings to you as we continue to drive down our costs. The new lower prices for all regions can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=2SXVU4T3VRUWB&amp;C=J2HG6JVZ1C5L&amp;H=PXMXBBGNPMWR1VAGFSTZAJIJ7Y8A&amp;T=C&amp;U=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fs3%2Fpricing%3Fref_%3Dpe_12300_29052180_7" target="_blank">Amazon S3 pricing page</a>. New prices are effective April 1st and will be applied to your bill for all requests on or after this date.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sincerely,</em><br /><em>The Amazon S3 Team</em>
<p>These price reductions are becoming more frequent across the numerous AWS APIs I depend on like S3, EC2 and RDS. &nbsp;I have been an S3 user since 2006 and EC2 since 2008, and I didn't see price reductions at all in the early days, but they seem to be a common part of doing business in the cloud today.
<p>The obvious explanation is that competition in the cloud space is heating up, especially with Google stepping up their game, but I think there are other lessons for API owners here. That spending the time to initially develop a sensible pricing model for your API is important, but also continuing to understand how it is working for developers and how they are accessing and putting your API resources to use--which will allow you to reach a place where you know your API, developers and the space you operate so well, you can reduce pricing, while actually increasing your revenue. &nbsp;
<p>At some point I would like to go back and document all the AWS pricing, to see at what point they were able to have enough of an understanding to begin delivering price reductions, and also see if there are any other correlations in the market that I can identify that have coincided with their pricing decisions. &nbsp;

<p>title: ‘Usually When Developers Are Mean, It Is About Power’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/angry-bird.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/angry-birds-are-amazing/images/32024326/title/angry-bird-photo" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/angry-bird.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming professionally since 1988, so I&rsquo;ve been around quite a few developers in my career. There seems to be a lot of moments lately that cause me to look back at this career, reassess what I've learned, and adjust the direction I'm going with this mined wisdom. &nbsp;This week I&rsquo;m reflecting on the recent insanity around Adria Richards, my role as the API Evangelist, and spending time thinking about the tech space's inclusiveness as I&rsquo;m hanging out with my 12 year old daughter for spring break.
<p>Throughout my career, in just about every position I&rsquo;ve taken, whether as a programmer, manager, lead, architect and VP, I&rsquo;ve encountered developers who are challenged by me, my role, skills and approach to tech.  I can remember 3 separate roles I&rsquo;ve had where one of my first assigned tasks was to fire a developer who had made everyone&rsquo;s lives miserable, because before I came along they couldn&rsquo;t fire them (him), because they were dependent on them for their skills.
<p>Quality technical talent is hard to find, and many companies can&rsquo;t afford to lose the talent they already have.  No matter what the personality defects or the workplace issues might be.  Many developers know this and work it to their advantage, taking advantage of power they possess for their own selfish goals.
<p>This power struggle does not just exist between developers and non-developers.  As a programmer I encounter developers who always have to one up you, and make you feel stupid for what you don&rsquo;t know.  It might be a programming language, database platform, technical library or just the fact you use Windows vs Mac.  Some programmers can co-exist, but many feel the need to challenge others, while assuming a defensive position around their established fiefdom.
<p>Outside the corporate firewall I see this behavior extended to online interactions, where programmers make non-developers feel insignificant for what they do not know, and belittle other developers for what skills they lack.  Something that often can extend into other more harmful, trollish behavior.  Developers can be quick to jump one others in an online environment,  creating very uncomfortable or hostile situations.
<p>Many places I&rsquo;ve worked or contracted with, this power struggle plays itself out as the classic IT bottleneck.  IT bottlenecks are often portrayed as lack of resources, but more often than not they represent power struggles around budget, technology and other lesser evils.  Think about some of your IT interactions--is it always a shortage or resources or lack of desire to actually deliver?  It can be very hard to tell sometimes.
<p>While the root of this behavior I feel is insecurity, I think ultimately it is all about power.  I also strongly believe one of the by-products of this reality is the sexism, racism and other negativity that is a systemic issue in the tech space.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/information-technology.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m not writing this to say that all developers are power trippers.  They aren&rsquo;t.  But us technologists have a huge problems with wanting to be keepers of the knowledge.  I&rsquo;m not excluding myself from this.  I fall victim to the desire for power and glory.  I&rsquo;m not exempt.  But I work really, really, really hard at trying to transcend this past I share with the rest of the tech space.
<p>I believe APIs are letting the IT resources out of the bag, and so is the consumerization of other areas like cloud computing, storage, email, web and mobile development, etc. APIs are bringing valuable IT resources closer to the people who can use these resources to solve problems.  I saw the opportunities around APIs playing out from 2005 through 2010, and in middle of 2010 I decided to start <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> to help spread the word to the masses about the potential of APIs--bridging a gap that has created between developers and non-developers.
<p>It is very important that us technologists ground our work in the assistance of other non-technologists.  We have to work very, very, very hard at being nice and make what we do inclusive.  It isn&rsquo;t easy.  Listen to the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/post/44802468357/episode-7-i-went-through-three-cliches-there">first couple minutes of the API podcast Traffic and Weather from the other  week</a> and you will hear how much work I put into making sure I&rsquo;m pleasant, but make an impact when engaging not only non-developers, but developers alike.  It is critical.
<p>If you are a developer, please join me in making sure everything we do is as inclusive as possible for other developers, non-developers and most importantly of other sexes, races and anyone we encounter in what we do.

<p><a title="I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet" href="https://tosdr.org/">I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet</a>.  We agree to terms of service for each and every service we use online, without ever reading and understanding exactly what we are agreeing to.
<p>This is one of the most damaging aspects of online life, as through this process we are giving away our rights, ownership of our data and allowing for our privacy to be compromised each and every day.  While not all services are abusing this, there are many online services that use this to their advantage, in an effort to maximize the amount of value they extract from their platform and end users.
<p>Service providers have to go further in educating users about the terms of service they are agreeing to.  There is a great example of this in action, via an article in NextWeb called &ldquo;<a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/29/now-this-is-how-to-write-a-terms-of-service-document/">now THIS is how to write your startup&rsquo;s Terms of Service</a>&rdquo;.  The post showcases how <a href="http://heello.com/" target="_blank">real-time sharing platform Heello</a> has provided <a href="https://heello.com/terms" target="_blank">plain english descriptions, next to each &ldquo;legaleze&rdquo; paragraph in their terms of service</a>.
<p><a href="https://heello.com/terms" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/heello/heello-terms-of-service.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>This is nothing new. <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms_of_service">You see it with other providers like Tumblr</a>.  But I think it is a very simple enhancement to API terms of service that can have a huge effect, and begin leading us in a more healthy direction when it comes to educating end-users about the TOS they are bound to.  While companies need the protection of a legal terms of service, there is no reason you can't provide your end users with a translated, plain english version. &nbsp;It doesn't take much work, and really sets you apart from other API service providers.
<p>Do you know of any other examples of online services going above and beyond to help educate end users about terms of service?

<p>title: ‘The Noun Project API’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-noun-project.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> is <a href="http://thenounproject.com/developers/">soliciting feedback on their upcoming API</a>.  If you aren&rsquo;t familar with The Noun Project, it is a innovative visual language project, that is creating a library of icons that will enable people to visually communicate and interact around the globe. Direct from <a href="http://thenounproject.com/about/">The Noun Project about page</a>:
<blockquote><em>Humans have been using symbols to communicate for over 17,000 years because they are the one language everyone can understand. Symbols can transcend cultural and language barriers and deliver concise information effortlessly and instantaneously. They allow people to communicate quickly, effectively, and intuitively. And for the first time ever, this language is being combined with technology to create a social language that unites the world.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Noun Project wants <a href="http://thenounproject.com/developers/">our feedback on what a Noun Project API might look like</a> and what we would use it for. &nbsp;So, I wanted to take a moment and share my thoughts, about what I would use The Noun Project API for, and some thoughts about what the endpoints might look like.
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong> <br />Normally an embeddable strategy for an API is in the background, relinquished to just one of the tools in the toolbox.  With the Noun Project I think a healthy embeddable strategy would be front and center, providing a wide array of buttons, badges, widgets and other items users could syndicate across the web.  The library of embeddable tools should be open for submission, much like the core of the Noun Project.  Designers could generate custom button sets, badges and other embeddables for users to choose from.  The Noun Project's embeddable strategy would make the Noun Project API accessible to everyone, even non-developers.
<p><strong>Builders and IDE </strong><br />A Noun Project API would enable a next generation of mobile and web application apps, as well as other visualization and big data analysis tools to integrate consistent imagery.  Makers of integrated development environments (IDE) could provide button, icon and other UI components with a wealth of meaningful icons, that could become the new default in modern apps.  Think how Twitter bootstrap is raising the bar in overall app user interface quality?  Love it or not, Twitter Bootstrap has made things look better, and consistent use of the Noun Project images could go even further.
<p><strong>Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words </strong><br />The Noun Project API would enable a wealth of text to image visualization possibilities, allowing developers to accompany and represent everyday text in much more impactful ways.  Imagine if in addition to titles and summaries, you always had a Noun Project icon to reference when reading on the web and via your favorite applications.  A couple examples might be:
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project-idea.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog &amp; News Listings</strong> - Often times our blogging platforms have a way to upload an image to represent a post or story.  The Noun Project could be used as visual cues for stories in certain categories or programmable determined by the text content of a story, dynamically pulled from the Noun Project API</li>
<li><strong>Link Representations</strong> - When faced with a link, all you have to reference is the title and possibly a description.  The addition of a Noun Project icon, pulled from the API after indexing the content of links page would help users make a determination of a site&rsquo;s content before clicking</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - The Noun Project could be used to provide visual references for emails, SMS, Tweets, Facebook Wall posts and other common forms of digital communication. &nbsp;Icons could be suggested based upon message content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ways The Noun Project API could be used to dynamically offer visual representations for common textual objects we encounter in our every day lives.  I&rsquo;m sure a developer community would come up with many more examples, once the API is available.
<p><strong>Network Graph</strong><br />Built into The Noun Project API would be a representation of the social and network graph of an image.  You could see how popular a particular image or set of images is.  You could apply this into the filtering and retrieval of images via the API, as well as have as part of the image meta data to use in your own application logic. To achieve the level of meaning the project intends to, a graph will be needed to show the use, reach and impact of each image and sets of images.
<p><strong>Partner Network </strong><br />Also built into The Noun Project API should be a partner layer, that reflects the core mission of the project.  Every image returned by the API would be complete with all meta data regarding its creator and how the image can, and is being used across the network.  The Noun Project Partner Network would give more control and insight for designers to see how their images are being used as well as commercial, volume and other monetization opportunities for designers--a layer that could be part of the overall Noun Project revenue strategy.
<p><strong>Attribution</strong> <br />Without an API, the usage of Noun Project images is a manual process, leaving attribution up to the user.  With an API and a healthy branding and attribution framework, The Noun Project attribution would be built into the embeddable strategy as well as bundled into each and every Noun Project API response.  This would provide The Noun Project network with easy attribution, which doesn't just credit designers, it will be the basis of The Noun Project marketing. Imagine being able to visualize the entire syndication for a single icon! Without an API this is impossible.
<p><strong>Bridging the Digital to Physical </strong><br />The Noun Project API would allow innovative new ways to use Noun Project icons in the physical world as well as the digital.  An API could allow for the printing on demand of icon templates in various sizes, and ship them to users for creating signs and other real-world uses that could be permanent or possibly even ephemeral, with the use of temporary paints or spray on chalks.  This process wouldn't be a one-way street either.  With a Noun Project API, developers could build icon recognition applications that could snap a picture of an icon printed (permanently or temporary) and immediately connect users back to the virtual world around the icon, either based upon its meaning, designer or some new represenation that has emerged as part of the Noun Project network graph.
<p>That are just some of my initial thoughts around how a Noun Project API could be put to use in meaningful ways.  Regarding what The Noun Project API would look like. I'd like to see some of the following endpoints:
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project-clicking-heels.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Designers</strong> - Endpoint for icon designers, with access to their profile, collections and icons&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - Enpoint for Noun Project user accounts with access to account and billing settings as well as favorite, saved, purchased icons and collections</li>
<li><strong>Icons</strong> - Endpoint for all icons, allowing to to search and filter individual icons as well as add and update existing icons for my designer profile</li>
<li><strong>Collections</strong> - Collection endpoints allowing me to search, filter and pull individual icon collections</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> - Endpoint for all words used for icons, allowing a dictionary that developed can reference while developing providing a reverse search for icons</li>
<li><strong>Graph</strong> - API access to all graph related events like popular icons, collections and designers as well as trending icons collections and reverse searches on popular keywords or phrases</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are more endpoints that could be identified in the future.  I think the most important aspect is to just get an API launched, and have a healthy strategy for engaging users to find out what should be put on the roadmap. Just starting simple and making sure to expose all aspects of the core Noun Project is an important beginning--the rest will come.
<p>What a fascinating project the Noun Project is.  I strongly believe that it order to fulfill its full vision, the Noun Project has to have an API.  The Noun Project API will be essential to syndicating the icons across both our physical and virtual worlds, provide a way for users and designers to interact around the icons, while also providing the most meaningful licensing framework possible that would even include much needed revenue for both designers and the Noun Project, and keep this very important project alive.

<p>I depend on <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> to move data around the cloud. &nbsp;I syndicate blog posts from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> to Blogger and Tumblr. &nbsp;This isn't just blind syndication, it is SEO and also plan B scenarios to make sure my content exists in multiple areas.
<p>When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use. &nbsp;If I begin to depend on an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS). &nbsp;This is how I roll.
<p>Not all platorms allow for this. &nbsp;In my opinion, all FREE platforms should have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">relief valves for users</a> like me, who want to move to some sort of paid account, assuring me some sort of service level agreement (SLA) or I'll move away.
<p>For example: Once I started using Evernote regularly, I moved to the premium level. &nbsp;I bought into Pinboard at an early rate, once I was hooked. &nbsp;Inversely, I can't pay for Twitter, Facebook and some Google services. &nbsp;Today it is about IFTT.
<p>In light of me losing Google Reader I'm taking a hard look at all my services. &nbsp;IFTT is on the chopping block.
<p>I have about 20-30 jobs running at IFTTT, moving data around between my cloud services, in a way I depend on. &nbsp;I need to move this into the realm of premium or paid services. &nbsp;
<p>What are your thoughts? &nbsp;Sell me on your service.

<p>title: ‘Embeddable API Conversations with Adam of Iris Media’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/iris-media-logo.jpeg</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/iris-media/iris-media-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I spent some time drinking IPAs and talking education technology with Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and a friend of ours Adam Wendt (<a href="https://twitter.com/skinnyblimp">@skinnyblimp</a>), the COO of&nbsp;<a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank">Iris Educational Media</a> last week.  IRIS Educational Media is a behavioral research and development company that provides educational resources for parents, parent educators, K-12 school staff, including teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, and direct support employees.
<p>During our discussion, Adam was describing how he wanted to make Iris Media resources available for people to use on any platform, by providing valuable embeddable tools and resources for organizations and professionals to use on their own sites and portals.
<p><a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/iris-media/iris-media-video.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>As Adam was talking, of course I&rsquo;m thinking API.  An API would not just a way to drive their own line of embeddable tools, but would also allow for other 3rd party developers to build specialized tools and widgets for other platforms that Iris Media might not have awareness, time or resources to focus on.  Wanting to be available on numerous platforms is easy, but actually delivering on them can be costly and time consuming--APIs are a way to share this load with a 3rd party community.
<p>An API could power Iris Media&rsquo;s syndication similar to Youtube. The Youtube API, plus a robust embeddable tool strategy is behind the massive syndication and growth of the popular video platform. Iris Media could go further with its own API, by integrating a partner layer within their API platform, and provide developers, organizations and educational professionals the ability to earn revenue by syndicating or developing widgets and applications on top of the Iris Media API.  This revenue could go a long way in ensuring some of these essential educational professionals organizations stay in operation and continue making an impact.
<p>Engaging with people like Adam, who are truly making a difference in priority areas like education, is why I continue doing API Evangelist.  APIs can help Iris Media be more successful in reaching its audience, but also empower the huge number of important individuals and organizations on the ground in communities around the globe, who deliver essential education where they are needed most.

<p>A <a href="/buildingblocks/roadmap.php">roadmap is an essential part of a healthy API ecosystem</a>.  The transparency and communication that come with providing a roadmap for your API and open data initiative will go a long way in building trust with your community.
<p>The <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2013/03/26/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-release-schedule/">City of Philadelphia is sharing its roadmap of data sets</a> that it intends to open in the coming months, by providing a <a href="https://trello.com/board/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline/51487d15bb68f5de3b0099b0">release calendar using cloud project management service Trello</a>. In addition to seeing the datasets the city intends to release, you can also see any data sets that have already been published.
<p>According to the open data roadmap, Philadelphia is releasing data on street closures, energy consumption, evacuation routes, campaign finance, bike racks, budgets, expenditures and city employee salaries to name just a few.
<p><a title="tecnically philly" href="http://technical.ly/philly/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/city/philadelphia/city-of-philly-open-data-roadmap.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>This type of transparency doesn&rsquo;t just build trust with citizens and developers, it provides an incentive for the city government to deliver high quality public data, in a meaningful and timely manner.    There is still a lot of work to be done once this data is available, in order to develop quality analysis, visualizations, other APIs and tools that can be used in mobile and web applications. But what Philly is doing is a great start.
<p>The City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s approach to its open data roadmap is good to see.  It is something all cities should have, as well as all API owners.  Your roadmap will set expectations within your community, guide your own initiatives and provide a healthy blueprint for moving your efforts forward.

<p>NASA has a <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/skymorph-imagery-api/">pretty cool challenge going on</a>, to create an API for SkyMorph, a database of optical images and catalogs generated by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program.  According to the NASA description, SkyMorph provides:
<blockquote><em>access to imagery by time and position or searching by specific asteroid or other moving object. The time dimension, unique to SkyMorph, allows users to discover changes in the intensities of stars, e.g. supernovae, or to discover moving objects, e.g. comets</em></blockquote>
<p>NASA is challenging us to help build a RESTful interface that would enable developers and citizen scientist to access SkyMorph imagery, lowering the barrier of access to the data and encouraging innovation around the program.
<p>Ok, how cool is that!  APIs that enable everyone to help track on and understand objects in the sky, along with NASA.  It is projects like the <a title="SkyMorph API Challenge" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/skymorph-imagery-api/">SkyMorph API Challenge</a> that keep me excited about APIs.

<p>title: ‘Interactive API Documentation With Swagger’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/reverb-for-developers-swagger.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="Swagger " href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/reverb-for-developers-swagger.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>It is becoming more common for API providers to deliver documentation using what's known as <a title="interactive API documentation" href="/buildingblocks/interactive_documentation.php">interactive API documentation</a>, instead of the usual static API documentation.   Understanding how to use an API can be tough sometimes, and rather than just reading about it how it works, interactive API documentation allows you make real calls against an API, while learning about the interface.
<p>While there are several approaches to delivering interactive API documentation, my personal favorite is using <a title="Swagger " href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>.  Swagger comes built in with <a title="3Scale" href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, which is the API management platform I use for the <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist API</a>, but Swagger is available for anyone to use as an <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">open source project</a>.
<p>Interactive API documentation using Swagger starts with a Swagger definition, which is a JSON representation of an API endpoint. In this case, the endpoint is for accessing my blog posts:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5216806.js"></script>
<p>This JSON describes everything about my very basic endpoint, which allows users to query almost 3 years of API Evangelist blog posts. Using this definition, Swagger generates the following API documentation automatically:
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-documentation-1.png" alt="" width="500" />
<p>As someone learning about the API Evangelist Analysis API, this describes the endpoint, which fields are required to make an API call, but it doesn&rsquo;t just describe this with text, it provides an interactive interface in which I can enter my API keys, provide a query value and actually make a request against the API:
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-documentation-2.png" alt="" width="500" />
<p>So I don&rsquo;t just learn about the API endpoint.  I learn about what keys are needed and fields are present that allow me to request different information of the API endpoint. It allows me to actually see the request to the API, the resulting body of my API request.
<p>This type of hands on learning is essential to onboarding new users with your API. I can read your API documentation and not see the value, but when I am walked through how to build a request, and actually see the value returned in real-time, it changes the game.  As a developer I&rsquo;m more likely to understand and integrate with an API when I am given interactive API documentation over static pages.
<p>The benefits of describing your API using Swagger don&rsquo;t stop with just providing <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui">interactive API documentation</a>. Swagger can also help deliver <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">code samples</a> in multiple programming languages for developers to put to use, <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">generate server side code</a> for new APIs and <a href="/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">provide potential benefits for API discovery</a>.
<p>It is well known that <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">API documentation is the number one pain point for developers</a>. Make sure your API documentation is hands-on, and interactive, so developers will understand the value your API delivers immediately, and go from learning, to integration, in as short of period as possible.

<p>Way to go brogrammers. &nbsp;You made sure a bright light in evangelism was partially dimmed tday. &nbsp;Really? With all the shaming that goes on targeted at women, you don't have balls to take a little shaming when you arer being a sexist pig? &nbsp; C'mon...ummm have some balls?
<p>As I've <a href="http://kinlane.com/2012/12/30/sexism-in-the-tech-space/">said it before, us guys are going to have to eat shit with a side of humble pie for many years</a> to come to balance this whole sexism thing out. &nbsp;Let's own it.
<p>All it would have taken is a humble apology from those gentleman in response to the Tweet, then some healthy discussion about why what they said was wrong, and move on kids. &nbsp;
<p>I sure hope the hacker news crowd steps up and defends every woman that is shamed by guys now, as they seem to be a defender of this now. So if you Tweet out shaming a woman in a career changing way, know hacker news will be all over you...right? &nbsp;Right?
<p>I just want to make sure you know I support you Adria. You are not unemployed, you've been promoted to new levels of evangelism. Let me know how I can help.

<p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/seabourne-logo-2013.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm tracking on a new wave of application frameworks and API centric architecture patterns, that are not just helping deliver the next wave of web &amp; mobile apps, but also bridging, aggregating and providing interoperability and transformations between APIs platforms.
<p>One company I've been watching closely is <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>.  The Seabourne team has an approach to application development that follows a very interesting set of principles:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Flows Instead of Pipelines - </strong>Information operates in &lsquo;flows&rsquo; where inputs and outputs are flexible and happen at any point. Flows are fluid and flexible, unlike structured, point-to-point pipelines</li>
<li><strong>Data has Multiple Owners -</strong> Information flows are composed of multiple streams of data owned by different partners and vendors. Any process must accommodate multiple canonical sources for different information</li>
<li><strong>Use APIs to Move Information -</strong> By using APIs to move information around, we decouple the data from the underlying technology and vendor, and make it possible to combine information from different technologies. APIs provide a flexible, low cost base to grow the system and meet changing needs</li>
<li><strong>Integrate Data Across Systems - </strong>Information lives on multiple systems inside and outside the organization. There is tremendous value to be had from combining multiple data sources together into a single information stream</li>
<li><strong>Translation Rather Than Standardization -</strong> Information is stored in multiple structures and formats. Any effort to manage information should focus on translating between structures rather than trying to develop a common schema</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that pretty much describes the challenges we face building web and mobile apps today, and Seabourne's approach isn&rsquo;t just about building apps, it is about organizing resources from multiple providers to build the best app you can. To see it in action you have to check out the project they just implemented using their approach called <a href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.
<p>Using GovInfo, anyone can sign up to receive alerts from more than 100 different federal agency websites. GovInfo gets its information from a large number of sources ranging from RSS, APIs or scraped from HTML sources. Once acquired, the framework de-dupes, cleanses and normalizes the data as needed, then makes available for publishing or pushing out via email, SMS or other means.
<p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/govinfo_diagram.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>The Seabourne approach is not just <a href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking extract, transform and load (ETL)</a>, but also makes your app platform centered around acquire, process and publish, in a way that improves flexibility, centralizes processing rules for all incoming information and reduces the amount of time it takes to add new sources of data, all while providing scalability, in a very granular way.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Seabourne evolve and constantly refine their approach to distributed application design ranging from their <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">deployment of the FCC web site</a>, to the <a title="launching of MyFCC" href="/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">launching of MyFCC</a>, and now the next iteration of their platform driving GovInfo.  I&rsquo;ll keep following what they are doing with their<a href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/"> AP2 approach</a> and watch the <a href="http://seabourneinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/case-studies/Seabourne-Information-Management.pdf">tools</a> and best practices that are a result of their innovative approach to application development using APIs.

<p>It was inevitable.  <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist now has its own API</a>.  I had a couple partners ask for more sophisticated access than provided by RSS or JSON dumps out of my platform. &nbsp;So I launched a handful of API endpoints, allowing you to get at information from my world.
<p>I currently have 13 endpoints providing access to the core of my platform, in 8 key areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Name, logo and description of the 2K APIs I'm activtely monitoring</li>
<li><strong>API Stack</strong> - Access to my weekly and monthly API stacks</li>
<li><strong>Analysis (Blog) - </strong>Access to my entire blog catalog</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers -</strong> Access to all API service providers I track</li>
<li><strong>Tools -</strong> A full catalog of all the API tools I've found</li>
<li><strong>Curated News - </strong>Title and links of news that I personally curate from my 2K+ feeds</li>
<li><strong>Notes -</strong> Notes I make during my daily and weekly curation</li>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -</strong> The common building blocks I've identified after looking at 2K top APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more data behind my firewall that I want to open up.  I do a lot of research on top APIs like Twitter and Google as well as trending areas like <a href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/trends/baas.php">backend</a>, <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity</a> and <a href="/trends/realtime.php">real-time</a> service providers.
<p>I will also be opening up API endpoints into the site traffic for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>, <a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a> and my other properties.  And toying with opening up some collections of my personal data like calendar, projects, checkins and other aspects of my world.
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m only issuing keys to API Evangelist subscribers and partners, but let me know if you are interested in getting at any of my data.  Eventually I&rsquo;ll make much of it openly available, but I&rsquo;m still formulating my approach, and playing with different service compositions--so things will change.

<p>title: ‘Web Harvesting to API with Import.io’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/import-io-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="Import.io" href="https://import.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/import-io/import-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p>I had a demo of a new <a href="https://import.io">data extraction service</a> today called <a title="Import.io" href="https://import.io">Import.io</a>.   The service allows you to harvest or scrape data from websites and then output in machine readable formats like JSON.  This is very similar to Needlebase, a popular scraping tool that was acquired and then shut down by Google early in 2012.   Except I&rsquo;d say Import.io represents a simpler, yet at the same time a more sophisticated approach to harvesting of web data and publishing than Needlebase.
<p><strong>Extract</strong><br />Using Import.io you can target web pages, where the content resides that you wish to harvest, define the rows of data, label and associate them with columns in table you where the system will ultimately put your data, then extract the data complete with querying, filtering, pagination and other aspects of browsing the web you will need to get at all the data you desire.
<p><strong>Connect</strong><br />After defining the data that will be extracted, and how it will be store you can stop and use the data as is, or you can setup a more ongoing, real-time connection with the data you are harvesting.  Using Import.io connectors you pull the data regularly, identify when it changes, merge from multiple sources and remix data as needed.
<p><strong>Put The Data To Work</strong><br />Using Import.io you can immediately extract the data you need and get to work, or establish an ongoing connection with your sources of data and use via the Import.io web app or you can manage and access via the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.import.io/">Import.io API</a>--giving you full control over your web harvesting connections, and the resulting data.
<p><a title="Import.io" href="https://import.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/import-io/import-io-connectors.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>When getting to work using Import.io, you have the option to build your own connectors or explore a marketplace of existing data connectors, tailored to pull from some common sources like the Guardian or ESPN.  The Import.io marketplace of connectors is a huge opportunity for data consumers as well as data scraping junkies (like me) to put their talents to use building unique and desireable data harvesting scripts.
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about database to API services like <a title="database to api with EmergentOne" href="/2013/03/01/mysql,-postgresql,-rds-to-api-with-emergent-one/">EmergentOne</a> and <a title="database to api with slashdb" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/18/database-to-api-with-slashdb/">SlashDB</a>, I would put Import.io into the Harvest to API or ScrAPI category--allowing you to deploy APIs and machine readable datasets from any publicly available data, even if you aren&rsquo;t a programmer.
<p>I think ScrAPI services and tools will play an important role in the API economy.  While data will almost always originate from a database, often times you can&rsquo;t navigate existing IT bottlenecks to properly connect and deploy an API from that data source.  Sometimes problem owners will have to circumvent existing IT infrastructure and harvest where the data is published on the open web. &nbsp;Taking it upon themselves to generate the necessary API or machine readable formats that will be needed for the last mile of mobile and big data apps that will ultimately consume and depend on this data.

<p>I wrote about the <a href="/2013/03/19/web-harvesting-to-api-with-import.io/">web to API service Import.io</a>&nbsp;earlier today, and before I close the Evernote for this story, I wanted to highlight something else I thought they did interesting, on their <a href="https://import.io/pricing">pricing page</a>. &nbsp;
<p>I thought they provide a very honest peak into how they are pricing their services. &nbsp;First off, they admit that they are a young company, which is cool, but they also lay out some pretty interesting points around their business philosophy::
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>We are a free service. We will always provide a free-to-use tool</li>
<li>We will introduce premium features. Some of these you may have to pay for</li>
<li>We will always provide you with a tool to export your connectors</li>
<li>We will let you know if we are going to change anything that may impact your usage of import.io</li>
<li>We are currently in Developer Preview. Some things might not work as expected</li>
<li>Free accounts may be volume-limited as we move from Developer Preview to production</li>
<li>We will never spam you or share your details with any third parties</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these points are something I feel ALL startups should commit to as part of their services to their users. One thing I'd also like to see from startups, is some mention of their exit strategy. &nbsp;What is the end goal? &nbsp;I think this is a relevant question for all startups, as is also good one for Import.io after the Google acquisition and shut-down of a similar service called Needlebase, back in 2012. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>My goal isn't to pick on <a href="https://import.io/">Import.io</a>, but along with the other items they outline, I think all API startups should be openly discussing everything listed above.
