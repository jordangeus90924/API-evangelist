[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Craft-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" />][1]I'm a member of a Google group called [API Craft][2]. There are some really smart API folks talking about everything from API deployment to API business strategies there.  

The other day someone in the groups asked:

> _**How does someone measure success in developing and deploying a public–facing Web API?**_

Scott Regan ([@scottregan][3]) of [Apigee][4] gave a great response, and I wanted to share with everyone here. Scott’s suggestions for measurements were:

  * **Revenue** \- For public APIs, could be affiliate program revenue, ad revenue, or if incremental traffic from apps to the website has a known monetization rate
  * **Reach** \- Incremental new user accounts or unique users
  * **Partnerships** \- Number of new partnerships established around your API
  * **Apps** \- The number of new apps developed using your API
  * **Traffic** \- Apply percentage of incremental traffic ("our API channel is now X% of total internet traffic")
  * **Brand** \- Measuring increased 'brand', but only if the company has an really established way to do this

Scott goes on to say:

> _When it comes to business metric tracking one thing i've seen work well is when the API team publishes a 'dashboard' widely and regularly - tracking actual results to estimates - because it helps PM focus the roadmap on what moves the business needle as agreed and avoid getting the team pulled in different directions._

Each API could potentially have different success factors depending on the type of API or the goals of a company. But revenue, reach, partnerships, apps, traffic and increased brand awareness are good places to start.  Thanks Scott.
