{% include JB/setup %}<p>I finished my roundup of hackathons for the API Evangelist calendar this morning.It took me a large portion of yesterday to gather and do the data entry for all the hackathons.Something I should probably have someone else do, but I like being in tune with the different events.I tracked on hackathons last year, but this year I’m spending time each week organizing into a calendar to share with my readers, publish a roundup on ProgrammableWeb each week, and plan which events I will be attending or sponsoring.I’m impressed with the growth in the number of hackathons worldwide in 2012: January 2012 - 35 February 2012 - 57 March 2012 - 68 That is 160 hackathons so far this year!</p>
