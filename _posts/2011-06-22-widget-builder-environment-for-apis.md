{% include JB/setup %}<p>There are many tools out there for working with Web APIs, but the one I am seeing used more and more is an API explorer.API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a Web interface -- all without writing code.These API explorers are making it a lot easier for developers to discover, learn, and integrate with Web APIs.I also think they have a lot more potential, beyond the developer community.Non-developers can use an API explorer to make calls against an API, retrieve JSON, and then use tools like Google Spreadsheets to process responses, building visualizations, and so on.</p>
