{% include JB/setup %}<p>Image Credit - Wiki Noticia Adam Duvander (@adamd) reported at ProgrammableWeb today that they rolled over 6,000 public APIs in the directory.The pace at which companies are launching public APIs is accelerating, with the last 1,000 added in just 3 months.Any of us in the space knows that this is just the tip of the iceberg, and Adam acknowledges that internal API usage is a major factor in API growth.While public APIs get all the major press, there are many private API initiatives that won’t see the light of day.So my question is, how are we going to track on the growth of private APIs along with public APIs?</p>
