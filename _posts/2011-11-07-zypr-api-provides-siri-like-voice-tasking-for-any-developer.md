{% include JB/setup %}<p>Pioneer Corporation just announced the availability of Zypr™, a new voice-powered API that provides a conversational, voice-control command API allowing developers to integrate Siri like functionality into their own applications.The Zypr API provides a single RESTful API for developers to access voice UI, maps and routing, local search, social networking, music and radio, contacts, calendars and weather from multiple service providers, including: Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yelp, AccuWeather, INRIX real-time and predictive traffic information, Slacker Radio, Tuner2 Radio, Wcities, xAd and VoiceBox.I’ve covered unified and aggregate APIs in the past, where within maturing industries like social and cloud computing, service providers are stepping up with a single API to work with multiple providers.Zypr is similar in that it offers a single API for multiple providers, but uses voice as the mechanism for search.Zypyr’s goal is to normalize, stable and voice-enhanced method for accessing a wide array of constantly changing APIs, Zypr can reduces the impact of service-specific API changes.</p>
