<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Code-Value-Reliability.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I've written about the [essential building blocks necessary for a successful API][1], and there are other great posts like, [What Developers Say About API Documentation][2] from Peter Gruenbaum of [SDK Bridge][3].

Everyone seems pretty unanimous that a RESTful API, with simple and complete documentation, qualitiy code samples in the popular languages, and real API support from the owner and the community are the ingredients for a successful API.

Iparticipatedin a chat about APIs on Twitter, where amix of API influencers, owners, advocates, evangelists and developers hung out for about an hour, answering questions posed by [@retailigence][4]. Overall there were about seven questions asked, but the second one was simple, and thought provoking:

_What is the most important characteristic of an API?_

The [common building blocks][5] were rattled off (by myself included): REST, quality documentation, code samples, while other said more innovative things like API explorer or [Masherys I/O Docs][6]. Then [@infochimps][7] said **_reliability _**
