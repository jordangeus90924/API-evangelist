{% include JB/setup %}<p>We hear a lot of talk about companies that were pioneers in the API space.In an ongoing series we want to try to document the story behind these pioneers, and we are calling it History of APIs.So far weve covered what we consider the early innovators of the modern web API: Salesforce - February, 2000 Ebay - November, 2000 Amazon E-Commerce - July, 2002 We call this the birth period of the modern API movement.Salesforce, Ebay, and Amazon were the leaders of this movement and set the stage for the social period of the modern API movement.The social period had one clear pioneer: Flickr - February, 2004 Flickr was the clear leader in redefining what APIs could be used for, and establishing the RESTful movement with their dead simple API.</p>
