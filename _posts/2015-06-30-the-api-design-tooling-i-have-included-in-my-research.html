<p>I am going through each of my research projects, and tightening things down, now that I have them all driven through my new, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">master stack of APIs</a>. First up was <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/30/tightening-up-the-organizations-that-are-included-in-my-api-design-research/">the other day I spent time going through the organization I track on as part of my API design research</a>, and today mission was to refine the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">tooling section</a>.
<p>Previously my tooling page was just an alphabetical list of tools, and I wanted to at least group things in a more meaningful way, reflecting how I break them down in my own monitoring system. So I reworked the publishing to allow me to group the tools by tags, resulting in the following list:
<div class="page">
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<h2>API Blueprint</h2>

<td align="left" valign="top"><a id="home-logo-link-727" href="https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/tool/bw-api-blueprint-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="left" /></a><a id="home-name-link-727" href="https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/"><strong>API Blueprint</strong></a>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A couple of semantic assumptions over the plain Markdown. API Blueprint is perfect for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read &ndash; after all it is just a form of plain text. API Blueprint, its parser, and most of its tools are completely open sourced so you don't have to worry about vendor lock-in. This also means you can freely integrate API Blueprint into any type of product, commercial or not.
