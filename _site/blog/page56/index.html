        <span class="post-date">27 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ITTC_PersonalDataNewAsset_Report_2011.pdf" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-economic-forum/world-economic-forum-personal-data-cover.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm immersed in deep thought around my personal data, asking some important <a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">questions about my digital self</a>--which includes the state of my online personal data.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/12/14-trends-for-2013.html">14 big trends to watch in 2013</a>, by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>), I got immersed in <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ITTC_PersonalDataNewAsset_Report_2011.pdf">World Economic Forums Personal Data: The Emergence of a New Asset Class</a> paper.</p>
<p>I'm still processing all of my thoughts around the paper, but one statement really stands out:</p>
<blockquote><em>The issues surrounding personal data &ndash; political, technological and commercial alike &ndash; are numerous and complex. The choices stakeholders make today will influence the personal data ecosystem for years to come.</em></blockquote>
<p>The World Economic Forum then outlines five key area that require action:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Innovate around user-centricity and trust. The personal data ecosystem will be built on the trust and control individuals have in sharing their data. From a technological, policy and sociological sense all stakeholders need to embrace this construct. One particular area of focus is the continued testing and promoting of &ldquo;trust frameworks&rdquo; that explore innovative approaches for identity assurance at Internet scale</li>
<li>Define global principles for using and sharing personal data. Given the lack of globally accepted policies governing the use and exchange of personal data, an international community of stakeholders should articulate and advance core principles of a user-centric personal data ecosystem. These pilots should invite real-world input from a diverse group of individuals who can not only articulate the values, needs and desires of end users, but also the complex and contextual nuances involved in revealing one&rsquo;s digital identity</li>
<li>Strengthen the dialog between regulators and the private sector. Building on a collective sense of fundamental principles for creating a balanced ecosystem, public and private stakeholders should actively collaborate as the ecosystem begins to take shape. Those responsible for building and deploying the tools (the technologists) should more closely align with those making the rules (regulators)</li>
<li>Focus on interoperability and open standards. With the appropriate user controls and legal infrastructure in place, innovations in how personal data moves throughout the value chain will be a key driver for societal and economic value creation. Enabling a secure, trusted, reliable and open infrastructure (both legal and technical) will be vital. Participants should identify best practices and engage with standards bodies, advocacy groups, think tanks and various consortia on the user-centric approaches required to scale the value of personal data</li>
<li>Continually share knowledge. It&rsquo;s a huge challenge for entities to keep up with new research, policies and commercial developments. To stay current, stakeholders should share insights and learnings on their relevant activities, from both successes as well as failures. After all, the ecosystem&rsquo;s promise is about the tremendous value created when individuals share information about who they are and what they know. Clearly, this principle should also apply to practitioners within the development community</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether its social networks or education and healthcare, personal data will be a major driver of API adoption in 2013.  Personal data is at the heart of the recent social and mobile movements, and there are very serious illnesses in how we buy and sell personal data in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I agree with Alex Howard, that personal data ownership will be big issue in 2013, and intrigued by the World Economic Forums insight on personal data, it asks a lot of great questions--questions that we need bring mainstream in 2013.</p>

<p>The end of the year is a great time to reflect--looking back at the year with a desire to quantify and understand ourselves.</p>
<p>With our increasingly digital (social, cloud, mobile, APIs) lives, there are more opportunities than ever to ask our digital self very specific questions, and with the power the API get an answer back.</p>
<p>Over the holidayz, I spent some time asking some questions I wanted to know about my world in 2012--things that were important to me, and help me feel healthy, happy, accomplished and ultimately successful. (aka.&nbsp;<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html" target="_blank">Optimize for Happiness</a>)</p>

<p>This is all a work in progress. &nbsp;I wanted a list that could evolve, but I could use as a framework for actually answering some of these questions--either annually or real-time if possible, using APIs.</p>
<p>To facilitate this process, I've <a title="Personal Data Questions" href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">published as project on Github</a>. &nbsp;I will be publishing all the questions I ask, and their solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I've been able to use <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and answer a number of critical questions about 2012 using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Google--via the <a href="http://singly.com">Singly API</a>.</p>
<p>If you have questions you'd like asked, you can visit my <a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">personal data questions project</a> and comment via Disqus or if you want, you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/personal-data-questions">fork and contribute</a> your own questions and API driven solutions.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/22/amazing-visuals-but-lack-of-api-imagination/">Amazing Visuals, But Lack of API Imagination</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/earth-as-art/desolation-canyon.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was scrolling through my feeds today and I came across, "<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/earth_art_detail.html">Earth As Art</a>" from NASA.  I clicked on the homepage and didn&rsquo;t think much, and moved on.  Then I came across <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2012/12/21/earth-as-art-from-nasa/">Earth as Art book from NASA on Flowing Data</a>, where they showed an actual image from the &ldquo;Earth As Art&rdquo; collection.</p>
<p>Sure, I suffer from ADD.  But so does much of the world.  I work through huge amounts of data on a daily basis, looking for gems.  Sometimes I can find them myself, and sometimes I need help.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Earth as Art&rdquo; is an amazing collection of satellite photos from NASA.   I feel the entire collection could be made into an exhibit, allowing us to experience, take in and discuss the meaning of art, created from space of the planet we live on.</p>
<p>I also feel NASA&rsquo;s Earth as Art I think is a poster boy example of how APIs can open up and provide access to content, but also work as conduit for syndication, sharing, remixing and expression around content the owner may not have been able to see.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/earth_art_detail.html">deployment of the Earth as Art collection at NASA</a> has a title, description and meaningless photo thumbnail--accompanied by a <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/703154main_earth_art-ebook.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nasa-earth-as-art/id577527077?mt=8">iPad app</a>.  Obviously NASA saw the value in delivering an iPad app, and making the content accessible to the masses via a PDF.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the images I want to create something that would share, syndicate and bring awareness to their beauty.  My hands are immediately tied, with only a PDF and iPad app--I am not equipped with the tools of a developer.</p>
<p>If there were simply a JSON file of all images, titles, locations and details. Before I got to work, I looked around, but couldn&rsquo;t find any raw data for the project.  So I created <a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/earth-as-art/gh-pages/data/photos.json">my own JSON representation</a> of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/703154main_earth_art-ebook.pdf">Earth as Art PDF</a>.</p>
<p>JSON output is so much more valuable than PDF output.  It took me about 2 hours to reverse engineer the Earth as Art PDF and render as images and text.  Now, equipped with the parts and pieces of the Earth as Art content, with JSON file as a framework--I can get to work creating several, more interactive representations of the satellite imagery.</p>
<p>Before I create any visualizations, I need a place to put my project.  No better place than <a href="/admin/blog/http:/github.com">Github</a>.  I can use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host my project and with a JSON file as my data source, I can easily use <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> to display the images and allow for basic browsing.</p>
<p>Instead of a single, static PDF--I now have all my images and the title, details, location and paths in a JSON file I can render the content in any way I want:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>HTML Templates</strong> - Using JSON + Mustache I can view images on a listing with detail pages</li>
<li><strong>Deck.js Presentation </strong>- Create a presentation in markdown using the satellite imagery and content, laid out using the deck.js framework</li>
<li><strong>Widgets</strong> - Develop several, embeddable, syndicatable JavaScript widgets that are driven from the JSON file</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/earth-as-art/great-salt-desert.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Having the Earth as a Art assets stored as individual images with name, details, location and image paths as JSON allows me build my own HTML display, presentations and widgets around the content.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank">Hosting the Earth as Art project at Github</a> allows me to provide simple, inexpensive, open hosting for the data, content and display elements--allowing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span> to fork, download and remix and even choose to contribute back.</p>
<p>As another project, I can explore the licensing, branding and other aspects that will ensure the creators of the content (NASA), get the attribution they deserve for creating such amazing content.</p>
<p>When I first saw the Earth as Art pictures this morning, I couldn&rsquo;t get over the fact that they weren&rsquo;t in a format that allowed for remix, sharing and syndication.  The images are amazing and really lend themselves for infinite presentations and interpretations.</p>
<p>Hopefully the project will only grow from here.</p>

<p>140 Proof launched the shirt at the Twitter Chirp Conference, and I think it is a classic, that should never go away.</p>
<p>I'm ordering one for christmas!</p>

<p>These areas reflect the patterns I'm seeing, and while some API owners or API service providers may fall into one or many of these areas, I've broken them down into, what I feel are meaningful groups that will help me explain the future of APIs to the masses. &nbsp;With a goal of demonstrating the value, power and importance of APIs.</p>
<p>If you feel there are other trends I'm missing, patterns I'm not seeing or companies that are doing cool stuff in these areas, please let me know. &nbsp;As with all of API Evangelist, these new sections are a work in progress--help it grow.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">History of APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a title="History of APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/history/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-History.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The history of APIs is something I discuss a lot. &nbsp;The history of modern web APIs is something I include in all my talks, and I'm always surprised by how little people understand some of the more popular APIs that got us to where we are at.</p>
<p>To further support this area, I've launched a <a title="History of APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/history/">History of APIs</a> section where I've hung the stories I've already done in this area, and will be looking to dig up the history on other APIs that are shaking things up.</p>
<p>When I'm talking to people about APIs, the term APIs can mean many different things. Sometimes it means hardware APIs, or the Java API or various other technical incarnations. Right now when you hear the term API, it probably means web API or an API built using REST, running on the same infrastructure the World Wide Web runs on.</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, I strongly feel that to understand where we are, we need to understand the short, modern history of the web APIs. There are several patterns to why the modern web API movement has worked, that I think you can take home and use in your own API strategy.</p>
<h2>Commerce</h2>
<p>While modern web APIs were officially born with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm" target="_blank">Roy Fieldings dissertation Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures in 2000</a>--Web APIs first appeared in the wild with the&nbsp;<a title="Saleforce" href="/history/salesforce.php">introduction of Salesforce</a>&nbsp;on February 7th, when the company officially launched its API at the IDG Demo 2000 conference. Salesforce was an enterprise-class, web-based, sales force automation as a "Internet as a service", with XML APIs were part of Salesforce.com from day one.</p>

<p>Later in the year, on November 20, 2000,&nbsp;<a title="eBay" href="/history/ebay.php">eBay launched the eBay Application Program Interface (API)</a>, along with the eBay Developers Program--which was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers.</p>

<p>Then on July 16, 2002,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon E-Commerce" href="/history/amazon.php">Amazon launched Amazon.com Web Services</a>&nbsp;allowing developers to incorporate Amazon.com content and features into their own web sites.

<p>The modern Web API movement was kicked off. But for some reason it didn't gain the momentum we see today, whether it was due to the "dotcom" bubble bursting or other things werent quite ready--web APIs wouldn't get traction until things got social.</p>
<h2>Social</h2>
<p>In February 2004 the popular photo sharing site Flickr launched. Six months later&nbsp;<a title="Flickr" href="/history/flickr.php">they launched their now infamous API</a>, and six months after that, they were acquired by Yahoo. The launch of the RESTful API helped Flickr quickly become the image platform of choice for the early blogging and social media movement by allowing users to easily embed their Flickr photos into their blogs and social network streams. While allowing Flickr to focus on a&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/" target="_blank">new approach to business development using web APIs</a>.</p>

<p>Then on August 15th 2006,&nbsp;<a title="Facebook" href="/history/facebook.php">Facebook launched its long-awaited development platform and API</a>.

<p>One month later on September 20, 2006&nbsp;<a title="Twitter" href="/history/twitter.php">Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world</a>. Much like the release of the eBay API, Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating rogue APIs.</p>

<p>At the same time Facebook and Twitter were playing with the social powers of web APIs, Google was exploring the power of web APIs supporting embeddable tools and apps. The&nbsp;<a title="Google Maps" href="/history/google-maps.php">Google Maps API launched was just shy of 6 months after the release of Google Maps as an application</a>, and was in direct response to the number of rogue applications developed that were hacking the application. Google Maps was immediately so popular that developers hacked the JavaScript interface and developed application such as housingmaps.com and chicagocime.org.</p>

<p>At this point web APIs were showing the power of the Internet when it came to sharing, making things embeddable and social. Web APIs still were perceived as "hobby" by mainstream business. You couldn't take care of business...yet.</p>
<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>As APIs were generating social buzz across the Internet, Amazon saw the potential of an&nbsp;<a title="RESTful approach to business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/" target="_blank">RESTful approach to business</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/" target="_blank">internalized and saw APIs in a way that nobody had seen them before</a>--giving re-birth to an Amazon Web Services that was much, much more than just e-commerce.</p>
<p>In March, 2006 Amazon launched a new web service, something completely different from the Amazon bookseller and e-commerce site we've come to know. This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="/history/amazon-s3.php">Amazon S3</a>. Amazon S3 which provided a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="/history/amazon-s3.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>Six month later, shortly after launching Amazon S3, Amazon followed with a new cloud computing service dubbed&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2" href="/history/amazon-ec2.php">Amazon EC2</a>&nbsp;or Elastic Compute Cloud. Amazon EC2 provided resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing developers to launch different sizes of virtual servers within Amazon data centers. Just like its predecessor Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 was just a RESTful API. Amazon wouldn't launch a web interface for another three years.</p>
<p>With cloud computing, web APIs got real. You could now deploy global infrastructure using APIs. It wasn't just about social fun anymore, you could actually run your business using APIs.</p>
<p>Even with this new found power of API driven cloud computing, it would take one more essential ingredient before web APIs were ready for the prime time.</p>
<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>With everyone focused on social and the cloud, a new device emerged, and much like social and cloud, would prove to be a game changer. In June of 2009 Apple launched the iPhone 3G, the App Store began allowing iPod Touch and iPhone owners to download applications through the iTunes desktop software or the App Store on their iPhones--opening up entirely new world of mobile applications, one that APIs would be the driving force.</p>
<p>Soon after the launch of the iPhone, in March 2009&nbsp;<a title="Foursquare" href="/history/foursquare.php">Foursquare launched</a>&nbsp;at the SXSW interactive festival in Austin, TX. Foursquare was a location-based mobile platform that makes cities more interesting to explore, by checking in via a smartphone app or SMS, users share their location with friends while collecting points and virtual badges. This new type of mobile app, utilized APIs to allow developers to deliver a new generation of location aware, API driven applications, feeding the growing app economy.</p>

<p>The mobile evolution of the Internet was under way, and the following year on October 6, 2010,<a title="Instagram" href="/history/instagram.php">Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone application</a>. Less than three months later, it had one million users. Kevin Systrom the founder of Instagram focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application. In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/" target="_blank">built his own unofficial Instagram API</a>&nbsp;on top of private Instagram APIs. By&nbsp;<a href="/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/" target="_blank">January Instagram shut down the rogue API, announcing that it was building one of its own</a>.</p>
<p>The appetite for API resources to drive mobile has only grown with the introduction of the iPad tablet and the growth of the Android and Windows mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Mobile was the finalize piece of the digital strategy puzzle, which included commerce, social and cloud--all required before the original vision of web APIs could be realized.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Web APIs got their start in early e-commerce on the Internet, but without social, a scalable cloud backend and a ubiquitous mobile devices--APIs weren't ready for prime time. In 2012, we reached that point.</p>
<p>Every company needs a healthy digital strategy for success in 2013, which includes sensible uses of social, cloud, mobile--all depending upon APIs. While there are plenty of other APIs to learn from, we can learn a lot from the history of modern web APIs, and these early web API pioneers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/scripting-platforms.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand the emerging patterns of of how APIs used, work through the details, and grasp the differences in competing approaches--in hopes of identifying <a title="what is next when it comes to web APIs" href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">what is next when it comes to web APIs</a>.</p>
<p>One trend I&rsquo;m tracking on is the emergence of API scripting platforms.  This is a difficult are to track on, because we script against APIs all the time, right? This is different.  Scripting platforms are providing platforms and libraries to support easily scripting against multiple APIs.</p>
<p>To help me understand this new approach to using APIs I&rsquo;m studying three separate approaches:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a></strong> - Authentication, integration and scripting platform.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a></strong> - Beyond&nbsp;code snippets, into ready-to-use processes, that simply API integration, taking care of authentication, credential management, updates and more</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">Google Apps Scripts</a></strong> -&nbsp;<span>A JavaScript cloud scripting language that lets you extend Google Apps, integrate 3rd party services and build mobile and web applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these platforms are bringing together valuable API resources, from multiple sources into not just a common interface, but providing a language library you can use to build apps efficiently across multiple API resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working to understand the nuances of each approach. For example, Google provides its JavaScript like, stripped down language, where Webshell focuses on JavaScript and CoffeeScript.  Temboo provides ready to go processes or what they call choreos, with language SDKs in Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby and Python.</p>
<p>Google Apps Script provides access to Google APIs and services, but recently opened up scripts to acts as connectors, that can be developed by 3rd party providers.  Temboo has over 100 APIs in its library, while Webshell is just getting going with less than 25.</p>
<p>I see what Webshell, Temboo and Google are doing as similar to the aggregation, integration and some times automation we are seeing in other trending API areas, but these approaches are actually building languages that allow you to be more expressive with not just single APIs, but fluently with many APIs at once.</p>
<p>This area is new and emerging, and I&rsquo;m still working to understand the different approaches.  let me know if you if you have anything I should be looking at or other thoughts. &nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/Manufacturing_supply_chain.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist. &nbsp;One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some fun research, and <a href="/2011/05/18/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011</a>. &nbsp;This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:</span></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Creators" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--the-creators/">Creators</a></strong>&nbsp;- 3D designers of virtual print objects</li>
<li><strong><a title="Scanners" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--3d-scanners/">Scanners</a></strong>&nbsp;- Scanning hardware for generating 3D models</li>

<li><strong><a title="File Formats" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--files--formats/">File Formats</a></strong>&nbsp;- File formats for storing 3D models</li>
<li><strong><a title="Warehousing" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--virtual-warehousing/">Warehousing</a></strong>&nbsp;- Virtual storage for 3D models</li>
<li><strong><a title="Marketplaces" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--marketplaces/">Marketplaces</a></strong>&nbsp;- Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products</li>
<li><strong><a title="Printers" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printers--printers/">Printers</a></strong>&nbsp;- Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing</li>
<li><strong><a title="Process &amp; Materials" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--process--materials/">Process &amp; Materials</a></strong>&nbsp;- The process and materials that go into 3D printing</li>
<li><strong><a title="Makers" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--makers/">Makers</a></strong>&nbsp;- The people who understand 3D printers, process, materials and industries</li>
<li><strong><a title="Delivery" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--delivery/">Delivery</a></strong>&nbsp;- Logistics behind getting 3D printed products to consumers</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.</span><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-manufacturing.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This series was just to help me understand the major components, and I will do another series on how APIs can impact these areas. &nbsp;</span>I also have a summary post on&nbsp;<a title="ProgrammableWeb.com" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb.com</a>&nbsp;about the role of APIs in 3D printing.</p>
<p><span>3D Printing is something I will be talking about a lot in 2013. &nbsp;I think all of these areas I laid out have the potential to be radically transformed by APIs. &nbsp;I will be taking my original research on 3D printing from 2011 and see where I can evolve it based upon what is going on in the 3D printing space in 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">number of available APIs is growing at a neck breaking speed</a>.  I have trouble keeping up with individual APIs, and I feel I am losing touch with the nuances and trends within specific areas like music or travel.</p>
<p>I am getting more and more questions like this via email and twitter:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>I am doing some research on music APIs. I am considering using one to integrate music streaming and relevant data into an app.  Can you recommend anyone who has technical or business expertise (or both) with these in particular?  I would love to speak with an expert to help lead me and my developers in the right direction.  Some points I am considering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Technical capabilities (streaming speed, limitations of service, etc.)</li>
<li>Access to support from API parent company</li>
<li>Business opportunities or restrictions that arise when relying on the API</li>
</ul>
</em></blockquote>
<p>These are concerns that might be shared with other industries, but knowing the music industry--there are plenty of unique issues developers encounter when building applications and businesses around music APIs.</p>
<p>Back in February, I did write on how <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/15/emi-helps-developers-navigate-building-apps-for-music-industry/">EMI is helping developers navigate building apps for the music industry</a>, but beyond just shedding light on what others are doing, I don&rsquo;t have the time to specialize in the details of how APIs are transforming the music industry.</p>
<p>There is a huge need for more professionals to step up within specific industries and develop the domain expertise necessary to make sure APIs are being deployed with the proper technical, business and political building blocks, and help developers understand how to navigate the nuances of a particular industry being transformed by web APIs.</p>
<p>Could you be this person, feel free to connect with me. &nbsp;I see a desperate need for experts in the music industry, education, health care, government and other fast moving business sectors.</p>

<p>I had a chance to talk with the <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/content/us/en.html">Johnson Controls</a>, <a title="Panoptix API" href="https://developer.panoptix.com/">Panoptix API</a> team this last week.  The <a href="http://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix&reg; community</a>&nbsp;offers:</p>
<blockquote><em>a combination of software and services that easily and cost-effectively helps customers see more so they can do more to achieve optimized building performance and energy efficiency</em></blockquote>
<p>To understand what Panoptix enables...imagine if all of our buildings:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Thought for themselves</li>
<li>Teach us to reduce energy consumption</li>
<li>Diagnose problems in real-time</li>
<li>Self correct when necessary</li>
<li>Call a service provider when they need repair or tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>Panoptix starts with a cloud-hosted platform that enables buildings to collect and manage data, along with tools for automating operations at the building and space levels providing metering for electricity, water, gas oil steam, carbon and weather--with very granular level reporting up to overall trends of energy use.</p>
<p>To grow Panoptix, Johnson Controls introduced a <a title="marketplace" href="http://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix/apps">marketplace of apps</a> combined with supporting news, information, resources and entire community dedicated to building performance and efficiency management.</p>
<p>This marketplace and community is driven by an&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.panoptix.com/">API developer area</a>, allowing anyone to <a href="https://developer.panoptix.com/signup/">sign up</a> and get to work developing apps and start selling them in the Panoptix marketplace.  The Panoptix API is free to use for anyone looking to developer one app, allowing you to collect 70% of revenue from app sales in the marketplace (an essential ingredient for developer success).</p>
<p>I like Johnson Controls approach to building a community around building management applications, data and resources--complete with a API driven developer area.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great to see a 125 year old company open up their hardware and software with such an innovative approach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be digging further into how <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/content/us/en.html">Johnsons Controls</a> deployed the Panoptix API, with further entries to this blog series, and a full case study on their approach to delivering their API driven building management platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Dec 2012</span>

<p>Some great <a title="API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier" href="http://startupjuicer.com/2012/12/wade-foster-co-founder-ceo-of-zapier/">API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier</a> over at <a title="Startup Juicer" href="http://startupjuicer.com/">Startup Juicer</a> today.</p>
<p><strong>Zapier is a company that couldn&rsquo;t have existed even a few years ago as API&rsquo;s were not commonplace. What other advanced do you envision changing the way businesses operate?</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>APIs are just the first piece, but it&rsquo;s still the wild west in the API world with APIs constantly changing. One thing that will happen is APIs will move away from polling driven to push driven. That way API consumers don&rsquo;t have to constantly asking providers for new data like a kid on a long trip asking &ldquo;are we there yet&rdquo; but can instead rely on the API provider to send us the data when we get to the proverbial travel destination.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>What your thoughts are about the changing landscape of API access with some of the free big networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin are becoming increasingly restrictive in the way they allow developers to access their feeds?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://startupjuicer.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/startup-juicer/startup-juicer.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>The only services I&rsquo;m seeing become more restrictive in how they allow developers to use their APIs are free tools. Many those services are in the high growth stage and are starting to think about monetization and are experimenting with lots of different ways to make money. Unfortunately this means instability for developers. Zapier leans heavily B2B though. And B2B services are doubling down on their APIs. For them, more usage of the API leads to more usage of the core product and since their core product is a paid service that means more paying users and the paying users are upgrading to higher plans. That means a service like Zapier is highly valuable to both API providers and to consumers alike.</em></blockquote>

        <span class="post-date">12 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/oc-hackerz/oc-hackerz-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I started tracking on Hackathons full time in 2011, as part of my API Evangelism toolbox.  In 2012 I&rsquo;ve watched <a title="Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/10/08/458-hackathons-in-the-united-states-so-far-in-2012/">Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers</a>.  (if done right)</p>
<p>As I do with other trending areas, I launched as its own site, <a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>.   I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of demand from hackathon organizers and sponsors to add events and other news and information.  To support this I recently <a title="Open Sourced Hack Weekends on Github" href="/2012/12/08/open-sourcing-hack-weekends-using-github/">launched Hack Weekends on Github</a>, so anyone can edit pages, write blog posts and add events to the calendar.  A sort of crowd sourced hackathon hub.</p>
<p>To further support the hackathon community I also wanted to provide an <a title="open source hackathon guide" href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">open source hackathon guide</a>, helping anyone understand how they can throw their own hackathon.  There were already two great hackathon guides out there which are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit">Open Data Hackathon How to Guide</a> and <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hack Day Manifesto</a>---both licensed openly.  So I took this excellent material and merged with my own material to create a <a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">Hack Weekends Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The Hack Weekends guide provides a very detail guide to throwing a hackathon, and I also included a <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">website template that runs on Github Pages</a> using Jekyll.  My goal is to make it a plug-n-play guide with all the tools and resources you need to be successful in your communities hackathon</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/hackathon-home-2.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Next I need to actually prove my &ldquo;open source&rdquo; approach to planning, designing and marketing hackathons.  I&rsquo;m planning several hackathons to make sure the process works.  The first hackathon I am planning is for <a title="OC Hackerz" href="http://www.meetup.com/OCHackerz/">OC Hackerz</a> in Orange County, California.  OC Hackerz is a big supporter of developers, and is in sync with my vision of what the hackathon space should look like, so they are a great partner to plan two initial hackathons:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="OC Hackerz Hackathon Los Angeles" href="http://kinlane.github.com/oc-hackerz-hackathon/">OC Hackerz Hackathon - Los Angeles - March 2013</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The planning of the OC Hackerz Hackathon is meant to be an exploratory deployment of the Hack Weekends Guide, intended to make hackathon planning an open and collaborative process between organizers, sponsors and the local stakeholders.</p>
<p>Hack Weekends is all a work in progress.  So I&rsquo;m lookiking for feedback.  If you&rsquo;d like to get involved in hackathons or use the Hack Weekends process yourself, feel free to reach out.   The platform already has other supports such Singly, AT&amp;T and Hacker League.  My vision is to have everyone in the community contributing.</p>

<p>Singly is weaving together the most critical of social and personal APIs into an AppFabric, that developers can use to build the next generation of API driven mobile apps.</p>
<p>As a developer, you won't think of development with single APIs anymore like <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a>. &nbsp;You can use AppFabric to build meaningful apps, knowing the social authentication, friends, sharing, photos and other objects across the multiple networks is at your disposal in a single, standardized interface.</p>
<p><a title="Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data" href="https://singly.com/">Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data</a>, that developers can use to build the apps that we depend upon ever day.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/11/mulesoft-launches-api-discovery-hub/">Mulesoft Launches API Discovery Hub</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/mulesoft-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API Discovery is becoming an increasingly troubling problem.  As an analyst, I see a dizzying amount of APIs each month.   When I get asked to find a particular type of API, or group of APIs in a particular industry--it gets difficult to discover a meaningful results to any query.</p>
<p>My options for API discovery historically has been <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  The OG API Directory.</p>
<p>Today there is a new player on the block, <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a>.  APIhub is a fresh attempt at solving the API discovery, with over 13K APIs organized by category, type, protocol, format and security.</p>
<p>API Hub is looking to provide a solution for two distinct groups:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Developers</strong> - Developers need an ecosystem to discover, learn, test and use APIs</li>
<li><strong>Publishers</strong> - Publishers require a platform to publish, manage, engage customers, and monetize APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>With first release APIhub&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have much out of the gate that is different than <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, except for a much cleaner layout, search tools that is not cluttered by news, mashups and advertising.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apihub.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Once you explore APIhub further, you start seeing early signs of deeper features.  When you add or claim your API, your given the option to upload a API spec in a Swagger or WADL format, with more formats coming soon.  If implemented for all 13K APIs, this could be a powerful discovery engine.</p>
<p>Beyond programmatic discovery I see hints of ranking on the platform.  Right now its just 5 star ranking, but have hopes for more sophistication on how developers, publishers and analysts can rank APIs in the future.  Allowing consumers to find new and existing APIs in meaningful ways--other than just 5 star ranking or my number of followers and mashups built on an API would be extremeley valuable.</p>
<p>APIhub, marketplace or directory is nothing new.  You see folks like <a href="http://apis.io/apis">APIs.io</a> trying to step up with a directory and startups like <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> providing a hub of their own, in a similar attempt to create an API marketplace.</p>
<p>I think there are several things that will decide whether <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a> is successful and it will center around their ranking and discovering algorithm, but also their ability to attract API owners to come, claim and enhance their listings.  But more importantly can APIhub and Mulesoft get developers to care and participate in curating, ranking and consuming APIs via the new APIhub? &nbsp;Just like the web API movement, developers will make or break APIhub. &nbsp;If it add values to developers worlds, they'll embrace it--if not, APIhub will have hard time staying relevant.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/"><img style="padding: 15xp;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/Hack-Weekends-Guide-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Hackathons have been a big part of current web API movement.  They are one of the most meaningful ways API owners can connect with developers in person. &nbsp;Twilio, Amazon and Facebook have all used hackathons to build their ecosystems.</p>
<p>I started a section on API Evangelist in 2011, dedicated to hackathons. And in early 2012 I rolled this section out as its own site, hackweekends.com. &nbsp;Over 2012 the number of hackathons has grown significantly--making it difficult to ignore hackathons as channel for reaching developers.</p>
<p>This weekend I <a href="/2012/12/08/open-sourcing-hack-weekends-using-github/">migrated the Hack Weekends directory to run on Github</a>.  It uses <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for the blog.  I deployed <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache templates</a> and JSON files for the events calendar and curated news section.  I&rsquo;m working on ways to easily crowdsource the management of Hack Weekends, while establishing it as an open source hub for the hackathon community.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing Hack Weekends as a hub for the community, I wanted to create a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">guide to throwing hackathons</a>.  So anyone can organize their own event. To help feed this, I&rsquo;ve been gathering my own research on hackathons from attending, mentoring, hacking and organizing hackathons over last 2 years.</p>
<p>I also knew that there was other really good information available from other hackathon experts.  So I pulled together the best, open information on throwing hackathons and combined it with my own research.  Pulling content from:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit">Open Data Hackathon How to Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hack Day Manifesto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With this content and my experience I wanted to organize into something more.  Remixing and setting into motion,  a guide that anyone can use to organize a hackathon.</p>
<p>While maintaining the calendar for Hack Weekends, I see a lot of hackathon sites.  To accompany the Hack Weekends Guide I wanted <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">hackathon organizers to be able to easily deploy a website in support of the event</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://hackweekends.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hackweekends/hackweekends-logo.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">Hack Weekends Guide</a> comes with a <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">hackathon website template </a>as part of the Github repository.  So all you have to do is fork the Hack Weekends Guide, and you get a detailed guide in addition to a website. It is up to you, which parts of the guide you will use--as little or as much as you feel necessary.</p>
<p>The Hack Weekends directory, guide and website is meant to be community owned.  You can deploy any hackathon with the guide and site, and participate in marketing your hackathons using Hack Weekends and other partner sites.</p>
<p>I will be using the model to deploy 5 hackathons in the coming months, to contribute my own content and data, I hope you will get involved too!  I look forward to your feedback and hackathon expertise.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/enterprise-business.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>At the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas, NV last week I discussed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"grass-roots web API movement"</em></span> with quite a few enterprise folks.  Walking through the exhibit floor, where I did my <a href="/2012/11/30/my-api-building-blocks-workshop-with-intel-at-the-gartner-aadi-conference/">building blocks of an API workshop</a>, I noticed the signage and discussions were all focused on APIs.</p>
<p>During my discussions with multiple enterprise developers, analysts, architects and executives, one question seemed to come up a lot:  <strong><em>Didn&rsquo;t we do all of this 10 years ago?  What is different this time around?</em></strong></p>
<p>With a strong focus on the technology of web services, many in the enterprise fail to see the difference between SOA and API.  In an effort to better tell stories in this area, I wanted to revisit the SOAP vs. REST argument, and refresh my thoughts. &nbsp;So I got to work pulling up old stories, and while conducting my research I noticed the same patterns I see in the REST debates--a heavy focus on the technical, with only a few discussions of the business and politics of web services.</p>
<p>If you are new to the SOAP vs. REST debate, let me get you up to speed.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">Wikipedia defines SOAP</a> as:</p>
<blockquote><em>SOAP, originally defined as Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em> SOAP was designed as an object-access protocol in 1998 by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein for Microsoft, with a specification of SOAP currently maintained by the XML Protocol Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>After SOAP was first introduced, it became the underlying layer of a more complex set of Web Services, based on Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI). </em></blockquote>
<p>SOAP, XML and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Service">Web Services</a> are all part of earlier approach to APIs which is widely considered to be called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a> (SOA).  While SOA is still used in enterprise environments, it is considered in open developer circles to have been a failure in comparison to API efforts in the more grassroots, popular web API approach employed by companies like Flickr, Twitter and Amazon.</p>
<p>I will spare you much of technical detail of the SOAP vs. REST debate, but the the main advantages of a web API approach are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Simple and Lightweight</li>
<li>Human Readable Results</li>
<li>Easy to Build and Consume</li>
</ul>
<p>The SOAP advantages are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Rigid, Well Defined and Adhering to a Contract</li>
<li>Wide Variety of Development tools</li>
<li>Agreed Upon Standard</li>
</ul>
<p>SOAP is a very well defined, strict technical, industry defined set of rules for approaching APIs.  To the enterprise, SOAP and a SOA approaches appears to be the proper solution for the exchange of structured information.</p>
<p>But around 2003, outside the enterprise, we started seeing a shift in how developers viewed web services.  According to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3005">Tim O&rsquo;Reilly of O&rsquo;Reilly Media</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Amazon has both SOAP and REST interfaces to their web services, and 85% of their usage is of the REST interface. Despite all of the corporate hype over the SOAP stack, this is pretty compelling evidence that developers like the simpler REST approach. </em></blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the next nine years we see this trend continue with <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/1-in-5-apis-say-bye-xml/">REST + JSON</a> growing in dominance, wrestling control over web services and the term API from a more SOAP + XML approach.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/enterprise-business-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>After re-reading much of the SOAP vs. REST debate this weekend, I see the same as with the REST debate, where much of the discussion is technical.  But there are some great statements on what contributee to the success of API over SOA.  From <a href="http://supunk.blogspot.com/2012/08/rest-vs-soap-adoption-perspective.html">Supun Kamburugamuva on Life of a Software Engineer blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>REST as a framework gives the developers exactly that. The freedom to innovate. Developers love that. As a framework REST introduces very few rules. Most of them are not even rules. Rather they are soft guidelines. So building a proper powerful REST API is an Art and a challenging task. In my opinion this makes it cool. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>This is completely opposite to SOAP. SOAP gives the developer all the rules. First thing about SOAP is you get a SOAP envelope where you have to put your data according to some rules. So from start to end the system is pretty well defined. There are standards for doing even the simplest things. Top of all this SOAP is very complex to understand. So in my opinion SOAP doesn't give user the nuts and bolts to innovate. Instead it gives a half baked solution that user has to obey. I guess not all developers like to bog down by rules and they don't like to learn that kind of rules as well.</em></blockquote>
<p>Martijn Linssen at&nbsp;CloudAve also had a great statement:</p>
<blockquote><em>SOAP was originally introduced to and by Microsoft, and was one in a range of futuristic machine-to-machine self-describing protocols. Needless to say, the world wasn&rsquo;t ready then, nor is it now. Current implementations of SOAP are arbitrary, proprietary, bi-lateral human agreements at best. In their worst form, SOAP implementations are dictated by governments and other bodies of power and bring nothing else to the other party but a cumbersome and hard-coupled interface</em></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion SOAP vs. REST is about Structure vs. Simplicity, Defined vs. Organic, Control vs. Open.  The differences aren&rsquo;t just technical.  As technologists we like to see things through a certain lense, add in capitalists and we can really have our blinders on.</p>
<p>There are a lot of lessons in the modern web API movement that the enterprise can learn from.  SOA and API have a lot of parallels in trying to facilitate the exchange of structured information between applications, but where they begin to differ is that SOA was born within industry and within an enterprise.  API was born on the open Internet, where it was able to get the oxygen it needed to grow.</p>
<p>My advice to the enterprise is when you look at adopting a web API approach over SOA approach, you look beyond just the technology and vendor solutions--you need to look at a lot of the more human elements that exist in the business and politics of APIs.  Consider essential elements like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Keep things small, modular and intuitive</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> - You should be widening access to your resources, not ever limiting</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong> -  While not everything should be 100% open, be as open as possible</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Provide insight into operations and your roadmap allowing consumers to operate in alignment</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Two way communication between you and your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Protect the privacy of your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong> - Be open to alternative licensing and ownership of content and data that is favorable to consumers</li>
<li><strong>Legal</strong> - Be as open as you can be with copyright, patents and trademark in API initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Terms</strong> - Establish terms of use that favor your business, but also the interests of consumers</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Acknowledge the monetization needs of your consumers</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the key ingredients in the grassroots recipe that so many companies are following when deploying web APIs.  A balance of technical, business and politics has been found and is currently being explored in the web API movement. You can see examples of both success and failure in these areas, with APIs like Amazon and Twitter. Both API providers have found success technologically, but took different approaches to business and politics, delivering very different results within their respective developer ecosystems.</p>
<p>There is a reason web APIs have found success on the open Internet.  Web APIs require a certain amount of &ldquo;open&rdquo; to be present in not just the technical, but also the business and political layers.  When embracing APIs,  make sure you understand the full scope of why API is different than SOA--then internalize this difference and make it part of how you conduct business internally, with partners and the public on the open Internet.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://hackweekends.com/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/Tag-Cloud-Hack-Weekends-Github.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been maintaining a calendar of hackathons for all of 2012.  Originally it was just a section off of <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, but eventually the site needed to be its own project.  Up until now its just been a blog and calendar of events I curate from Eventbrite, Twitter, Google, Eventful and event organizers.</p>
<p>I spend about 8-12 hours a week curating the events and stories for blog posts, and with the increase in the number hackathons over 2012, so does the time I need to maintain.  I was adding an API so other users can add to calendar or event guest post, then I decided I would like to also have databases of hackathon organizers, sponsors, vendors, venues and other key building blocks of hackathons.</p>
<p>My goal is to create an information hub for the hackathon community.  But an &ldquo;open API&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t seem like enough.  I wanted everything about it to be open and accessible, as well as community owned.  I decided to publish&nbsp;<a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com/index.html">Hack Weekends on Github</a> and run it like an open source project.</p>
<p>I launched the site using <a title="Github Pages" href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> with <a title="Jekyll" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.  These run the pages and blog for Hack Weekends. &nbsp;But, I needed something to run the calendar, and other systems.   I wanted them to be simple--I went with <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> + JSON stores.</p>
<p>The implementation isn't perfect.   I had problems getting search and sort tools to work, so I scaled back to a minimal viable implementation.  I got the following areas up:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Hackathon Calendar </strong>- Listing of hackathons global, sorted by city (for now)</li>
<li><strong>Cities Hackathon Directory</strong> - Breakdown of hackathons by cities</li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends Blog</strong> - Blog running on Jekyll, which I edit using prose.io</li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends News </strong>- Curated, relevant hackathon links from my pinboard</li>
</ul>
<p>I will get all the bells and whistles in there soon. Before that, I&rsquo;m working on a basic Github template for planning and executing a basic hackathon.  I would like to see hackathon organizers using a common, open approach to planning and delivering hackathons around the globe.  I&rsquo;m hoping it will work in conjunction with an open approach to Hack Weekends and other hackathon community sites.</p>
<p>Hack Weekends is a work in progress.  I went ahead and made it live, as its about 85% of what I had on the previous version.  Having it running as a completely client-side and static site on Github will force me to learn to approaches to manage my content and data in a way that is open and machine readable by default. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to fork <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends">Hack Weekends</a> and make contributions. &nbsp;You can add blog posts, news or calendar events. &nbsp;I will be building other client side tools for interacting with the site as time goes on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The second talk I did at API Days was <a title="The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal" href="/talks/apidays/internal-apis/" target="_blank">The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal</a>. &nbsp;This material was evolved from past stories I've done on <a title="Amazon" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon's</a> and <a title="Netflix" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/20/apis-power-netflix%E2%80%99s-move-to-cloud-enabling-world-domination/">Netflix's</a> success with internal APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs. But these are the hardest stories to come by, and I feel they are some of the most important API stories we can tell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a great internal API story you'd like to tell, I love to hear more. &nbsp;Feel free to email or DM on Twitter, and we can figure out the best format to tell your story.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-days-paris-france/api-days-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The organizers of <a href="http://apidays.io/">APIs Days</a> asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations. &nbsp;Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The talk was on <a href="/admin/blog/Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" target="_blank">business models for your API as a start-up</a>. &nbsp;On the plane ride over I reviewed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmusser/j-musser-apishotnotgluecon2012" target="_blank">John Musser's great material on API business models</a>, and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then after watching Guillaume Ballas (<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">@guillaumebalas</a>) from 3Scale give his talk&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323" target="_blank">APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model?</a> &nbsp;And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 35px;">
<p>Let's not ask what business model for my API.You should be deploying an API for your business model. @<a href="https://twitter.com/3scale">3scale</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">guillaumebalas</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23apidays">#apidays</a></p>
&mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/status/275622596689661954">December 3, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15473323" width="342" height="291" align="right"> </iframe></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Free users</li>
<li>Paid users</li>
<li>Free developers</li>
<li>Paid developers</li>
<li>Partners</li>
<li>Incubation</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this approach isn't for every startup. &nbsp;I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323">which API business model is right for your startup</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>The talk is rooted in my research on the <a title="Business of Twitter's API" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Business of Twitter's API</a> and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.</p>

<p>I gave a talk at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris, France this week. &nbsp;This talk was using some of my usual material around the <a title="building blocks of an API" href="http://apievangelist.com/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">building blocks of an API</a>. As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further. &nbsp;This is one benefit of using <a title="reveal.js" href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a>, driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.</p>
<p>I discussed 5 main areas to consider when building your API developer portal:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Design &amp; Planning</li>
<li>API Development</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>Whats Next for APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to keep organizing and sharing my view on API design, planning, development and evangelism so my readers can put to use in their own API efforts.</p>
<p>It was interesting to talk through my <a title="API Building Blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> approach with API owners in France, after giving my talk. &nbsp;I learned a lot by talking with folks there. &nbsp;And I really think Europe has huge opportunity in front of it, when it comes to the API economy.</p>

<p>I got back last night from France, where I spent the week at the #APIDays conference, billed as the first international event on APIs in Europe.  The two day event was organized <span>by&nbsp;</span><a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a><span>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by</span><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a><span>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs</span></p>
<p>After some scheduling shuffling due to speaker cancellations API Days asked me if I&rsquo;d do three talks on APIs, instead of just my one--resulting in these three presentations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal" href="/2012/12/07/building-blocks-bricks-for-your-developer-portal-apidays/" target="_blank">Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal</a></li>

</ul>

<p>While the building blocks presentation is my usual material (but needs to be told over and over to new audiences), the other two talks represents entirely new work based upon other stories and research I&rsquo;ve done in the past.</p>
<p>I learned a lot while at API Days.  It was about 200 people, discussing APIs over the course of two days.  I was really impressed with the passion everyone had for APIs and the genuine interest in understand the essence of the web API movement--discussing ideas, philosophies and approach rather than just the technology of APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://webshell.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-days-paris-france/webshell-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel an awakening occurring in Europe right now in regards to APIs.  My Twitter has lit up in the past three months with new European based followers focusing on APIs, and flood of new requests for discussions and information about APIs.</p>
<p>With a very healthy stance on transparency, privacy and data ownership I think the EU has an excellent opportunity to become a major player in the <a title="API Economy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>, and I predict good things to come out of not just France, but other EU countries in 2013.</p>
<p>I look forward to getting back soon, and talking APIs!</p>

<p>I read a great post recently about how a company called <a href="http://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/4979/Start-Up-Offers-Blueprints-For-3D-Printed-Parts.aspx">Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts</a> for the products they make.</p>
<p>It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality. &nbsp;I wrote about the concept of a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/08/01/my-3d-printed-junk-drawer/">3D printed junk drawer</a> last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs.</p>
<p>Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways. &nbsp;Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products?</p>
<p>There is still a lot of gaps in how all of this can work, 3D printing is widely available yet, but with retailers like <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/staples-3d-print-mcor-iris,19447.html">Staples playing around with offering 3D printing on demand</a>, the future for 3D printing is looking pretty bright.</p>

<p>There was a great post last week on <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> from Curtis C. Chen (<a href="https://twitter.com/sparCKL">@sparCKL</a>), on how a company called <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/11/22/spectragram-is-a-gateway-to-instagram-api/">Spectagram has launched a new JavaScript library built on top of </a><a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.adrianquevedo.com/jquery-spectragram/">Spectagram</a> uses JQuery to provide a basic set of embeddable tools for Instagram allowing users to embed widgets showing latest photos, popular photos, and photos by tag.</p>
<p>Instagram has been notoriously focused on their core product, which leaves a lot of areas open to its developer community.  Even the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">first version of the Instagram</a> API was created by a passionate developer.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see such a sophisticated Javascript library developed by a developer, essentially rolling out something <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> should be doing themselves, but obviously haven&rsquo;t prioritized.  Something I&rsquo;m sure many API owners would love to have happen in their communities.</p>

<p>I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas.  Working from my <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.</p>
<p>My workshop started with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">history of APIs</a>, then walked through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> in 3 areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Design&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Development&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Evangelist</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research &amp; development and business development for your company.</p>
<p>After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, API automation platforms like <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and new API programming libraries like <a href="http://webshell.io">Webshell</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee&rsquo;s mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are More Than Tech&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Require a Business Approach&nbsp;</li>
<li>Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focus Delivering Value</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the slide deck below for the workshop.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom demo feel free to contact me and we can do a Google Hangout.</p>

<p>I got an email from Anthony Wu over at <a href="http://learnsprout.com/#home">LearnSprout</a> yesterday.  If you are not following what LearnSprout is up to, they are bridging legacy student information systems (SIS) and providing easy to use web APIs that application developers can use to build educational apps.</p>
<p>The email from Anthony was in regards to a SIS LearnSprout was integrating with, which he said:</p>
<blockquote><em>IlluminateEd is the best SIS API we've seen so far!   Clean &amp; simple. OAuth, JSON, no bullshit. If every SIS did this, we could just move on to greener pastures. This kind of thing should be encouraged!</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Anthony. The&nbsp;<a href="https://demo.illuminateed.com/dna/?ApiDocumentation">IlluminateEd API</a>&nbsp;is clean and simple.  They intelligently use common technical API building blocks like oAuth and JSON, while keeping the API interfaces intuitive and meaningful and provide simple, up to date documentation.</p>
<p>My only criticism is simple, and would be about the description for the API:  &ldquo;This API allows third party applications to interact and communicate with the Illuminate system&rdquo;.   This is a classic mistake from API owners.  Unlike Anthony I had no idea what the Illuminate system is.  I can assume its a SIS, but they should really make it a little more description for newcomers.</p>
<p>Even though the API isn&rsquo;t perfect LearnSprout says it is better than:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Humans as APIs (i.e. office secretary mashup with Excel)</li>
<li>CSV as APIs (the status quo)</li>
<li>Screen Scraping as APIs (for some, the ends justify the means&hellip;)</li>
<li>Legacy DOS terminal emulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Learsprout sees a lot of different approaches to accessing and sharing data between SIS systems.  They have a lot of value to bring to the industry, and I enjoying telling the story about what they are experiencing.  And I agree with Anthony and this type of effort should be encouraged within the education space.  Nice work <a href="https://www.illuminateed.com/">IlluminateEd</a>.</p>

<p>Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, in an effort to make the Facebook platform more responsive and dependable for developers, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/11/15/delivering-important-alerts-about-your-app/">Facebook announced Developer Alerts</a>.  Developer alerts are a way for Facebook platform developers to receive critical information about their apps via email or Facebook notification.</p>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts provide the following for Facebook app administrators:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Breaking Changes </strong>- If your app is using functionality that FB is changing or removing, you will be sent an alert at least 90 days before the change goes into effect</li>
<li><strong>App Status Changes</strong> - If you have submitted Open Graph actions or created an app detail page for App Center, FB will use Developer Alerts to notify you when the status of your submission changes</li>
<li><strong>Policy Violations and Enforcement -</strong> If your app doesn&rsquo;t adhere to FB Platform Policies you will be notified through these alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts are more than notifications, it is an issue management system which will allow multiple developers on a project to known when action is required or things have been resolved.</p>
<p>It seems like a great approach to improving communications between API platforms and its API application developers.  I think I will add platform alerts as an official API building block, and recommend it as something API should consider when developing their platform.</p>

<p>Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, recently updated their <a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">DOer Gallery</a> to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.</p>
<p>Twilio has the best record I&rsquo;ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twilio/twilio-doers-gallery.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Twilio DOer Gallery has the following features:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Personal Details</li>
<li>Short Bio</li>
<li>Skills</li>
<li>Other Profiles</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform.  But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.</p>
<p>A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention.  Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".</p>
<p>Would showcasing your &ldquo;API DOers&rdquo; benefit your API community?</p>

<p>In 2012 the number of APIs has grown significantly.  We are transitioning from &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t enough APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do we more intelligently use many APIs&rdquo;.  As I track on this and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m noticing growth in the number of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was introduced <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>, a "Singly for Analytics".  While Singly focuses on personal data API aggregation, Adigami is focused on <a title="aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today" href="http://www.adigami.com/">aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today</a>--covering seven key channels:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adigami.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/adigami/adigami-data-visual.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web</strong> - Google Analytics</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - DoubleClick, Yahoo! APT, Facebook Ads, MediaMind</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Facebook Insights, Twitter</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Yahoo! Mobile, Verve Wireless</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - MailChimp, SendGrid, ConstantContact, ExactTarget</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - Adigami can import proprietary data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating your business on the Internet or "in the cloud" is a reality, and as we operate more and more in this cloud, each platform will have its own set of analytics--making the need to centralize and standardize analytics across channels and platforms more and more critical.</p>
<p>Adigami is just the tip of the iceberg.  I predict we&rsquo;ll see API aggregators emerge from top industries like government, healthcare and education.  In 2013 we will learn to more fluently communicate with web APIs with the help of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>.</p>

<p>Swag can be a critical tool in any API evangelist toolbox.  And stickers are one piece of swag that if possessing the right design, can be something developers will take home and put to use.</p>

<p>The legal building blocks of an API can be just as critical as the technical and business building blocks.  It makes sense to version and communicate your API terms of use (TOS) , privacy policy and branding guidelines alongside your code.</p>
<p>Since Github will allow document types other than code, such as markdown and PDF, it can make sense to use Github for managing the legal side of your API.</p>
<p>Using Github for the legal aspects of API operation will provide a level of transparency developers will appreciate, allowing them to download and store for their own records while being able to see the difference between each version, in a format that makes sense to them.</p>
<p>Just as with all other areas of an API, Github will allow you to completely manage the evolution of your API terms, privacy and branding in a way that is in sync with all the other technical and business building blocks of your API.</p>
<p>Consider using Github for API legal building block management.</p>

<p>I am heading to Paris, France next week for <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>.  API Days is December 3rd and 4th in Paris and is dubbed as the <em>"First National Event on APIs in Europe"</em>.   The two day event is organized by <a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>&nbsp;sees the API economy the same way I do:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Web 1.0 was readable, the Web 2.0 was social, now the web is programmable through application programming interfaces, aka APIs. Web APIs are a unique opportunity for companies, governments and developers to either better organize the governance of their IT into a scalable and flexible model, either leverage a complete ecosystem around the organization, exchanging data through the web for trillion of applications on billion devices. Because each civilization has been described by the way it communicates and make exchanges, API are the beginning of a programmable civilization.</em></blockquote>

<p>The API event is hosting over 50 sessions from over 30 speakers--including two of my own talks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The Secret to a Successful API is Internal</li>
<li>Business models for your API as a start-up</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see APIs getting interest in Europe.  And after working with the Webshell team for several months and learning more about FaberNovel, I'm excited to be working with both of them to drive API adoption in Europe.</p>
<p>If you are planning on going to <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>, let me know and I&rsquo;ll make time to talk.  If you aren&rsquo;t, I will publish more info about the event and my talks here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, when it is all wrapped up.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chartboost/Chartboost-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The team over at <a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank">Chartboost</a> have a pretty forward thinking <a href="http://blog.chartboost.com/post/36221629171/web-3-0-help-site?hn">blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development</a>.</p>
<p>They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites.  The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end.  With mobile applications following the same pattern.</p>
<p>To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Push State</strong> - Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks</li>
<li><strong>JSON-API </strong>- A REST API providing JSON to drive the site</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Design </strong>- Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers</li>
<li><strong>Vector (Icon Fonts &amp; CSS)</strong> - Using a combination of icon fonts and CSS3 to deliver the UI. SCSS - A new technology that uses CSS-preprocessing to make the CSS code cleaner and res-usable</li>
<li><strong>Markdown</strong> - Using the simple markup language to allow anyone on their team to write and edit help articles</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong> - Using Github to manage the help center as an open project</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chartboost/Chartboost-Help-Center-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I agree that their metholody has the potential to be one possible future of web and mobile application development.  JavaScript and API development have both matured in the last 10 years, getting us to this point where you can build some damn sexy, but simple apps that run smoothly on the web or mobile devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Or as Chartboost puts it:</p>
<blockquote><em>We believe that the web is finally reaching a tipping point. The culmination of a decade of incremental improvements to web technologies is upon us, and lets us do things in a way that is radically new and better.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m also playing around with my own approach to delivering apps in this way using Github + Jeckyll + Mustache Templates with JSON data stores, all running as open repositories using Github Pages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to publish on this in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>Social analytics provider&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://www.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;has won a temporary injunction against Twitter today, with a complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court. It reads:</p>
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Twitter from destroying its business, interfering with PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s contractual and prospective business relations, and restraining competition in markets using Twitter data.</em></p>
<p>The complaint was filed in response to a trheat from Twitter to cut off PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s access to its Firehose by November 30, 201 &nbsp;PeopleBrowsr has had access to the full Twitter full firehose for over four years. According to the complaint:</p>
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s products require the full Firehose feed. A mere sample of Twitter data is insufficient for PeopleBrowsr to provide the products its users expect. Though there are some data analytics companies that can provide certain limited types of Twitter data analysis based on sampling, PeopleBrowsr competes in a separate &ldquo;Twitter Big Data Analytics&rdquo; market, in which a few, highly sophisticated players analyze massive amounts of Twitter data to provide deeper insights.</em></p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s decision to terminate PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s firehose follows a&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">pattern of it consistently cutting off partner and developer access to the platforms and its data</a>. In doing so Twitter&nbsp;has sought more control in their effort to monetize the social networking platform and provide&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/22/investment-in-twitter/">investors with a return on their investment of almost 1.4B dollars</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/PeopleBrowsr-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>PeopleBrowsr states that it has &ldquo;invested millions of dollars and years of work in building a business based on the Firehose&rdquo;. It says it did so in rlying on Twitter&rsquo;s representations that it would maintain an &ldquo;open ecosystem&rdquo; and allow other companies to use of its data. Through agreements with Twitter PeopleBrowsr felt it could compete without fear that Twitter would cut off access to its data in order to influence which businesses succeed or to usurp business opportunities for itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Twitter has consistently described</a>&nbsp;the Firehose as a part of this open ecosystem that it would make available to &ldquo;everyone in the system&rdquo;, and this open approach was a key component of Twitter&rsquo;s business strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The injunction PeopleBrowsr received today will keep their firehose access open until January, when further hearings on the case will be held. Until now, all the outcy regarding Twitter&rsquo;s restriction of access to the platform have been vocal, but without any legal action. The filing by PeopleBrowsr shows the situation has truly become serious and will move discussion about Twitter access from the tech blogosphere and hacker news into the U.S legal system.</p>

<p>Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>.  It&rsquo;s no secret I&rsquo;m a fan of what they are doing.  We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> look like.</p>
<p>In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the <a title="NGINX" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGNIX</a> web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry.</p>
<p>What makes 3Scale&rsquo;s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers don't need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party <a title="addons" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/3rdPartyModules">addons</a> and <a title="modules" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Modules">modules</a> available in the NGNIX ecosystem. All while employing an established technology that has been proven to deliver in highl volume production environments.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits provided by NGNIX, the proxy provides seamless integration with 3Scale&rsquo;s API management platform that delivers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API business modeling using service contracts, API rate limits and pricing rules</li>
<li>API access control &amp; security with API key generation with user id, app id, oAuth</li>
<li>API analytics &amp; reporting including alerts, statistics, business intelligence</li>
<li>API billing &amp; payments supporting pre-paid, post-paid, PCI compliant, six separate payment gateways</li>
<li>Developer portal for self-service registration and onboarding</li>

<p>This list represents everything you will need to get your API up and running.  3Scale enables you to do this both on premise or in the cloud, using a proxy that you cotrol--then alllowing you to choose which 3Scale API management services you need to use.  But what is most important for me, is 3Scale allows you start off without spending any money.  3Scale has a free, entry level tier that will allow you to design, experiment and iterate until you find the meaningful API definition that works for your developers--at which time you can scale, paying for only what you need, as you grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is critical to success of individual APIs as well as the overall health of the API industry.  We need to allow companies to innovate without spending a fortune, give up control of their data, and being locked into unnecessary commitments--allowing the industry to go from thousands of APIs to millions of APIs as quickly as possible.</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;As of today this makes 3scale the API Management solution provider with the richest and most flexible set of technical options to manage API traffic,&rdquo; said Guillaume Balas, 3scale CMO. &ldquo;At 3scale we want companies with great and valuable APIs to be able to distribute them easily, rapidly, without hampering the economics of their API project and without disrupting their existing infrastructure: this what 3scale&rsquo;s API Management solution provides.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The 3Scale approach is in aligment with my industry philosophy, that we shouldn&rsquo;t stand in the way of API providers with costly, proprietary proxies.  We should leverage existing, proven, open technologies like NGINX to allow API providers to deploy wherever their infrastructure exists, either in the datacenter or the cloud--while enabling them to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; to the best of breed API management services, which allow them to scale, grow and evolve their API ecosystem in the healthiest way possible.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/11/13/where-are-the-apis-for-state-health-insurance-exchanges/">Where Are The APIs For State Health Insurance Exchanges?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/State-Healthcare-Insurance-Exchanges.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was listening to a story about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/165057222/nevada-quietly-starts-implementing-obamacare">Nevada quietly starting their implementation of health insurance exchanges</a>, as part of what everyone loves to call Obamacare.  I&rsquo;m not even going to get involved in the politics and merit of making sure everyone is insured--I want to focus on the execution of it.</p>
<p>Immediately I think:  <em><strong>Where is the state health insurance exchange platform API?</strong></em></p>
<p>According to healthcare.gov an exchange is:</p>
<blockquote><em> A mechanism for organizing the health insurance marketplace to help consumers and small businesses shop for coverage in a way that permits easy comparison of available plan options based on price, benefits and services, and quality.  By pooling people together, reducing transaction costs, and increasing transparency, Exchanges create more efficient and competitive markets for individuals and small employers.</em></blockquote>
<p>And the principles and priorities of state health insurance exchanges are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Establishing a State-based Exchange</strong> - Establishment of an Exchange is a critical step that States must take to be on track for achieving certification of an Exchange by January 1, 2013 under Section 1321. </li>
<li><strong>Promoting Efficiency </strong>- Exchanges must be mindful of costs for consumers, employers, and the federal government. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Adverse Selection</strong> - Successful Exchanges will avoid adverse selection by ensuring that those who buy through the Exchange are a broad mix of the healthy and the less healthy.</li>
<li>Streamlined Access and Continuity of Care.  Section 1311(d)(4)(F) requires Exchanges to evaluate and determine eligibility for applicants in Medicaid, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and other health programs - Exchanges must also comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination.  The federal government will provide critical building blocks and financial support for achieving an efficient enrollment process including verification of&nbsp;eligibility for tax credits.</li>
<li>Public Outreach and Stakeholder Involvement - Section 1311(d)(6) requires Exchanges to consult with a broad range of stakeholders in carrying out their activities.</li>
<li>Public Accountability and Transparency - Accountability requires transparency.  Section 1311(d)(7) requires public reports on Exchange activities, and Section 1311(e)(3) requires additional reporting, which should include standardized data reporting on price, quality, benefits, consumer choice and other factors that will help measure and evaluate performance. </li>
<li>Financial Accountability - Section 1313 provides for the efficient and non-discriminatory administration of Exchanges, and seeks to prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to successfully implement 50 state health insurance exchanges that meet the definition, principles and priorities of the federal government objectives, you will need an open source platform, complete with a robust API strategy.  Maybe it exists, and I&rsquo;m unaware of it.</p>
<p>If you know more about current initiatives in this area, please let me know.</p>

<p>Hackathons are a fertile environment for generating code based upon the ideas of its attendees.  However, much of the innovative programming that occurs at these events is forgotten the day after the event ends.  This process tends to leave developers working on the same ideas over and over, without much continuity.</p>
<p>To help remedy this, hackathon organizers can use Github to store code that is generated by all attendees. Organizers can encourage all developers to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the event with a README file of their project as part of the presentation process.</p>
<p>Github can be a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.</p>
<p>Using Github for a hackathon can generate extra marketing for the event as well as the hackathon organizers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="https://singly.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/singly-logo_300.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for meaningful API analogies, to stock my evangelism toolbox.   Ways that I can relate the potential of APIs, in a way that anyone can understand, even non-developers.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the success of the web API movement lies in the ability to extend, potentially complex resources in a very simplistic and universal way.  So, as an evangelism I have to abstract away the complexities and make sure I connect with my audience.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m tracking on the API space and working to quantify the potential future of APIs, I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful analogies to articulate where API driven platforms like Singly are moving the industry.  But just as with the technology, leave it to the Singly team to do this for me.</p>
<p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> made a slight shift in their branding recently, using the words <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API Fabric</span></strong></em> in the description of what they do.  This seems like a slight change, but it truly is an exceptional way to describe the Singly approach to app development using social authentication and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, to a non technical person, fabric may be defined as:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>fab&middot;ric/Ëfabrik/</strong> Noun: Cloth, typically produced by weaving or knitting textile fibers</em></blockquote>
<p>With synonyms being cloth, material, structure, textile, texture and web. Using this definition of fabric as the source for my analogy can work by itself.  It can help a non-technical person understand what is possible when you can quickly begin weave together apps using different APIs--visualizing some sort of woven textile, with unique meaning.  Immediately helping anyone, visually relate to the potential when developing on top of social and personal APIs.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/mayan-weaving.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you are more technical, the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; might help you understand Singly at another level. In information technology, fabric is a synonym for the words framework or platform.  In general, the term fabric can describe the way different parts of something work together to form a single entity.  Fabric can be used as a metaphor to illustrate the idea that if someone were to document computer components and their relationships on paper, the lines would weave back and forth so densely that the diagram would resemble a woven piece of cloth.</p>
<p>Bringing us back full circle to the visualization potentially related to non-developers.  The word fabric has deep meaning through our personal worlds, it might be your favorite jeans, blanket the uniform you wear to work every day.  APIs are fast being woven into every aspect of our lives, and the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; is an excellent way to relate what API providers like Singly are doing with specific groups of APIs, like personal and social data APIs.</p>
<p>Our sometimes very personal data and sometimes very public social data is fast becoming fabric of our daily personal and work worlds on the Internet and our mobile devices.  We are going to need to provide ways of assuring developers can build the most powerful, meaningful apps possible--by weaving together the best of breed data and resources into a strong API fabric!</p>

<p><a title="Socrata announced today that they are preparing to release an open source, cloud-based, open data system" href="http://www.socrata.com/newsroom-article/socrata-announces-open-source-option-for-leading-open-data-cloud-platform/">Socrata announced today that they are preparing to release an open source, cloud-based, open data system</a>, called the &ldquo;Socrata Open Data Server, Community Edition.&rdquo;  If you don&rsquo;t already follow what Socrata does, they are the data platform behind municipal open data initiatives like <a title="New York City Data" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/new-york-city/">NYC City Data</a>, <a title="San Francisco City Data" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/city-of-san-francisco/">San Francisco City Data</a> and <a title="Data.gov" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/data-gov/">Data.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The new Socrata Open Data Server is meant to be a reference for the <a title="open data standard" href="http://open-data-standards.github.com/">open data standard</a> they are actively evolving to promote data portability throughout open government data ecosystems, and support open source software policies in public organizations around the globe--called <a title="Open Data Substrate" href="http://open-data-standards.github.com/">The Open Data Substrate</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of the Socrata open source strategy is to enable customers to rapidly accelerate the process of breaking data out of traditional database &ldquo;silos,&rdquo; move it to the cloud and opening it for mass consumption to end users and developers. &nbsp;The Socrata Open Data Server will support the ongoing evolution of open data standards in three key areas, that Socrata feels are required for a thriving open data ecosystem:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data Catalog Interoperability </strong>&ndash; Enable universal federation of different open data catalogs using a standard catalog schema, based on the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability Based on Standard Data Formats &ndash;</strong> Standardize outputs including JSON, XML, and CSV, as well as RDF and other Linked Data standards. The goal is to evolve towards standard schemas that developers can use for popular data sets, based on real-world examples and collaboration between data publishers</li>
<li><strong>Application Portability Based on Open Data API Standards &ndash; </strong>Standardize the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used to programmatically access open data, using established paradigms and protocols such as REST, HTTP, and Structured Query Language (SQL)</li>
</ol>

<p>Socrata&rsquo;s move to open source their technology is in line with their mission:</p>
<blockquote><em>Socrata&rsquo;s mission is to help government organizations everywhere reap massive economic benefits from data liberation by promoting unfettered access, shareability, consumability and reuse of public data.</em></blockquote>
<p>And I share a similar vision with Socrata&rsquo;s CEO Kevin Merritt:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Socrata is constantly inventing new products that help people visualize and contextualize data in consumer-friendly web and mobile experiences, and as machine- and developer-ready APIs. We are part of a broader ecosystem that is creating massive downstream benefits and economic incentives for government to open the data floodgates,&rdquo; adds Kevin Merritt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough to reduce friction in the supply of data, we also need to hardwire interoperability and data portability into the open data experience, to keep everybody honest and create a financially-sustainable business model for the entire ecosystem to thrive."</em></blockquote>
<p>We need all city, county, state and federal goverment to have APIs.  Let&rsquo;s not stand in the way.  The same can be said about the private sector--which is why I have been a <a href="/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">proponent of more open source offerings in the API industry</a>.</p>
<p>The Socrata Open Data Server will be released in the first quarter of 2013, as freely downloadable open source software, but will also come fully integrated with other components of the company&rsquo;s commercial software products.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited by the opportunities for opening up government data with Socrata&rsquo;s approach, but we all have a lot of work to do.  We can&rsquo;t expect government to do it all alone.  Everyone needs to step up and help educated our local government about the potential of open data and APIs, and get involved and contribute to what Socrata has set into motion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a>, a hub for musicians to manage and control their online presence, just expanded their reach with <a href="https://developers.bandpage.com/home">BandPage Connect</a>, an API, allowing  developers to build apps for the music industry.  I wrote about their <a title="update once, publish everywhere with an embeddable API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/25/update-once,-publish-everywhere-with-the-right-embeddable-api-strategy/">update once, publish everywhere with an embeddable API strategy</a> back in July, feeling an API would be next.</p>
<p>When it comes to a Bands most treasured assets, music is always held up as the most valuable piece of the catalog, but band info, events, venues, videos and photos of the band are essential to the success of these artists--emotionally connecting fans with their favorite bands.</p>
<p>This is where BandPage Connect comes in.  The API will allow bands to provide content to open API developers, as well as their partners, in a self service approach.  BandPage Everywhere allows bands to easily manage their presence with robust embeddable apps that they can easily distribute across the web, but BandPage Connect takes this to the next level--allowing developers define what is next, when it comes to building web and mobile apps that connect bands with their fans.</p>
<p>BandPage Connect provides a solid approach for the music industry to provide access to valuable band assets, but also provides a centralized way to control presence.  Ryan Kavontrka, Digital Manager for Maroon 5, Sara Bareilles, Gavin DeGraw, and Eve 6, says, "There are a lot of platforms out there that have our bio, photos, and videos, but the info they have about us is out of date and we don't have a way to change it. This makes it so that any member of a band or their manager/label can update the content, not just the guy who knows HTML. If you're connected with BandPage, you know your entire online presence is up-to-date."</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.bandpage.com/home"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bandpage/BandPage-Developer-Portal.png" alt="" width="525" /></a></p>
<p>All a band has to do, is manage their presence via BandPage, and they can use BandPage Everywhere to allow any fan or partner to easily embed content on sites and social networks, as well as allowing developers to build custom experiences--all while maintaining control over every aspect of a bands presence.</p>
<p>After diving into BandPage Connect they&rsquo;ve done a great job launching the API, providing valuable endpoints, and all the <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks so developers can be successful</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;building apps on the platform.  I think the BandPage approach to their embeddable and API strategy, is a model for other industries that showcase artists, to follow--giving them the highest level of control over their presence, while achieving the large distribution and presence possible in an API driven online and mobile world.</p>

I&rsquo;m not a big fan of covering funding, acquisition or launch press releases, unless there a significant business story there.  But the acquisition of Vordel is another important sign for the API industry in 2012.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal haven&rsquo;t been disclosed, but the acquisition shows the API industry is maturing and producing desirable companies with proven API products, that larger software companies can use as a competitive advantage.  While Vordel's API management, SOA governance and identity management will help Axway&rsquo;s customers, I think Vordel&rsquo;s customers is probably the type of new client large software companies will want be also seeking out through acquisitions.</p>

<p>I always joke with John and Adam at <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> about, &ldquo;Is this the year of the API&rdquo;? They have been at it longer than I have, and are very hesitant to dub any particular year, the year of the API.  But, with the growth we&rsquo;ve seen in 2012, two open source API management platforms deployed and now a major acquisition in the space--I confidently would say 2012 is the year APIs came of age.</p>
<p>I predict in 2013-2015 we are going to see more of these types of acquisitions occuring.  Large software companies are going to need a robust set of API tools to bring legacy systems into the modern, API driven economy.  Companies that have invested in API management service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> will see the return they are looking for, as the space continues to grow in the next five years.</p>

<p>When you operate an API, you need to make sure and communicate with your developer community about what your plans are for the future, so developers can plan their own roadmap, and keep in sync with the coming changes to the API.</p>
<p>In addition to <a title="API issue management with Github" href="/2012/11/08/api-issue-management-using-github/">issue management using Github</a>, API providers can use Github to manage their roadmap using the milestones features of the social coding platform.  Milestones can be directly related to issues or can be larger goals around where you intend to take your API.</p>
<p>Milestones give developers insight into what the plans are the future of an API, using just a title, description and target date.  Milestones are one of the simplest aspects of an API, but can go a long way in creating goodwill with your developers.</p>
<p>API providers have to balance transparency versus giving away information to competitors, something that will take regular consideration.  A transparent roadmap for your API will let developers prepare properly, while also letting them know what features are coming in the future--eliminating the possibility of competing with your own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Consider what you can include in your Github roadmap, and using Github for issue management.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a title="CloudMine" href="https://cloudmine.me/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/cloudmine-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Backend as a Service (BaaS) provider <a title="CloudMine" href="https://cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> and aggregated social API platform <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> announced a partnership today, to make sure the mobile applications developers are building using CloudMine have social baked in by default.</p>
<p>CloudMine is delivering on the BaaS promise and providing all the tools developers need to rapidly develop and scale their mobile applications, by providing a complete backend solution for developers including user management, object storage, push notifications, syncing and other essential tools developers need to be successful.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/53044170">CloudMine + Singly Partnership Announcement</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/cloudmine">CloudMine</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Social is the logical next step in the BaaS evolution.  Social authentication, data, friends, followers are also essential for any developer building an app these days, so the partnership being CloudMine and Singly makes sense.  Instead of CloudMine aggregating these essential social tools, they can rely on Singly to bring this to the table for CloudMine developers--allowing CloudMine to stick with what they do best.</p>
<p>If you want more information, you can head over to <a title="CloudMine" href="http://blog.cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> or <a title="Singly" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/11/12/teaming-up-with-cloudmine-for-backend-superpowers/">Singly</a>, and see how their approach can help your mobile app development.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> &nbsp;Singly is a partner of API Evangelist</p>
