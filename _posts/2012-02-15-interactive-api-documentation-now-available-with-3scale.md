I first wrote about [interactive API documentation with Posterous’s new API area][1] in June 2011, then the follow-up when [Mashery deployed their own version called I/O Docs][2] in July 2011.

Smart, interactive or I/O API documentation is an evolution of API documentation from static and often boring documentation, to more interactive and real-time experience, allowing you to make live calls against an API while also browsing the documentation that explains how it operates.

Peter Gruenbaum of [SDK Bridge][3] has surveyed and done exhaustive research on [what developers say about API documentation][4] and [web API documentation best practices][5], proving that up to date, and complete documentation can be very successful in helping developers get up and running using an API.

The [API Service Provider][6], [3Scale][7] has stepped up with their own interactive API documentation for users of their platform using [Swagger][8], an open-source framework that lets developers learn, play, test and debug each element of an API in real-time.

There are 3 main benefits for API owners coming from adopting [Swagger][9]:

  * Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation
  * Generation of client code and SDK in Scala, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Actionscript 3
  * Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use

While many companies are providing [API explorers][10] for their developers to make live calls against their APIs, I think interactive documentation holds more value in educating developers about APIs, while also allowing them to make real-time calls. My feeling is that this makes some tough concepts stickier while trying to understand and integrate with an API.

Visit the [3Scale][11] site for more information on using their [API management platform for deploying interactive documentation][12], using Swagger, for your APIs.

**Disclosure:**  I have consulted with 3Scale on industry strategy several times.
