<p><a title="WebServius" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/07/18/webservius-api-service-provider/">WebServius</a> provides self-service API deployment and management solutions, that allow you to monetize your data.
<p>By combining Amazon SimpleDB and WebServius you can quickly deploy and monetize any dataset using an API.
<p>You start by uploading your data to Amazon SimpleDB, then create a WebServius account and connect it to your SimpleDB account.

You instantly get a commercial-grade pay-per-use API complete with a user signup page, a system for issuing API keys, and billing capabilities.
<p>Amazon SimpleDB gives you a way to store and scale access to your data, while WebServius provides way to open up access, while also securing and monetizing it through an RESTful API that developers will understand and know how to use.
