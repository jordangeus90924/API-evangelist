{% include JB/setup %}<p>Posterous recently launched a new API giving users access to all the functionality available through the Posterous web interface.Instead of just delivering documentation for the Poserous API, they went a step further and made the documentation smarter, and more interactive.Think API explorer meets API documentation.The Posterous API documentation provides a list of all API services, endpoints, and methods, but it doesnt stop there.When logged into your Posterous account, the API documentation automatically includes your api_token, which is necessary for making API calls.</p>
