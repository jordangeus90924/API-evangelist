{% include JB/setup %}<p>I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the DC API Meetup Group, which met at NPR offices downtown.The API Meetup started with pizza, a healthy selection of beer and networking with around 50 API professionals and API curious from around the DC area.I was able to meet about 15 folks I know online, but have never had the opportunity to connect with in real life.Ben Balter (@BenBalter), one of the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) kicked off the conversation with a presentation of some of the cool API discovery, CSV to API, DB to API and various tool hes developed during his time as a innovation fellow.I totally dig Bens style, in making very small, but powerful open source tools that can make a real difference in how government opens up data via APIs.</p>
