{% include JB/setup %}<p>I had a great discussion with a friend who works in federal government yesterday.We were talking about various ways to “successfully” deploy APIs within the federal government.She gets APIs, understands the benefits, but she had some very realistic perspectives on where API deployment within the federal government can fail.While discussing this with her, we kept coming back to two points: API Garbage Littering the Internet - With some of the tools, making it easier to deploy APIs, the potential to just post meaningless and worthless data sets grows Lack of API Ownership - There are big movements to get APIs deployed, but then very little ownership once its up.Regarding worthless APIs being deployed, I think we can mitigate this by providing some sort of ranking or voting systems for APIs, allowing developers to upvote or downvote and add some critical feedback on what is right, or what is wrong.</p>
