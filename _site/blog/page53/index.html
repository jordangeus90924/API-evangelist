<p>Have you taken a moment and looked at the APIs AT&amp;T is offering through their <a href="http://developer.att.com/">developer program</a> lately? I think it is an interesting spread of API resources for a leading telco to offer, and is very telling about their strategy.</p>
<p>This is one thing I like about my API monitoring platform, is that I'm forced to dive deeper into companies that are ubiquitous in the space, and make sure I'm kep in tune with where they are actually going.</p>
<p>I thought <a href="https://developer.att.com/developer/basicTemplate.jsp?passedItemId=12500043">AT&amp;T's API catalog</a> was interesting in its current state:</p>

<p>Some of the APIs they offer are pretty straightforward like MMS, SMS, Location and Speech. &nbsp;But the TV, Healthcare, Notary and even advertising seem like they are from a different planet. Which is a signal in itself I think.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T pops up on my radar a lot because of their presence at hackathons, and coverage in the blogosphere. &nbsp;I'd like to make more time to dissect AT&amp;T's approach to APIs from an outside perspective. I think there is a lot to learn from their strategy, both good and bad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/28/api-trends/">API Trends</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="/trends/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/trends.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I study the API space.  I want to understand how we got where we are at, and try to understand where we are going with our usage of APIs.  To do this I monitor the best of the existing and new APis, using the blogosphere, Twitter, LinkedIn, Github and the open web looking for examples of how people are using APIs in different ways.</p>
<p>Currently I monitor the blogs of 804 API related companies and 205 blog feeds from other news and blog sources, as well as around 1000 API twitter accounts.  As I read and curate this every day, I tag items according to a process I've evolved over 3 years of operation.  Then at the end of each week I look at which tags are trending for the week, based upon what I've written and other news items I've curated along the way.</p>
<p>This is how I monitor trends.  When Is see a tag trending, and I feel the area is interesting or has potential, I tend to spin off the topic into its own trend area.  Now I can monitor it separately and potentially give it more attention, with the hope of finding new sources of information, companies and domain experts in this area.</p>
<p>I have done this with four main areas I've seen trending in 2013:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Aggregation</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Backend as a Service</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Reciprocity</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Realtime</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the areas I've had time to isolate and spin off into their own research projects.  I have a short list of other areas I will tackle very soon, including voice, data analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>None of these project areas are concrete.  They can change at any time, becoming entirely new areas or stay as it is, and since each project is its own Github repository, it can go idle, without any impact on the overall network--leaving it open for anyone else to use the data and content available within the project.</p>
<p>I will add new trending projects as I find them and have time, as well as add news, companies, APIs, tools, services and any analysis to existing project areas.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2013</span>
        <p>I spend a lot of time on API Evangelist getting excited about APIs.  Going on three years doing this, I'm getting a little more hardened in my view on what is "good" in the API space.  Along with that evolution, I'm getting my priorities in order.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/priorities.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>While I may get excited about cloud computing APIs or quantified self APIs, there are other areas I think are straight up priorities--ones that we can't ignore.  To support this I'm launching several research projects into areas I have labeled as API priorities:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Federal Government" href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Federal Government</a></li>
<li><a title="City Government APIs" href="http://city-government.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">City Government</a></li>
<li><a title="Education APIs" href="http://education.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Education</a></li>
<li><a title="Library APIs" href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Healthcare</a></li>
<li><a title="Library APIs" href="http://libraries.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Libraries</a></li>
<li><a title="University APis" href="http://university.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Universities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These represent areas I'm actively doing research in, looking for the best APIs, tools, services, building blocks and news while also generating as much analysis and white papers as I can to help define what is going on.</p>
<p>As with all of the API Evangelist network of research projects, everything is a work in progress and represents what I have time to dive into.  If you see anything missing, or feel some priority areas are not represented, let me know.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/27/helping-people-understand-apis-through-real-world-examples/">Helping People Understand APIs Through Real World Examples</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.cfnnet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/commercial-fueling-network/commercial-fueling-network.jpg" alt="" width="170" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm always looking for easy, dead simple approaches to explaining APIs to people.  Having real world examples, that folks can relate with, go along way in helping people wrap their heads around the very abstract concepts that are APIs.</p>
<p>While going for a walk today I was thinking back when I use to build technology for my parents trucking company, when one of the fuel expenses was for <a href="http://www.cfnnet.com/" target="_blank">Commercial Fueling Network</a> (CFN), which is a self-service commercial fueling station.</p>
<p>Whether your a long haul trucker or local contractor, you can use CFN to get at an essential resource for your business, whatever the application. Any business can apply and join CFN, get a "key" to access fuel resources in a self-service way.</p>
<p>APIs are the same approach to selling any "virtual" online resource, as CFN is to selling a "physical" fuel resource. CFN doesn't just put free gas alongside the road for anyone to take.  They have a portal where you know to go to get your resources, providing you with a key to access the fuel resources you need.  CFN then bills you for the usage of their resource.  You can be sure CFN has extensive data on how much fuel they sell and who it was sold to.</p>
<p>With virtual resources, whether you are a iPhone developer or website developer you can use APIs to get at essential resources you will need for your business, whatever the type of applications you are developing. &nbsp;Any developer can apply to use an API, and get a "key" to access the resources in a self-service way.</p>
<p>The best part about the online approach is you can turn ANYTHING into a resource.  Your resource can be data in a database, specialized code you've developed or interact with anything in the physical world.</p>
<p>This example works well for helping people to understand how APIs work, by using a real world example they may have experience with.  The best thing is, you can continue evolving this example by talking about the payment APIs used to process credit cards while fueling or the usage of APIs to interface with accounting or other administrative systems for businesses who use CFN.</p>
<p>I'm adding this to my list of white papers and see if I can create a more polished version of it.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/27/evolving-beyond-api-service-providers-and-tools-to-goal-based-api-toolkits/">Evolving Beyond API Service Providers and Tools to Goal Based API Toolkits</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/universe-expansion.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the universe of APIs expands, I&rsquo;m working to find new ways that I can discover, educate myself, then organize information around the most meaningful areas in the API space.  As part of this effort I&rsquo;m reorganizing <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> site into a network of small story groups, so that I can focus on a specific piece of this expanding API universe.</p>
<p>Each portion of API Evangelist will run using what I call my <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com" target="_blank">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, where I use Github Page, Jekyll along with a variety of JSON driven widgets that tell a story around a specific topic.</p>
<p>The first story group I&rsquo;m tackling is redefining two of my main sections which I had called <em>&ldquo;service provider&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;tools&rdquo;</em>. My original intent was to find resources people could use to deploy APIs, and if it was an online service I put it in service providers and if you could download and install, it went under tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m abandoning this approach and dismantling these sections and breaking them into goal oriented stories:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Design</a></li>
<li><a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Deployment</a></li>
<li><a title="API Managemet" href="http://management.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Management</a></li>
<li>Evangelism</li>
<li>Monetization</li>
<li><a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Discovery</a></li>
<li>Consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't have evangelism, monetization or consumption ready to go yet, but design, deployment, management and discovery are coming together nicely. You will be able to get at news, analysis, services and tools within these areas, as well as some overall thoughts about each area of the API universe.</p>
<p>I'm doing this to help me focus on each aspect of the API space, allowing me to see just the news and the best of the companies who are active in that area. This approach really helps me curate and write very focused stories and white papers that serve each topic. I hope it offers similar value for you.</p>
<p>My objective is to allow people to find information from two main areas, either using APIs or providing APIs. You can then navigate to individual areas within those two goal areas, with some overlap between them. In addition to toolkits for using or providing APIs, I'm also rolling out other story groups in the areas of API trends, priorities and opportunities.</p>
<p>So stay tuned&hellip;<a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> is always a living research project.</p>

In May 2012, I started monitoring the progress of the White House Digital Strategy, where I setup a <a href="/federal_government.php">monitoring system that pings all 246 agencies</a> to see if they have published their digital strategy yet.</p>
<p>As we approach the one year anniversary, I expect we'll see a lot more news emerge around what various agencies are doing as part of the original mandate by the White House.  As of today there are now 23 federal agencies who have published their Digital Strategy at their domain.</p>
<p>I have published <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">all of my research around my APIs &amp; the Federal Government research at a permanent Github repository</a>.  I will continue pushing all my research, curated stories and analysis there in real-time.  I have also published a handful of JSON data sets I have generated as part of the research:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-with-social.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Social</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-digital-strategy.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-digital-strategy-with-social.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy &amp; Social</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the JSON data for these areas, along with the PHP script I used to harvest, store and publish this data using the JSON version of each agencies Digital Strategy.</p>
<p>While you can pull a list of federal agencies via <span>from the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Agency Directory API</a><span>, and each agencies social data using the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Social Media Registry API</a>, the logos included with each agency is something I hand-rolled, so you won't find it anywhere other than here. &nbsp;I gave the data to the GSA, and I hope they incorporate the agency logos into the Federal Agency Directory API.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">Federal Government Github project</a> will be a permanent, living place for me to publish stories, news, data and the scripts I create around my research in the area.  I'm using my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format to keep everything up to date, openly licensed, while also keeping everything machine readable by default.</p>
<p>I'm categorizing this project under "API Priorities".  It is a critical area that we need as many people involved as possible.  If you need an idea for a project, let me know.  I have endless ideas to suggest on how we can evolve our government using open data and APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hundred-dollar-bills.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>There was a lot of buzz in the API space over the last two weeks.  I'm not a big on being first with news from the world of APIs, I leave this approach to the tech blogs like Techcrunch, RWW, GigaOm, The Next Web and others.  I'd rather simmer on things for a bit, think beyond the press release, and craft a post that offers value beyond the initial announcement and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churnalism">churnalism</a>.</p>
<p>To get everyone up to speed,  four major things happened in the API space over the last two weeks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/04/17/intel-acquires-mashery">Intel Buys Mashery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ca.com/us/content/Integration/Layer-7-Technologies.aspx">Computer Associates Buys Layer 7 Technologies</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2013/04/23/programmableweb-joins-mulesoft/">MuleSoft Acquires ProgrammableWeb</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/04/thank-you-to-investors-and-customers/">3Scale gets $4.2M in Funding</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no arguing that these are some pretty significant signs the API industry is picking up the pace, especially when you have companies like Intel and Computer Associates taking notice and making investments.  I've been tracking on the space for 3 years now, with round-ups of API service providers in <a title="API Service Providers 2011" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">2011</a> and <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">2012</a>. For 2010, 2011 it was all an uphill battle, but in 2012 I started seeing things heat up with the <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">introduction of several new API service providers</a>,&nbsp;then really stepping up in November 2012 with the <a href="/2012/11/13/axway-acquires-api-management-service-provider-vordel/">acquisition of Vordel by Axway</a>. But, the last couple of weeks are pretty outstanding, with not just acquisition of two separate API service providers, but also the fact that one of them is API pioneer Mashery, being purchased by chipmaker Intel.  Love or hate Mashery, they help define the space and have been at it a while a while, and we all have an industry, partly due to their work.</p>
<h3>VC Cycles More Than API Cycles</h3>
<p>Personally I feel the recent acquisitions are indeed positive signals for the industry, but I think they are also just part of the natural cycle that is set in motion by the types of businesses, companies like Mashery and Layer 7 are looking to build. These are companies that are designed for an exit, an with Mashery raising almost $40M, after multiple rounds, as well as Layer7 at $20M, with just a handful of rounds.  I don't do predictions, but I would say that Apigee is next with their $70M, in a Series E round.  Any takers IBM?  AT&amp;T? Oracle? &nbsp;The signals are more that these companies are ripe for picking, than it is a sign that the API space is booming.</p>
<h3>The Enterprise Opportunity</h3>
<p>The acquisitions of&nbsp;Vordel, Mashery and Layer7 tell me that the enterprise is interested in APIs, whether it is for mobile, big data or the internet of things--the enterprise wants in. Duh?  That really isn't much of a signal. It is logical, and if you are building an API service provider company, that is looking for an exit, you are going to build your company so that it appeals to the enterprise. It isn't really API business, it is just business. I know that this is what many of you focus on as "being the opportunity", but in the end it is just short-sighted and doesn't reflect the real potential of APIs.</p>
<h3>The API Opportunity</h3>
<p>The real opportunity in the API space is about making sure that <strong>EVERYONE</strong> can design, develop, manage, discover and consume APIs, allowing them to significantly change their company or the industry they exit in.  This is why ProgrammableWeb (PW) finding a new home at MulSsoft, and the $4.2M in funding by 3Scale excites me more than the acquisitions of Mashery or Layer 7.</p>
<p>First, ProgrammableWeb is the grandfather of API discovery, it's history and future are important to how we market our APIs as well as discover APIs for consumption, two sides of a very important coin. &nbsp;So it is critical that PW remain live and being a vibrant piece of the API industry, something I believe that MuleSoft can deliver on, in a way that makes sure PW has a signficant a role in the future of API discovery. Alcatel-Lucent was completely abandoning their API efforts and it would have been a huge blow to the space if PW went down the toilet with Alcatel-Lucent's self-destructive vision of the future.</p>
<h3>Why The 3Scale Investment is Important</h3>
<p>I know all my haters will laugh, but I think the meager $4.2M investment made in 3Scale, is truly a positive sign for the API space.  3Scale isn't building an API service provider company for an exit.  3Scale has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only freemium API service provider in the space since the beginning</span>.  Over the last 3 years, I've had multiple arguments with people across the space that the API opportunity for APIs is about unlocking enterprise resources with APIs, when in reality I feel the true API opportunity is about making sure every single business, organization and government entity understands APIs, stands one up, manages, iterates and evolves it until they get it right, without spending a fortune and being locked into contracts that are ultimately about boosting the numbers of a company intent on their exit.  3Scale has been doing this for years, and the $4.2M is just enough to grow and scale to the next logical and sustainable level.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-craft/API-Craft-SFO-July-2012.png" alt="" width="335" align="right" /></p>
<p>I know the 3Scale approach it is not the sexy "startup way" or the "big numbers" that the TechCrunch and Silicon Valley audience loves, but to me it is a healthy way to approach what the API space truly needs. &nbsp;3Scale's approach to running their business, and helping people stand up and manage their APIs is a realistic, healthy and sustainable way that API owners, developers and the overall space really needs.  3Scale is profitable and sought a sensible next round of funding to do more of what they are already doing. They aren't brining in customers to boost numbers or strictly pandering to the enterprise, ultimately seeking an exit over delivering a quality product.  3Scale focuses on delivering the resources, tools and services that people need to understand and successfully manage their APIs. The sign that 3Scale can get the funding they need to keep moving forward, shows the space has a healthy edge.</p>
<h3>Meaningful Services, Tools and Educational Resources</h3>
<p>Successful acquisitions of API service providers, by large enterprises, will not define the API space as "healthy". To deliver on the OG API vision, we will need a wealth of API resources, tools and services that make APIs accessible to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYONE</span></strong>.  There will be lots of money to be made when every individual company, organization or government organization can stand-up, run and iterate and find success with APIs for whatever their personal objectives or monetization goals are.</p>
<p>There is opportunity in the API space! &nbsp;This is demonstrated by the buzz in the last couple weeks.  But lets not get distracted by the opportunity to make money and selling to the enterprise. Let's focus on the opportunity that APIs afford individuals, companies, organizations and our government, and the impact APIs can make on the end-users or customers these companies sell to, or are in service of.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous API knowledge, tools and resources represent a much bigger opportunity for everyone, beyond the big money deals that seem to catch the headlines and dominate our attention.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale and Intel are both API Evangelist partners. &nbsp;Although I have never actually taken money from 3Scale. &nbsp;Maybe things are different now that they have the big bucks!! :-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://intel.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/intel/Intel-logo.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/04/17/intel-acquires-mashery">Intel is reportedly buying API service provider Mashery for &ldquo;a range of $120 million to $180 million&rdquo;</a>, according to ReadWrite(Web). As I reflect on this, two main questions come to mind:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Was it a smart acquisition for Intel, and worth their money?</li>
<li>Is this a logical move for Intel since they are a chip maker?</li>
</ol>
<p>Was Intel&rsquo;s acquisition smart for Intel?  If they are serious about playing in the API game, which all signals I&rsquo;ve seen say yes, I think it was smart.  They didn&rsquo;t buy Mashery for their tech, although their tech was a nice add-on to <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/">Intel's existing API Gateway</a>.&nbsp;They bought Mashery to buy their market share.</p>
<p>Is the acquisition worth 120-180M?  I&rsquo;m not sure about that.  I don&rsquo;t think Masherys current market share is worth all that, so I think this is an investment in the past and the future more than current market share.  Mashery is the pioneer of the API space, owning that history has value, if you can deliver on the future of the API space.  Which I think Intel is more capable of than Mashery was all by itself.</p>
<p>Next is this a logical move for Intel?  They are maker of physical things like  motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphic chips, embedded processors, not of things virtual like APIs.</p>
<p>Intel is known for making the thing essential ingredients &ldquo;inside&rdquo; our PCs, laptops, servers, smart phones and digital devices.  They have been the driving force of &ldquo;compute&rdquo; for the last 40 years, basically my entire life.  I&rsquo;ve heard lots of chatter today that Intel moving from building the physical ingredients, to virtual APIs is too big of a switch for Intel, and they will fail.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/intel/intel-Expressway-Service-Gateway-Whiteboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Obviously I don&rsquo;t know shit about chip manufacturing, but if Intel wants to be the leader in the next 40 years of computing, moving from central processing units (CPU) to distributed processing units (DPU) makes sense.  In the past they have provided the computer, memory, graphics, networking and other essential elements we needed for personal, server or mobile computing.  While these elements are still relevant at the physical level, compute has moved into the clouds and when it comes to the components or resources we will need to deliver the next generation of laptop, tablet, mobile, server, automobile or anything in the realm of Internet of Things, you will need hardened and secure API compute resources.</p>
<p>Intel will not be building and deploying APIs for fun and games on the Internet.  Intel will be the gateway of the essential resources that are driving our mobile apps like SMS, voice, video encoding, etc, all the way to vital healthcare, climate monitoring and military grade API resources that will drive everything from the private sector to governments and NGOs worldwide.</p>
<p>I feel the Intel vision of APIs won&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t apply to all aspects of web APIs, open data, and various aspects of the open web. But I think Intel has what it takes to deliver the hardened and secure compute resources we are going to need to drive the next 40 years of web enabled technology.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Intel is a partner of API Evangelist and Mashery has never been a partner of API Evangelist. :-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/person-building-blocks.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>On a regular basis I review my API consumption to evaluate how I&rsquo;m using various APIs, and what I&rsquo;m paying for them.   <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">I depend on around 20 APIs to make API Evangelist work</a>, and I need to make sure I&rsquo;m using them to their fullest potential while also being mindful of budget.</p>
<p>As a part of my regular review, I am looking at the differences in pricing between three key services:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/developer/">FullContact API</a> -</strong> I use FullContact for all my company and individual contact intelligence.  I go through phases of light or heavy use depending on research projects I have going on.  Full Contact provides me with per API call rates depending on the endpoint and call volume, and they limit me between four packages Trying It out (Free), Getting Started ($19/month), Gaining Traction ($99/month) and Rolling ($499/month)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">Alchemy API</a> -</strong> I use Alchemy API to primarily pull text content from blog posts, so I can use it internally for indexing.  With Alchemy I get access to three packages Free, Small Business ($250.00) and Basic ($800.00)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS APIs</a> -</strong> I use AWS for all my computer, storage, database and DNS API services.  With AWS I pay by the resource, bandwidth transfer and storage and the other parts and pieces or specific actions in cloud computing.  There are no packages, just modular API resources I use and get billed for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m just one use case, but figured I&rsquo;d share my thoughts on how I use these three API resources within my little world.</p>
<p>For Full Contact the jump from $19/month to $99/month isn&rsquo;t too bad.  I&rsquo;ll lump all my processing together into a single month and get lots of work done.  So I tend to toggle each month between these two tiers based upon my needs.</p>
<p>For Alchemy API I operate within the free tier and stick with the rate limit of 1,000 API calls per day.  If a blog post doesn&rsquo;t get pulled because I hit my limit, I queue it for another day when I have room within my daily limit.   The jump from zero to $250.00 / month is really just too big of a jump for me to make.</p>
<p>My Amazon Web Services bill runs between $250.00 and $1,000.00 / month.  Depending on how much traffic, harvesting, processing and other crazy stuff I&rsquo;m doing.  I have a buffet of compute, storage, database, IP address, monitoring,DNS and other cloud computing modules that I have developed and associated with pricing in my head, so that I can make decisions in the moment about whether I can afford to process a bunch of data, launch new API, website etc.</p>
<p>I have a few good friends in the API space that feel API rate limits stimulate creativity, innovation and work-arounds.  I agree with that statement, and think every API has to understand its own consumer and make the decision they feel is best.  But in the end, I personally like single API resource pricing based upon units, that I can scale infinitely as needed in any moment.  I&rsquo;m am more likely to integrate services into my world when they are independent bite size chunks, with pricing not restricted by other services or service tiers.  Each module tends to have different value in my world and I like to make independent decisions about how to use just that resource, disconnected from all the other resources.</p>
<p>The world is starting to look different when I depend on 10-20 APIs vs 1-2 APIs, and I can imagine when I reach the point where I'm depending on 100-200 APIs I will have an even greater need to have API resources be priced independent of other services or limiting pricing tiers. &nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/17/conflicting-emotions-about-api-providers/">Conflicting Emotions About API Providers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/conflict-with-myself.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a walking conflict most of the time.  You should try being me, it can be tense about 40% of the time.   I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of example of what I mean to help bring you a little closer to what I experience each day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with what I consider to be the 2nd most important API of all time (#1 being AWS), Twitter.  I love / hate Twitter.  They really deliver on everything around their API except in regards to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong> - Their rate limits suck!</li>
<li><strong>Competition</strong> - They don&rsquo;t approach potential competition sensibly</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - They aren&rsquo;t good communicators</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than those three <em>"simple areas"</em>, Twitter delivers a damn good API.  I find it very hard to criticize what they do, except for the fact that having suffocating rate limits, and shutting off access for integrations you view as competitive, can well, be a pretty quick downer.</p>
<p>An example of Twitter in action is with their recent post about <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/symbols-entities-tweets">Symbols entities for Tweets</a>.  I love this idea, I&rsquo;m working through thoughts that are similar, when it comes to <a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">markup APIs or what I&rsquo;m calling dictionary APIs</a>.  I think that a dictionary, symbol or other lookup functionality around an API is cool and has a lot of potential...right up until the point you realize they are have been <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/30/why-isnt-the-ftc-looking-into-twitters-increasingly-anti-competitive-practices/">sharecropping a lot of this innovation from the Twitter Ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, I just have to live at odds with the way I feel about Twitter.  I can&rsquo;t stop showcasing the cool stuff they are doing, just because I do not agree with their approach to API rate limits, communication, competition and sharecropping (or is it cropdusting?)</p>
<p>Another similar conflict in my life is around the <a title="Pearson API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/apis">Pearson API</a>.  As a company I&rsquo;m not 100% in agreement with what Pearson is up to, but from an API perspective, I am a big fan of the companies approach.  They follow what I consider to be a lot of the best practice for the space, and have a model API program I think other publishers should follow.  This canyon is made even wider by the fact I live and work with <a href="http://hackeducation.com">notorious ed-tech trouble maker Audrey Watters</a> who is not shy about sharing her hatred of Pearson.</p>
<p>In the end, I think my inner conflicts make for a better lense to see the API space through.  I will keep sharing the good, the bad and the ugly as I see it.  I really believe that Twitter is the second most important API around, and I can&rsquo;t help but showcase what they are doing, while also holding them up as them up as the poster child of how to do it both right and wrong at the same time!</p>

<p>The ability for me to own <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>, point it at a server, host a website and a blog has been an critical part of my online world and professional career for over 12 years now.  My blog goes back to June of 2007, but I have had a site and portfolio up there since around 2000.  Having control over my domain has enabled me to store years of my writing, research and projects in a central location that I have control over, allowing me to land jobs, contracts or evolve into entirely new domains that have expanded my audience in ways I never imagined, like with&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p>Anytime I can teach this approach to someone else and empower them to own their own domain, I&rsquo;ve jumped at the chance, resulting in numerous individuals who have their own thriving domains--including my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://audrewyatters.com">Audrey Watters</a> with her blog <a title="Hack Education" href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.  Understanding what is necessary to purchase, own and manage your domain, servers, sites, applications and other portions of our digital lives is something everyone should do! But be careful, you just might change the world, and make a significant impact like Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audrewyatters</a>) has.</p>

<p>Last weekend while at MIT, I had a chance to work on a project that takes this concept of owning your domain and looks to make it an educational resource anyone can take advantage of.  I ended up at the MIT Media Lab after being summoned for an&nbsp;<a title="open learning hackathon" href="http://open.media.mit.edu/hackathon.html">open learning hackathon</a>&nbsp;by MIT and Phillip Schmidt (<a href="https://twitter.com/schmidtphi">@schmidtphi</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>. &nbsp;During the event&nbsp;I had the pleasure of plotting and scheming with infamous technology educator Jim Groom (<a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>) and education rabble rouser Audrey Watters on an&nbsp;<a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/a-domain-of-ones-own-to-community-syndication-hubs/">idea Jim brought with him</a>, that was born out of the <a href="http://umwdomains.com/">University of Mary Washington Domain of One's Own Project</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/reclaimyourdomain/kin-jim-brainstorming.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>After the hackathon was kicked off properly Friday afternoon, Jim and I spent the afternoon of whiteboarding, followed up by a quality evening of beer drinking, in which Jim, Audrey and I hatched a plan we called #ReclaimYourDomain, which would act a hub to allow anyone to easily learn about taking control over their domain, complete with the tools for actually delivering on the promise.</p>
<h3>#ReclaimYourDomain Hub</h3>
<p>Allowing users to take control of their domain will start at a centralized hub where anyone can begin learning about the nuts and bolts of domain ownership, but also find a wizard that will walk them through the sometimes confusing process.  The #ReclaimYourDomain hub is an open source platform that could be launched by a teacher or department within a school, career training center, or any other institution that would like to help individuals own their own domain, and be the central support for them until they could operate completely on their own.</p>
<p>Right now the #ReclaimYourDomain Hub will run as stand-alone service at <a title="reclaimyourdomain.org" href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org">reclaimyourdomain.org</a>, but eventually it will be available for anyone to deploy on any server.  The #ReclaimYourDomain Hub will start with a simple home and about page, but focus on a simple wizard that will walk an individual through purchasing and setting up their own online domain.</p>
<h3>#ReclaimYourDomain Wizard</h3>
<p>The focal point of#ReclaimYourDomain is a simple, six step wizard that will walk any user through owning their own domain:&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="olist">
<li><strong>Claim Your Domain</strong> - Allow users to select, purchase and setup domain</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - Select from common resources such as a blog</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> - Where resources like a blog will be located using services like Github, Dropbox or Amazon S3 or EC2</li>
<li><strong>Details</strong> - Title, summary, photo and a full bio of the domain owner</li>
<li><strong>Contact</strong> - Provide contact information for the domain user that visitors can use to contact them</li>
<li><strong>Hello World </strong>- Something to kick off the launch of a domain like writing the first blog</li>
</ol>
<p>When done running the #ReclaimYourDomain wizard, the service will purchase a top level domain, setup a basic profile site for the user and configure the resources (like a blog), chosen during the wizard. Right now the only resource #ReclaimYourDomain will offer is a blog, but will deliver in other resource areas in the future. To start I'd like to see several definitions of what a blog is:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog @ Local Server with Wordpress</li>
<li>Blog @ AWS EC2 Linux + Amazon RDS + Linux with Wordpress</li>
<li>Blog @ Github Pages with Jekyll</li>
<li>Blog @ Dropbox with Jekyll</li>
<li>Blog @ Amazon S3 with Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to successfully setup a domain, landing page and blog for a user, but the mission is to educate the user about the process ,different resources, location configurations by providing a series of learning objects and migration paths which will allow users to make educated decisions about which options are best for them.  If you want to understand more about why this is important read Audrey's <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/04/11/reclaim-your-domain/">Reclaim Your Domain: A #ReclaimOpen Hackathon Project</a> and Jim's <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-open-learning/">Reclaim Open Learning</a>, located at their domain blogs.</p>
<p><a title="Brain Gears" href="http://fineartamerica.com/featured/4-brain-design-by-cogs-and-gears-setsiri-silapasuwanchai.html" target="_blank"><img style="pading: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/gears-brain.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<h3>Learning Objects</h3>
<p>With digital literacy the mission, #ReclaimYourDomain will provide a series of structured learning objects that will educate users at every step of the setup, configuration and management of their domain.</p>
<p>Learning objects will be available via a centralized help center, while also being linked individually throughout the domain setup wizard and management process so users can access whenever needed, at just the right moment.</p>
<p>As Audrey says, the goal of #RelcaimYourDomain is not just to provide an easy button for buying a domain and setting up a blog, it is to actually educate users about the process, equipping them with essential web literacy skills along the way.</p>
<h3>Domain</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain user will be given their own domain, complete with a static home, about and contact pages.  The domain will always provide a user with a single landing page that will represent their online persona. A #ReclaimYourDomain domain site will provide users with two key services:</p>
<p><a title="Sir Edmund Hilary - Mount Cook by Vanessa (EY), on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanchett/424399237/"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/174/424399237_b60c7e1732.jpg" alt="Sir Edmund Hilary - Mount Cook" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - The ability to add different resources like a blog, and configure what application is used and where the blog is hosted within their domain</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - A tool for adding titles and urls that link to existing services a user might depend on like Flickr, Facebook and LinkedIn--services that are unlikely to ever be hosted as a local resource</li>
</ul>
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain is designed to educate users about all the services we depend on, while providing the knowledge and tools to incrementally take control over their:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Online Domain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Critical Services</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personal Data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The process of educating average Internet users about taking control of their worlds in these three essential areas is no easy task, it will be a process that will never fully be complete--requiring a constant flow of open educational resources to empower domain owners about our ever changing digital worlds.</p>
<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain site will have a dashboard allowing each individual to manage their details, contact information, resources and links. The dashboard will be tighlty coupled with the help center, which will provide access to all learning objects, but also provide meaningful analytics that will help users understand the activity that occurs within their domain.</p>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain site will also have a programmatic layer allowing discovery of profile detail, resources and links.  The #ReclaimYourDomain user domain site will automatically generate not just an HTML home page, but an XML and JSON version providing a programmatic directory for accessing domain details, links and valuable resources like your blog RSS or Twitter accounts.</p>
<h3>Domain Modules</h3>
<p><a title="Reclaim" href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org" target="_blank"><img style="pading: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/reclaimyourdomain/puzzle-cloud-services.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain will initially employ a handful of modules, but eventually could provide access to a robust library of common or niche components.  While the goal is to empower users to set up application within their domain, the platform will easily support common cloud services like Tumblr, Flickr, Evernote and others--with the intention of educating users about the pros and cons of each service, with clear migration paths between resource services and various locations.</p>
<p>Each domain module will come complete with setup, management, migration and even backup, storage and syndication options allowing each module to work independently while providing domain owners with the largest amount of control. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All domain modules will have their own learning objects to support educating users about all the parts and pieces of domain literacy, exposing the technology, business and political layers each resource and its underlying services possess. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a title="Reclaim" href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org" target="_blank"><img style="pading: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/fist.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Currently Jim, Audrey and I have a mocked up version of <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">#ReclaimYourDomain Hub</a> and a <a href="http://template.reclaimyourdomain.org/">#ReclaimYourDomain domain site</a>. &nbsp;All the buttons and lnks work, so make sure and click around to see it in action. &nbsp;I need to gather my thoughts from the project, then I will be publishing all #ReclaimYourDomain code and a framework for planning via Github.</p>
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain is not just about setting up a domain and blog.  It is much more than that.  It is meant to be a hands on, digital literacy platform to teach anyone about reclaiming, owning and managing their online domain.</p>
<p>Giving someone the ability to own their domain can look as simple as having a place to put your thoughts via a blog, but could also evolve into an aggregate location to store and link all of a peron's projects, allowing them to be used as part of your online CV and potentially a digital badge or credential system. The possibilities are really endless. However to achieve this vision, we have to educate people about the building blocks of a domain, the importance of taking control over essential services within your domain, and asserting ownership over as much of our personal data as we possibly can, through this enlightening process.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on #ReclaimYourDomain, and if you&rsquo;d like to get involved feel free to <a href="http://kinlane.com/contact/">contact me</a> directly or stay tuned and I&rsquo;ll have the Github project up shortly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/studio-sketchpad/studeio-sketchpad-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote yesterday&rsquo;s piece on <a href="/2013/04/09/api-education-with-codecademy/">API education with Codecademy</a> back in February.  I didn&rsquo;t publish because I wanted to do more research on suggested areas of improvement for the Codecademy team to balance my criticism.</p>
<p>The point of yesterday's post was not to bash Codecademy, it is to incentivize them to make their platform better.  Until then, I can't really recommend as an <a title="API Building Block" href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a>.</p>
<p>The publishing of my post yesterday was triggered after seeing an example of what is possible after seeing another learn to code platform called <a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank">Studio Sketchpad</a> by Ari Bader-Natal (<a href="https://twitter.com/studiosketchpad">@studiosketchpad</a>).  Studio Sketchpad is an open studio platform for creating beautiful code, aiming to be a open studio for individuals learning to sketch beautiful code on the web canvas--built on a mashup of the Sketch from <a title="Processing" href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing</a> and the Pad from <a href="http://etherpad.com/">EtherPad</a>.</p>
<p>Studio Sketchpad, while still a work in progress has many of the essential elements I feel should be part of any learn to code with API tool.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Learn By Yourself</strong> - You can select lessons and learn online at your own pace</li>
<li><strong>Learn With Instructor </strong>- You can learn in real-time with the assistance of instructor</li>
<li><strong>Create Lessons</strong> - Instructors can build and record lessons and publish to a gallery, providing code walkthrough, with audio (using SoundCloud), complete with playback</li>
<li><strong>Cloning</strong> - You can clone a sketch (lesson) and tweek, edit and make learning more hands on</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong> - You can see the, interact and fork sketches at any point in the evolution of the script</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - You can embed the sketch within your site, allowing for use on your site</li>
<li><strong>Render</strong> - All code renders so you can see the results of the lesson and your modifications</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> - Allow you to share to your social networks</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong> - You can export code lessons to use outside of Studio Sketchpad</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong> - Sketches are openly licensed allowing for reuse, remix and learning</li>
</ul>
<p>I found nine additional features, beyond what is available via Codecademy.  I strongly feel both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embeddability</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learn with instructor</span> are critical to API education. &nbsp;My primary arguement in yesterday's post is I can&rsquo;t endorse sending our API users away to learn about an API.  API education is an hands-on, iterative process, and we have invested too much in our API ecosystems to ship our users off to boarding school.</p>
<p><a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/studio-sketchpad/studio-sketchpad-example.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Secondarily API education is not just people learning about your API, it is about you learning from your API consumers and making your API endpoints, resources and community better.  As API owners there is so much to learn through interacting with our API consumers as they learn and integrate with a platform.  API education isn&rsquo;t a one way street.</p>
<p>I understand everyone in Silicon Valley is cheering for Codecademy, but I think that we are setting the bar too low.  What Ari has created with Studio Sketchpad raises the bar, and really delivers a platform that can help people truly learn about programming.  His implementation is for learning about Canvas, and would take some work to retrofit for PHP, Python, Ruby and would need some sort of emulator to work for iOS and Android, but the important elements are all there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned with where Codecademy has opted to set the bar, since they are a YCombinator company, based on the fact that the technology Studio Sketchpad is built Eitherpad has its origins in YCombinator <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=977015">before Google bought it</a>, and in its early incarnation as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppJet">AppJet</a>.  There seems to be some sort of broken feedback loop at YCombinator, and I don&rsquo;t think Codecademy is consciously ignoring the past, but I think there is a lot they can learn from their own investor's technology history, our <a href="http://guide.hackeducation.com/techies.php">rich history of teaching people to program</a> and some of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">proven building blocks for API support and education</a>.</p>
<p>I hope Codecademy and other platforms who are looking to teach people to use APIs receive both my posts as constructive criticism on how they can evolve their platforms to better serve not just the API consumer, but also API owners--resulting in truly helping educate the masses about the potential of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/fist.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Last week Twitter expanded its Twitter Cards initiative to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/02/looking-to-find-new-apps-twitter-adds-third-party-app-discovery-and-deep-links/">allow 3rd party app developers to include links to download apps within Tweets</a>, opening up new opportunities for app discovery via Twitter.  Yay, for app developers...</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t try to explain the <a title="history of Twitters approach to their ecosystem" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">history of Twitter's approach to their ecosystem</a>, their <a title="Twitters tight fisted approach to cards" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/13/twitter-launches-new-not-so-open-graph-aka-twitter-cards/">tight fisted approach to Twitter Cards</a>, and how it affects this latest app discovery announcement.  Matthew Ingram does an amazing job (as always) of capturing the essence with <a title="Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/03/twitter-plays-its-platform-hand-and-it-is-the-one-holding-all-the-cards/">Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards</a>.</p>
<p>My point is, their announcement isn&rsquo;t that exciting. Could you imagine what would be possible if Twitter decide to actually use an open standard like <a title="Open Graph" href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a>, and allowed developers to innovate within Tweets using Twitter Cards?</p>
<p>I fully understand Twitter wants control over their platform, and I don&rsquo;t deny any platform the right to assert control.  And yes, Twitter allows their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/twitter-certified-products">approved partners</a> to play in this arena.  But that isn&rsquo;t open! &nbsp;And, it isn&rsquo;t part of the OG vision that Twitter was built on.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Twitter is missing out on soooo much opportunity for innovation in the space that exists within a Tweet.  Sure, not every developer idea would be good or even viable, but without opening it up, we will never know what is possible, and what end-users would want and embrace. &nbsp;It is all up to Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So much missed opportunity for innovation, in the name of control. :-(</p>
<p><strong>Correction:</strong>&nbsp;I call Open Graph a Standard. &nbsp;I should have said protocol. &nbsp;I will leave as is, and just admit my error.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/finger-pointing.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />How To Get Your Grandma, Mother, Daughter and Sister to Understand APIs? You stop using gendered approaches when explaining what an API is.  I&rsquo;m not going to cite any of the past or recent examples of this (you know who you are). And I don&rsquo;t care <em>"how you didn&rsquo;t even mean to do this"</em>, when you wrote your API example.  There really isn&rsquo;t a line between sexism and ignorant sexism.</p>
<p>If you really want everyone to understand what an API is, provide well written, plain english examples, that are framed around solving a problem your grandma, mother, daughter or or sister will understand--using problems they truly face in their lives.</p>
<p>It really is that simple.  As long as you are using gendered terms to describe what we are doing, you are raising the barrier to entry. &nbsp;And when you do this, you are talking down to a person and making them feel small, stupid and all the other power trips that go with sexism.  And yes, those thing are still there even if you <em>"didn&rsquo;t mean to do it"</em>.</p>
<p>So let &lsquo;s make sure and keep API examples about solving problems and putting the valuable API resources to use, and not about gender, and get EVERYONE on board.</p>
<p>End of story! And if ever step over this line, call me out. I welcome it, cause I'm not perfect or exempt.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/09/api-education-with-codecademy/">API Education With Codecademy</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codecademy/codecademy-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I do with many of my stories, I&rsquo;ve been stewing on the news that online education platform Codecademy started offering API programming lessons for popular APIs like Twilio and NPR back in January.  While at first glance this seems like an important evolution in API education, I wanted to really think through all the details of API on-boarding before I passed judgement.</p>
<p>Codecademy&rsquo;s claim to fame is a pretty slick code view where you can edit your code and then a view window, which will process and run your code, letting you know if you&rsquo;ve done it right or not.  Each class is broken into several lessons, allowing you to finish at your pace, with a accompanying Q&amp;A forum, glossary and scratch pad--with a badge showing you passed the course.</p>
<p>Codecademy offers API classes for YouTube, SoundCloud, Parse, Twilio, SendGrid, NPR, Sunlight Foundation, Bitly, PlaceKitten and Stripe APIs and handful of others, with each class using Python, Ruby or JavaScript as the programming language. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Codecademy is a novel idea for helping existing developers understand the ins and outs of learning a new programming language or learning an API, using their wizard driven, code tutorials.  But it shouldn&rsquo;t be the only tool in your toolbox for helping people understand your API.</p>
<p>First I don&rsquo;t think people (especially non-developers) want to &ldquo;learn a programming language&rdquo; or want to &ldquo;learn an API&rdquo;.  In my opinion, APIs are about opening up access to resources that anyone can take advantage of, even non-developers.  Because many APIs are built on HTTP and use simple key authentication, it makes them extremely hackable and something that anyone can put to use.  I don&rsquo;t think we need to require people to be programmers to use APIs, we can allow varying grades of coders, scripters and hackers to put APIs to use to solve problems they face in their everyday worlds.</p>
<p>When looking to educate your potential consumers about your API, you should focus on some sort of project that your target audience will relate with.  I&rsquo;m assuming you have done a great deal of due diligence on the market you have entered, as well as profiled any developers who are already registered for your API.  So you have a good idea of the types of problems your API will solve and potentially how users will put it to use.  With this knowledge you should be building lessons that speak specifically to these problems, not generically &ldquo;learn your API&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Next there are plenty of established building blocks like interactive documentation, blog, forum, frequently asked questions, youtube and Twitter that you can use to build lessons that focus on specific projects or problems your known target audience will need to solve.  I just can&rsquo;t advocate sending users away from your site to learn about your API, when you already have the building blocks you need to teach them in your API area.</p>
<p>Additionally, by using existing building blocks to construct specific lessons for potential users you will receive the SEO benefit, which will draw in new users looking to solve the problems you&rsquo;ve identified.  Most users won&rsquo;t know they need to learn your API, they will be Googling that they need to solve a problem, and come across your API.  You will miss out on this if you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">solely rely</span> on an online platform like Codecademy.</p>
<p>Beyond SEO, you will deprive new users of the additional benefits provided by your API ecosystem, like direct and community support.  On Codecademy you won&rsquo;t be there to answer their questions along the way, and they won&rsquo;t be able to access the knowledge and wisdom of your existing developer community--an essential aspect of taking your API from just an area, to a community and ultimately an ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codecademy/codecademy-api-page.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>My objective on API Evangelist is to help API owners be successful in their API initiatives by understand the best practices to deploying and managing their APIs.  I think Codecademy is a very cool platform and if you have the resources it is something you should add to your toolbox.  But if your API team resources are short (as they are in most), you need to rely on many of the existing building blocks you have and build meaningful education material for your API that users can find and put to use within your API area, where you can make sure and support them in real-time.</p>
<p>Looking at the lessons Codecademy has, I don&rsquo;t think they have the resources to offer lessons on all the top APIs, and I think they should focus on lessons around other common building blocks that API owners could put to use educating users, such as HTTP, oAuth, JSON, etc.  I think its easy for all of us 8% alpha geeks to get excited about tools like Codecademy, but when the rubber meets the road with the mainstream I think we have to think deeper about how we approach teaching people about tech and APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/03/moving-beyond-api-pricing-to-api-price-reduction/">Moving Beyond API Pricing to API Price Reduction</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/aws-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a lot of inquiries from API owners about how they should price their API access in a way that will make sense to developers, but also help them generate revenue from their valuable API resources.</p>
<p>As most of us are still trying to figure out sensible pricing for our new APIs, or better understand how to adjust and evolve pricing to better suit existing developers--Amazon is busy reducing their cloud API pricing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a simple email from Amazon today:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear Amazon S3 Customer,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We are excited to announce that we are reducing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=2SXVU4T3VRUWB&amp;C=J2HG6JVZ1C5L&amp;H=PVA7GS7QEGLCGOTDJIF9KXXMGHEA&amp;T=C&amp;U=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fs3%2Fpricing%3Fref_%3Dpe_12300_29052180_8" target="_blank">Amazon S3 request prices</a>&nbsp;in all nine of our regions. We are lowering the prices for GET requests by 60% and the prices for PUT, LIST, COPY, and POST requests by 50%. For example, in the US Standard Region, we are reducing the price of every 1,000 PUT requests from $0.01 to $0.005 and the price of every 10,000 GET requests from $0.01 to $0.004.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We are happy to pass along these savings to you as we continue to drive down our costs. The new lower prices for all regions can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=2SXVU4T3VRUWB&amp;C=J2HG6JVZ1C5L&amp;H=PXMXBBGNPMWR1VAGFSTZAJIJ7Y8A&amp;T=C&amp;U=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fs3%2Fpricing%3Fref_%3Dpe_12300_29052180_7" target="_blank">Amazon S3 pricing page</a>. New prices are effective April 1st and will be applied to your bill for all requests on or after this date.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sincerely,</em><br /><em>The Amazon S3 Team</em></p>
<p>These price reductions are becoming more frequent across the numerous AWS APIs I depend on like S3, EC2 and RDS. &nbsp;I have been an S3 user since 2006 and EC2 since 2008, and I didn't see price reductions at all in the early days, but they seem to be a common part of doing business in the cloud today.</p>
<p>The obvious explanation is that competition in the cloud space is heating up, especially with Google stepping up their game, but I think there are other lessons for API owners here. That spending the time to initially develop a sensible pricing model for your API is important, but also continuing to understand how it is working for developers and how they are accessing and putting your API resources to use--which will allow you to reach a place where you know your API, developers and the space you operate so well, you can reduce pricing, while actually increasing your revenue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At some point I would like to go back and document all the AWS pricing, to see at what point they were able to have enough of an understanding to begin delivering price reductions, and also see if there are any other correlations in the market that I can identify that have coincided with their pricing decisions. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/angry-birds-are-amazing/images/32024326/title/angry-bird-photo" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/angry-bird.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming professionally since 1988, so I&rsquo;ve been around quite a few developers in my career. There seems to be a lot of moments lately that cause me to look back at this career, reassess what I've learned, and adjust the direction I'm going with this mined wisdom. &nbsp;This week I&rsquo;m reflecting on the recent insanity around Adria Richards, my role as the API Evangelist, and spending time thinking about the tech space's inclusiveness as I&rsquo;m hanging out with my 12 year old daughter for spring break.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, in just about every position I&rsquo;ve taken, whether as a programmer, manager, lead, architect and VP, I&rsquo;ve encountered developers who are challenged by me, my role, skills and approach to tech.  I can remember 3 separate roles I&rsquo;ve had where one of my first assigned tasks was to fire a developer who had made everyone&rsquo;s lives miserable, because before I came along they couldn&rsquo;t fire them (him), because they were dependent on them for their skills.</p>
<p>Quality technical talent is hard to find, and many companies can&rsquo;t afford to lose the talent they already have.  No matter what the personality defects or the workplace issues might be.  Many developers know this and work it to their advantage, taking advantage of power they possess for their own selfish goals.</p>
<p>This power struggle does not just exist between developers and non-developers.  As a programmer I encounter developers who always have to one up you, and make you feel stupid for what you don&rsquo;t know.  It might be a programming language, database platform, technical library or just the fact you use Windows vs Mac.  Some programmers can co-exist, but many feel the need to challenge others, while assuming a defensive position around their established fiefdom.</p>
<p>Outside the corporate firewall I see this behavior extended to online interactions, where programmers make non-developers feel insignificant for what they do not know, and belittle other developers for what skills they lack.  Something that often can extend into other more harmful, trollish behavior.  Developers can be quick to jump one others in an online environment,  creating very uncomfortable or hostile situations.</p>
<p>Many places I&rsquo;ve worked or contracted with, this power struggle plays itself out as the classic IT bottleneck.  IT bottlenecks are often portrayed as lack of resources, but more often than not they represent power struggles around budget, technology and other lesser evils.  Think about some of your IT interactions--is it always a shortage or resources or lack of desire to actually deliver?  It can be very hard to tell sometimes.</p>
<p>While the root of this behavior I feel is insecurity, I think ultimately it is all about power.  I also strongly believe one of the by-products of this reality is the sexism, racism and other negativity that is a systemic issue in the tech space.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/information-technology.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not writing this to say that all developers are power trippers.  They aren&rsquo;t.  But us technologists have a huge problems with wanting to be keepers of the knowledge.  I&rsquo;m not excluding myself from this.  I fall victim to the desire for power and glory.  I&rsquo;m not exempt.  But I work really, really, really hard at trying to transcend this past I share with the rest of the tech space.</p>
<p>I believe APIs are letting the IT resources out of the bag, and so is the consumerization of other areas like cloud computing, storage, email, web and mobile development, etc. APIs are bringing valuable IT resources closer to the people who can use these resources to solve problems.  I saw the opportunities around APIs playing out from 2005 through 2010, and in middle of 2010 I decided to start <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> to help spread the word to the masses about the potential of APIs--bridging a gap that has created between developers and non-developers.</p>
<p>It is very important that us technologists ground our work in the assistance of other non-technologists.  We have to work very, very, very hard at being nice and make what we do inclusive.  It isn&rsquo;t easy.  Listen to the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/post/44802468357/episode-7-i-went-through-three-cliches-there">first couple minutes of the API podcast Traffic and Weather from the other  week</a> and you will hear how much work I put into making sure I&rsquo;m pleasant, but make an impact when engaging not only non-developers, but developers alike.  It is critical.</p>
<p>If you are a developer, please join me in making sure everything we do is as inclusive as possible for other developers, non-developers and most importantly of other sexes, races and anyone we encounter in what we do.</p>

<p><a title="I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet" href="http://tosdr.org/">I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet</a>.  We agree to terms of service for each and every service we use online, without ever reading and understanding exactly what we are agreeing to.</p>
<p>This is one of the most damaging aspects of online life, as through this process we are giving away our rights, ownership of our data and allowing for our privacy to be compromised each and every day.  While not all services are abusing this, there are many online services that use this to their advantage, in an effort to maximize the amount of value they extract from their platform and end users.</p>
<p>Service providers have to go further in educating users about the terms of service they are agreeing to.  There is a great example of this in action, via an article in NextWeb called &ldquo;<a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/29/now-this-is-how-to-write-a-terms-of-service-document/">now THIS is how to write your startup&rsquo;s Terms of Service</a>&rdquo;.  The post showcases how <a href="http://heello.com/" target="_blank">real-time sharing platform Heello</a> has provided <a href="https://heello.com/terms" target="_blank">plain english descriptions, next to each &ldquo;legaleze&rdquo; paragraph in their terms of service</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://heello.com/terms" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heello/heello-terms-of-service.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is nothing new. <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms_of_service">You see it with other providers like Tumblr</a>.  But I think it is a very simple enhancement to API terms of service that can have a huge effect, and begin leading us in a more healthy direction when it comes to educating end-users about the TOS they are bound to.  While companies need the protection of a legal terms of service, there is no reason you can't provide your end users with a translated, plain english version. &nbsp;It doesn't take much work, and really sets you apart from other API service providers.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other examples of online services going above and beyond to help educate end users about terms of service?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/28/the-noun-project-api/">The Noun Project API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> is <a href="http://thenounproject.com/developers/">soliciting feedback on their upcoming API</a>.  If you aren&rsquo;t familar with The Noun Project, it is a innovative visual language project, that is creating a library of icons that will enable people to visually communicate and interact around the globe. Direct from <a href="http://thenounproject.com/about/">The Noun Project about page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Humans have been using symbols to communicate for over 17,000 years because they are the one language everyone can understand. Symbols can transcend cultural and language barriers and deliver concise information effortlessly and instantaneously. They allow people to communicate quickly, effectively, and intuitively. And for the first time ever, this language is being combined with technology to create a social language that unites the world.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Noun Project wants <a href="http://thenounproject.com/developers/">our feedback on what a Noun Project API might look like</a> and what we would use it for. &nbsp;So, I wanted to take a moment and share my thoughts, about what I would use The Noun Project API for, and some thoughts about what the endpoints might look like.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong> <br />Normally an embeddable strategy for an API is in the background, relinquished to just one of the tools in the toolbox.  With the Noun Project I think a healthy embeddable strategy would be front and center, providing a wide array of buttons, badges, widgets and other items users could syndicate across the web.  The library of embeddable tools should be open for submission, much like the core of the Noun Project.  Designers could generate custom button sets, badges and other embeddables for users to choose from.  The Noun Project's embeddable strategy would make the Noun Project API accessible to everyone, even non-developers.</p>
<p><strong>Builders and IDE </strong><br />A Noun Project API would enable a next generation of mobile and web application apps, as well as other visualization and big data analysis tools to integrate consistent imagery.  Makers of integrated development environments (IDE) could provide button, icon and other UI components with a wealth of meaningful icons, that could become the new default in modern apps.  Think how Twitter bootstrap is raising the bar in overall app user interface quality?  Love it or not, Twitter Bootstrap has made things look better, and consistent use of the Noun Project images could go even further.</p>
<p><strong>Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words </strong><br />The Noun Project API would enable a wealth of text to image visualization possibilities, allowing developers to accompany and represent everyday text in much more impactful ways.  Imagine if in addition to titles and summaries, you always had a Noun Project icon to reference when reading on the web and via your favorite applications.  A couple examples might be:</p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project-idea.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog &amp; News Listings</strong> - Often times our blogging platforms have a way to upload an image to represent a post or story.  The Noun Project could be used as visual cues for stories in certain categories or programmable determined by the text content of a story, dynamically pulled from the Noun Project API</li>
<li><strong>Link Representations</strong> - When faced with a link, all you have to reference is the title and possibly a description.  The addition of a Noun Project icon, pulled from the API after indexing the content of links page would help users make a determination of a site&rsquo;s content before clicking</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - The Noun Project could be used to provide visual references for emails, SMS, Tweets, Facebook Wall posts and other common forms of digital communication. &nbsp;Icons could be suggested based upon message content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ways The Noun Project API could be used to dynamically offer visual representations for common textual objects we encounter in our every day lives.  I&rsquo;m sure a developer community would come up with many more examples, once the API is available.</p>
<p><strong>Network Graph</strong><br />Built into The Noun Project API would be a representation of the social and network graph of an image.  You could see how popular a particular image or set of images is.  You could apply this into the filtering and retrieval of images via the API, as well as have as part of the image meta data to use in your own application logic. To achieve the level of meaning the project intends to, a graph will be needed to show the use, reach and impact of each image and sets of images.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Network </strong><br />Also built into The Noun Project API should be a partner layer, that reflects the core mission of the project.  Every image returned by the API would be complete with all meta data regarding its creator and how the image can, and is being used across the network.  The Noun Project Partner Network would give more control and insight for designers to see how their images are being used as well as commercial, volume and other monetization opportunities for designers--a layer that could be part of the overall Noun Project revenue strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution</strong> <br />Without an API, the usage of Noun Project images is a manual process, leaving attribution up to the user.  With an API and a healthy branding and attribution framework, The Noun Project attribution would be built into the embeddable strategy as well as bundled into each and every Noun Project API response.  This would provide The Noun Project network with easy attribution, which doesn't just credit designers, it will be the basis of The Noun Project marketing. Imagine being able to visualize the entire syndication for a single icon! Without an API this is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging the Digital to Physical </strong><br />The Noun Project API would allow innovative new ways to use Noun Project icons in the physical world as well as the digital.  An API could allow for the printing on demand of icon templates in various sizes, and ship them to users for creating signs and other real-world uses that could be permanent or possibly even ephemeral, with the use of temporary paints or spray on chalks.  This process wouldn't be a one-way street either.  With a Noun Project API, developers could build icon recognition applications that could snap a picture of an icon printed (permanently or temporary) and immediately connect users back to the virtual world around the icon, either based upon its meaning, designer or some new represenation that has emerged as part of the Noun Project network graph.</p>
<p>That are just some of my initial thoughts around how a Noun Project API could be put to use in meaningful ways.  Regarding what The Noun Project API would look like. I'd like to see some of the following endpoints:</p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project-clicking-heels.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Designers</strong> - Endpoint for icon designers, with access to their profile, collections and icons&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - Enpoint for Noun Project user accounts with access to account and billing settings as well as favorite, saved, purchased icons and collections</li>
<li><strong>Icons</strong> - Endpoint for all icons, allowing to to search and filter individual icons as well as add and update existing icons for my designer profile</li>
<li><strong>Collections</strong> - Collection endpoints allowing me to search, filter and pull individual icon collections</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> - Endpoint for all words used for icons, allowing a dictionary that developed can reference while developing providing a reverse search for icons</li>
<li><strong>Graph</strong> - API access to all graph related events like popular icons, collections and designers as well as trending icons collections and reverse searches on popular keywords or phrases</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are more endpoints that could be identified in the future.  I think the most important aspect is to just get an API launched, and have a healthy strategy for engaging users to find out what should be put on the roadmap. Just starting simple and making sure to expose all aspects of the core Noun Project is an important beginning--the rest will come.</p>
<p>What a fascinating project the Noun Project is.  I strongly believe that it order to fulfill its full vision, the Noun Project has to have an API.  The Noun Project API will be essential to syndicating the icons across both our physical and virtual worlds, provide a way for users and designers to interact around the icons, while also providing the most meaningful licensing framework possible that would even include much needed revenue for both designers and the Noun Project, and keep this very important project alive.</p>

<p>I depend on <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> to move data around the cloud. &nbsp;I syndicate blog posts from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> to Blogger and Tumblr. &nbsp;This isn't just blind syndication, it is SEO and also plan B scenarios to make sure my content exists in multiple areas.</p>
<p>When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use. &nbsp;If I begin to depend on an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS). &nbsp;This is how I roll.</p>
<p>Not all platorms allow for this. &nbsp;In my opinion, all FREE platforms should have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">relief valves for users</a> like me, who want to move to some sort of paid account, assuring me some sort of service level agreement (SLA) or I'll move away.</p>
<p>For example: Once I started using Evernote regularly, I moved to the premium level. &nbsp;I bought into Pinboard at an early rate, once I was hooked. &nbsp;Inversely, I can't pay for Twitter, Facebook and some Google services. &nbsp;Today it is about IFTT.</p>
<p>In light of me losing Google Reader I'm taking a hard look at all my services. &nbsp;IFTT is on the chopping block.</p>
<p>I have about 20-30 jobs running at IFTTT, moving data around between my cloud services, in a way I depend on. &nbsp;I need to move this into the realm of premium or paid services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? &nbsp;Sell me on your service.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/26/embeddable-api-conversations-with-adam-of-iris-media/">Embeddable API Conversations with Adam of Iris Media</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/iris-media/iris-media-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent some time drinking IPAs and talking education technology with Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and a friend of ours Adam Wendt (<a href="https://twitter.com/skinnyblimp">@skinnyblimp</a>), the COO of&nbsp;<a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank">Iris Educational Media</a> last week.  IRIS Educational Media is a behavioral research and development company that provides educational resources for parents, parent educators, K-12 school staff, including teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, and direct support employees.</p>
<p>During our discussion, Adam was describing how he wanted to make Iris Media resources available for people to use on any platform, by providing valuable embeddable tools and resources for organizations and professionals to use on their own sites and portals.</p>
<p><a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/iris-media/iris-media-video.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As Adam was talking, of course I&rsquo;m thinking API.  An API would not just a way to drive their own line of embeddable tools, but would also allow for other 3rd party developers to build specialized tools and widgets for other platforms that Iris Media might not have awareness, time or resources to focus on.  Wanting to be available on numerous platforms is easy, but actually delivering on them can be costly and time consuming--APIs are a way to share this load with a 3rd party community.</p>
<p>An API could power Iris Media&rsquo;s syndication similar to Youtube. The Youtube API, plus a robust embeddable tool strategy is behind the massive syndication and growth of the popular video platform. Iris Media could go further with its own API, by integrating a partner layer within their API platform, and provide developers, organizations and educational professionals the ability to earn revenue by syndicating or developing widgets and applications on top of the Iris Media API.  This revenue could go a long way in ensuring some of these essential educational professionals organizations stay in operation and continue making an impact.</p>
<p>Engaging with people like Adam, who are truly making a difference in priority areas like education, is why I continue doing API Evangelist.  APIs can help Iris Media be more successful in reaching its audience, but also empower the huge number of important individuals and organizations on the ground in communities around the globe, who deliver essential education where they are needed most.</p>

        <p><a title="tecnically philly" href="http://technical.ly/philly/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/city/philadelphia/tecnically-philly.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A <a href="/buildingblocks/roadmap.php">roadmap is an essential part of a healthy API ecosystem</a>.  The transparency and communication that come with providing a roadmap for your API and open data initiative will go a long way in building trust with your community.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2013/03/26/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-release-schedule/">City of Philadelphia is sharing its roadmap of data sets</a> that it intends to open in the coming months, by providing a <a href="https://trello.com/board/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline/51487d15bb68f5de3b0099b0">release calendar using cloud project management service Trello</a>. In addition to seeing the datasets the city intends to release, you can also see any data sets that have already been published.</p>
<p>According to the open data roadmap, Philadelphia is releasing data on street closures, energy consumption, evacuation routes, campaign finance, bike racks, budgets, expenditures and city employee salaries to name just a few.</p>
<p><a title="tecnically philly" href="http://technical.ly/philly/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/city/philadelphia/city-of-philly-open-data-roadmap.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>This type of transparency doesn&rsquo;t just build trust with citizens and developers, it provides an incentive for the city government to deliver high quality public data, in a meaningful and timely manner.    There is still a lot of work to be done once this data is available, in order to develop quality analysis, visualizations, other APIs and tools that can be used in mobile and web applications. But what Philly is doing is a great start.</p>
<p>The City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s approach to its open data roadmap is good to see.  It is something all cities should have, as well as all API owners.  Your roadmap will set expectations within your community, guide your own initiatives and provide a healthy blueprint for moving your efforts forward.</p>

<p>NASA has a <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/skymorph-imagery-api/">pretty cool challenge going on</a>, to create an API for SkyMorph, a database of optical images and catalogs generated by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program.  According to the NASA description, SkyMorph provides:</p>
<blockquote><em>access to imagery by time and position or searching by specific asteroid or other moving object. The time dimension, unique to SkyMorph, allows users to discover changes in the intensities of stars, e.g. supernovae, or to discover moving objects, e.g. comets</em></blockquote>
<p>NASA is challenging us to help build a RESTful interface that would enable developers and citizen scientist to access SkyMorph imagery, lowering the barrier of access to the data and encouraging innovation around the program.</p>
<p>Ok, how cool is that!  APIs that enable everyone to help track on and understand objects in the sky, along with NASA.  It is projects like the <a title="SkyMorph API Challenge" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/skymorph-imagery-api/">SkyMorph API Challenge</a> that keep me excited about APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/21/interactive-api-documentation-with-swagger/">Interactive API Documentation With Swagger</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Swagger " href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/reverb-for-developers-swagger.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is becoming more common for API providers to deliver documentation using what's known as <a title="interactive API documentation" href="/buildingblocks/interactive_documentation.php">interactive API documentation</a>, instead of the usual static API documentation.   Understanding how to use an API can be tough sometimes, and rather than just reading about it how it works, interactive API documentation allows you make real calls against an API, while learning about the interface.</p>
<p>While there are several approaches to delivering interactive API documentation, my personal favorite is using <a title="Swagger " href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>.  Swagger comes built in with <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, which is the API management platform I use for the <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist API</a>, but Swagger is available for anyone to use as an <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">open source project</a>.</p>
<p>Interactive API documentation using Swagger starts with a Swagger definition, which is a JSON representation of an API endpoint. In this case, the endpoint is for accessing my blog posts:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5216806.js"></script>
<p>This JSON describes everything about my very basic endpoint, which allows users to query almost 3 years of API Evangelist blog posts. Using this definition, Swagger generates the following API documentation automatically:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-documentation-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>As someone learning about the API Evangelist Analysis API, this describes the endpoint, which fields are required to make an API call, but it doesn&rsquo;t just describe this with text, it provides an interactive interface in which I can enter my API keys, provide a query value and actually make a request against the API:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-documentation-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t just learn about the API endpoint.  I learn about what keys are needed and fields are present that allow me to request different information of the API endpoint. It allows me to actually see the request to the API, the resulting body of my API request.</p>
<p>This type of hands on learning is essential to onboarding new users with your API. I can read your API documentation and not see the value, but when I am walked through how to build a request, and actually see the value returned in real-time, it changes the game.  As a developer I&rsquo;m more likely to understand and integrate with an API when I am given interactive API documentation over static pages.</p>
<p>The benefits of describing your API using Swagger don&rsquo;t stop with just providing <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui">interactive API documentation</a>. Swagger can also help deliver <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">code samples</a> in multiple programming languages for developers to put to use, <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">generate server side code</a> for new APIs and <a href="/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">provide potential benefits for API discovery</a>.</p>
<p>It is well known that <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">API documentation is the number one pain point for developers</a>. Make sure your API documentation is hands-on, and interactive, so developers will understand the value your API delivers immediately, and go from learning, to integration, in as short of period as possible.</p>

<p>Way to go brogrammers. &nbsp;You made sure a bright light in evangelism was partially dimmed tday. &nbsp;Really? With all the shaming that goes on targeted at women, you don't have balls to take a little shaming when you arer being a sexist pig? &nbsp; C'mon...ummm have some balls?</p>
<p>As I've <a href="http://kinlane.com/2012/12/30/sexism-in-the-tech-space/">said it before, us guys are going to have to eat shit with a side of humble pie for many years</a> to come to balance this whole sexism thing out. &nbsp;Let's own it.</p>
<p>All it would have taken is a humble apology from those gentleman in response to the Tweet, then some healthy discussion about why what they said was wrong, and move on kids. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I sure hope the hacker news crowd steps up and defends every woman that is shamed by guys now, as they seem to be a defender of this now. So if you Tweet out shaming a woman in a career changing way, know hacker news will be all over you...right? &nbsp;Right?</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/seabourne-logo-2013.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm tracking on a new wave of application frameworks and API centric architecture patterns, that are not just helping deliver the next wave of web &amp; mobile apps, but also bridging, aggregating and providing interoperability and transformations between APIs platforms.</p>
<p>One company I've been watching closely is <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>.  The Seabourne team has an approach to application development that follows a very interesting set of principles:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Flows Instead of Pipelines - </strong>Information operates in &lsquo;flows&rsquo; where inputs and outputs are flexible and happen at any point. Flows are fluid and flexible, unlike structured, point-to-point pipelines</li>
<li><strong>Data has Multiple Owners -</strong> Information flows are composed of multiple streams of data owned by different partners and vendors. Any process must accommodate multiple canonical sources for different information</li>
<li><strong>Use APIs to Move Information -</strong> By using APIs to move information around, we decouple the data from the underlying technology and vendor, and make it possible to combine information from different technologies. APIs provide a flexible, low cost base to grow the system and meet changing needs</li>
<li><strong>Integrate Data Across Systems - </strong>Information lives on multiple systems inside and outside the organization. There is tremendous value to be had from combining multiple data sources together into a single information stream</li>
<li><strong>Translation Rather Than Standardization -</strong> Information is stored in multiple structures and formats. Any effort to manage information should focus on translating between structures rather than trying to develop a common schema</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that pretty much describes the challenges we face building web and mobile apps today, and Seabourne's approach isn&rsquo;t just about building apps, it is about organizing resources from multiple providers to build the best app you can. To see it in action you have to check out the project they just implemented using their approach called <a href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.</p>
<p>Using GovInfo, anyone can sign up to receive alerts from more than 100 different federal agency websites. GovInfo gets its information from a large number of sources ranging from RSS, APIs or scraped from HTML sources. Once acquired, the framework de-dupes, cleanses and normalizes the data as needed, then makes available for publishing or pushing out via email, SMS or other means.</p>
<p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/govinfo_diagram.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The Seabourne approach is not just <a href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking extract, transform and load (ETL)</a>, but also makes your app platform centered around acquire, process and publish, in a way that improves flexibility, centralizes processing rules for all incoming information and reduces the amount of time it takes to add new sources of data, all while providing scalability, in a very granular way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Seabourne evolve and constantly refine their approach to distributed application design ranging from their <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">deployment of the FCC web site</a>, to the <a title="launching of MyFCC" href="/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">launching of MyFCC</a>, and now the next iteration of their platform driving GovInfo.  I&rsquo;ll keep following what they are doing with their<a href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/"> AP2 approach</a> and watch the <a href="http://seabourneinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/case-studies/Seabourne-Information-Management.pdf">tools</a> and best practices that are a result of their innovative approach to application development using APIs.</p>

<p>It was inevitable.  <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist now has its own API</a>.  I had a couple partners ask for more sophisticated access than provided by RSS or JSON dumps out of my platform. &nbsp;So I launched a handful of API endpoints, allowing you to get at information from my world.</p>
<p>I currently have 13 endpoints providing access to the core of my platform, in 8 key areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Name, logo and description of the 2K APIs I'm activtely monitoring</li>
<li><strong>API Stack</strong> - Access to my weekly and monthly API stacks</li>
<li><strong>Analysis (Blog) - </strong>Access to my entire blog catalog</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers -</strong> Access to all API service providers I track</li>
<li><strong>Tools -</strong> A full catalog of all the API tools I've found</li>
<li><strong>Curated News - </strong>Title and links of news that I personally curate from my 2K+ feeds</li>
<li><strong>Notes -</strong> Notes I make during my daily and weekly curation</li>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -</strong> The common building blocks I've identified after looking at 2K top APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more data behind my firewall that I want to open up.  I do a lot of research on top APIs like Twitter and Google as well as trending areas like <a href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/trends/baas.php">backend</a>, <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity</a> and <a href="/trends/realtime.php">real-time</a> service providers.</p>
<p>I will also be opening up API endpoints into the site traffic for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>, <a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a> and my other properties.  And toying with opening up some collections of my personal data like calendar, projects, checkins and other aspects of my world.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m only issuing keys to API Evangelist subscribers and partners, but let me know if you are interested in getting at any of my data.  Eventually I&rsquo;ll make much of it openly available, but I&rsquo;m still formulating my approach, and playing with different service compositions--so things will change.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/19/web-harvesting-to-api-with-importio/">Web Harvesting to API with Import.io</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/import-io/import-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had a demo of a new <a href="http://import.io">data extraction service</a> today called <a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io">Import.io</a>.   The service allows you to harvest or scrape data from websites and then output in machine readable formats like JSON.  This is very similar to Needlebase, a popular scraping tool that was acquired and then shut down by Google early in 2012.   Except I&rsquo;d say Import.io represents a simpler, yet at the same time a more sophisticated approach to harvesting of web data and publishing than Needlebase.</p>
<p><strong>Extract</strong><br />Using Import.io you can target web pages, where the content resides that you wish to harvest, define the rows of data, label and associate them with columns in table you where the system will ultimately put your data, then extract the data complete with querying, filtering, pagination and other aspects of browsing the web you will need to get at all the data you desire.</p>
<p><strong>Connect</strong><br />After defining the data that will be extracted, and how it will be store you can stop and use the data as is, or you can setup a more ongoing, real-time connection with the data you are harvesting.  Using Import.io connectors you pull the data regularly, identify when it changes, merge from multiple sources and remix data as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Put The Data To Work</strong><br />Using Import.io you can immediately extract the data you need and get to work, or establish an ongoing connection with your sources of data and use via the Import.io web app or you can manage and access via the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.import.io/">Import.io API</a>--giving you full control over your web harvesting connections, and the resulting data.</p>
<p><a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/import-io/import-io-connectors.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When getting to work using Import.io, you have the option to build your own connectors or explore a marketplace of existing data connectors, tailored to pull from some common sources like the Guardian or ESPN.  The Import.io marketplace of connectors is a huge opportunity for data consumers as well as data scraping junkies (like me) to put their talents to use building unique and desireable data harvesting scripts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about database to API services like <a title="database to api with EmergentOne" href="/2013/03/01/mysql,-postgresql,-rds-to-api-with-emergent-one/">EmergentOne</a> and <a title="database to api with slashdb" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/18/database-to-api-with-slashdb/">SlashDB</a>, I would put Import.io into the Harvest to API or ScrAPI category--allowing you to deploy APIs and machine readable datasets from any publicly available data, even if you aren&rsquo;t a programmer.</p>
<p>I think ScrAPI services and tools will play an important role in the API economy.  While data will almost always originate from a database, often times you can&rsquo;t navigate existing IT bottlenecks to properly connect and deploy an API from that data source.  Sometimes problem owners will have to circumvent existing IT infrastructure and harvest where the data is published on the open web. &nbsp;Taking it upon themselves to generate the necessary API or machine readable formats that will be needed for the last mile of mobile and big data apps that will ultimately consume and depend on this data.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="/2013/03/19/web-harvesting-to-api-with-import.io/">web to API service Import.io</a>&nbsp;earlier today, and before I close the Evernote for this story, I wanted to highlight something else I thought they did interesting, on their <a href="http://import.io/pricing">pricing page</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought they provide a very honest peak into how they are pricing their services. &nbsp;First off, they admit that they are a young company, which is cool, but they also lay out some pretty interesting points around their business philosophy::</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>We are a free service. We will always provide a free-to-use tool</li>
<li>We will introduce premium features. Some of these you may have to pay for</li>
<li>We will always provide you with a tool to export your connectors</li>
<li>We will let you know if we are going to change anything that may impact your usage of import.io</li>
<li>We are currently in Developer Preview. Some things might not work as expected</li>
<li>Free accounts may be volume-limited as we move from Developer Preview to production</li>
<li>We will never spam you or share your details with any third parties</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these points are something I feel ALL startups should commit to as part of their services to their users. One thing I'd also like to see from startups, is some mention of their exit strategy. &nbsp;What is the end goal? &nbsp;I think this is a relevant question for all startups, as is also good one for Import.io after the Google acquisition and shut-down of a similar service called Needlebase, back in 2012. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal isn't to pick on <a href="http://import.io/">Import.io</a>, but along with the other items they outline, I think all API startups should be openly discussing everything listed above.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="http://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/45364274104/introducing-open-badges-1-0">Mozilla launched their new Open Badges platform</a>, as an open standard to recognize and verify learning.  I immediately started thinking about how it could be applied to APIs for incentivizing developer participation and success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come across other badge programs, but Mozilla is the first open approach I&rsquo;ve seen, providing free software and an open technical standard, that any organization can use to create, issue and verify digital badges.</p>
<p>So I was thinking, as an API owner, you could use Open Badges to structure a series of rewards for developers who reach important milestones integrating with your API, and engaging with your ecosystem.</p>
<p>Some examples badge-worthy milestones might be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Achieve X amount of API calls</li>
<li>Published application to showcase</li>
<li>Published open source code library</li>
<li>Developed more than one application</li>
<li>Revenue generated from application</li>
<li>Supporting the forum and conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take a bit of planning to developer the right approach to badging for each API, as goals would be different for each provider. But, providing badges could provide an incentive for developers to work towards meaningful goals you have tied to important KPIs for your API strategy, While also providing an easy way to track your most knowledgable and potentially trusted developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://openbadges.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mozilla-open-badges/mozilla-open-badges-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>If API providers start issuing sensible and consistent badges for API knowledge it would also provide additional ways to measure the size and overall health of the API developer community.  I could envision badges that would serve specific business sectors or even around city, state and federal government APIs and civic efforts.</p>
<p>I will add Mozilla Open Badges to my list of <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> and explore other ideas about how an API provider can establish badge programs to incentivize and reward healthy API developer activity.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-realtime/google-real-time-api-playground.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Google launched a <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/03/build-collaborative-apps-with-google.html">Realtime API for the Google Drive Platform</a> today.  It is the API version of the same functionality available on Google Drive, that allows for you and other collaborators to type, edit, annote and chat with each other within a Google Doc.</p>
<p>To use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/" target="_blank">Google Drive Realtime API</a> you add the Google Realtime Javascript library, then you can give any local object on an HTML page realtime behavior.  The JavaScript library and Realtime API handle network communication, storage, presence, conflict resolution and sync changes using what they call a CollaborativeString object.</p>
<p>The Realtime API isn&rsquo;t just for documents, it can be used for productivity apps, games, entertainment and much more.  The only limitation is a developers imagination within their own applications.</p>
<p>Google gives a <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/realtime-quickstart">quick start</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/reference/">documentation</a> and other resources to get you going, and they provide a pretty cool <a href="https://realtimeplayground.appspot.com/">realtime playground</a> for building stuff with the API in a hands-on, interactive environment.</p>
<p>There are other players in the realtime space already, like <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> and <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.  Google&rsquo;s entry into the arena is a signal that there is developer demand for realtime tools and provides validation for the other startups.   I&rsquo;ll play with Google Drive Realtime API some more and talk with the folks at Pusher and Firebase and see what their thoughts are and how it compares.</p>

        <p>Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt">@audreywatters</a>) forwarded a very interesting series of tweets to me yesterday from software artist, writer, and educator Jer Thorp (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt" target="_blank">@blprnt</a>):</p>

<p>What a fascinating thought. It is so close to how I see APIs in my minds eye.  A single API design can hold so much beauty, information, expression and emotion.  Imagine if you hung the API design for each iteration of the Twitter API on a wall.  There is so much to interpret.  It expresses the vision of Twitter founders and employees, it is in direct response to a million developers and the needs of 500 million users around the globe. &nbsp;What an impression!!!</p>
<p>While JSON might be the only way we have to visually describe an API, each web, mobile app and data visualization could also be considered an artistic representation of the Twitter API.  You could fill an entire gallery with JSON representations of each endpoint and each of its versions, applications, and visualizations.  Creating interactive art exhibition of the Twitter ecosystem.</p>
<p>I remember back in 8th grade(1984) I was in my social studies class with Ms. Schuler.  She brought in some fractal prints, she said were created by her mathematician boyfriend.  She walked us through how each visual was actually a math problem.  This was the same year my math teacher Mr. Hathaway got around 20 Commodore Vic 20s, which he didn&rsquo;t know how to setup and run, so a handful of us stayed after school and helped setup the lab.  At this point in my education I hated math, and without seeing the beauty of the fractal, I may never have developed a passion (obsession) for computing.  My counselors told me I&rsquo;d never have a career in computers, because I was so poor at math. Ha! Eat it middle school counselors!</p>

<p>Jer Thorp&rsquo;s tweets really resonate with me.  APIs are a technical, business and political representation that can interpreted in so many different ways.  When I read a <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">swagger definition of an API</a>, images begin to form in my mind around the intent of the APIs author (think girl in red dress from the Matrix).</p>
<p>Sometimes an API will invoke kindergarten images in my mind telling me the designer didn&rsquo;t have the experience it took to represent their information and resources properly.  Other times they invoke very precise images, almost too precise, alerting me to the fact this API was designed by another application and not a human.</p>
<p>On a very rare ocasion I will see an API design that you can tell was hand crafted, with the love and care of a individual or group of individuals who considered the needs of many end users, developers, and other consumers.  After several iterations an artful API representation will also begin to bear the technical, business and political imprints of its time.  Much like a painting will have certain styles, approaches, shapes, sizes, colors and materials going into the ink and canvas, or maybe markings of war, its owners or poor care.</p>
<p>In my opinion APs are a very artful representation of sometimes very complex data or programmatic resources, that have the possibility to evoke very emotional responses from the developers that build on them or the from the end-users who are the intended audience.</p>
<p>Thanks for planting this seed in my head Jer.  It is a topic I will visit often, as I&rsquo;m no doubt going to stumble across patterns and approaches that are more art than tech, as I&rsquo;m navigating this amazing API driven world I'm obsessed with.</p>
<p>And remember you heard it from Jer Thorp (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt" target="_blank">@blprnt</a>) first!</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.slashdb.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/slashdb/slashdb-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I would say the most common path to an API is from your company's database.  This makes database to API connectors, tools and services a pretty valuable area of the API space.  While there will always be high profile APIs dominating the tech blogosphere, most APIs will be launched quietly from small companies, by connecting them to various internal data sources.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, I met a new API service provider, called <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/" target="_blank">SlashDB</a>, that focuses on just delivering APIs from your database.  Once installed on any web server, SlashDB connects your internal databases and constructs a REST/HTTP web service, easily making database content accessible by URLs for getting, updating, inserting and deleting in a secure way.</p>
<p>SlashDB provides connectors for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, IBM DB2 and Sybase--covering the top 5 databases you will find in the enterprise or small to medium businesses.</p>
<p>I notice that SlashDB also has Microsoft Excel connectors.  I will have to investigate this further and do another story on API deployment from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  I know this will sound insane to the RESTafarians, but I think much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, on individual computers, throughout companies around the globe.</p>
<p>I've added SlashDB to my list of next generation API service providers like <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">EmergentOne</a>, <a href="http://apispark.com/" target="_blank">API Spark</a> and <a href="https://apiengine.io/" target="_blank">API Engine</a>. &nbsp;Check it out, and let me know what you think.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2013</span>
        <p>This post is more rant, and about me working through my thoughts on this subject, which is why its on <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> and not <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> or <a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>. &nbsp;This post is an aggregation of ongoing thoughts I'm having around my role in the API space, a diagram I drew the other day while enjoying an IPA, and inescapable thoughts fueled up by a post by&nbsp;Patrick Meir over at iRevolution, called <a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/03/17/neogeography-and-democratization/">Crisis Mapping, Neogeography and the Delusion of Democratization</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meir kicks up a bunch of thoughts related to how I perceive my role in the API space, which I believe is to help keep a certain amount of oxygen (aka open) present in the space, which I believe is the key ingredient in why the expirement we know as APIs is working. &nbsp;At first glance, API Evangelist looks like just a blog, but in reality it is a pretty complex system of data stores, API connectors, jobs and curation that I'm using to help draw a map of the API space that I can follow. Currently it looks something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>The way I see the space, is there are a shitload of resources, awaiting to be exposed via APIs that are both public and private resources. The stewards of these resources have the ability to select from tools and resources to deploy their API resources, using various building blocks for accomplishing this.</p>
<p><strong>API as a Service</strong><br />Additional to standing up your own API, there is the phenonmenon known as BaaS, PaaS and SaaS. &nbsp;Many of these platforms can actually help you deploy API resources, while also consuming and deploying resources of their own. &nbsp;For example, Kinvey allows you to deploy generic APIs from data stores you setup on their BaaS platform, bt they also consume API resources and makes available to you from eBay, and other places, while also providing you with their own API resources that you can use to rapidly deploy mobile apps. This layer is complex, lots to think aobut here.</p>
<p><strong>Top APIs</strong><br />There is a breed of API resources that are changing the landscape, both in whats available and how you do it. &nbsp;Leaders like Twilio, SendGrid, Amazon Web Services, Google and others are providing API resources and approaches to delivering API resources in ways that are influencing the API economy in big ways. &nbsp;These players stand out, and are worthy of identifying as separate group.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong><br />API consumers have to be able to find API resources. &nbsp;Historically we've only had ProgrammableWeb for this, but we are seeing growth in number of directories, IDE integrations and other evolutions in how we describe, share and discover APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enablers</strong><br />There are several evolving approaches to using APIs that deliver entirely new use cases for APIs, enabling new value that API providers and consumers can tap into. &nbsp;API aggregation from providers like Singly are bringing together existing API resources into easier to use, aggregated interfaces. &nbsp;Reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT allow resources and value to transfer between API platforms in the clouds and behind the firewall. &nbsp;Application frameworks like <a href="http://ql.io/">ql.io</a>, are changing how we bridge APIs and rapidly build API driven web and mobile applications. &nbsp;Real-time providers like Firebase and Pusher are connecting and providing APIs that make the exchange of API driven resources real-time. &nbsp;These are just a of the few of the new areas of API enablement I'm seeing emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Reseller</strong><br />Platform providers like BaaS, PaaS and Saas, plus the enablers, discovery services and top APIs all represent reseller and partnership opportunities for individual companies deploying API resources. &nbsp;This is the wholesale world of getting your API found as well as being baked into an existing consumer base. &nbsp;Without a reseller or partner layer to your API, you are just a single API in a ever growing flood of API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Last Mile</strong><br />However, this is all just the piping or tubes of this fascinating new API driven economy. &nbsp;The entire purpose of having these API pipes is to deliver the "last mile". &nbsp;APIs began by delivering resources to distributed web sites, and enabling sharing and embeddable widgets and buttons. &nbsp;With the birth of the cloud, APIs began delivering wholesale infrastructure resources for use indistributed cloud environments. Then with mobile we saw the demand for APIs skyrocket--what will it do with big data, sensors, devices, cars, home and building and beyond?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my role as API Evangelist. &nbsp;I feel compelled to keep the discussion of the pipes occuring within all the "last mile" conversations. &nbsp;I understand the VC's and companies under their control want to monetize the last mile. &nbsp;This is fine. &nbsp;But I want to prevent the API pipes from getting paved over in the process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want ANYONE to be able to get at the pipes behind the tablet applications their children use. &nbsp;I want ANYONE to be able to get at the data that went into any infographic, visualzation or report. &nbsp;I want ANYONE to understand the pipes that connect our physical worlds via sensors, devices to our online worlds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want the pipes to stay open, accessible, transparent and part of ALL "last mile" conversations. &nbsp;Which brings me back to&nbsp;Patrick Meir article. &nbsp;There were several key quotes I'm processing in regards to how I view API resources, API pipes and the last mile API Products that are derived from them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Feenberg&rsquo;s own view is constructivist, &ldquo;emphasizing that technology development is humanly controlled and encapsulates values and politics; it should thus be open to democratic control and intervention.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;technology can and should be seen as a result of political negotiations that lead to its production and use. In too many cases, the complexities of technological systems are used to concentrate power within small groups of technological, financial, and political elites and to prevent the wider body of citizens from meaningful participation in shaping it and deciding what role it should have in the everyday.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Meaning Hacking" is often hijacked by "Deep Technical Hackers"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Democratizing information flows and access; promoting Open Data and Do it Yourself (DIY) </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Innovation with free, highly hackable (i.e., open source) technology; letting go of control.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"the artful alteration of technology beyond the goals of its original design or intent,&rdquo; enables &ldquo;Deep Democratization"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Freely pro-viding the hackable building blocks for DIY Innovation is one way to let go of control and democratize"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The control over the information is kept, by and large, by major corporations and the participant&rsquo;s labor is enrolled in the service of these corporations, leaving the issue of payback for this effort a moot point. Significantly, the primary intention of the providers of the tools is not to empower communities or to include marginalized groups, as they do not re-present a major source of revenue."</em></p>
<p>There are so many lessons to be absorbed from CrisisMapping and Neogeography, when it comes to the API economy. &nbsp;Sorry for just posting these quotes as just a list, but I'm still absorbing and just needed them published in single place, so I can reference and re-read while thinking on this subject. &nbsp;(Thats right, I read my own blog!)</p>
<p>I don't think there are any easy answers here. &nbsp;I just want to make sure we keep the conversation including the pipes and not just about the resources and last mile products delivered on top of the pipes. &nbsp;So we don't cutoff the oxygen needed for the API economy to work for EVERYONE!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform/">BeyondGET or OtherVerbs, an Augmented API Platform </a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-post.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a idea for a new API platform.  Since I do not have any startup aspirations, I prefer setting my ideas free, for anyone to use, instead of acting on them myself.</p>
<p>This idea is an evolution from an earlier one, which I had while working with the CityGrid API, called &ldquo;augmented places&rdquo;. &nbsp;While at CityGrid I constantly had people asking if they could submit data back to the API.  Stating they had a better list of pizza places in Brooklyn or vegan restaurants in Santa Cruz.  I had to always turn these folks away, and one morning I sketched out  &ldquo;augmented places&rdquo;.  It would be a service where anyone could submit their own meta data about a place, either adding an entirely new place, updating an existing one, or even remove a listing. It would provide an external service that could augment all places APIs, not just CityGrid.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the other night, I did some data journalism for my girlfriend Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), which included <a href="/2013/03/16/using-the-crunchbase-api/">pulling data from the Crunchbase API</a>.  I pulled 3000 education startups from around the world, then after delivering to her in a JSON object and Google Spreadsheet, I immediately used the script to pull any API related startup, for my own needs.  I quickly compared a handful of results with my existing API database and in many cases, I have much better information on some of these companies than CrunchBase.  Yet I have no way to submit this data back to CrunchBase, to correct or add to what they have.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-put.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is common in the open API space.  Most data APIs only allow you to /GET.   Allowing for the other verbs /POST, /PUT, and /DELETE, usually require not just more resources to deploy and manage, but also a certain mindset that is open to receiving information from your API consumers, which could range from internal and partner users, to the general public.  Some places I&rsquo;ve worked, are just scared shitless of repercussions of doing something like this.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my idea for a new API service.  Let&rsquo;s call it <strong>BeyondGET</strong> or <strong>OtherVerbs</strong>.  A service that would allow people to add API resources they&rsquo;d like to augment with the ability to POST, PUT and GET.  So I could add an entry for Crunchbase using api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/.  I would define each entry with a Swagger definition, and the system would create a basic data store for the entry.   You could now submit changes to existing records, as well as entirely new records or mark a record for deletion--providing an augmented, external, crowdsourced layer on top of potentially distributed API resources.</p>
<p>Developers could use a primary API resource as well as the augmented version of the API if they choose.   You would have to add some sort of trusted user layer, so developers could only show data submitted by trusted sources. &nbsp;Seems like some sort of Git layer for versioning would be needed as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-delete.png" alt="" width="330" align="right" /></p>
<p>API owners could also choose to use an augmented layer as a sort of crowdsource queue for their API.  The API owner could decide which users they trust and what data was relevant enough to let back in.  It could act as a DMZ for your API.</p>
<p>There would also need to be a data licensing layer to all of this, that if well crafted, could open up the potential for revenue sharing or at least virtual credits to use against other API services.  I know CityGrid was discussing how they could reward API consumers for their contributions, and I could see this being a way to deliver on that across the API space.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;d love to hear thoughts on this.  Or run with building a version of it yourself.  It would be awesome to see a whole breed of augmented API service providers pop up, allowing me to add a new section about it at API Evangelist. :)</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, I helped Audrey download a PHP Twitter bot, reverse engineer and make it work for an objective she had around Tweeting random responses to a certain type of tweet.  I figured she was ready to see what it took to hack on an API and get the research data she needed.</p>
<p>Audrey wanted to pull a list of startups that were educated related.  We started with the /search endpoint, using the query keyword &ldquo;education&rdquo;.   The query parameter appears to search the title, tags and overview of each Crunchbase entry, pulling way more than what we needed, 5700 in total.  Each search returned 10 startups, with a handful of fields for each company, not nearly enough information.</p>
<p>To prove we could get what we needed, we took the first startup returned, grabbed the name and used it to perform a company /entity search, returning a wealth of information.  We had what we were looking for including date founded, amount raised, CEO, founders as well as description, logos, addresses and other vital company information.</p>
<p>Back to the /search endpoint.  Each search only returned 10 results, when there were actually 5,700.  I looked at the documentation and the only parameter listed, was &ldquo;query&rdquo;.  No way to control how many results returned, paginate or otherwise.  So I start guessing, appending page=, and max=, maxrows=, anything to get more results.  Eventually I was able to change the page, so I was able to write logic to loop through each page, getting at all the results required.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-search-endpoint.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>For each returned result from the /search endpoint, I would take the company name and perform a company search on the /entity endpoint.  However each call to the endpoint would yield a 301, redirecting me to another URL.  So the search for:</p>
<blockquote><em>http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/Noodle+Education.js?api_key=[key]</em></blockquote>
<p>Get a 301 returned, with the following redirect URL:</p>
<blockquote><em>http://ec2-107-21-104-179.compute-1.amazonaws.com/v/1/company/noodle-education.js</em></blockquote>
<p>So for each /entity endpoint I would have to make two separate cURL calls to get a single record for a company.  An approach that is guarantee to get CrunchBase into the API billionaires club (as chatty APIs do), or at the very least generate a nice bill with their API management provider.</p>
<p>Next, I needed to create a table to store the data in, I looped through the JSON object and spit out a list of fields, so I could generate a SQL script to create the table.  There were a few duplicate fields, but quickly got a table up and the data inserted.  The data is decent.  There are a lot of issues with absence of default values, empty objects with available images, addresses, etc.  But nothing I&rsquo;m not used to wading through, to get what I need from an API.</p>
<p>With the /search endpoint based upon a single keyword search, that spans title, overview and tags, the search returned a lot of companies that didn&rsquo;t fit our search.  As we prepared to enter each record into a database, we would apply further filters, making sure there companies founded in 2010 or greater, and met other criteria, before actually inserting.</p>
<p>Now we had a MySQL table filled with 772 education startups.  I exported as CSV, uploaded as a Google Spreadsheet, and shared it with Audrey.  Game over.  She had what she needed.  Overall it took about 3 hours start to finish, which she felt was tedious, and feeling there was a lack of clarity regarding the whole process--something she couldn&rsquo;t have done with me and my API programming skills.  This is a problem CrunchBase.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audrey is your target audience</span>.  This needs to be dead simple.  She shouldn&rsquo;t have to blindly navigate the API endpoints, documentation, data structures and holes in the data.  These are things I&rsquo;m used to having to cobble together, but an analyst like herself, won&rsquo;t have the time and patience.</p>
<p>I can tell the CrunchBase API was created by someone who didn&rsquo;t give a shit about the data, let alone use the API to build anything.  I saw a job posting from CrunchBase, so I know they are looking for someone to own the API.  I hope this person can become a steward for this great set of data, and make it into a meaningful API--there is a lot of potential there.</p>
<p>Quick feedback for whoever takes the job, regarding some building blocks to focus on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong> - Establish more meaningful names for the existing endpoints, while establishing some new ones</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Get the documentation complete!!  So what if you have I/O docs, if all the fields aren&rsquo;t defined</li>
<li><strong>POST / PUT</strong> - Al</li>
low folks to add and update data either after they curate and add to it, or from their own databases
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Create a blog, that lets me know someone is home.  Its so evident nobody is. </li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Provide me with an active Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ account to interact with you on and share what I&rsquo;m doing with your data</li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong> - I need some guidance with branding of CrunchBase data, when I publish in the wild</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Holy shit, the opportunity with badges, buttons and widgets around CrunchBase data.  This data is made for crunching and sharing in stories</li>
<li><strong>JS Library</strong> - You need a plug and play dictionary, demographic JavaScript library that allows bloggers, analysts, etc to embed on pages and provide a library with a rich set of demographic references, funding links and other vital data people will cite in stories and reports around the web</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet</strong> - From the I/O docs, provide export as CSV and to Google Spreadsheet.  Build Google Spreadsheet templates that allow users to enter their key into cell and it will pre-populate a spreadsheet with the data they are looking for, with the analysis, visualizations and other tools analysts will need</li>
</ul>
<p>CrunchBase is a goldmine of data.  As it is, I can make use of the data and generate value.  But the API won&rsquo;t remain at the center of that, I will extract the value I need and not return much to the platform, because well...it sucks ass.  I can&rsquo;t write back, and I do so much work to get the value I do, I feel like its mine after I&rsquo;m done. Especially if the platform has no person or personality that I consider an owner or steward. &nbsp;I don't feel beholden to give anything back. &nbsp;Just take...not good for your business.</p>
<p>You guys have a lot of potential within the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/io-docs">CrunchBase API</a>, I hope you dedicate the resources to make it work, and find a steward for the API that will actually care about what you have, and interact with your API consumers in a meaningful way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/braintree/braintree-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Next generation payment provider <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank">Braintree</a> just launched a new JavaScript library that helps  merchants reduce their PCI scope in a flexible and testable way, which they are calling appropriately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/braintrust/braintree-js" target="_blank">Braintree.js</a>.  According to Braintree, the library:</p>
<blockquote><em>...uses asymmetric encryption to prevent raw credit card data from passing through merchants' servers. It intercepts a form submit in the browser that contains sensitive data, encrypts that data with a public key provided to merchants by Braintree and then submits the form with the encrypted data to the server. Braintree retains the private key of the key pair so that merchants are unable to decrypt the encrypted fields server-side. Any string field in Braintree's API can be encrypted and encrypted values can be transparently dropped into any API call</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what I call a <a title="embeddable API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Embeddable">healthy embeddable strategy</a>, which includes buttons, badges, widgets and other tools you can build on top of an API or to support API integration.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/languages">rise in populartiy of JavaScript</a>, and the growth of platforms like Node.js, I predict that providing your API developers with standardized JS libraries that extend the value of your API will become commonplace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add a section to my <a title="embeddable building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">embeddable building blocks</a>, for JavaScript libraries. I&rsquo;m seeing more API providers doing cool stuff in this area.  I will try and record as much of it as I can during my industry monitoring each week and provide resources for you to follow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the <a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">potential of markup APIs and scripting platforms</a>&nbsp;in the past, which I think is a related example to what Braintree is doing--in which you can build JS libraries for your API users and extend not just the reach of the value generated by your APIs, but the expertise of your team.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pusher/cisimple-plus-pusher.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.pusher.com/using-pusher-to-power-cisimples-real-time-api/">This story comes</a> from Phil Leggetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) over at <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.  Its about a client of theirs, <a href="https://www.cisimple.com/">cisimple</a>, which provides continuous delivery services for mobile developers.  <a href="http://blog.cisimple.com/2013/03/06/check-out-our-shiny-new-api-and-pusher-integration/">cisimple just released a new API</a>, which gives mobile developers more control over the build processes for their mobile applications.</p>
<p>Using the cisimple API you can kick off new builds and download artifacts from your mobile dev process.  cisimple is a very interesting API resource, that I will definitely be watching, and I&rsquo;m sure I will be writing about in the near future.  But what I really think is interesting is that cisimple is allowing clients to register for real-time updates via Pusher channels, using API tokens.</p>
<p>This means that when you use cisimple to manage your mobile development, you now have a real-time push system that will send notifications when builds start, pass, fail, etc.  This opens up a whole world of human integration with the build process via desktop and mobile notifications, but also can be used in other systems that play a role in your dev cycles.</p>
<p>The weaving of a Pusher real-time notification layer into the cisimple API is pretty innovative. Something I&rsquo;m sure will deliver huge value to their customers.   But think of the potential as a standard approach for all API owners?  You could offer developers real-time notifications about their own usage of your API, providing them with an intimate view of how their application(s) are using an API.  Addiitionally it seems like you could set up a pretty interesting system wide notification layer that would let you, as the API owner, establish notification channels regarding overall API usage, thresholds and other important signals from your platform.</p>
<p>As I continue to dive into the <a title="real-time" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/realtime.php" target="_blank">world of real-time APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m surprised at the multiple ways in which we can truly deliver real-time value using APIs.  cisimple API + Pusher is in interesting addition.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/15/pinboard-api-tax-proposal/">Pinboard API Tax Proposal</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://pinboard.in" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard_in_blue.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Maciej Ceglowskiis, the founder of popular social bookmarking platform <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>,made an <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pinboard-dev/PidYOmyBaxI/mLDKIzC6olgJ" target="_blank">interesting proposal over on the Pinboard Google Group</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I've been thinking about imposing an API tax, the proceeds of which  would go into improving API infrastructure and offsetting operating costs, structured along these lines:</em></p>
<ul class="mainlist" style="padding-left: 30px; list-style: none;">
<li> 
<ul>
<li><em>API free to use for your own Pinboard account</em></li>
<li><em>Every API client making requests on behalf of someone else must register an app identifier</em></li>
<li><em>$20/year tax if your app makes requests for over 100 Pinboard accounts</em></li>
<li><em>$100/year tax if your app makes requests for over 1000 Pinboard accounts</em></li>
<li><em>Possibly additional price levels to waive certain rate limits</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Think of it as a road tax that then pays for further construction, repair, and  people in orange vests.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that Maciej has a lot of experience to back his proposal, watching how developers use Pinboard for their own purposes, or on behalf of a user via a client.  I heavily depend on Pinboard for my curation at API Evangelist, so API access would remain free for me.  I&rsquo;m not sure how I would feel if I was building a client.</p>
<p>On the forum, there is very interesting feedback from Matt Schmidt, developer of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pindroid">PinDroid</a>, the leading Pinboard client for Android:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I'm very much against this.  Why would you tax the makers of the apps that help drive use of your product, rather than the users themselves?  To extend your road use tax analogy, this is like taxing the car companies for their customer's use of the roads.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I offer PinDroid as a free, open source app and have no interest in making money off it, but I also have no interest in losing money on it.  Why not offer api access as a premium account feature (like archiving) for an extra buck instead?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To be clear, if such a "tax" were to be implemented, I will have to stop developing and supporting PinDroid and take it off the market.</em></p>
<p>Matt provides some real life feedback, that I can&rsquo;t.  PindDroid is a vital player in the PinBoard ecosystem, that could be hurt by such a tax.  Free and open source code and clients are a vital aspect of any API ecosystem, you definitely want to understand how this layer will be affected by such a tax.</p>

<p>Maciej just made this proposal today, so the conversation is fresh.  Head over to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pinboard-dev/PidYOmyBaxI/mLDKIzC6olgJ" target="_parent">Pinboard Google Group</a> to weigh in.  I&rsquo;ll post another story after the conversation dies down, providing more thoughts about API taxes.</p>

<p>In May 2011 I released a book called the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Business-APIs-1-Kin-Lane/dp/1461113881/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304210432&amp;sr=1-5">Business of APIs</a>. The book was intended to be an introductory walkthrough for non-technical people, to the world of APIs. I wanted to educate business, organizational and governmental leaders about the space, and the important role of APIs in having a healthy digital strategy.</p>
<p>Its coming up on two years later, and I'm finally getting around to updating the Business of APIs. After a nice long walk on the strand with <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>, we have the outline for the next version:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>What are APIs used for?</li>
<li>The history of APIs</li>
<li>What goes into an API?</li>
<li>Do you need an API?</li>
<li>How do you get an API??</li>
<li>What are the common building blocks of an API?</li>
<li>What are possible business models for an API?</li>
<li>How do you evangelize and support an API?</li>
<li>Where have some APIs stumbled?</li>
<li>APIs, a new way of doing business</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the Business of APIs is the same. Help anyone, from any company, organization or the government understand what an API is, and why they are important. &nbsp;You don't have to be a developer to put APIs to use, this book is for everyone.</p>
<p>Look for an updated version of the Business of APIs by June. I'll still keep it a simple guide to the space, but provide a whole lot more information that will help you understand the Business of APIs.</p>

        <p><a href="http://punchfork.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-vertical.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I ended up at the Punfork API today for some reason. Full disclosure: "Punchfork has been acquired by Pinterest! <a href="http://punchfork.com/pinterest" target="_blank">Read the announcement</a>. Site shutdown: March 31st, 2013".  Just getting that out of the way. While at the site, I ended up at the <a href="http://punchfork.com/goodies/badges">Goodies page</a>, which I think represents a nice set of basic embeddable tools for an API.</p>
<p>First using Punchfork Badges, you can customize a badge, then copy and paste the embed code onto your blog's sidebar, or anywhere else you want it to appear:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-badges.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Then you can download a Punchfork logo (ok, its just one, but it gets point across):</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-logos.png" alt="" width="250" /></p>
<p>Last, you can enter your address and request a Punchfork sticker to be sent to you:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-stickers.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>These are all three, simple examples of a good approach to providing embeddable tools for users.  Badges are pretty straightforward, and it is sensible to provide logos and other images as part of a healthy branding strategy.  But the request for a sticker is something I haven't added to my listing of embeddable building blocks. After thinking about it, stickers are the OG embeddable tool.  Something your users can take offline, and embed anywhere.</p>
<p>At some point I will do a roundup of all the embeddable building blocks, since I've been adding some new ones like sticker request form.</p>

<p>I see a lot of new API platforms emerge, and often times you see them deploying their own solutions to problems that are actively solved by top API platforms, and are already adopted by common mobile and web app users.</p>
<p>The best example of this is with authentication.  Its growing more and more common that you don&rsquo;t build your own login, you use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google or Github oAuth.</p>
<p>It seems to me that when it comes to other common resources, the same could be applied.  So I&rsquo;m exploring what my essential stack of API driven resources might look like:</p>

<p>I could do quite a bit with this assembled as a single backend stack, if it included a regular datastore, key-value store, user management and other essentials for building apps.</p>
<p>It seems to me that new platforms shouldn&rsquo;t always create new silos, but bridge the existing ones that we depend on already.</p>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, the server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications in JavaScript, seems to be getting more attention lately from top API providers because of its event-driven, asynchronous I/O that can minimizeoverhead and maximize scalability.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/#readme">Google released an official Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs </a>that supports authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0.  Then earlier this week, Amazon Web Services announced that <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/aws-elastic-beanstalk-for-nodejs.html">AWS Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS solution now supports Node.js applications</a>.</p>
<p>While Google&rsquo;s deployment is a client, and AWS&rsquo;s is an application platform, they both have the same objective--enabling developers to build highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective applications using APIs.</p>
<p>Both Google and AWS recognize the potential for selling developers their valuable API driven resources, by providing them with Node.js solutions.  <a href="https://github.com/languages/JavaScript">JavaScript is the number one language on Github</a>, with Node dominating most starred and most forked overall categories, according to Github trends.</p>
<p>I think that AWS and Github both send a good signal to other API owners, that they need to step up the availablity of Node.js resources for their API developer communities.</p>

<p>One of the best aspects of being the API Evangelist, is I get to hang out with smart folks, doing gaming changing things across all business sectors.  Last week I was able to make it to the API Social, an event held in Berkeley by a group of API savvy faculty members.  This is my third one, and the group is up to some very interesting things.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with one UC Berkeley analyst about a problem that isn&rsquo;t just unique to a university, but they are working on an innovative solution for.</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<blockquote><em>UCB Developers are creating Web Services that provide access to sensitive data (e.g. grades, transcripts, current enrollments) but only trusted applications are typically allowed to access these Web Services to prevent misuse of the sensitive data.   Expanding access to these services, while preserving the confidentiality of the data, could provide student and third party developers with opportunities to create new applications that provide UCB students with enhanced services.</em></blockquote>
<p>The solution:</p>
<blockquote><em>Wrapping untrusted applications in a "Proxied Facade Service" framework that passes anonymous tickets through the &ldquo;untrusted&rdquo; application to underlying services that can independently extract the necessary personal information provides a secure way of allowing an application to retrieve a Web User&rsquo;s Business data (e.g. their current course enrollments) WITHOUT exposing any identifying information about the user to the untrusted application.</em></blockquote>
<p>I find their problem and solution fascinating, I also think it is something that could have huge potential.  When data leaves any school, healthcare provider, financial services or government office, the presence of sensitive data is always a concern.  More data will be leaving these trusted systems, for use in not just apps, but also for analysis and visualizations, and the need to scrub personally identifiable information will only grow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still processing everything the team at UC Berkeley is doing, but want to write about as I&rsquo;m wrapping my head around it.  If you know of any other services out there that do similar things, let me know.  I&rsquo;m curious to hear about other approaches to scrubbing personally identifiable information as it leaves systems via APIs.</p>

The are being very transparent about the process (which I like), and putting out the word looking for some new team members to help them get the job one.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks they want build an API that is simple and easy to use, but also capable of handling tens of millions of document conversations a month.  To help get the job done they are looking for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Sales Engineers</strong> - Boots on the ground to let them know what people want and to help us engage the developer community</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Engineers </strong>- Help them open source the demos we build and design our client-side libraries</li>
<li><strong>DevOps Engineers </strong>- Help them build the infrastructure we use to convert millions of documents each month</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5358861">Crocodoc posting on Hacker News</a>, but I&rsquo;m writing about because I appreciate API owner sending out signals that they are planning the next version of their API.  This type of transparancy is not just important in helping you find talent to make it happen, it sends a signal to the community that you are beginning a planning cycle and can encourage community feedback and involvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crocodoc API reworking sounds like a pretty innovative project to work on, and the <a title="Crocodoc" href="https://crocodoc.com/about/" target="_blank">Crocodoc team</a> looks like a pretty smart team to get a chance to work with.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2013</span>

<p>Netflix has <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Changes_to_the_Public_API_Program" target="_blank">entered the final stages of shuttering its public API last week</a>.  Its been coming for a while now, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Upcoming_Changes_to_the_Netflix_API_Program" target="_blank">starting in June of 2012</a>, and now is official with the platform no longer accepting new API registrations.</p>
<p>After reading about the changes to the Netflix Public API program on their blog, and hearing much of the news in response, <a href="http://www.rethink-wireless.com/2013/03/11/netflix-public-api-program-retired.htm" target="_blank">everyone seems to file this away, along with the Twitter API</a>--just another API platform screwing over its developers.</p>
<p>As I do, I wanted to take a step back, look at the bigger picture and try understand what happened. &nbsp;On <a href="http://readwrite.com/2008/09/30/netflix_api_launches_tomorrow" target="_blank">October 1st 2008, Netflix launched their public API</a>, and they appear to have done everything right.  They had a blog, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Let_Us_Know_About_your_Libraries" target="_blank">solicited code samples from developers</a>, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/App_Gallery_Open_for_Developer_Submissions" target="_blank">accepted application submissions</a> and even <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Finding_nice_applications_via_the_Netflix_App_Gallery" target="_blank">showcased the developers apps in the gallery</a>.  Netflix would even help <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Promote_Your_App_to_Netflix_Subscribers" target="_blank">promote your app to Netflix subscribers</a> and <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Untitled_1" target="_blank">threw hackathons</a>.  The Netflix API team worked to <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/API_Performance_Improvements" target="_blank">improve API performance</a>, communicate regularly, but really nothing that amazing happened.</p>
<p>There were applications like <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/" target="_blank">InstaWatcher</a> and <a href="http://www.whichflicks.com/" target="_blank">WhichFlicks</a>&nbsp;(among others)&nbsp;developed on the API, but as Daniel Jacobson puts it, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/michaelhart2/api-strategy-evolution-at-netflix" target="_blank">a thousand flowers didn&rsquo;t bloom</a>.  In these situations its easy to blame the API provider, but developers didn&rsquo;t really step up and build anything that innovative and cool. So is this a failure of Netflix?  A failure of developers to innovate?  Or could it possibly be a third: failure of the API vision?</p>
<p>I would say the demise of the Netflix public API is equal part Netflix and the developer, and just the nature of the industry it exists in.  It didn&rsquo;t take me long to look through the Netflix API blog, so I can tell they didn&rsquo;t put alot into evangelizing the API.   But I really can&rsquo;t find any innovation that occurred by developers as part of it, so I think us devs have to share some of the responsibility as well.</p>
<p>Several of the blog posts covering the news last week, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/08/netflix-changes-its-current-api-program-by-ending-it-will-no/" target="_blank">compared this to Twitter</a> which I think for the untrained eye of the mainstream tech blogosphere, this is easy to do.  But Twitter is user generated content, via one of the newest types of content platforms, and Netflix is heavily licensed and policed content from one of the oldest content platforms.  I think expecting public API success from Netflix and / or developers was a lot to ask.</p>
<p>I love and believe in APIs, but I&rsquo;m not delusional enough to think they will work magically everywhere they are applied. However, even with the closing of the public Netflix API, I consider Netflix is an API success story.  Look what they&rsquo;ve done with their internal and partner APIs. They&rsquo;ve managed to scale not just from the data center to the cloud, but globally and across 800+ devices--while also <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">sharing this knowledge and wisdom with the public</a>&nbsp;via their blog:</p>

</ul>
<p>When measuring the success or failures of API initatives, we can't use the same yardstick in all scenarios. When you look at the knowledge, wisdom and code that has come out of Netflix, there is no way you can say their API initiative is anything but a success. I don&rsquo;t see see Netflix as a case study in how to stream movies over the web via public APIs, but a deeply important experiment in how to deliver licensed content to over 800 devices, via the next generation of APIs. &nbsp;Something that probably isn't an edge case, it actually represents where we all might be headed in the near future.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get caught up in the recent deprecation of the Netflix public API. &nbsp;There is so much going on! &nbsp;Let's get studying some of the knowledge and technology coming out of Netflix. I know its my motivation for writing this post, and doing this research.</p>

<p>When it came to API focused events, the only conference there was to attend was the <a title="Business of APIs Conference" href="http://apiconference.com/">Business of APIs Conference</a>, from <a title="Mashery" href="http://mashery.com">Mashery</a>.  They have been putting on the conference(correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) since 2007.  There wasn&rsquo;t much of an "API Industry" back then, and Mashery was definitely the pioneer in the space, getting the word out and along with <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, has done a lot to define the API space.</p>
<p>Fast forward five years, and after the successful <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> in February (originally scheduled for November), there are now five API event series going on:</p>

<p>It is exciting to see the explosion of events, and I&rsquo;m hopeful regarding how much progress will occur in 2013 with this many conversations going on.  It is also promising to see the international growth, with Nordic APIs happening in Scandinavia, API Days coming from France, Business of APIs in London and API Summit spreading the conversation from United States and Australia.</p>
<p>With this amount of buzz, APIs will definitely continue its spread to the mainstream.  My only hope is that all the events make sure and represent the space well by being interoperable and sharing content, speakers and ideas openly so that the entire industry benefits.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api-the-humans-win/">SOA vs API - The Humans Win</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/human-cutout.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the API movement marches forward, it continues to grind against the enterprise and its legacy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a>, which increases the frequency at which people ask me, <em>What is the difference between API and SOA?</em> This is not a technical explanation of the differences, but a philosophical one that many will argue does not apply, but in my opinion is the dark matter around the technological and business approach of SOA,  that makes API work.</p>
<p>Many say that a web API is just one component in an SOA toolbox.  This is true.  Using HTTP for an API is not that novel in itself.  That is until it jumped out of the enterprise petri dish, got a little oxygen to grow, allowing the introduction of some new aspects that the industry and technology overlords of SOA would never have introduced on their own.</p>
<p>While reading the <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/nation-building-in-the-age-of-apis/">Nation Building in the Age of APIs</a>, by Matt McLarty (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>) of <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a> today, he reminded me that:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Every paradigm shift in technology has been driven by both innovation&mdash;the new technology itself&mdash;and application&mdash;how that technology can be used.  In other words, there is a machine side and a people side to every technology change.  The technologists responsible for implementing these changes often bias towards their comfort zone&mdash;the machine side&mdash;and overlook the people side."</em></blockquote>
<p>He is right. &nbsp;APIs moves us closer to the people side of the equation, outside the technologists comfort zone, but I would also add that it moves it outside the business and industry leaderships comfort zone, introducing more balance that has the potential to make online communities, platforms and ecosystem thrive. Matt continues to say:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Ultimately, the success of a company&rsquo;s API will depend on the creation of a diverse community for that API&mdash;end users, partners, developers, and more&mdash;as well as the adoption of a business model that allows the API to contribute to the company&rsquo;s bottom line."</em></blockquote>
<p>SOA does a damn fine job of looking after the platforms (business), the developers (technology), but doesn't always provide for the best interest of the user--aka human side of the equation.  APIs have allowed for valuable resources to flow around traditional IT bottlenecks, outside the firewall and be put to use by those who are potentially closer to the human problem that is being solved.</p>
<p>API introduces newer pieces of the SOA puzzle, found within the OAuth security relationship, terms of use and privacy policies, self-service access, transparency, while also providing monetization strategies that encourage partner and developer innovation.</p>
<p>At first glance, it is easy to mistake API as just part of the SOA toolbox, but there are other nuances that bring SOA closer to the users, and solving the real problems they face, by developers who understand.  In the end I don't really think it matters whether you call it SOA or API, just make sure you include the essential ingredients that have worked with "open" APIs, whether your API is public, private or evolving your partner relationships.</p>
