{% include JB/setup %}<p>Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is 3Scale.It’s no secret I’m a fan of what they are doing.We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry will look like.In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the NGNIX web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry.What makes 3Scale’s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers dont need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party addons and modules available in the NGNIX ecosystem.</p>
