{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m going through hundreds of APIs and curating a list of APIs, for what I’m calling the API Stack. The API Stack consists of APIs that provide clear value for developers and have demonstrated real investment in their API, and are in it for long haul.There are quite a few things I consider when looking at an API, here are a few: Value - The API offers clear value to developers, without needing an explanation.Web API - They don’t have to be 100% REST, but web APIs make developers lives easier.Active Blog w/ RSS - A blog is a quick way to see what is behind the curtain of an API.</p>
