<p>I was just reading a post via <a title="BuzzFeed" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>, that <a title="Twitter was going to remove third-party image services from its apps" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/twitter-is-removing-third-party-image-services-fro">Twitter was going to remove third-party image services from its apps</a>.  <em>&ldquo;According to a person who was briefed on the company's plans&rdquo;</em>, the changes will be coming in the next updates to the Twitter client(s).</p>
<p>"They're trying to control those eyeballs on their apps, they're an ad-based company, they make money that way,&rdquo; says Twitpic founder Noah Everett, according to&nbsp;<a title="BuzzFeed" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>.</p>
<p>One thing is clear. Twitter is serious in its effort to take control over its ecosystem. &nbsp;It has a plan, and it's systematically rolling it out, taking control over each area it needs to maximize "promoted" revenue.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/speakers/steve-klabnik.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to announce that <a title="Steve Klabnik" href="http://www.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a> will be speaking at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>, November 1st &amp; 2nd in New York City.  I just added him to the homepage and <a title="API Speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker line-up</a>.</p>
<p>Steve is a highly respected Ruby developer, software craftsman, and an aspiring digital humanities scholar. He spends most of his time contributing to Open Source projects, and maintains both <a title="Hackety Hack" href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack</a> and <a title="Shoes" href="http://shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a>, while also teaching and helping develop curriculum for&nbsp;<a title="JumpStart Labs" href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Steve has has written book on <a title="Designing Hypermedia APIs" href="http://designinghypermediaapis.com/">Designing Hypermedia APIs</a>. Well it&rsquo;s better than a book.  I&rsquo;d call it a "living digital book". One where you can constantly come back and get fresh content and interact with the books community and author.  Much better than  the old-school programming book, which you buy once and it sits on your shelf.</p>
<p>What intrigues me about Steve, is that his perspective is very technical, but in his own words, &ldquo;<em>I've found a place between the sciences and the humanities.</em>&rdquo;  Which is a point of view we need to give a platform to, and everyone in Silicon Valley needs to listen.</p>
<p>Steve is exactly the fresh perspective we want to get at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>.  I hope you can join us for the two day event in November and be there in person for Steve&rsquo;s talk.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2012</span>

<p>We are at an exciting time right now with the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Practice &amp; Strategy conference</a>, where we get to orchestrate the best lineup of speakers, sessions and panels possible.</p>
<p>I just added <a title="Steve Klabnik to our speaker line-up" href="/2012/09/13/steve-klabnik-added-to-speakers-at-api-strategy--conference/">Steve Klabnik to our speaker line-up</a> and now we are excited to announce we&rsquo;ll be having a fireside chat with Albert Wenger (<a title="albert wenger" href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger">@albertwenger</a>) of <a title="Union Square Ventures" href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures (USV)</a>.</p>
<p>Albert combines over 10 years of entrepreneurial experience with an in-depth technology background. As an entrepreneur, he has founded or co-founded five companies, including a management consulting firm (in Germany), a hosted data analytics company, a technology subsidiary for Telebanc (now E*Tradebank), an early stage investment firm, and most recently (with his wife), DailyLit, a service for reading books by email or RSS.</p>
<p>Albert also served as the president of del.icio.us through the company's sale to Yahoo. His technology background goes back to winning the German national computer science competition at age 18. Albert graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in economics and computer science and holds a Ph.D. in Information Technology from MIT. He has managed technology projects for organizations as diverse as Tacoda (startup) and Telebanc (leading Internet bank).</p>
<p>USV invests in companies that have large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience and defensible by network effects, so USV has a vested interest in understanding developer communities, how APIs will evolve, what types of businesses are best suited to an API driven strategy.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Practice &amp; Strategy conference</a> fireside chat with Albert Wenger will reflect the tone of the conference, which is a blend of both the technical and business of APIs--providing what is essential for companies to be successful with their API driven strategies.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a big supporter of <a title="API providers having a healthy embed strategy" href="/2011/05/04/does-your-e-commerce-marketplace-have-an-embed-strategy/">API providers having a healthy embed strategy</a>.  I bundle any widgets, buttons and any API driven tool that allows enables users to take advantage of APIs, under the label, "API embed strategy".</p>
<p>I noticed that Twitter gave it&rsquo;s embeddable tools feature status in the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter developer area</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/Twitter-Developers-Embed.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>Embeddable tools like Twitter&rsquo;s <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines">Embedded Timelines</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards">Twitter Cards</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets">Embedded Tweets</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button">Tweet Button</a> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/follow-button">Follow Button</a> are all great for empowering all your users to take advantage of an API.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s move is similar to that of <a href="/2011/04/13/linkedin-api-platform-and-the-evolution-of-the-api/">LinkedIn, who also de-emphasized their API interfaces and offered various embeddable tools, badge and widget builder tools</a> that help extend the API across the interwebz.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/singly-twitter-linkedin-github-facebook-authentication.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m updating the login and authentication for my content management system, APIs and other tools to provide authentication using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Github by default. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://singly.com/">Singly as an authentication provider</a>, because their aggregation of API authentication, endpoints and objects across these providers is easy and most efficient way I know to get this accomplished.</p>
<p>In addition to it being easy, I&rsquo;m using Singly for another advantage.  Each service Singly provides has a discovery endpoint, which provides me with metadata and the other endpoints each service provides.  I want to use this meta data to derive a quick snapshot ranking of my authenticating user.</p>
<p>For example, when a user authenticates via <a href="https://github.com/">Github Using Singly</a>, I get the following meta data and endpoints:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Github-Meta-Endpoints.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Singly gives me 6 endpoints with data from the user&rsquo;s activity in these areas.  I&rsquo;m looking to create an algorithm that will provide me with some quick ranking score based upon the number of repositories, followers and following a user has.</p>
<p>Right now I'm just going to add these up, take average across all my users that have logged in via Github.  I&rsquo;m sure I will evolve the design of the algorithm as I progress, but it should work for now.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide a little more insight into what type of user is signing up for my service, API or otherwise and possibly take different courses of action based upon their overall activity levels on Github.  I mean, if they are Github superstar I want to know it, and also know if they aren&rsquo;t very active at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explore the same algorithm for <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> authentication, but probably take different values into consideration for those social networks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of talk about API automation using platforms like <a title="IFTTT" href="https://ifttt.com/dashboard">IFTTT</a> and <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> these days.  It&rsquo;s one of the fastest growing areas of my&nbsp;<a title="future of web APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a> series.</p>
<p>A sign of this growth can be seen by <a title="Sendgrid&rsquo;s announcement of their partnership with Zapier" href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/sync-data-between-applications/">Sendgrid&rsquo;s announcement of their partnership with Zapier</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Zapier makes it easy to sync data between web applications. They allow SaaS users to create integrations that push data between different web applications without having to waste time coming up with complicated systems.  Now you can easily connect to SendGrid along with hundreds of other apps without having to write a single line of code.</em></blockquote>

<p>API automation is allowing API providers to reach entirely new audiences, acting as a sort of icon-based interface allowing anyone put their APIs to work for them.</p>
<p>Up until now, if you wanted to integrate Sendgrid&rsquo;s email functionality into your workflow you would need to get a programmer, now any user can integrate email into their every day workflow--using the wide array of cloud services and APIs that <a title="automation platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">automation platforms</a> are supporting.</p>
<p>Does your company have an API that users access via API Automation?</p>

<p>I'm happy to be a media partner for the <a title="SOA Cloud 2012 Service Technology Symposium" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/">SOA Cloud 2012 Service Technology Symposium</a>, the largest international conference dedicated to the exploration of SOA, cloud computing and modern service technologies.</p>
<p>SOA Cloud 2012 is happening September 24,25, 2012 in London, UK at the Imperial College London.  The first day kicks off with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li> <strong><a title="The Era of Intelligent Service Technology" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote1">The Era of Intelligent Service Technology</a></strong> -  Thomas Erl's well-known, visionary tour of relationships between and combinations of service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, and semantic Web technologies. </li>
<li><a title="New Paradigms for Application Architecture" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote10">New Paradigms for Application Architecture</a>: From Applications to IT Services Speaker by Anne Thomas Manes of Gartner about the convergence of mobile, social, cloud, and information forcing demand that we adopt new paradigms for application architecture and delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>The first day keynotes have not one space agency talking APIs, but two.  With<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote2"> Vicente Navarro of the European Space Agency</a>, and <a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote3">Hook Hua of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology</a> (NASA Center).</p>
<p>Second day keynotes are pretty impressive too, with opening keynote by Dennis Wisnosky, US Department of Defense &ndash; "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote6">Heading, Altitude &amp; Airspeed: Service Orientation, Cloud &amp; Semantics &ndash; All or Nothing!</a>".  Then Michael Hritz, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) &ndash; "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote7">SOA, Cloud and Service Technologies at the FAA</a>"  and "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote11">The API Economy is Here: Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and Your IT Enterprise</a>" from Corey Scobie of SOA Software looks interesting.</p>
<p>A couple sessions I&rsquo;m watching closely are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_open_api_economy">The Open API Economy: What Is It and How Do I Capitalize on It?</a> with Laura Olson of IBM</li>
<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_open_api_economy"> </a>
<li><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_open_api_economy"></a><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_rise_of_the_internet_service_bus">The Rise of the Internet Service Bus</a> with Jaime Ryan of Layer 7 Technologies </li>
<li><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#architecting_a_restful_cloud">Architecting a RESTful Cloud: The Key to Elasticity</a> with Jason Bloomberg of ZapThink</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the <a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/panels2012.php">expert panels</a> the  The New World of Open APIs caught my eye, where they are discussing how the marketplace and economy that surround open APIs is rapidly growing, and has been further fueled by the acceptance of REST-based services and innovative hybrid solutions.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the keynotes, sessions and panel that caught my attention,  I&rsquo;m going to spend some time researching a couple of the speakers and companies and then I might have some more recommendations.  It looks like a lot of API goodness packed into 2 days, and would make a fun trip to London this month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking the <a title="progress of each federal agency&rsquo;s adoption of the White House CIO digital strategy" href="/federal_government.php">adoption of the White House CIO's digital strategy</a>, trying understand each agency's mobile and API plans.</p>
<p>Today I noticed that NASA, in addition to publishing their digital strategy in <a title="NASA HTML Digital Strategy" href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html">HTML</a>, <a title="XML" href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.xml">XML</a> and <a title="NASA JSON Digital Strategy" href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.json">JSON</a>, added a "recent commits" Github widget on their digital strategy homepage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a small, but very important addition.  It shows that NASA sees the importance of not just using Github, but pushing code and interacting with developers via the social network.</p>
<p><a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> is a service that is getting more traction within government, and I hope that more federal agencies don&rsquo;t just put it to use, but make it part of the culture within their organization.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/API-Upside.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was spending time thinking about API discovery methodologies this afternoon (I know...I have issues), but with <a title="ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs</a>, its a very real problem.</p>
<p>Currently, as an application developer, when I have an idea, I start by sketching what I want to build and set out to find all of the resources I will need to make it a reality.  I pick my platform of choice and then set out to find other API resources I will need to bring my app to life.</p>
<p>I will need a database, user management and some analytics for my back-end, selecting a <a title="Backend as a Service" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">Backend as a Service</a>&nbsp;(BaaS)&nbsp;provider like <a title="CloudMine" href="https://cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> or <a title="Kinvey" href="http://www.kinvey.com/">Kinvey</a>.  Next I need authentication and social integration with <a title="Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly</a>.  After this I will have to piece together my application from a variety of individual APIs like <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, <a title="Urban Airship" href="http://urbanairship.com/">Urban Airship</a>, <a title="Iron.io" href="http://Iron.io">Iron.io</a> and many other APIs.</p>
<p>What if we flipped this on its head and reversed the process?  As an application developer, I could publish a list of resources I need for my web or mobile app, and APIs could find me.  I could just publish my need for image storage, facial recognition, location and other resources and API providers could find me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a brain exercise to see if I&rsquo;m missing anything.  Maybe the problem we need to solve isn&rsquo;t API discovery, it&rsquo;s application discovery? &nbsp;Enable APIs to find developers, in addition to developers finding APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2012</span>
        <p>I was directed to an API question today, that needs to be asked constantly in the space:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 50px;">
<p>What&rsquo;s your biggest web API pet peeve? What drives you crazy when integrating with a new API?</p>

<p>My response was:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 50px;">
<p>Reply to @<a href="https://twitter.com/pengwynn">pengwynn</a> my top 4 R 1) incomplete or cumbersome docs 2) lack of code samples 3)senseless rate limiting 4) no self-service reg</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>This is such a relevant topic I wanted to continue the conversation by listing the top 10 things that drive me crazy when integrating with a new API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Incomplete or Cumbersome Documentation</strong> - Definitely something that will keep you from a achieving a successful integration and make you walk away from an API</li>
<li><strong>Lacking Code Samples &amp; Libraries</strong> - The programming language i&rsquo;m using could vary from project to project, and the code samples and libraries can make or break my successful integration</li>
<li><strong>Senseless Rate Limiting</strong> - Rate limits are an essential part of API management, but placing of rate limits unecessarily and without pressure release options, doesn&rsquo;t make sense</li>
<li><strong>No Self-Service Registration</strong> - As a developer, I need instant gratification.  I need to know if an API will work for me, and getting started immediately will make the difference between using and walking away</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> - I&rsquo;m depending on an API, if its not reliable, I can&rsquo;t depend on for my application.  There are many aspects of API management that goes into reliability--spend the time to understand what it takes</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use </strong>- Nothing stops a great application idea more than restrict terms of use.  Make the legaleze as developer friendly as you can</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Regular communication with developers goes a long ways.  Whether blog posts, tweets or working with developers in person at hackathons, communication is an essential for me to adopt an API</li>
<li><strong>Usage Analytics </strong>- As a developer I need to understand how I&rsquo;m using an API.  As an API owner, you should be tracking every aspect of API operations, make sure and share some of this insight with developers</li>
<li><strong>Business Model </strong>- A business model for both API provider and consumer is essential for a healthy API experience.  If the API provider isn&rsquo;t making money or delivering value, it&rsquo;s not sustainable--if the developer can&rsquo;t pay the bills, their integrations will not survive</li>
<li><strong>Clear Pricing</strong> - If I don't know what it will cost for me to accomplish what I need with an API, there is very little chance I will integrate it into my application. I've become very accustomed to knowing my AWS bill, with the clear pricing they provide</li>
</ul>
<p>All nine of these items go into establishing trust between API provider and consumer.  There are some APIs I just trust and others I don&rsquo;t.  Delivery in these nine areas, all feed into whether I trust an API for my business or not</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
</ul>
<p><a title="I depend on 21 separate APIs for my business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">I depend on 21 separate APIs for my business</a>.  I&rsquo;m working to add more to this stack, and as a developer I can identify if an API has value within seconds, and hopefully have it integrated with in minutes or at the most a couple of hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As an API provider, make sure and find out what drives your developers crazy while integrating, and see what you can do to reduce friction in these nine areas. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bizdev.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>At first glance, APIs seem like something very technical, and the REST pundits do a good job of maintaining this perspective. Even though at the core of what we currently know as a &ldquo;web API&rdquo; there is plenty of tech, web APIs can be much more business than tech--a notion first introduced by&nbsp;<a title="Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake when she coined the term BizDev 2.0" href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake when she coined the term BizDev 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>APIs in practice, are a new approach to business development, using a partner or public facing API that allows consumers to sign up, start accessing valueable business assets in a self-service way--allowing a company to scale business development opportunities with fewer human resources.</p>
<p>Developers can start building applications and businesses around a companies assets, utilizing exposed API resources and self-service tools to establish a business relationship on their own. If an API has the necessary technical and business building blocks, and API consumers have a good enough application, there is a an opportunity for finding success without the need for engagement of traditional business development resources.</p>
<p>This process is BizDev 2.0. &nbsp;However, even with this evolution in establishing new business relationships, your company may not be ready for the flood of new relationships and ideas that will flow in through this new API driven environment. If you handle all the aspects of your API correctly, developers build applications, establish successful businesses and get traction on their ideas, they will need additional resources, attention and potentially, incubation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been the face of this process several times, only to bring in good ideas, get traction and identify potential value, but when I present these implementations internally...I get well, nothing. Companies often don&rsquo;t have the infrastructure and resources to handle this flow of new business opportunities, even a formal process for saying, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a great idea, we see the value, but we don't have the resources to deal with that right now&rdquo;, aka no!</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Biz-20-Workflow.png" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Biz-20-Workflow.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>If your going to open up a public or private API, you need to make sure you have a proper BizDev 2.0 process for handling new relationships that get traction via your API. This isn&rsquo;t saying you have to take in every relationship that comes in the door, but you need to have an efficient framework for receiving, evaluating and either accepting as a new relationship or formally declining and providing secondary options for the relationship--one of which can be putting the project back out to the ecosystem, for a crowd-sourced implementation.</p>
<p>Having a formal process, especially one that is transparent will go a long ways in building trust with your developer community. Think of how much different the current Twitter conversation would have been if they had a formal process for handling various business relationships early on? They are just now putting some of this in place, which is good, but much harder to do further down the road.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how perfect your technical implementation is, if you don&rsquo;t have a decent framework for handling the relationships that come in through your API community, developers will lose trust and look elsewhere to build their applicaitons and businesses. Make sure you have thought through the business development 2.0 process for your API, during the initial planning phase.</p>

        <p>Many providers don't offer a clear pricing page for their services, sticking to old school concepts of software sales where they can change and adjust pricing, depending on who they are talking to.</p>
<p>Have an <a title="easy to find and understand pricing page for an API" href="/buildingblocks/pricing.php">easy to find and understand pricing page for an API</a> or platform is one of the most critical aspects of a successful API.&nbsp;</p>

<p>APIs are everywhere.  The number of public APIs available on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> are growing at a dizzying pace, with current count being at 7,207.  The number of <a title="API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">API service providers</a> and tools supporting the new demand for simple, web APIs that mobile and web developers can use has seen the same pace of growth.  I&rsquo;m getting requests for API 101 materials across all business sectors from healthcare to the <a title="federal government" href="/federal_government.php">federal government</a>.</p>
<p>The pace of API consumption is growing as well, and up until recently, we only communicate in single words using APIs--we checkin, post, share, get, friend, like. &nbsp;Now that we have learned the basic words, we need a way to form more "<strong>meaningful&nbsp;phrases and sentences to communicate using APIs</strong>".</p>
<p>In the past month I&rsquo;ve explored a couple different areas where I&rsquo;m seeing APIs evolve from single uses into more aggregate, flowing forms of communication using APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Backend as a Service (BaaS)" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">Backend as a Service(BaaS)</a></strong> - Building in the resources developers need most when building mobile or web apps into a single stack, bringing together the back-end and middleware to make developers more successful.</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Automation" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">API Automation</a></strong> - Providing iconographic tools for any users, even non-developers to string together actions between multiple APIs.  Bundling them into reusable recipes, and automating our personal and business lives in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mobile Builder Platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/04/mobile-application-builder-platforms/">Mobile Builder Platforms</a> </strong>- Platforms that provide hosted tools for developers and non-developers to rapidly build cross-platform mobile applications using content from RSS and APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Language Libraries" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/06/the-next-generation-of-api-programming-using-temboo-and-webshell/">API Language Libraries</a></strong> - Development of language libraries allowing developers to program against APIs with single lines of code, abstracting away common friction with authentication and inconsistencies between APis.</li>
<li><a title="Aggregate API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/18/a-unified-interface-for-social-apis-with-singly/"><strong>Aggregate APIs</strong>&nbsp;</a>- Building of unified or aggregate APIs like <a href="https://www.singly.com">Singly</a> does with personal data, providing a single authentication, endpoint and object framework that makes speaking with multiple APIs a reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the five fastest growing areas where I see API usage being taken to the next level, potentially allowing developers and even non-developers to better communicate using APIs, in ways that are more sophisticated than just single word uses.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/communicate-in-new-ways.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ironically there is a sixth area where APIs takes communicating with APIs to a new level, using speech and voice applications like Apple&rsquo;s Siri. This is one area that we&rsquo;ll continue to see an explosion of APIs to support.  If your business resources aren&rsquo;t exposed via an API, they won&rsquo;t be found by mobile users taking advantage of Siri-like speech applications.</p>
<p>All six of these areas will fuel the demand for APIs, while also adding entirely new ways of communicating.  These API resources will drive new meaning behind existing phrases like take a picture or search for restaurant, while creating entirely new words and phrases--much like we saw in the last ten years with the introduction of API driven concepts such as &ldquo;like&rdquo;, &ldquo;share&rdquo; and the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Sep 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m exploring the <a title="future of web APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a>, and have come to what I feel is what of the most fascinating areas of evolution in the usage of web APIs. &nbsp;An approach that is very developer centric, which is something you don't always see in the current API service landscape.</p>
<p><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/temboo/Temboo-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are two companies working hard on developing new libraries for popular programming languages that abstract away much of the authentication and other complexities developers face when using APIs.</p>
<p><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com">Temboo</a> and <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> are two pioneers that are taking API development to a new level.  Temboo is building libraries in Java, PHP, Python, or Ruby and Webshell is building libraries in JS, PHP, Ruby as well as providing a command line interface for programming against APIs.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just programming directly against a single API.  These are libraries that allow you to make calls against APIs using sometimes as little as 2 or 3 lines of code, opening new possibilities of efficiently programming against not just one API, but fluently across multiple APIs.</p>
<p><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to simplifying calls made against APIs, both platforms work to abstract away the complexities of API authentication, one of the biggest pain points for developers.</p>
<p>Platforms like Temboo and Webshell absorb the complexity, inconsistencies and difficult aspects of programming using APIs, providing libraries that developers can use in their native programming languages--making developers lives easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to classify what <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com">Temboo</a> and <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> are doing.  I don&rsquo;t have a term or phrase to describe them--one that does them justice.  Everything I say sounds like everything you are already doing with individual APIs.  But this is more.  Temboo and Webshell are defining new ways of speaking using APIs, allowing us to more efficiently speak using the vast amount of valuable resources being exposed via web APIs today.</p>
<p>Temboo and Webshell both have their own approach to solving this problem, which I will dive into separately, in future posts. &nbsp;Right now I just want to identify what they are doing to move forward the API landscape.</p>

<p>The API management capabilities in OAP are being released under the name&nbsp;<a title="apiGrove" href="http://apigrove.net/">apiGrove</a>.  According to Alcatel-Lucent&rsquo;s methodology there are four major components to API infrastructure:</p>

<li>Management</li>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Monetization</li>
<li>Analytics</li>

<p>The functionality of apiGrove API Management platform represents the basic features companies will need when deploying web APIs internally, and externally to the public or for partners.

<p>Bundled with apiGrove is a GUI administration tool, providing a simple interface for administrators to use, but only represents some of the features available on the platform.  To fully take advantage of apiGrove API management you need to use the API--with everything on the platform accessible via an API.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/09/05/providing-api-developers-with-github-login-using-singly/">Providing API Developers with Github Login Using Singly</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><a href="https://singly.com/docs/github" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/singly-plus-github.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m building a small API that I want to allow developers to register for.  I don&rsquo;t want to make it a complicated registration process, I just want them to provide some sort of credentials and I will issWue a key that they can use to make API calls.</p>
<p>To keep it simple I&rsquo;m offering a login using a <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> account.  Every developer has a Github account right?   Well if they don&rsquo;t, they should.  The easiest way there is to enable your API with a Github login is Singly.</p>
<p>Using <a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Singly</a>, I sign in with my Github account (this is where I got this idea), then I <a href="https://singly.com/apps/new">add a new application</a>, giving it the root URL and callback URL of my API developer area.</p>
<p><a href="https://singly.com/apps/new" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Application-Github.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Next I need to link up my Github account to my Singly account, by <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications">adding an application to my Github account</a>.  I give it a name, URL and when adding the callback, I add a Singly specific callback--Singly will handle the rest.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Github-App-Settings.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Now I just add a login with Github button to my developer area with the following URL:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><em>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/github?access_token=my_token</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When one of my API developers click on the Github login, it will route them to Github for OAuth, back to Singly and to my API callback URL where I can grab the authorization code for the user.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3646162.js?file=github-login-using-singly.php"></script>
<p>Now I can reference my API developer using their Github account, using their profile image, name as well as having some stats about the user like how many repositories they have, number of followers and who they follow--which provides me a pretty good baseline metric for distinguishing active developers vs. in-active developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kinlane"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kinlane-github.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Github login should be default for all API providers. It reduces developer on-boarding friction with an API, and uses the social network that makes the most sense for API developers.</p>
        <ul class="actions" style="text-align: center;">

<p>In my quest to understand the possible <a title="future of web APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of Web APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m trying to understand the opportunities available for APIs when it comes to latest wave of mobile app builder platforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the most familiar with two leading platforms, <a title="CabanaApps" href="http://www.cabanaapp.com/">Cabana</a>&nbsp;and <a title="Tiggzi" href="http://www.tiggzi.com">Tiggzi</a>, but wanted to take a look at what else is out there.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m classifying as a mobile app builder platform, is a web-based platform (not something you have to download), that lets you build a mobile application and usually (but not always) without any development experienced.</p>
<p>There are a lot of sites that claim the ability to build mobile apps in minutes, but many of them clearly are spammy crap.  I tried to sort through as many as I could to come up with this short list of mobile app builder platforms:</p>

</table>
<p>Not all of these mobile app building platforms provide support for external APIs, the ones who do are clearly leaders in the space. &nbsp;Tiggzi and Cabana both provide powerful API support, while others offer modules, connectors that are canned API integration, without much customization from users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of these mobile builder platforms look pretty basic and are trying to capitalize on the needs of the masses wanting to deploy mobile applications. &nbsp;The mobile builder platforms that continue to add in API connectivity, especially with <a title="social and personal data APIs" href="http://www.singly.com">social and personal data APIs</a> will keep up.</p>
<p>I predict in 6 months, I'll come back to this post and 1/3 will be out of business, because they didn't build in API integration.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><em>This is a case study sent to me from National Instruments. &nbsp;I just had to post it as is, because it just shows the serious potential of APIs. &nbsp;If cloud computing and mobile hasn't convinced you that APIs are here to stay, take a look at what National Instruments is doing.</em></p>
<p>Over the past five years, <a title="National Instruments" href="http://www.ni.com/">National Instruments</a> (NI) has been using an API strategy to enable a developer ecosystem, based on their <a title="LabView" href="http://www.ni.com/labview/">LabVIEW software platform</a>. &nbsp;NI equips engineers and scientists with tools that accelerate productivity, innovation, and discovery &ndash; and a strong ecosystem is core to their philosophy. &nbsp;This case study takes a look at one approach, and the business role that APIs play in expanding into new markets. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />As background, NI LabVIEW is a productivity tool and graphical programming language used in all kinds of scientific applications. &nbsp;The breadth of users range from &ldquo;aspiring engineers&rdquo; who use a specialized version to program the Lego Mindstorms NXT software, to some of the world&rsquo;s top researchers who use LabVIEW to design complex systems including software for the CERN hadron collider and the SpaceX control center. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-1.png" alt="" width="576px;" height="267px;" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: &nbsp;LabVIEW is used from K through Rocket Science.</p>
<p>To understand why an API strategy was needed, first consider the standard use-case for LabVIEW. &nbsp;Most companies use LabVIEW as a productivity tool/IDE to develop applications using the default software stack provided by NI, and combining that software with measurement hardware. &nbsp;&nbsp;A common application is production testing of a consumer device, such as the <a href="http://sine.ni.com/cs/app/doc/p/id/cs-662">Xbox 360 controller from Microsoft</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW allows complete customization of an engineering application, just as is possible with any other programming language. &nbsp;The difference between a text-based language, and LabVIEW&rsquo;s graphical approach, that that the graphical approach is familiar to engineers who grow up drawing block diagrams of systems, and it makes connecting to real-world I/O very efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW also supports parallelism (multithreading), memory management, built-in analysis, control algorithms, and measurement routines which helps engineering firms build sophisticated applications more quickly. <br /><br />NI&rsquo;s core business model is to serve end-users directly, but the ability to scale through an open platform allows &ldquo;repeatability&rdquo;. &nbsp;In otherwords, through an API strategy, Company A in one specialized domain, can extend the NI platform or build a vertical product on top of it, such that Company B can leverage that. &nbsp;The software stack for 3rd party developers looks very similar to the stack for end-users, with the addition of APIs that enable product development. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-2.png" alt="" width="386px;" height="288px;" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: &nbsp;API Framework for LabVIEW</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been some very compelling use-cases that have arisen from the LabVIEW ecosystem, and over 100 certified products in total. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of three examples:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Robotics</strong> - ImagingLab GmbH, is a German company that has created LabVIEW toolkits to allow engineers to control industrial robots from leading manufacturers including DENSO, KUKA, Epson, Yaskawa, Mitsubishi, and more. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Big Data</strong> - Neural ID, a venture backed firm in the San Francisco bay area, has created a pattern recognition engine called CURE, to analyze unstructured data. &nbsp;This product sits on top of LabVIEW, and can recognize any kind of waveform and provide analytic capabilities to allow organizations to make better decisions about their data. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s used by companies like ecoATM and NASA. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing </strong>- Maintainable Software has developed a software-as-a-service product for use in electronics manufacturing test, for cloud-based data management.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their software is used by customers such as Coulomb Technologies, a leader in electric vehicle chargers.&nbsp; In addition, &nbsp;Maintainable Software has deep expertise in tools used to develop cloud infrastructure, and have published a technical book on the subject.&nbsp; Their product works on the latest tablet devices such as Apple iPads.</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>The companies listed above offer their respective products through NI&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ni.com/labviewtools/">LabVIEW Tools Network</a>, which is an appstore dedicated to engineers and scientists. <br /><br />In summary, an API strategy can enable 3rd party developers and tech companies to innovate on a mature software platform and expand it into new markets. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an approach that&rsquo;s not just limited to companies in the mobile or web space&ndash; it is equally as powerful in the B2B space in industries like test &amp; measurement, and embedded control. &nbsp;&nbsp;For a product like LabVIEW with a 25+ year history, an API strategy is one of the best ways to compliment in-house R&amp;D efforts with an ecosystem approach, and drive innovation in emerging areas like Robotics, Big Data, and Cloud.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/facebook/Facebook+Download+Your+Archive.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was just downloading all of my Facebook data.  You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download">go under your account settings and there is a little link</a> that lets you download everything. &nbsp;It takes some time to generate a full archive, but once my archive is ready, they&rsquo;ll email me and I can get at my data and see what the download format looks like.</p>
<p>While waiting, I wanted to see what Google had to offer.  Google has an amazing <a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard">acount management dashboard</a> which provides you access to your settings, some of the data, but Google is also working on their <a title="takeout service" href="https://www.google.com/takeout/">takeout service</a> which gives you downloads for individual services and across multiple services.</p>
<p>That is a pretty good start.  Two of my biggest networks allow me to download data. I wasn't so lucky with the next four:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter - No</li>
<li>Instagram - No</li>
<li>Foursquare - No</li>
<li>LinkedIn - Some (just your connections)</li>
</ul>
<p>I use all six of these services daily.  It bums me out that I can&rsquo;t get out my own data.  Of course all of these services have an API, which allows developers to get at my data, but even <a title="Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/IFTTT-My-Recipes.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I want access to a data store of all my <a title="Facebook" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a title="Google" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/gcontacts">Google</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a title="Instagram" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a> and <a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> data in a single location.  There are software available trying to solve this problem such as <a title="ThinkUp" href="http://thinkupapp.com/">ThinkUp</a> or <a title="The Locker Project" href="http://lockerproject.org/">The Locker Project</a>.  As with APIs, these solutions require you to be a developer. (I see ThinkUp has a cloud solution now)</p>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;m thinking about how to build an application using <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com">Singly</a>, one that allows me to pull posts, tweets, photos, friends and other vital personal data into a single store. &nbsp;I need to think it through.</p>
<p>Then I really start questioning the storage of all of my social data.  Do I really even want it all in one location?  Do I just want it in another location, a sort of plan B.  It really depends on the data.  I guess I have to think about each service and how I want the data replicated, moved, syndicated or otherwise. This is beginning to sound a lot like <a title="API Automation" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">API automation</a> to me and not just data liberation.</p>
<p>I hate ending a post, without wrapping up an idea properly. &nbsp;I'll just have to work out in another post, but then again that is why this is on my personal blog and not API Evangelist or API Voice.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/08/30/crowdsourced-api-terms-of-service/">Crowdsourced API Terms of Service</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service/developer-rights.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>API terms of service (TOS) is one of the most critical, yet one of the most silent links for developers who are building apps and business on top of APIs.  Terms of service determine what you can or cannot do with an API, and often times developers do not understand these terms, leaving them vulnerable to some very negative outcomes.</p>
<p>Following in the footprints of a larger project, called &ldquo;<a title="Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="http://tos-dr.info/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a>&rdquo;, a group of us have gotten together,  and created &ldquo;<a title="API Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="http://api-tos-dr.info/">API Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>&rdquo;, which aims at creating a transparent and peer-reviewed process to rate and analyze API Terms of Service, to establishing a rating classification that all developers can understand.</p>
<p>To seed the process, we went out and reviewed a number of the popular API terms of service and identified seven categories that really affect developers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Business model (include pricing, rate limits and quotas)</li>
<li>Terms change conditions</li>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service/API-Terms-of-Service-Didnt-Read.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<li>Developers restrictions</li>
<li>End-user Privacy</li>
<li>API Data ownership</li>
<li>Data portability</li>
<li>Jurisdiction</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to rank each API using a classification ranging from A (good) to E (bad) in these seven areas, so developers can quickly understand where an API stands in the areas that are most important to them.</p>
<p>API Terms of Service Didn't Read, also known as API-ToS;DR, is a crowd-sourced effort and requires community involvement to be successful.  To get involved you can visit the <a href="http://api-tos-dr.info/">API-ToS;DR website</a>, join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-tosdr">working Google Group</a> or help by <a href="https://github.com/tiborvass/ToS-DR">pushing code in the Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>As APIs grow in popularity this problem is only going to get worse.  Terms of service is something I see several groups working to actively understand such as <a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Singly</a> with their personal data <a title="terminator project" href="https://github.com/quartzjer/Singly/tree/master/Terminator">terminator project</a>, and EFF with their <a title="TOSBack Project" href="http://www.tosback.org/timeline.php">TOSBack project</a>.</p>
<p>Over the coming months I&rsquo;d like to help focus all this energy into <a title="API Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/84544713/apitos/index.html">API Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>, providing a plain english rating system that all developers can use when navigating the often treacherous landscape of API development.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get excited about the potential here.  With almost 20 departments and agencies on board, and 166 APIs planned--there is a lot of potential for the other 226 departments and agencies to see the potential and get on board.</p>
<p>This list of systems are generated programmatically using each department or agencies machine readable digital strategy.  I didn't have to compile this by hand, which shows the potential of the digital strategy to become a federal API discovery platform. &nbsp;You can view the <a title="real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy" href="/federal_government_digital_strategy_systems.php">real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy</a>, which gets updated every night when I run my monitoring script.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Personal-Data-Explorer.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Last week I announced that <a title="API Evangelist and Singly Were Partnering" href="/2012/08/20/api-evangelist-partners-up-with-singly-to-evolve-the-social-and-personal-api-space/">API Evangelist and Singly were partnering</a>, and while I&rsquo;m helping Singly with their API Evangelism strategy and they are providing me with some vital data on some of the most important APIs in the industry and how developers are using them--I&rsquo;m fascinated by the Singly unified API model and how it can simplify developing apps that use social and personal data.</p>
<p>As I do with any API, I sign up for an account, come up with an idea for a prototype, start hacking, then get to work telling the story of the process.  To get started using Singly, I wanted to build a simply social data explorer that would help me understand how the platform works, but also give me a simple example for explaining to other developers.</p>
<p>Before diving in, let me start with the basics.  What is <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com" target="_blank">Singly</a>?</p>
<blockquote>Singly is a <a title="unified API interface for accessing social and personal data" href="https://singly.com">unified API interface for accessing social and personal data</a> from the top API platforms. Singly has built an API on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other API platforms.  Simplified the authentication, objects and API endpoints into a unified API, allowing you to access multiple APIs through a single, simpler API interface, drastically improving the time you have to spend developing social features in your web and mobile apps.</blockquote>
<p>For this project I focused on the top social network APIs: <a title="Facebook" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a>, <a title="Github" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/github">Github</a>, <a title="Instagram" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="Twitter" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>.  Ok, for many Github isn&rsquo;t a social network.  It&rsquo;s something just  geeks use, but to us, it is a social network.  Anyways, let&rsquo;s start building my social data exploration prototype.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="120" align="right" /></p>
<p>First, I <a title="signed up for Singly which was instant using my Github login" href="/2012/07/18/let-developers-register-for-your-api-with-their-github-profile/">signed up for Singly using my Github login</a>.  Once signed up, I added my first Singly application, which allows me to generate application specific Singly keys, which features I will use, and provides a single interface to store and manage that access for each social network that I will be using.  When adding a new app, it takes some time to setup, and create an app definition in all 6 social networks and add keys to my Singly app, but once you are all done, all you have to worry about is a single Singly key--Singly takes care of the rest.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-App-Management.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Now I have a single API for accessing all six social APIs.  Singly provides consistent endpoints across these services:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/facebook</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/foursquare</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/github</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/instagram</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/linkedin</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the objects you can work with across all of them aren&rsquo;t the same, as they can be very different services, but the patterns are consistent and Singly standardizes the authentication and objects as much as possible across all APIs.</p>
<p>The first authentication and code library for Facebook took me about 10 minutes.  Then after that I was able to reuse my code and had all five other services up and running in another 10 minutes.</p>
<p>How you use social data in your web and mobile applications will vary, but the unified API approach offered by Singly is taking API development to a new level.  Using Singly I don&rsquo;t think of terms of single APIs and how I have to approach each integration--I can now think of building social features into my applications across multiple APIs in a very seamless and efficient way.</p>
<p>I will be exploring this same approach, using the other blogging, productivity and quantified self services Singly offers.  I just wanted to get started with the social APIs, and begin wrapping my head around more efficient API development using a unified API like Singly.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/mobile-backend-as-a-service/Mobile+Backend+as+a+Service.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I did a <a title="roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers" href="/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers</a> last week, which brought in a couple recommendations of other companies I should include, and some interesting feedback on how APIs can be integrated with MBaaS platforms.</p>
<p>A very interesting comment left on the post was about MBaaS vendor lock-in:</p>
<blockquote><em>The big problem, IMHO, using a BaaS provider is the so called "vendor lock in". What if my backend provider changes the pricing models, or dismisses the service and go out of the business? </em></blockquote>
<p>To address this issue, the commenter said they are building an open source MBaaS platform, which anyone will be able to download and install on the server or cloud platform of their choice.</p>
<p>Just like with the recent addition of an <a title="open source api management platform" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/19/the-100-open-source-api-platform-i-was-looking-for/">open source API management platform</a>, I think an open source Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) would benefit the space tremendously.</p>
<p>The new open source MBaaS is called BaaSBox, and is in early development.  I found a <a href="https://twitter.com/baasbox">Twitter account</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/BaasBox">Facebook page</a>, which I'll pay attention to for updates.</p>
<p>While many of the MBaaS providers are catering to the most common needs of mobile application developers, I can envision an open source MBaaS platform opening up entirely new niche offerings that could provide developers with ready to go platforms for developing, deploying and managing very specialized mobile applications, without "vendor lock-in". &nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to hear your thoughts on MBaaS vendor lock-in and whether an open source version is necessary.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m continuing my <a title="research into the future of web APIs" href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">research into the future of web APis</a>, and after watching leading <a title="Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) provider Kinvey start building APIs into their platform" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/03/rise-of-mobile-backend-as-a-service-mbaas-api-stacks/">Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) provider Kinvey start building APIs into their platform</a>, I think MBaaS providers show a lot of potential for providing developers with quick access to API resources.</p>

<p>This number of providers really shows a fast growing market of back-end tools to help developers rapidly build mobile applications.  Most of these service providers focus on common use cases like data storage, push notifications and social integration.  As these platforms mature it makes sense that will need to start offering more specialized resources.</p>
<p>While developers can go straight to API service providers on their own, since MBaaS providers are in the business of simplifying development for mobile application builders, it makes a lot of sense for them to start bundling common resources available via social, photo, productivity APIs and location data APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/landscape monitoring.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>One very important aspect of API Evangelism is landscape analysis.   When you launch an API, you need to have an intimate understanding of the landscape where you will be evangelizing your API and engaging with potential consumers.</p>
<p>I always start by establishing potential 10K foot target areas that I will focusing on in my research.  While these may vary from industry to industry, my starting list is:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Individuals</strong> - Who are the key individual influencers in your target landscape</li>
<li><strong>Competitors</strong> - Know your competitors, you can learn a lot from what they do right or they do wrong</li>
<li><strong>Platforms</strong> - There are an endless amount of platforms that may benefit your company, such as Drupal, Wordpress and Salesforce</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Who are the relevant media and blogs you should be following and engaging with</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong> - Existing partners who you should be in tune with on the landscape</li>
</ul>
<p>After tackling these areas and identifying who the players are, you will identify other areas that are unique to your API evangelism efforts, so don't stress over whether you have the right areas in the first week.  While researching these areas of my landscape I try to identify specific channels for getting plugged in with landscape targets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Website URL</strong> - What is the targets root URL for their website</li>
<li><strong>Blog URL</strong> - What is the blog for a target</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS</strong> - Secondary to the blog, what is the RSS feed so I can programmatically monitor</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - What is a companies or individuals Twitter handle</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Identify and sometimes connect with a target&rsquo;s LinkedIn account</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Identify and sometimes connect with a target&rsquo;s Facebook account</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Identify, follow and engage with a companies Github profile and appropriate repositories</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-bird-blue-on-white.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>After getting the primary channels for each target on my landscape identified, I will go deeper sometimes and actually identify key individuals associated with target companies, either the founders and / or key employees. I look for Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Github for individuals as well, and sometimes even personal blogs when available.</p>
<p>While landscape analysis is an initial project in the first couple weeks of designing your API evangelism strategy, it will be ongoing iniative, in monitoring all target channels in real-time, but also identifying new target groups, companies and individuals or even specific channels not listed above like Tumblr or Google+ each week.</p>
<p>Each industry will be different when identifying the landscape for your API evangelism efforts, but this is a good first round blueprint and has worked well for me on multiple projects.  Let me know if there are any landscape analysis and monitoring tricks you use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing lots of research into the <a title="future of web APIs" href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a> lately, and one area that is definitely gaining more traction is the ability to automate tasks, by defining triggers and actions on top of web APIs.</p>

<p>API automation platforms provide a new way for developers and non-developers to put API resources to use for business or personal tasks.  These automation platforms provide a new opportunity for companies looking to deploy APIs, providing additional channels for distribution and user acquisition.</p>
<p>If you know of any API automation platforms I missed, let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/US_white_house_logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been running a monitoring script every night, so that I could tell when any of the federal department and agency have launched their digital strategy pages, per <a title="Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API</a>, and the White House CIO's strategy, entitled "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>"</p>
<p>I noticed that many of the departments and agencies aren&rsquo;t properly using HTTP response codes, and when I pulled pages, I often get 302 redirects to 404 pages, so I tended to treat 301, 302, 500 as 404&rsquo;s.  Today, I noticed that some of them actually were redirecting to their digital strategies, published at alternate locations, other than directed by the White House strategy, which was [domain]/digitalstrategy.</p>
<p>Recognizing this I put in some logic to handle redirects and check if it was a valid strategy page, and after re-running the script I found 11 more digital strategies published, bringing the total to 14 to date:</p>

<p>With 246 federal departments and agencies, we have a long way to go, but I&rsquo;m optimistic that we&rsquo;ll see enough publish their strategies, identify enough high value data-sets to deploy as APIs, so that the developer community can get to work building some important web and mobile apps or data visualizations.</p>
<p>Once the other departments and agencies see what is possible, hopefully we can get more of them on board, creating somewhat of a domino effect for API deployment, getting us closer to a reality where machine readable data is as common as the PDF in Washington DC.</p>

<p>The world around us is being redefined and a new currency is taking shape.  Tweets on <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, wall posts to <a title="Facebook" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, pictures on <a title="Instagram" href="http://instagram.com">Instagram</a>, files on <a title="Dropbox" href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and health data via <a href="http://fitbit.com">Fitbit</a> are emblematic of the emerging API-driven economy.</p>
<p>This data isn&rsquo;t just social, nor just a currency. It is vital personal data that contains details from intimate aspects of our daily lives.  Platform players like Facebook and Twitter have shown through their APIs the possibilities that emerge when developers can build, unfettered with their own creativity on top of this data -- enriching people&rsquo;s lives in a richer, more connected way.</p>
<p>With the number of social and personal data APIs available today, it is getting increasingly difficult for developers to keep up to speed on which platforms are most important to their end users, the technical differences between each platform&rsquo;s APIs and where to keep up with the changes from each platform as they are rolled out.</p>
<p>Even with all this confusion, there is help:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a></strong> delivers news about the business of APIs and best practices for API owners, politics around API management and developers rights, in hopes of providing insight into which APIs are delivering the most value for the API space and application developers</li>
<li><strong><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com">Singly</a></strong> provides a single API with which developers can build against multiple social and personal data API platforms using a single authentication model, standardized endpoints, a common object model and a whole host of solutions for challenging infrastructure issues that data intensive applications face</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe the industry needs more leadership and content and we have partnered up to deliver:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Real-time news, changes and updates about top social and personal data platforms Information about the business of APIs and best practices from direct experience with top social and personal data APIs</li>
<li>Technical details from daily monitoring and integration with top social and personal APIs Politics and legal issues around personal and social data, how this impacts end users, API owners and developers</li>
<li>Data about how developers access and use social and personal data in their applications A larger voice for developers in a space, where currently API owners dominate the conversation Education, access and greater awareness to end users of their personal and social data Assistance for API owners to better reach and leverage the API developer community</li>
</ul>
<p>In spending time with Jason Cavnar (<a title="@jasoncavnar" href="https://twitter.com/jasoncavnar">@jasoncavnar</a>), Jeremie Miller (<a title="@jeremie" href="https://twitter.com/jeremie">@jeremie</a>) and the Singly team, it&rsquo;s clear they have a very valuable and unique perspective when it comes to API consumption and the future of personal data -- not only for consumers and developers but also that will benefit the platforms themselves. Every day they are monitoring and consuming the personal and social data flowing through the most important APIs in the space and I can&rsquo;t wait to tell the stories of their journey and share their insights along the way. Keep an eye out for these stories in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>While the Department of Commerce and Department of Education have only published paragraphs discussing how they are engaging with users, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has identified three datasets for the web API portion and two optimized for mobile use.  All three have published their digital strategy in HTML, XML and JSON formats, meeting the requirements of "machine readable by default".</p>
<p>I anticipate we&rsquo;ll see many more agencies releasing their digital strategies this week, but there is no way to tell how many agencies will be able to get on board with the CIO&rsquo;s strategy in time.  No matter what, the next 3 months will be critical time for APIs in Washington DC, not just because of the presidential election, but the end of November will be the next milestone where agencies are expected to have established an agency-wide governance structure for developing  and delivering digital services via web APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/mcjug-rockville-md/mcjug_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>While out in Washington DC last week I was invited to speak at the <a title="Montgomery County Java Users Group" href="http://www.mcjug.org/">Montgomery County Java User Group</a> in Rockville, MD.  Without much of an understanding of who my audience was I chose to talk about the <a title="Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/12/the-building-blocks-of-a-successful-api/">Building Blocks of a Successful API</a>.</p>
<p>There was about 25 developers attending from various companies with a heavy health care influence, since the building that hosted the event was home to several health care technology companies.   There were also developers from firms who contracted with federal agencies ranging from Census to the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find out how hungry many of these developers were for information about the API movement and what is working in the open, public API space.  As with my experience with other enterprise companies, these developers were well versed in APIs in the context of service oriented architecture, but had little experience with the building blocks used by many of the successful public APIs operating today.</p>
<p>My presentation went for about an hour, then we discussed not just the business of APIs, but the politics of APIs for another hour.  With the health care presence in the room, the conversation quickly focused on the challenges around deploying APIs in an industry that is so heavily regulated, but also dominated by several 1000 pound gorillas who really have no interest in opening up data, something that threatens their control and dominance.</p>
<p>If I had more money, I think I could spend 100% of my time traveling around the country talking to user groups like MCJUG.  There is a hunger for information about the tech, business and politics of APIs by developers, and I will be coming back soon to Rockville, MD to talk more about APIs with MCJUG. For now I will keep publishing as much content as I can to help these developers understand APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>Continuing my API Craft road show, I landed in Washington DC for the second week in August.  As I planned my trip to the nations capital, I planted the seeds for an API Craft DC version.</p>
<p>I chose a popular H Street watering hole, the <a title="Queen Vic" href="http://www.thequeenvicdc.com/">Queen Vic</a> to host the event, and in tune with <a title="API Craft PDX" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">API Craft PDX</a> and <a title="API Craft SFO" href="/2012/08/18/api-craft-san-francisco/">API Craft SFO</a> about 10-15 people showed up to drink beer and discuss APIs, DC Style.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-craft/API-Craft-DC-August-2012.jpg" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>I was impressed with not just the energy for APIs in DC, but the startup buzz occurring in a city, many like to associate with slow moving government bureaucracy.  API Craft DC brought out one API Service Provider <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com/">APIphany</a>, and an assortment of companies that contract for the government and several other private companies including API geeks from <a title="QVC" href="http://www.qvc.com/">QVC</a>.</p>
<p>API Craft DC has triggered requests for three new gatherings that I will be planning, including API Craft NYC, API Craft Philadelphia and API Craft Atlanta.  Dates coming as soon as I can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>On the heels of the successful <a title="API Craft OSCON Portland, OR" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">API Craft meetup in Portland during OSCON</a>, I was landing in San Francisco for a few days and at the request of SFO API folk, quickly organized a meetup at the Chieftain Pub, and thanks to <a title="@abraham" href="https://twitter.com/abraham">@abraham</a> it was a great turnout.</p>
<p>10-15 people showing up seems to be about the normal for these events, and this API craft had a good showing of API Service Providers with 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Mashape representing.  Then we had API folks from IFTTT, Pearson and SendGrid.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-craft/API-Craft-SFO-July-2012.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>It was also great to have out fellow evangelist and unicorn herder, @abraham.  The SFO API Craft meetup was another great gathering in a growing trend within the API community, and I plan on having them in every city that I can, I hope you do too!</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist two years ago, I noticed some common practices by API owners, in how they tailored their API areas, and I started calling these <a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a>.  I started a section of the site dedicated to my building block philosphy and showcased what I felt were the most common building blocks across the most successful APIs.</p>
<p>Two years later, and after having viewed just about every API publicly available, I have updated my <a title="building blocks section" href="/buildingblocks/">building blocks section</a>, based upon the practices of 1500 of the most successful APIs.  Along with this update I have also published a white paper called <a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a>.</p>
<p><a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> is not meant to provide detail on implementing these building blocks, but shed light on the common ones used by the top APIs.  The white paper is 32 pages long and provides:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>73 Common API Building Blocks, in 18 Categories</li>
<li>30 Top APIs for Review While Planning Your API</li>
<li>Building Block Checklist for Easy Review Before Launch</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this information is freely available on this site, but will require some clicking to gather across pages and blog posts.  If you can&rsquo;t afford the white paper, I want you to be able to learn what you need to be successful. The Building Blocks of a Successful API is meant to be a single PDF, for you to easily read, and find success in planning your own API.</p>
<p><a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="https://tinypay.me/~DRCho6h/the-building-blocks-of-a-successful-api-by-kin-lane">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> is the first in a series of white papers I&rsquo;m producing to provide the resources needed to successfully plan, deploy and manage your APIs while also producing the revenue I need to keep doing the research and writing the drives <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> and <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support, and I good luck with your API!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">Thirty APIs To Look At When Planning Your API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>When planning an API, I always tell people to go look at as many of the top APIs as they can before crafting their own API strategy.  I'm always surprised how many API owners I talk to don't actually use other APIs.  They can usually reference the main ones like Twitter and Facebook, or the usual rockstar Twilio--but very few can cite 10 or more APIs they like.</p>
<p>Recently I spent some time looking through all of <a title="ProgrammableWeb API Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb's APIs</a>, and I made a list of the 30 APIs I like, and would reference when designing an API strategy.  Since I'm more about the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">Business of APIs</a> and not just the finer, technical points, these I feel are unique because of their business approach to delivering their API.</p>
<p>Here are 30 of the best APIs I think you should look at when planning your own API strategy:</p>

<p>Not all of these APIs do it perfectly, but each of them have something we can learn from when planning, deploying and managing our own APIs. &nbsp;All of these APIs have an active presence, so I recommend reaching out to them and ask questions about what made them successful or follow their blog and Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>If there is an API you feeling strong about that is not on this list, please let me know. &nbsp;Or if you feel one of these APIs doesn't do something right, either technical or otherwise, also let me know as well (except if its Twitter). &nbsp;</p>

<p>I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, in Evernote.  Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate.  As a recovering IT guy, and maintaining infrastructure for myself, but also <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>--so I keep good tabs on the various services I use.</p>
<p>While going through this my services list this month, I added a new section to it, and started tracking if I depend on the service for their API.  I have enough automated jobs running on top of APIs I needed to make sure I keep good track of which APIs I depend on. Here are some of the API I depend on to keep my business operational.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for extremely simple ways API Evangelists can support their developers without rolling out complex tools or platforms.  The latest approach comes from the <a title="Disqus API" href="http://disqus.com/api/docs/">Disqus API</a>, and how they are using Twitter to answer developer questions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 45px;">
<p>Tweet with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23DisqusFAQ">#<strong>DisqusFAQ</strong></a> to get your frequently asked questions answered by <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus">@<strong>disqus</strong></a>!</p>
&mdash; DISQUS (@disqus) <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus/status/227934056820662272">July 25, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Using a #hashtag is a great way to allow developers to ask questions without learning some new system or complex process.  They can simply Tweet out their question in real-time, in a format they are hopefully already familiar with.</p>
<p>As an API owner, you can quickly help solve a developers problem, allowing them to get back to developing.  Because of the Twitter 140 character format it will help keep their questions brief.  Then using the Twitter REST API, you can easily pull, filter and integrate FAQs for your API into your master FAQ list.</p>
<p>Thanks Disqus for keeping developer support so simple.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/07/29/api-driven-twitter-advertising/">API Driven Twitter Advertising</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jul 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Ads.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with my <a title="Twitter Advertising" href="https://ads.twitter.com">Twitter Advertising</a> account, trying to understand Twitter&rsquo;s path to monetization.  The Twitter Advertising interface is pretty clean and simple, allowing me to promote my account or tweets in four easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - I can choose the locations where I want to reach users anywhere in the world, in specific countries only or in specific US cities:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-1.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - I can promote my Twitter account prominently in the who to follow section to users that are most likely to be interested in my account--I only pay for new followers that I gain:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-2.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - I can promote my Tweets, prominently displaying them to other users with similar interests:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-3.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Then plug in my credit cards to pay for the ad spend I setup for my promoted account or tweets:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-4.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>Twitter Advertising is pretty straightforward.  I wouldn&rsquo;t call it anything revolutionary.  But it is implemented simply, making it work for the masses.  I could see businesses adopting it right alongside Google AdWords.</p>
<p>By itself Twitter Advertising makes sense, but when you step back and look at it in context of the rest what&rsquo;s going on with the Twitter ecosystem, I wonder if they are seeing the big picture.</p>
<p>As a Twitter Advertiser will I be able to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Use the Twitter API to truly understand the space I&rsquo;m advertising in?  Track on patterns, opportunities and be able to get at the data I need to make my advertising successful?   If I have to pay Gnip or DataSift for my business intelligence, it won&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>Have access to an API that gives me full access to the Twitter advertising resource? Allowing me to programmatically tailor my Twitter Advertising campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>It just seems like to me that Twitter is seriously reducing the potential network effect by not including the Twitter API ecosystem in the Twitter Advertising program.   Developers could help deliver innovation beyond just promoted accounts and tweets, extend the reach of advertising if they had more access to data via the Twitter APIs, optimize advertising campaign effectiveness with more API access as well as automate Twitter advertising with an API directly for the advertising platform.</p>

<p>APIs are about to enter a new phase, one where developers can easily program using multiple APIs at once, and non-developers can easily introduce API automation into both their business and personal worlds. &nbsp;A time where APIs are seen as a valuable resource anyone can quickly put use, not just as a technical interface only the geekiest of us understand.</p>
<p>Web APIs have matured out of its earlier service oriented architecture (SOA) roots, often shedding a rigid SOAP approach to a more flexible RESTful implementation, increased efficiency by opting for more lightweight JSON over bloated XML, and becoming more accessible with API explorers and interactive documentation like <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, <a title="Mashery I/O Docs" href="http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs">Mashery I/O Docs</a>, and <a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console">Apigee&rsquo;s Console</a>.</p>
<p>Now with over <a title="6,000 public APIs available" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">6,000 public APIs available</a>, there is a need to get more efficient about how we work with APIs, and evolve to where we can truly program the web. &nbsp;But to get there, we have to add a new platform layer that can help standardize the authentication, interfaces and resource types available--simplifying how not just developers, but average users can take advantage of APIs.</p>
<p>One approach is targeting developers with new languages, or extensions of existing languages that can be used to program against one or many APIs, as with <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a> and <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a>:</p>

<p>Both approaches provide a much needed platform to help make APIs more accessible, where one is still targeting the developer community and the other will allow anyone to take advantage of APIs through special automation tools and connectors.&nbsp;Beyond these programmatic and automation approaches there is a third approach to API usage, currently being defined to support mobile application development. &nbsp;Companies like <a title="Cabana" href="http://www.cabanaapp.com/">Cabana</a> and <a title="Tiggzi" href="http://tiggzi.com/home">Tiggzi</a> are changing the way we build API driven mobile apps:</p>

<td><a title="Tiggzi" href="http://tiggzi.com/home">Tiggzi</a>&nbsp;- A GUI mobile application development platform</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These GUI mobile application builders allow developers and non-developers to rapidly deploy mobile applications built on top of APIs, providing new ways of abstracting away the complexity of API integration we commonly experience today. &nbsp;This approach to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/03/rise-of-mobile-backend-as-a-service-mbaas-api-stacks/">API bundling is also being put to use by Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers like Kinvey</a>, who are building in API gateways for common APIs that would be needed by mobile developers--a move we&rsquo;ll see mimicked by other MBaaS providers.</p>
<p>Which of these three approaches reflect the future of the ProgrammableWeb? &nbsp;Will it be an API programming language, an API automation platform, mobile back-end as a service or a blend of them all?</p>
<p>Only time will tell, but no matter which approach get us there, I can see we are getting closer to a truly&nbsp;<a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>

<p>Embeddable tools like widgets, gadgets and buttons built on top of an API are nothing new. A healthy embeddable strategy was behind the success of popular platforms like Youtube, Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Even with this success, embeddable tools often get overlooked by many companies when planning their APIs.   I was recently introduced to <a title="BandPage" href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a>, formerly known as RootMusic, who made a name for themselves by building a successful band promotion application within the Facebook ecosystem, and have crafted a very interesting embeddable strategy. To recover from a recent Facebook platform change, BandPage employed a robust embeddable strategy to quickly decouple their business from Facebook, enabling bands to not only deploy on Facebook, but manage music, photos, tour dates across the web.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/bandpage/BandPage-Update-Once-Publish-Everwhere.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>Driving the embeddable band pages is a robust JavaScript API, which isn&rsquo;t publicly available, but at some point it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;d like to expose.  Calling BandPage&rsquo;s embeddable tools widgets really doesn&rsquo;t do them justice, they have a seriously crack team of developers who&rsquo;ve built a pretty sophisticated platform. &nbsp;Their approach deserves notice, not just for the embeddable strategy, but the way they were able to use it to quickly recover from the changes they encountered in the Facebook ecosystem.</p>
<p>I think a healthy embeddable strategy is something every API owner should craft. &nbsp;The right set of embeddable tools can extend your reach beyond the average developer community, while also allowing your data and resources to exist on any site or platform.   And in the case of <a title="BandPage" href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a> it can also free you from having your wagon hitched to any single platform like Facebook, and open up much wider opportunities for success.</p>

<p>The current API development space is very self-ruled, in that web API developers have freed themselves of earlier SOA attempts to rigidly define and ultimately constricted API growth, into a more grassroots, community-owned approach to RESTful API design.</p>
<p>You can see this happen in real-time on the public Google Group called <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a>.   API Craft was started by <a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/" target="_blank">Apigee</a>, as an open forum for sharing and developing knowledge and skills around APIs, where you can find the latest throughts, from the smartest people in the space. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the online version of <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a>, and just experienced my first offline version of API Craft at OSCON in Portland this week.  Several API folks got together for beers and API Craft discussion at the White Eagle Saloon creating an awesome real-time, face-to-face extension of the online <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a> group--an experience I intend to initiate whenever I am in new cities around the country, and I encourage you to do the same.</p>

<p>I think Apigee has really started something important and feeling inspired, I wanted to share my thoughts on a definition of API Craft.  Deriving from the dictionary definition of craft:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Skill in doing or making something, as in the arts; proficiency" and "The membership of such an occupation or trade; guild."</em></blockquote>
<p>I suggest the following definitions of API Craft:</p>
<blockquote><em>"An online forum for sharing and achieving proficiency in the skill and art of web API design, development and management" and "A physical gathering for discussion of the skill and art of web API design, development and management while enjoying a craft beer and good food."</em></blockquote>
<p>Apigee has started something that has taken on a life of its own, becoming a powerful, community driven approach to evolving the skill and art of web API design, development and management--both on and offline.</p>
<p>I encourage you do participate, and I&rsquo;d love to hear your definition of API Craft, as well as more information your local API Craft gatherings. &nbsp;I look forward to seeing you online and in-person at the API craft gatherings.</p>

<p>I was playing with <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, a unified social API last night. One of the first things I saw, after landing on the home page, were two choices for signing up as a developer--one with Facebook or the other with my Github account.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing Github as an option for API developer registration, more frequently these days. And it makes sense.  Each of my social networks have a place in my life--Facebook is my more personal social network, Twitter my more public persona, Google is my business platform and Github reflects my developer profile.</p>
<p>When registering for APIs and development centric platforms I&rsquo;d much prefer to keep these associated with <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">my Github profile.</a> And for an API owner it makes sense to have developers linked using Github, because of the social effects and interactions possible with code library repositories and documentation.</p>
<p>With two clicks I was signed up for Singly, using my Github, and I dropped into the dashboard where I was given an option to add my first application and begin integrating.</p>
<p>Developer registration using Github should be standard operating procedure for all APIs. Github is the social network I want APIs to interact with me on, and it is definitely where API owners want to connect with their developers, so they can further interact around code, documentation and all the other geeky goodness Github provides.</p>

<p>Web APIs come in all shapes and sizes.   The differences between API authentication, interfaces and data types can be a big challenge when developers work with multiple social networking APIs like Twitter, Facebook and social media APIs like Instagram and Flickr.</p>
<p>Each API tends to run with their own interpretation of what a RESTful API means, leaving developers left with navigating not only the differences between various APIs, but the changes a single API will make from version to version.</p>
<p>Many industry pundits claim this will become unmanageable.  I think its the nature of the web API space, and we should leave API owners to do what they do best, rather than forcing them to agree on standards. &nbsp;Then how will we bridge these difference?  This is an important opportunity for providers to step in and aggregate critical APIs within specific sectors, and provide a unified interface that developers can depend on.  One example of this in action is <a title="Singly" href="https://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>Singly aggregates some of the most important social APIs, simplifying authentication, creating consistent patterns for API endpoints and a unified set of data types to work with across all supported APIs.  Singly pays attention to the differences between APIs and versions, so developers can do what they do best--build social applications, using social data from the platforms their users are already on.</p>
<p>Immediately the pundits will ask, how can they keep up with all the changes?  I respond with how can we not move this industry forward without someone paying attention to it for developers.   I see Singly as a necessary component for the API industry to stabilize and move forward.  Developers needing to integrate with a single API can visit the API directly, while developers who need to integrate across multiple APIs can depend on Singly.</p>
<p>I see opportunities for the Singly model to be applied in other niche areas like location based services, video, restaurants and government to just name a few fast growing API business sectors.   It&rsquo;s clear that <a title="RESTafarians" href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">RESTafarians</a> aren&rsquo;t going to come to an agreement on a single stand, and API owners are busy providing the data and resources they specialize in, so a unified approach like Singly appears to be a healthy path forward for standardizing APIs, creating a more stable interfac for developers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Next generation payment platform <a title="Dwolla" href="/admin/blog/dwolla.com">Dwolla</a> just revamped the home page of their developer center to speak to the widest audience possible.  When you land at <a title="developers.dwolla.com" href="http://developers.dwolla.com">developers.dwolla.com</a> you are given two options:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="I can code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/dev">I can code</a></strong> - You know the difference between Java and JavaScript and just want to dive into our API documentation</li>
<li><strong><a title="I don't code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/bd/why">I don't code</a></strong> - You're a non-technical executive, the master of partnerships and products, and want to know why Dwolla is right for you</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an approach I've been long advocating for, and rarely see in API areas. The best case study I always point out is the <a title="LinkedIn developers area" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn developers area</a>, who provide buttons, widgets and embeddable tools that non-developers can put to use.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://developers.dwolla.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla/Dwolla-Developer-Area.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Why do this? Well according to Dwolla, "One of the biggest misunderstandings about API portals is that their purpose is only for developers. That&rsquo;s just not true. Integrations start with a spark of curiosity, &ldquo;Would this work for my company?&rdquo; Technical or not, who asks that question is irrelevant at that point; how it&rsquo;s answered is what determines the outcome."</p>
<p>Dwolla's approach reflects the core philosophy of why I started API Evangelist.  I'm not advocating just to developers about the power of APIs, I'm evangelizing to the business leaders and decision makers about the power of APIs.</p>
<p>While actually integrating with your API might be a technical endeavor, much of the business decision around using your API will most likely be made by a non-developer.  Make sure your API speaks more than just geek, and reaches as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<p>As we continue to stress over all the news of <a title="API Ecosystem Battles" href="/2012/06/29/the-api-economy-welcomes-its-early-trade-wars/">API ecosystem battles</a>, and how APIs owners are evil, and once a business grows up, it has to choose between being a hobby developer platform or real grown up business--let&rsquo;s remember the <a title="web API pioneers" href="/2011/02/10/history-of-apis-birth-through-social/">web API pioneers</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, <a title="ebay" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">eBay</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> are all three going strong, making money, treating developers as part of the equation and continue to operate legitimate business via APIs for over a decade now.  These three API pioneers set the stage for the API industry during the first &ldquo;dot com bubble&rdquo; in 2000 and Amazon in 2002, and 10 years later still proving you can become an Internet powerhouse with the help of your API developer ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ebay/ebay-developer-program-history.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API skeptics always step up and say they are different, that they have core web products, existing business models, etc. Sure, there are differences, but Salesforce, eBay and Amazon have all managed to achieve success with continued investment in their API ecosystem.  None of these platforms have had to restrict or shed their developers to make ends meet, once the utopian API early days are over.</p>
<p>When I read comments, tweets and other noise from people about what fools developers are for depending on an API, I stop and think about these API pioneers.  Developing a large, healthy API ecosystem is not easy--but when you see your API as an essential part of your core platform, and give it the necessary resources, you can strike the harmonious balance necessary to make APIs work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m closely following the <a title="Oracle v Google" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/judge-oracle-google/">Oracle v Google</a> case playing out in a court of law right now, and more specifically the Tweet stream of Wired writer, <a title="Caleb Garling" href="https://twitter.com/#!/calebgarling">Caleb Garling</a>.</p>
<p>According to Garling:</p>
<blockquote><em>"A jury has ruled that Google infringed on Oracle&rsquo;s copyrights in building a new version of the Java platform for its Android mobile operating system, but it was unable to reach a decision on whether this infringement was acceptable under the law."</em></blockquote>
<p><a title="Google quickly moved for a mistrial based upon this incomplete decision" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/oracle-google-verdict/">Google quickly moved for a mistrial based upon this incomplete decision</a>, and in a statement to <a title="Wired" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/judge-oracle-google/">Wired</a>, Google says:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We appreciate the jury's efforts, and know that fair use and infringement are two sides of the same coin,&rdquo; reads a canned statement from Google sent to Wired. "The core issue is whether the APIs here are copyrightable, and that&rsquo;s for the court to decide. We expect to prevail on this issue and Oracle&rsquo;s other claims".</em></blockquote>
<p>The case is now moving into other areas which include patent infringement, but today&rsquo;s portion is what I&rsquo;m most concerned about, dealing with the API copyright vs. fair use, when Google "mimicked" 37 APIs used by the Java platform while building a new Java engine for Android.  While Java APIs</p>
<p>During this case Judge William Alsup defined copyright by saying:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Copyright protects the "expression of ideas" but not a procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries."</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where I stand on copyright of APIs, I have a lot more education and contemplation to do on the subject.   My gut reaction is concern.  If you can&rsquo;t mimic an API interface, what will this do for innovation and growth in the API space?</p>
<p><a title="PInboard API" href="http://pinboard.in/api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard_in_blue.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One API I depend on daily is the <a title="PInboard API" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard API</a>.  Pinboard provides an essential bookmarking API I use in my curation, which is modeled after <a title="Delicious" href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>.  This is right off the Pinboard API documentation page:</p>
<blockquote><em>"In order to make life convenient for developers, wherever possible the Pinboard API uses the same syntax and method names as the Delicious V1 API. See differences from Delicious for a full list of areas where the APIs diverge."</em></blockquote>
<p>And similarly <a href="https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/reference/v1/apiversion1">Google Cloud Storage API v1</a> is interoperable with a some cloud storage tools and libraries that work with services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Eucalyptus Systems, Inc. To use these tools and libraries, all you do is change the request endpoint (URI) that the tool or library uses so it points to the Google Cloud Storage URI, and your up and running.</p>
<p>This kind of interoperability is critical to growth and innovation in all areas of the API sector.  What if <a title="AVOS Systems" href="http://www.avos.com/">AVOS Systems</a> (owners of Delicious) decided to file for copyright on the Delicioius API, where would this leave Pinboard?  Or what if Amazon copyrighted the web API for EC2 and S3?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.  I only know enough to be concerned at this point.  There aren&rsquo;t many answers right now.  But to quote Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We wanted to build the biggest tent and invite as many people as possible,&rdquo; Schwartz said. &ldquo;You have open APIs and compete on implementations."</em></blockquote>

<p>Acquisition of technology startups by companies is a regular part of business today, providing a way for these companies to get the technology, talent, as well as user and market share they need to be successful. These acquisitions play an important part of API ecosystems, with API owners hoping developers build the next killer feature that users will love, something they can invest in, and developers dream API owners will notice their work and purchase their &ldquo;startup&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Looking back at the acquisitions made by a company can function as a sort of &ldquo;tea leaves&rdquo;, allowing us to interpret the companies motivations, possibly telling us where they are headed and who they might acquire next.

<p>Twitter&rsquo;s acquisitions are diverse and appear to be very strategic. Twitter has wisely invested in search, security, messaging and data storage, while also taking control over mobile and desktop clients. &nbsp;Twitter has made some smart acquisitions out of the ecosystem, and you have to wonder why acquisitions of companies like Tweetie and TweeDeck caused such a backlash, while acquisitions like Backtype, Julpan and Dasient you don&rsquo;t hear much of anything from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I would like to understand other players in the Twitter ecosystem like the firehose partners and investors more, before I draw too many conclusions from the acquisitions Twitter has made. &nbsp;Twitter has already made 6 acuisitions this year, the same amount as Twitter acquired in 2011, and we are only halfway through the year. &nbsp;It makes you&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/03/rumor-twitter-to-acquire-sense-networks-to-target-twitter-ads-locally/">wonder who Twitter's next acquisition will be</a>.</p>
