{% include JB/setup %}<p>Canadas Yellow Pages Group (YPG) launched a new developer ecosystem to support their local search and location based services (LBS) API, YellowAPI.com.YPG sees their developer ecosystem much differently than many other companies, they view the YellowAPI as a direct extension of its core business model, and the API dramatically extends the reach of its business network.Within many API communities, the API owners can often seem distant from developers, or even view the development community as a problem.As a developer Ive experienced the limitations imposed by Twitter and Facebook, and I often feel ignored by Google when using their APIs.</p>
