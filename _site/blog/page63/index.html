<p>I was out growing what I could do with Wordpress, and had too much data and other research I need to link together to show the bigger picture of whats going on with APIs.<br /><br />API Evangelist has always been a hybrid Wordpress blog and custom CMS system system I wrote. &nbsp;Over the last couple months I rewrote my CMS, and re-lauched with 7 new systems:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Blog" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/blog/">Blog</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Industries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/industries/">Industries</a></strong></li>

<li><strong><a title="Events" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events/">Events</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These content systems each have their own database, and are linked together by a central tagging system, and I have established relationships between each of the databases as necessary.<br /><br />v2.0 allows me to store data I gather from around the web in a more structured way, &nbsp;one that allows me to identify patterns and trends easier and also opens up more opportunities for discovery here on the site.<br /><br />I have a whole bunch of APIs, tools, services etc. to put into the system, but I couldn't wait anymore and wanted to launch the new site. &nbsp;If you see any problems, <a title="let me know" href="../../contact.php">let me know please</a>.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="National Archives" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/uk-national-archives-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>The <a title="National Archives" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/">National Archives</a> has <a title="published a new API" href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2011/09/02/247784/National-Archives-releases-public-application-programming-interface-for-11m.htm">published a new API</a>, as part of an ongoing program to get more public records online, according to <a title="ComputerWeekly.com" href="http://www.computerweekly.com">ComputerWeekly.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
     The <a title="National Archives API" href="http://labs.nationalarchives.gov.uk/wordpress/index.php/2011/09/the-national-archives-api/">National Archives API</a> provides programmatic access to over 11 million records from the discovery service catalogue, broken down into a seven-level hierarchical structure:
</p>
<ul>
     <li>Department - Government department, agency or body that creates the records
     </li>
     <li>Division - Administrative section of a department
     </li>
     <li>Series - The main grouping of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Sub sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Piece - A piece can be a box, volume or file
     </li>
     <li>Item - A part of a piece. It can be a bundle, a single document, a sub-file, etc.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Access is provided without restriction or charging for content, but costs $3.50 per document to retrieve the same records online through the website.
</p>
<p>
     Aleksandr Drozdov, architect for the National Archives, said they have been speaking with academic historians to help them find ways to use the API in their research, and they are very interested in access to the archives in a programmatic way.
</p>
<p>
     According to Computer Weekly the National Archives is also working an e-commerce system. Since private companies have been paying the National Archives 52M since 2002 for the digitization of paper records they could then resell through websites, the API and associated e-commerce system are a perfect fit.
</p>
<p>
     The move by the National Archive may prove a great model for other institutions to not only open up access to their collections, but provide new ways to derive revenue from collections, and allow for commercial use of images, documents and other items that have been historically very hard to access.

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API" href="http://blog.infochimps.com/2011/08/30/geo-api/">Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API</a> that brings together geographic data from multiple sources, connects it with a standardized schema, and delivers it to developers through a single API.</p>
<p>When pulling geo data from APIs, developer may not always get the most complete data, but they just deal with it, because we don't always have the time to pull data from multiple APIs. InfoChimps does this for developers, making it possible to have the best data from many sources.</p>
<p>Once InfoChimps downloads the data from multiple sources, they tie the data together, making relationships and connections between disparate data, using the Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS). So no matter what the original data source is, there is a consistent, complete and expressive description of a collection of related data its associated assets.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-geo-api-map.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />InfoChimps doesn't stop at downloading and standardizing access to this geo data, they also tackle displaying potentially large volumes of data. When you look at data from a large geographic region, the amount of data to display for users can very large. Developers are faced with questions of how to group and summarize for display. The Infochimps Geo API provides a summarizer feature that will group data based on intelligent clusters, making the data easier to display, and more meaningful.</p>
<p>Next InfoChimps also provides multiple ways to query geo data, allowing developers to query based upon latitude and longitude, as well as other geographic locators like street address, bounding box or any dimension that can be mapped back to a location. This type of geo data querying opens up a whole new ways for developers to empower their users to discover.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/geo_api_chart.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />Then if aggregating from multiple sources, providing a standardized schema, intelligent summaries, and multiple query options wasn't enough, they are also pushing the traditional notions of what is geo data. They've included Wikipedia articles as sources, and opened up the possibility for tying any data set to a location, using the <a title="Infochimps Geo API" href="http://infochimps.com/apis/geo">Infochimps Geo API</a>.</p>
<p>InfoChimps approach to the Geo API, shows they just get it. They aren't just pushing data sets via an API because data is valuable, like I see with other data marketplaces and API providers. They are actually solving data problems for developers and actually enriching our mobile and web apps with quality geo data, and making a better user experience.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I finally made some time to <a title="write up a review of the new Infochimps Geo API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/09/01/centralized-geo-data-with-infochimps-new-api/">write up a review of the new Infochimps Geo API</a>, and I think their approach gives us a glimpse at the future of data APIs.</p>
<p>With the new <a title="Infochimps Geo API" href="http://www.infochimps.com/apis/geo">Infochimps Geo API</a>, Infochimps provides some very important features for developers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Aggregation of data from multiple sources</li>
<li>Tying together with a simple schema</li>
<li>Intelligent clustering and summarization</li>
<li>Provide a flexible query interface</li>
<li>Allow linking with other data sets</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all problems developers face when working with Geo data, but they are also problems that are encountered when working with other data sets.</p>
<p>The future of delivering data via APIs is not just about providing access to the data via a simple RESTful interface (though that is a great start). It is also about actually solving the common problems developers face when integrating the data into their applications.</p>
<p>I think InfoChimps approach provides a model for other data APIs, and shows they have a viable business model that makes them more than just a data marketplace.</p>

The Twitter Streaming API currently supports HTTPS requests, but will completely discontinue HTTP support by the end of the month.<p></p>
Along with the SSL switch they are letting developers know they will also be eventuallydeprecatingBasic Auth for the <a title="Twitter Streaming API" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api">Twitter Streaming API</a>, and encouraging everyone to use OAuth.<p></p>
SSL and OAuth are fast becoming standards for APIs, and it seems wise to implement with the first version of the API, rather than having to force developers to switch down the road.

        <span class="post-date">25 Aug 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Google-Translate.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />Back in May <a title="Google deprecated the free version of the Google Translate API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/spring-cleaning-for-some-of-our-apis.html">Googledeprecatedthe free version of the Google Translate API</a>, and pissed off a lot of people along the way. I talked about <a title="building your business around Google or any other APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">building your business around Google or any other APIs</a>, and even suggested that Google offer a paid version of the API instead of just shutting down.<p></p>
Today <a title="Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/08/paid-version-of-google-translate-api.html">Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API</a> that provides a programmatic interface to access Google's machine translation technology, supporting translations in over 50 languages.<p></p>
The paid version of <a title="Google Translate API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/">Google Translate API</a> costs $20 per million (M) characters of text translated (or approximately $0.05/page, assuming 500 words/page), and allows up to 50 M chars/month.<p></p>
Google has give a limit of 100K chars / day until 12/1/2011 for developers who had already created projects in the API console that used the Translate API version 2 prior to today.<p></p>
It sounds like Google has decided on a solid business model that will keep the translation API alive, and allow developers to commercially integrate the service into their applications. Google Tranlsate API is now integrated into the <a title="Google API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Google API Console</a>, and is now one of four Google APIs that have pricing / billing frameworks to support them.<p></p>
Google could have done a better PR job by deprecating the free version of the API at the same time as offering a paid version, but I think Google is trying to figure out how to manage and monetize their APIs just like the rest of us.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/mindtouch-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I was just reading a post at Mindtouch on having <a title="conditional documentation using Mindtouch TCS" href="http://www.mindtouch.com/blog/2011/08/22/having-conditional-documentation-using-mindtouch-tcs/">conditional documentation using MindTouch TCS</a>. <a title="MindTouch TCS" href="http://www.mindtouch.com/products/mindtouch_tcs">MindTouch TCS</a> is a social knowledge-base, that can be used in building help systems and support communities.<p></p>
The post made me think about the API space and <a title="smart API documentation like Posterous" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/deploying-smarter-api-documentation/">smart API documentation like Posterous</a>, and <a title="Masherys new I/O docs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/02/mashery-open-sources-their-api-io-docs/">Masherys new I/O docs for APIs</a>. These are all approaches to making documentation more intelligent and personalized to whoever is reading the documentation.<p></p>
<a title="Masherys I/O docs" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/26/mashery-delivers-smarter-api-documentation/">Masherys I/O docs</a>, and smart API documentation allow developers to make API calls from within the documentation, making learning about APIs more interactive. This is a great approach to help developers learn about APIs, but I think we can go even further.<p></p>
Can we make API documentation even more personalized? Can my API documentation know which language I'm using? Can code samples be in my native language? Should the documentation automatically know whether I'm making a web or mobile app?<p></p>
The information needed to make the documentation smarter could be gathered when developers apply for an application key. Then documentation can then be dynamically tailored specifically for each application.<p></p>
Quality API documenation is a huge stumbling point for many developers. How can we make documentation better meet developers needs? Where else can we personalize the APIdocumentationexperience?

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ipad-in-the-cockpit.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I just finished the NYTimes article, <a title="United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/united-airlines-to-give-all-pilots-ipad-flight-manuals/">United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals</a>. This follows <a title="Alaska Airlines adopting the iPad" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/228924/ipad_enters_the_cockpit_on_alaska_air.html">Alaska Airlines adopting the iPad</a>, and <a title="Delta Airlines testing the iPad" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/17/delta_airlines_now_testing_apple_ipad_as_electronic_flight_bag.html">Delta Airlines testing the iPad</a> as a viable alternative to on-board manuals.<p></p>
I don't think of the iPad as enterprise tool. It is a consumer tool, so this type of large scale adoption of the iPad at United, Alaska and potentially Delta says a lot. These major companies have made decisions that tablets, more specifically the iPad, and mobile applications are the future of their business operations.<p></p>
These applications are driven by APIs. APIs provide the flight, weather and other real-time information that drive these mobile applications, and make the iPad a viable tool in the cockpit.<p></p>
The growth in APIs over the last 6 years has been driven by social media and cloud computing, and more recently the iPhone and Android led mobile revolution. A large portion of these movements are driven by a grassroots, consumer dominated user base, outside of the traditional IT ranks. Mainstream enterprise and business IT are just now waking up to the potential of the social, and mobile Internet operating in the clouds, and the role APIs play in this.<p></p>
It shows that the enterprise are coming around, and APIs aren't just the latest trend, and more companies will be deploying systems and devices that depend on APIs, to get business done.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/reinventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">Re-inventing Pearson Publishing using APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2011</span>
        <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pearson/Pearson-Plug-And-Play-API-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>We hear about the struggles of newspapers, magazines, and book publishers to stay relevant in the digital age on almost a daily basis these days. Many of these publishers are sitting on a treasure chest of content, but are unable to understand how to unlock them -- to make the content accessible in a way that allows them to retain control, adhere to existing licensing agreements, and make money in a world quickly being dominated by the iPad and Kindle.<p></p>
For those of us who live and breathe APIs, its easy for us to understand the power of a simple RESTful interace when it comes to content, but for publishing dinosaurs, it is much harder. I wrote a post back in May about the <a title="publishing company Pearson, looking to unlock their content with a new API platform" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">publishing company Pearson, looking to unlock their content with a new API platform</a>. Pearson made good on their promise, and launched the <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Plug &amp; Play Platform</a> at the end of July. The platform includes three content APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pearson/Pearson-Plug-And-Play-API-iphone-app.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><strong><a title="DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/Eyewitness%2520Guide%2520to%2520London/List%2520Guide%2520Entries%2520in%2520Category/overview">DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide API</a>:</strong> Provides information about hotels, restaurants, bars and shops in London, plus insider tips on everything from where to find the best markets and traditional pubs to great attractions for children.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Financial Times (FT) Press API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/FT%2520Press/List%2520All%2520Books/overview">Financial Times (FT) Press API</a>:</strong> Provides access to over 500 articles on business, management, marketing and science from award winning authors who deliver timely and authoritative content.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/Longman%2520Dictionary/Get%2520Entry/overview">Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API</a>:</strong> Rich multimedia dictionary containing over 230,000 words, phrases and meanings plus examples and pronunciations as MP3 and pictures.</li>
</ul>
At first glance these APIs may not seem like much. There are other travel, business, and dictionary APIs available already. But for a publishing power house like Pearson, this is a big move. These APIs will provide a model for how the publisher prepares, gives access, controls and monetizes content for any new material as well as their vast archives, in the future.<p></p>
Take a look at the DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide. You can purchase the guide and other related information on the <a title="TravelDK / London Website" href="http://traveldk.com/london">TravelDK / London website</a>, a model which has obviously proven lucrative for the company. But it is still a pretty limited way to monetize your content. With an API the travel guide information is available as a database, allowing other publishers and app developers to access just the information they need to create rich user experiences on the web, tablets and mobile phones. While the printed travel guide provided a great model for the last couple decades, the monetization opportunities through an API are only limited by the imagination of app developers.<p></p>
APIs shed light, and provide access to content in ways that printed formats never could. Consumers can now access just a chapter, paragraph, sentence or a single photo from content without buying the whole book. Publishers can open up this access, while still maintaining control, and create entirely new ways of making money off entire collections or just the parts and pieces of their archives.<p></p>
I'm always skeptical of larger companies when it comes to understanding how to leverage the power of APIs, but from what I see, the Pearson Plug &amp; Play team has done a great job with their pioneering efforts in this space. They launched the essential building blocks for their API community using <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, providing the basic tools developers are used to when working with an API. The team also launched with a diverse set of APIs that not only provide valuable content to developers, but also gives Pearson a good place to practice when it comes to serving up content via an API.<p></p>
What the Pearson Plug &amp; Play team is doing can't be easy, I imagine they are up against some seriously entrenched management not just at Pearson, but with their network of partners as well. I will be keeping any eye on the <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Plug &amp; Play Platform</a>, and see what lessons we can pull from what they are doing with their innovative content APIs.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/08/13/united-states-farmers-market-api/">United States Farmers Market API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Farmers-Market-Data-US-Map.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I'm always on the lookout for innovative data sets and examples of APIs that provide value in ever-day life. APIs are often a very geeky thing, and I'm always trying to find examples of APIs that make sense to my mainstream audience, and help me explain what APIs are, and the value they can deliver.
<p></p>I found a story from <a title="John Mertens" href="http://twitter.com/#!/@mertonium">John Mertens</a> of <a title="Code for America" href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>, about <a title="building a famers market Api" href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/08/08/farmers-market-api/">building a Famers Market API</a>, which I think tells a great story about how anyone with a need, can take a valuable dataset and make it available using an API.
<p></p>Like many of us Mertens loves getting his fruit and vegetables from a local Farmers Market. He was new to the San Francisco area and was unsure how to find the local Farmers Market. After Googling he found the <a title="USDA web site which has a great web-application for searching for famers markets in the US" href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/">USDA web site which has a great web application to search for Farmers Markets in the United States</a>. It is a great tool, and they also allow you todownload a spreadsheet of the data, but there is no API to build an application on.
<p></p>So being a data geek (I totally understand), Merts felt compelled to liberate this data using an API, which he build using a couple of freely available technologies:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Exported the Famers Market dataset using the USDA export to excel
     </li>
     <li>Normalized the data using <a title="Google Refine" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">Google Refine</a>
     </li>
     <li>Uploaded it to a <a title="free couchdb instance" href="http://iriscouch.com/">free couchdb instance</a>
     </li>
     <li>Added a map using the open-source <a title="geocouch-utils" href="https://github.com/maxogden/geocouch-utils">geocouch-utils</a> CouchApp
     </li>
</ul>Mertens did all this for free. The data was freely available, the tools he used are free, and the hosting of the API is free as well. I'm not sure I'd depend on his API for commercial purposes, but it is a great demonstration how take a data-set and publish as an API, to fill a specific niche.
<p></p>Now anyone can build an application around Farmers Market data using his <a title="Farmers Market API" href="http://usda.iriscouch.com/farmers_markets/_design/geo/_spatiallist/geojson/full?bbox=-122.61248930742187,37.655669842383595,-122.24788054277343,37.83240550745524">Farmers Market API</a>.

Developers have been waiting for the release of the Google+ API, so they can get to work building Google+ applications. While Google did put up a<a title="Google+ developers signup form" href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/plusdevelopers/">Google+ developers signup form</a>, there has been no other word about access to the Google+ APIs.<p></p>
Apparently, todays launch of games on Google+ represents the first wave of developers using the Google+ APIs. Google chose to release the Google+ API to a small number of gaming partners so they could experiment, gather feedback and work the kinks out of the Google+ APIs before releasing it into the wild.<p></p>
It shows they are starting to allow developers into the Google+ APIs, but I am sure they are prioritizing their partners, and unless your a Zynga or a Popcap, I doubt you'll get early access.<p></p>
It seems wise of Google to open up access to game developers first, after the major success of the Facebook API platform was around gaming.

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/chrome-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />With all of the technology available to us, the way we express ourselves online and interact between web applications is still in its infancy. The two most common examples of online interaction are the share and like, which are like grunts and groans in online expression. However they are a very ubiquitous form of showing how you feel about a news article, discussion, event, song, video and many other things we interact with every day.<p></p>
On my blog I can give users a couple of basic actions to interact with my posts: share, link, favorite, vote up and down. These are pretty basic actions in the grand vision of the Internet. Because of the popularity of Facebook, the like has become a common expression for the web. So how do we evolve beyond this homogenized, like based world we've created?<p></p>
<a title="Google and Mozilla are trying to evolve the actions available to us" href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/08/google-mozilla-team-up-to-create-a-smarter-action-based-web/">Google and Mozilla are trying to evolve the actions available to us</a> with the concept of <a title="Web Intents" href="http://www.webintents.com/">Web Intents</a>. Both companies are building this spec into their browsers, but <a title="Google seems to be taking it a step further with their Web Intents API" href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/08/connecting-web-apps-with-web-intents.html">Google seems to be taking it a step further with their Web Intents API</a>. This web platform API will provide the same benefits of <a title="Android Intents" href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters.html">Android Intents</a>, but better suited for web applications. With Web Intents, you will be able to connect your web app or site to a service with a couple lines of code, and the browser will handle the rest.<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/firefox/firefox-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />A web intent based application will let users request a generic action like share or like, triggering this action, and the user is presented with a list of registered apps that can handle the requested intent. When selected, the action is triggered, information passed, and the intended action is fulfilled.<p></p>
Web Intents will start with the usual of intent actions like edit, view, and share, but it will create a framework allowing new types of web intents to evolve. Google intends to build a site allowing the adding, viewing and curation of web intents and their corresponding actions, and build a community around web intents that will create a sort of marketplace of what can actions can occur on the web.<p></p>
This all reminds me somewhat of the online marketing term conversion event. When someone clicks off a Google Ad and ends up your site, you need to define a conversion event to measure if your Google Ad campaign is successful. The most common type of conversion event being a shopping cart purchase, but could be anything like newsletter sign-up, or even sharing a post to Twitter.

Web intents are the next generation of events that can occur on web sites and applications. These intents will often use services provided by other platforms and applications. The web intents will start simple, using what we know--share--and evolve into more complex forms of online expression like altering, mashing up, curation, and syndication.<p></p>
Web Intents will benefit everyone. It will allow users to perform more meaningful actions while using apps, and allow site owners to easily offer popular actions that users want, and app developers can offer a wider variety of actions and services from a range of providers, as well as enabling developers who are looking to specialize in web intent focused web services. Of course Google will be the big winner in this by providing a frawework to grow what actions can be taken across the Internet, they put themselves at the center when it comes to the next generation of actions, that replace the ones we know now, like search.

Data about physical places is notoriously messy, and with number of providers, and the growing value of location based data, its only going to get messier. Factual is aiming to normalize places data across the web by providing a central ID to link individual entries across multiple data providers.<p></p>
Using the Factual Crosswalk API you can retrieve a place by providing its Factual ID or any associated URL, either way you get a complete record from the Factual database, and URLs to its associated IDs and locations. The Factual Crosswalk API can be used to link to data across the Internet, as well as cleaning and standardizing local data sets.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1133424.js?file=place.json"></script>
Taking the lead in providing centralized storage and API for data-sets will help make Factual the goto place when looking for places data, and it will also make them a source when discovering multiple sources for places online.<p></p>
The <a title="Factual Crosswalk API" href="http://developer.factual.com/display/docs/Places+API+-+Crosswalk">Factual Crosswalk API</a> is free for now, and is only available in the United States, but they are looking to roll-out the service for 40+ countries in the near future.

<p></p>Hackthons were born out of the Silicon Valley start-up scene. During these events, companies bring together a group of developers, give them a coding target, allow them to break into teams where they build a plan and hack together apps, mobile apps, and other web services that meet the criteria of the event.
<p></p>Hackathons are now being held in Seattle, Los Angeles, London, Paris, New York and beyond. Other start-up groups and incubators have seen the value in holding these coding events and bringing together the best minds in their community, hoping to bring attention to their event on the world wide tech scene.
<p></p>The success of hackathons as an innovation vehicle is spreading beyond general coding and the start-up community. There are hackathons coming up for <a title="Photo Hack Day" href="http://photohackday.org/">photos</a>, <a title="Water Hackathon" href="http://www.rhok.org/event/water-hackathon">water</a>, <a title="Cleanweb Hackathon" href="http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/">sustainability</a>, <a title="Health 2.0's live code-a-thons" href="http://www.health2challenge.org/code-a-thon/">health</a>, <a title="Open Gov Hackathon" href="http://loqi.me/poll/geoloqi-hackathon-2010">government</a> and I just finished covering <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/13/hacking-education-with-donorschoose-org-contest/">Hacking Education</a>, an event hosted by <a href="http://www.DonorsChoose.org">DonorsChoose.org</a>, to challenged developers to create apps and data visualizations with the its API that would engage the public and have an impact on education.
<p></p>Its exciting to see Hackathons being used outside of Silicon Valley. I would like to see the Hackathon format evolve and be applied to other areas, like manufacturing, real estate, mining, livestock, farming and beyond. Hackathons hold a lot of power in bringing together talented minds and ideas, and creating a fertile environment for innovation to occur.
<p></p>It's important to remember that the technology produced at Hackathons is not always the most important outcome of these events. It's about bringing together the right minds and sharing ideas that can result in people going back to their everyday life with a new perspective and can encourage them to make a real impact in their daily lives.
<p></p>What industries would most benefit from holding Hackathons?

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Code-Value-Reliability.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I've written about the <a title="essential building blocks necessary a successful API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential building blocks necessary for a successful API</a>, and there are other great posts like, <a title="What Developers Say About API Documentation" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/20/what-developers-say-about-api-documentation/">What Developers Say About API Documentation</a> from Peter Gruenbaum of <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/api-documentation/">SDK Bridge</a>.
<p></p>Everyone seems pretty unanimous that a RESTful API, with simple and complete documentation, qualitiy code samples in the popular languages, and real API support from the owner and the community are the ingredients for a successful API.
<p></p>Iparticipatedin a chat about APIs on Twitter, where amix of API influencers, owners, advocates, evangelists and developers hung out for about an hour, answering questions posed by <a title="http://twitter.com/#!/retailigence" href="http://twitter.com/#!/retailigence">@retailigence</a>. Overall there were about seven questions asked, but the second one was simple, and thought provoking:
<p></p><em>What is the most important characteristic of an API?</em>
<p></p>The <a title="common building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks</a> were rattled off (by myself included): REST, quality documentation, code samples, while other said more innovative things like API explorer or <a title="Mashery I/O Docs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/02/mashery-open-sources-their-api-io-docs/">Masherys I/O Docs</a>. Then <a title="@infochimps" href="http://twitter.com/#!/InfoChimps">@infochimps</a> said <strong><em>reliability &amp; usefulness</em></strong>.
<p></p>This started some side conversations and got me thinking. Does the overall value an API deliver and its reliability trump its RESTfulness, documentation and available code samples?
<p></p>I would say definitely, yes! It is true that a RESTful API, with simple and clear documentation, and code samples are a must have. But if your API doesn't offer clear value and reliably deliver on this value, no amount of documentation or code samples is going to work.
<p></p>These are all pretty basic concepts at first glance, but it is a reminder where to focus your resources when it comes to your API.

While browsing around the Yahoo WebPlayer site I came to the Terms of Service, which I found three items that stand out:
<blockquote><em>Yahoo! can update and change this Agreement and TOS by posting a new version without notice to you.</em><p></p>
<em>You understand and agree that the Player may allow for advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Yahoo! to provide the Player for your use.</em><p></p>
<em>Yahoo! Media Player is free, but Yahoo! reserves the right to charge fees for future use of or access to the Player at Yahoo!'s sole discretion.</em></blockquote>
I think these are pretty standard <a title="Rules of the Road" href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">rules of the road</a> that us publishers and developers are getting used when integrating with APIs and deploying gadgets, widgets and other embeddable tools. But they don't give us much build upon, as a content publisher, or developer trying to build a business.<p></p>
I cannot see into the future, and I understand the problems providers face, but these terms seem pretty wide open, in favor of the provider. What can we do to make terms of services (TOS) for APIs and other tools more in support of the community a provider is targeting with these services?<p></p>
I don't have the answers, just asking the question. This bizdev 2.0 stuff is a lot harder than we anticipated.

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2011</span>
        <a title="Office of the Federal Register" href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/government/presidential-seal.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>Each day Federal agencies publish documents in the Federal Register. These documents include proposed rules, final rules, public notices, and Presidential actions. The print-based version of the Federal Register can be difficult to read, process and access, so the <a title="Office of the Federal Register" href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/">Office of the Federal Register</a> (OFR) of the <a title="National Archives and Records Administration" href="http://www.archives.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration</a> (NARA), and the <a title="U.S. Government Printing Office" href="http://www.gpo.gov/">U.S. Government Printing Office</a> (GPO), who all joined forces to launch the <a title="federalregister.gov" href="http://www.federalregister.gov/">FederalRegister.gov</a> website, also deployed an API.<p></p>
The goal of the initiative was to make it even easier for developers to build new ways of interacting with Federal Register data, making it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in the Government decision-making process.<p></p>
The <a title="Federal Register API" href="http://www.federalregister.gov/blog/learn/developers">Federal Register API</a> is RESTful, with no keys required for authentication and responses in a JSON format. They even provide a simple JSON interface for callbacks. All data in the Federal Register is updated daily by 6 a.m., and is published Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, and consists of four types of entries:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Presidential Documents</strong> - Executive orders and proclamations</li>
	<li><strong>Rules and Regulations</strong> - Policy statements and interpretations of rules</li>
	<li><strong>Proposed Rules</strong> - Petitions for rulemaking and other advance proposals</li>
	<li><strong>Notices</strong> - Scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public, grant applications, administrative orders, and other announcements of government actions</li>
</ul>
The Federal Register API is meant to deliver print-based material in machine-readable formats, to make the Federal Register more searchable, accessible, easier to digest, and easier to share withother systems.<p></p>
The Federal Registers, encourages every citizen to become more involved in the workings of their government and to make their voices heard on the things that matter to them, from the smallest to the largest issues.<p></p>
I'm reporting on multiple government APIs lately with, <a title="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/08/01/sunlight-labs-releases-influence-explorer-text-api/" href="Political Influence in U.S. an API Call Away" target="_blank">Political Influence in U.S. an API Call Away</a>" and "<a title="More Government Data with U.S. Department of Labor API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/28/more-government-data-with-u-s-department-of-labor-api/" target="_blank">More Government Data with U.S. Department of Labor API</a>".

I/O Docs provides an interactive documentation system for RESTful web APIs. By defining APIs at the resource, method and parameter levels in a JSON schema, I/O Docs will generate a JavaScript client interface. API calls can be executed directly from the documentation interface, proxied through the I/O Docs server, producing formatted responses.<p></p>
Mashery has <a title="open-sourced a version of the I/O docs on Github" href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">open-sourced a version of the I/O Docs on Github</a>, for any API owner to deploy for their own documentation.

Last year Apigee launched their <a title="API consoe" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API console</a> which allows users to also make calls against an API, and <a title="earlier this year they made it freely available for any API owner" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/apigee-api-console-is-now-free-for-everyone-to-use/">earlier this year they made it freely available for any API owner</a> to deploy. The API console is a popular tool with developers to get up and going using an API, and build an understanding how an API works. Apigees move to make free was a significant market play, and definitely built awareness of their platform.<p></p>
Masherys approach to API exploration reflects an alternative view from Apigees, one that integrates API discovery with API documentation, as opposed to being an entirely separate tool. Masherys move to open-source their I/O Docs on Github, is great to see. I'm sure it will definitely attract more attention to their platform and tools.<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2011</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/junk-drawer.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I had a discussion yesterday with <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>about the infamous junk drawer(s) that exists in every house. That end of the counter drawer that seems to accumulate everything from around our house that we think we may some day use.</p>
<p>Junk drawers possess those small items that hold our lives together. Nuts, bolts, fasteners, knobs, hinges and handles as well as the tools we use to assemble the futon, bikes, shelves and other household appliances. We keep all these items because we don't want to throw them away. We will use them some day right?</p>
<p>We all live with this delusion. I have no hard data on what we actually use from the junk drawer, but we all have them, and I'm sure many of us have just taken that entire drawer to the Goodwill, sold at a yard sale, or worse.....thrown away.</p>
<p>Instead of having a junk drawer, what if we could take a picture of each object with our mobile devices. The mobile app would use image recognition or some sort of image scanning to identify the object. The mobile application would scan potentially millions of parts and pieces to identify this little piece of treasure in our lives. Once identified it would pull all meta data related to it, identifying it as a screw, faster for a futon or drawer handle from IKEA.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15 px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AutoCAD_Symbols_Fasteners.jpg" alt="" align="right" />We could create a virtual junk drawer of all these items. Once cataloged in our virtual junk drawer, we could properly dispose of in a recycling bin, Goodwill donation bag, or items in garage for the big yard sale that will make us rich. No more physical junk drawer. We could access our virtual junk drawer at any time, in an online environment.</p>
<p>When that magical time comes, and we actually need the exact same screw, knob, fastener or obscure alan wrench we could search in our virtual junk drawer and pull up the item. Then we could either find out a local place to purchase, or even better the virtual junk drawer would pull the 3D drawing for the part and have it printed for us at the nearest 3D printer.</p>
<p>Instead of clinging to the vision that some day we will need this part or piece, we could keep track of the parts and pieces that make up our lives, and when this day comes we could actually have recreated, and magically it appears in our lives.</p>
<p>This would make way more sense then having a junk drawer with thousands of un-identifiable parts and pieces, and think of the valuable data you could extract from such an application.</p>
<p>Anyways...just a thought.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.twitter.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>I just finished reading two great posts about battles within API ecosystems.<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/07/convoluted-tos-and-open-apis-w.php" target="_blank">Convoluted TOS and "Open" APIs Will Be the Death of Us</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shiondev" target="_blank">Shion Deysarkar</a> and <a href="http://blog.louisgray.com/2011/07/topify-to-go-dark-as-twitter-claims.html" target="_blank">Topify to Go Dark as Twitter Claims Another Dev Victim</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/louisgray" target="_blank">Louis Gray</a>. I recommend you read, and form your own opinion.<p></p>
I'm totally behind Shion in,<em> ..arguing that the breaching parties (i.e. the developers holding the API key) should not be held in contempt of court, as it were. </em>When it comes to terms of service disagreements, there needs to be more discussion.<p></p>
<em></em>I also feel Topify's pain in their decision to, <em>..shut down the service, rather than chasing after Twitter's continued meandering API road-map</em>. This makes it very difficult to build a business on Twitters API.<p></p>
I am the biggest advocate for the developer when it comes to these ecosystems battles. API developers often deliver on the promise of an API, but seldom see the reward.<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/topify_125.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />However I also feel the pain of API owners. How are you supposed to have an API that delivers true value, is sustainable, makes all your developers happy, and have terms of service and a roadmap that is all knowing and sees into the future, and promises never to step on your developers toes.<p></p>
I see both sides of the argument, however I feel much of the trouble Twitter and other API owners run into, is the result of not properly sharing its roadmap with developers. If Twitter shared its road-map <span style="text-decoration: underline;">earlier</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more consistently</span> with its developers, and also allowed feedback periods before launching, I think there would a lot less backlash--even if the community didn't always win 100% in the resulting decision.<p></p>
How "open" an API owner is with their road-map obviously is entirely up to them. They have trade secrets to protect, and many other considerations when managing a roadmap. However you should identify a consistent time frame in which to give the developer community a heads up about what is happening. Something they can get used to, count on.

Of course there will most likely be partners you share your road-map with before sharing it with your developer ecosystem. And don't forget to make sure to consider the press and blogosphere in this road-map release cycle. The press can be the first to bring up an issue, and ultimately end up being the bullhorn for developer grievances.<p></p>
Also, if your platform has a accompanying web application, you will have to consider the linkage between its road-map and your API road-map. How do features you plan to release impact your developer community? When should they be informed about your companies plans for new products and features?<p></p>
Rather than being polarized about these API ecosystem battles I hear about, I'm trying to put on my product managers hat, and find a balanced approach to solving. I don't think there is one single solution to make developers feel warm &amp; fuzzy about integrating with APIs, and each industry or API sector may be different. But I think many of these problems can be addressed through early and consistent sharing of our API road-maps, which will truly make our APIs more open.

        <a title="PHP code library for the Github Gist API" href="http://codecanyon.net/item/gist-api/410684"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/php-scripts-codecanon-gist-api.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>One of my Google Alerts picked up on something interesting today. A <a title="PHP code library for the Github Gist API" href="http://codecanyon.net/item/gist-api/410684">PHP code library for the Github Gist API</a>, for sale on the code marketplace <a title="CodeCanyon" href="http://codecanyon.net/">CodeCanyon</a> for $2.00.
<p></p>I almost just closed the window, but then thought a little more about it. I think its the first time I've seen a code libraries for sale like this. I've seen more robust integrations and API clients for sale, but never a simple library for working with an API.
<p></p>The <a title="Github Gist API" href="http://develop.github.com/p/general.html">Github Gist API</a> is well documented and there is a <a title="PHP Library for the Github API" href="https://github.com/ornicar/php-github-api">PHP library for the Github API</a> available for free on the site. It doesn't look like it has Gist API support yet, but is well written, and shows you how to exend the PHP class.
<p></p>Seems like there is a narrow window where you could build an API code library and make money off selling it before a free library is available, or is it also possible to sell them even when there are other free libraries available?
<p></p>I will keep watching for other API code libraries for sell on CodeCanyon and elsewhere, see if this is a growing trend. I prefer to just open source mine on <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>, for the entire community to put to use.

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2011</span>
        <a title="Moodstocks" href="http://www.moodstocks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/moodstocks/Moodstocks-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>I was reviewing the image recognition API from <a title="Moodstocks" href="http://www.moodstocks.com/">Moodstocks</a>, for a story on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> today, and discovered another API management story I feel should be told. Its a story about bootstrapping your API management using existing free and low cost services.<p></p>
Before users adopt your API, it can be hard to justify costs around using paid API management services to support your developer ecosystem (because at that stage the ecosystem often doesn't exist). Moodstocks approach to its API community was a great example of bootstrapping API management until you can afford more.<p></p>
For managing its <a title="documentation" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=120">documentation</a>, <a title="code libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">code libraries</a>, <a title="articles" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=122">articles</a> and <a title="FAQs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=132">FAQs</a>, Moodstocks turned to Github for help. Github provides these tools for free, and are great for delivering these API management essentials.<p></p>
For developer support, Moodstocks uses Vanilla Forums for its <a title="forum" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=131">forum</a>, and Campfire for chat support. Moodstocks uses a nicely skinned copy of Wordpress for its <a title="blog" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=123">blog</a>, and has a solid social media approach using Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube.<p></p>
With this bootstrapped approach, it was up to Moodstocks to deliver its own API processes: rate limiting, security and other reporting features. But when it came to management the startup chose a nice selection of free and low cost services to delivery services to its API community.

<a title="OAuth" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=184">OAuth</a> is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data, and is a popular method to allow secure API authorization, enabling websites to provide a more streamlined user login experience with the additional benefits of enhanced privacy and security.<p></p>
The Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit is the first solution of its kind that enables enterprises to control policy and identity aspects of many different OAuth token operations, a capability that is particularly important as enterprises increasingly use OAuth to authorize access to APIs in cloud settings, said Phil Walston, vice president of products at Layer 7 Technologies. By allowing enterprises to seamlessly manage their OAuth implementations as the standard evolves, the toolkit simplifies operations while providing rigorous security and control.<a title="Layer 7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/layer7-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><p></p>
Features of the Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Policy and identity controls to handle HMAC-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signature methods, SAML and OAuth WRAP</li>
	<li>Mix and match implementations of OAuth with SAML</li>
	<li>Ability to drop in new signature and credential methods without changing APIs</li>
</ul>
Layer 7's new OAuth Toolkit supports a variety of standards, including OAuth 1a, OAuth 2.0, SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, WS-Trust, <a title="REST" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=196">REST</a> and <a title="JSON" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/27/api-technology-json/">JSON</a>.<p></p>
Layer 7 will be demonstrating its OAuth Toolkit at the Layer 7 Hospitality Suite at <a title="Gartners Catalyst Conference" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/catalyst/">Gartner's Catalyst Conference</a> at the San Diego Hilton Bayfront, Aqua Room 311, from 6:00 - 9:00 p.m., July 26-29.

</p>
<p>
     The investment will be used as part of a continued global expansion and R&amp;D efforts focused on the company's in-car, location based services (LBS) and mobile applications businesses.
</p>
<p>
     With over 150 industry-leading customers across 8 different distribution channels, a profitable business, and nearly 90 percent compound annual revenue growth over the past 3 years, INRIX did not need to raise capital, said Bryan Mistele, president and CEO of INRIX. However, given new market opportunities including the rapid adoption of our premium traffic services, increasing demand from automakers for global solutions and the explosion of LBS on mobile devices, we're accelerating several investments designed to firmly cement our global leadership position.
</p>
<p>
     The investment by KPCB Green Growth Fund and August Capital show the growth of the LBS data market, and resulting APIs that gather and deliver this data to mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/inrix/inrix-traffic-mobile-applications.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Traffic congestion costs the U.S. economy upwards of $155 billion dollars annually. Last year alone, US drivers wasted 3.9 billion gallons of fuel sitting idle in traffic, and the US is a small part of a much larger and growing global traffic problem, commented Michael Linse, partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers. We believe that INRIX is uniquely positioned to help improve the efficiency of our cars in ways that reduce fuel consumption and improve sustainability for all.
</p>
<p>
     We are experiencing a convergence of automotive and mobile efforts that leverage the latest smart devices, data analytics and connectivity technologies that improve how the world's one billion drivers travel from place to place.
</p>
<p>
     The use of crowd-sourced traffic information from mobile devices, vehicles, and sensors on the road can provide continuous real-time speed, congestion, accident data that can provide a unique understanding of traffic events from school schedules, concerts, sporting events and everyday commutes to deliver highly accurate real-time, predictive and historical traffic information.
</p>
<p>
     APIs are the "vehicle" in which data will travel from cars, phones, and sensors and to companies like INRIX, and investors are started to see the huge potential in this massively growing market.

        <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-tag-cloud-1.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />In the summer of 2010 I was looking to reinvent my career. I was looking for a new direction. Somewhere I could apply all my strengths, and stay relevant and at the forefront of a fast changing tech landscape.
<p></p>As part of this effort, I spent some time considering what areas dominated the past 5 years of my career. Looking at my resume, social media and cloud computing were the two major themes. Then I put some thought into what technology is dominating right now, and will continue growing in the next couple years. The answer was mobile technology.
<p></p>Looking to apply what I know, but also be relevant and competitive in the future, I wanted to find a common thread. What did all of these areas have in common? It was clearly application programming interfaces, or more specifically, web APIs.
<p></p>APIs drove the social media revolution from Flickr to Twitter, reinvented IT with cloud computing, and is a driving force behind mobile applications.
<p></p>I found an area to focus my energy, but do I have the skills needed to work with APIs. What is needed to be successful with an API?
<p></p>I set off to study all the top APIs out there and answer this question. After much research, success with an API seemed to boil down to equal parts technical, business, and marketing. It sounded like a fit for my skills.
<p></p>Successful APIs like Amazon, Twilio and Google all had one thing in common. They had developer advocates or technical evangelists. This is what I wanted to do. What skills are required to be an API developer advocate or evangelist?
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Hacker</strong> - You have to have a love of hacking. You have to be able to write code samples, prototypes and be able to know what programmers experience hacking on an API. You should also be able to push the boundaries on what can be done with APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Business Development</strong> - You need business development experience and an understand of how APIs can evolve businesses and industries. You push to understand how APIs can change how business is conducted, where it can be applied, an how this can be communicated to existing business leaders.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong> - You need to be able to plan and maintain an on and offline sales and marketing presence. Attend and speak at events, able to mingle with both developers and business people, and possess a knowledge of traditional marketing as well as online and social media marketing tactics.
     </li>
</ul>The biggest skill you have to posses is the classic self-starter or self-motivator. There is no well laid road-map to follow, you have to be able to plan, strategize, execute and fail or succeed all on your own.
<p></p>I closely monitor how other players are executing, and apply relevant pieces to my own strategy. But ultimately you have have the knowledge and confidence to define your own road-map, and awareness to adjust as necessary.
<p></p>This kind of experience I've gained from being the leader on several development teams, and wisdom gained from running my own business, including several failed startups.
<p></p>I'm writing this blog post this for my own benefit. To establish a clear definition of who I am, and what I'm bringing to the table, and make sure I'm on track with my career.
<p></p>However, I also want to help others understand this evolving new role of being a developer advocate or API evangelist. There is a growing need in this area, and I get offered an average of 2-3 jobs per week in this area. I'm very happy in my current position, so they all end with me telling them I will refer anyone I know from my network.
<p></p>Which is kind of bullshit, because I don't know anyone with these skills, that is looking for work. Do you have these skills? Maybe you should consider a career with APIs. Let me know.

<p></p>With the <a title="Google Picker API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/picker/docs/index.html">Google Picker API</a>, any developer can build a web-based file open dialog box. In Google's opinion, a web-based file open dialog box should provide a user with a more modern experence:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Familiar</strong> � A look-and-feel that users will recognize.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Graphical</strong> � A dialog experience, with many views showing previews or thumbnails.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Streamlined</strong> � An inline, modal window, so users never leave the main application.
     </li>
</ul>I would add that users need to see, and have access to the content they use most. In this day and age, this means on and offline content. Google Picker API gives you access to what you use most on the Google platform. This makes sense in the context of the Google vision.
<p></p>As a developer Google Picker API provides you display access to a users:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Google Docs (Folders, Docs, Spreadsheets, Presentations)
     </li>
     <li>Picasa Web Folders
     </li>
     <li>Videos (Youtube?)
     </li>
</ul>Since I use Google Docs and Picassa heavily, this will help, but I still don't consider this the next generation of the file open dialog box.
<p></p>I would like to see all of my Google Data (I'm sure Google is working on this), and other sources of data I use regularly. I need my Flickr, Amazon S3, Twitter, Instapaper, Evernote, Github, Pinboard and any other relevant applications I use.
<p></p>Will Google open up access to other services, allow them to register their services, and offer access within the new, web-based vision of the file open dialog box?
<p></p>I agree the file open dialog box is ready for an overhaul. I like Google's style. I think they have the talent and resources to make it happen. I also think they will recognize the importance of opening up access to other services.
<p></p><strong>One last random thought:</strong> When will my file open dialog box give me access to my <a title="Locker Project" href="http://lockerproject.org/">Locker Project</a> data?

Many API owners are in experimental mode when it comes to how they make money with their API.
<p></p>Beyond the fuzzy plans for how API owners intend to make money, even more API owners don't have a clear vision of how they will reward their developers, and share revenue with its API ecosystem.
<p></p>There are examples of leadership from API owners. <a title="Qwerly gives discounts of API costs for high volume API users" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/24/whats-next-for-apis-learning-from-social-apis/">Qwerly gives discounts on API costs for high volume API users</a> and <a title="YellowAPI pay developers for high volumes of traffic" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">YellowAPI pay developers for high volumes of traffic</a> originating from their applications as well as sharing advertising revenue with developers.
<p></p>The <a title="Bluevia API" href="https://bluevia.com/en/">Bluevia API</a> is another innovator in the space with its straightforward business models provided for its development community. <a title="Bluevia lays out four business models" href="https://bluevia.com/en/page/view/menupath/main.gotomarket.sell.businessModels">Bluevia lays out four business models</a> developers can choose from:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Downloads - Earn 70% of downloaded apps that developers publish to Movistar and O2 App Stores
     </li>
     <li>Subscriptions - Earn 70% of recurring revenue stream fees of ongoing subscription of apps that developers publish to Movistar and O2 App Stores
     </li>
     <li>Mobile Advertising - Earn 50% of advertising revenue when developers integrate Telefonica's ad network
     </li>
     <li>Messaging Sending and Receiving - Earn 10% of SMS and MMS that are sent from a developer app
     </li>
</ul><a title="Bluevia lays out four business models" href="https://bluevia.com/en/page/view/menupath/main.gotomarket.sell.businessModels"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/bluevia/bluevia-business-models.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>Bluevia provides a step-by-step process for walking developers through obtaining an API key, certifying an application and API key, publishing to the store, and collecting revenue from one or all of the available developer business models.
<p></p>This type of straightforward approach represents the future of how API owners can clearly communicate how a platform intends to generate revenue, and share revenue with the developer community so that they too can be successful in building businesses around an API platform. It sets clear expectations with the developer community, allowing developers to understand the risks and benefits with building a business around an API.
<p></p>Bluevia's approach to revenue earned from selling apps in a marketplace is nothing new. Other providers like YellowAPI also share mobile advertising revenue, and other service revenue with developers. What really stands out is their clear presentation of solid business models that developers can choose from. This identifies the value of the developer community, and gives them the clear revenue opportunities they need to be successful.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/melange/melange-blue-500px.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />A lot of innovation occurs at <a title="hackathons" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/hackathons-and-contests.php">hackathons</a>. Seems like every hackathon I attend, there are discussion about how to better harness the talent available at these events, and develop a way to track what gets generated.
<p></p>The last hackathon I attended one of the ideas pitched was actually a web application that tracks what gets produced at hackathons. It would track the participants, and provide repositories for any code created. The application would provide access to ideas and projects from any participating event.
<p></p>It's a pretty good idea. I think a lot of good ideas and code goes to waste from contests and hackathons. Evening winning ideas may never go anywhere.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hackathon.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Today I came across a Google project called <a title="Melange" href="http://code.google.com/p/soc/">Melange</a>. Melange is an open-source web application that Google uses to track the <a title="Google Summer of Code" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a title="Google Code-In" href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gci/2010-11/index.html">Google Code-in</a> programs.
<p></p>The goal of the project is to create a framework for tracking open-source contribution programs. Google is able to manage Google Summer of Code programs, and other similar programs with the web application.
<p></p>Melange is part content management system, part issue tracking system, and part customer relationship manager. It is written in Python and runs on Google App Engine.
<p></p>At first glance it looks like Melange is setup to track all the users, ideas, projects and code for a hackathon environment. It might take a little customization, but Melange may work as a platform for tracking hackathons and contests.
<p></p>It would be great to have access and visibility to projects and code that gets generated from event to event, and information about the smart people were involved.

        <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/visually/visually-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />It is hard for me to imagine why someone would launch a web application these days, without immediately launching an API, or at least having plans for an API shortly after release.
<p></p>There always is some data that can be liberated, and make it available in a JSON format. Simple data APIs can easily drive widgets and other embeddable tools, providing viral marketing tools that drive awareness and SEO.
<p></p>So when I am playing with new web applications, if there is no clear API strategy, it always gets me thinking about the possibilities. This happened when I was playing the new <a title="infographic builder and marketplace Visual.ly" href="http://www.visual.ly">infographic builder and marketplace Visual.ly</a> today.
<p></p>There is no evidence of an API at Visual.ly. I see an RSS feed of infographics, but no API. So I started thinking about a simple API and embeddable strategy for them.
<p></p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/visually/visually-infographic.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I would start with infographic and designer services providing JSON responses for searches on the infographic marketplace and graphic designers.
<p></p>Visual.ly only provides tools for sharing infographics. You can't actually embed them, I believe this is how they plan to monetize. So you wouldn't have full copies of infographics via the API. You'd provide smaller representations of parts and pieces, or other relevant visualizations.
<p></p>For every infographic, a designer would create a handful of small images, and the API could serve up these images and all the meta data for each entry in the marketplace.
<p></p>This would open up possibilities for embeddable buttons, widgets and gadgets that anyone could copy and paste, and virally promoteinfographics without actually giving away everything.
<p></p>The Visual.ly API wouldn't be complex to begin with, just allow basic access to infographics and designers, and provide an assortment of embeddable tools for users to syndicate content. A more advanced API, providing more complete access to infographics and the builder, can come later.

The goals was to significantly reduce network, memory, and CPU resources needed to work with Google APIs.<p></p>
Now Google is <a title="adding support" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/07/lightning-fast-performance-tips-for.html">adding support </a>for partial response, and an improved version of <a title="partial update, called patch" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/v1/performance.html#patch">partial update, called patch</a>, to a number of newer APIs including:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google Buzz API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/">Google Buzz API</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Tasks API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/">Google Tasks API</a></li>
</ul>
All APIs available in the <a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> and the <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">APIs Explorer</a> supporting partial response and updates.<p></p>
The partial response algorithm works by supplying a fields query parameter to any API call that returns data, you can request specific fields.<p></p>
Here is an example request that returns only titles and timestamps of a user's public Buzz activities: <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">https://www.googleapis.com/buzz/v1/activities/kinlane@gmail.com/@public?alt=json&amp;pp=1&amp;fields=items(title,updated)</a><p></p>
A full response for Buzz activity would be around 53KB and the partial response is 3KB, a reduction of almost 95%!<p></p>
You can try out both partial response and patch algorithms in the <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google APIs Explorer</a>. In partial responses, the fields parameter is available for most methods. You can easily tell which are partial update methods by the .patch in the method name. Both the fields parameter and the patch method on the tasklist resource in the APIs explorer.<p></p>
Partial response and updates are a great way to make APIs more efficient for devices with limited connectivity, as well as making API platforms operate as efficiently as they can by delivering only what information is needed.<p></p>
Google is in a unique position with the number of APIs they offer, volume of API calls they manage, and wide audience they deliver to. We can all learn a lot from watching them organize their APIs, and apply elements of their approach to our own API ecosystems.

<p></p>While considering this, I keep having thoughts about the perfect API stack. In my opinion, these are APIs that do one thing and do it well, makes a developers life easier, and have clear business value.
<p></p>The first one that comes to mind is <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-detail.php?API_ID=1823">Twilio</a>. When I think of Twilio, I think of two clear use cases: voice and SMS.
<p></p>Voice and SMS are two critical tools to have in your developer toolbox. These are services that have clear value, that would take a lot of effort to duplicate yourself, making it a no brainer to pay for as a service.
<p></p>In an effort to define the perfect API stack, I'm going to start blogging about APIs that fall into this category as I find them. They will be short posts that introduce you to these services, and when I get enough I will launch a landing page showcasing the perfect API stack.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/search-magnifying-glass.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />One of the new features that Twitter rolled out with the <a title="new Twitter developer area" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/07/11/twitter-launches-new-api-developer-area/">new Twitter developer area</a> was an enhanced search tool powered by <a title="Apache Solr" href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>. The new unified search provides an engine for searching across all areas of the new developer area, including the mailing list historical archives.<p></p>
Many of us API owners have to cobble together our developer areas from several tools like <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, <a title="Google Groups" href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a>, and other tools we can leverage to quickly provide communication and support for our APIs. There is nothing wrong with this approach, however one side effect is that we end up with information available in separate silos, making information harder for developers to find.<p></p>
Providing a single search interface, that allows developers to search across all systems, delivering comprehensive and relevant search results can make a significant difference in whether or not a developer finds the details they need to successfully integrate.<p></p>
Apache Solr is one indexing tool you can deploy as part of your API area, but there are also lower impact solutions such as <a title="Google Custom Search" href="http://www.google.com/cse/">Google Custom Search</a> that can be deployed as an external service, without investing in costly equipment or software.<p></p>
Don't underestimate the power of having a single search interface that developers can use to find the information they are looking for when integrating with your API.

One common problem I see, are with, what on the surface appear to be <a title="public APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">public APIs</a>, but once I start looking to get access as a developer, I get walls thrown up.
<p></p>Often times, information about the API is public. I can browse the documentation, code samples and more, but when I want to play with the API I have to ask for access and wait for approval.
<p></p>This is different than a <a title="private APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">private API</a>, where you just want to give API access to a private audience. I can tell these API owners have a good idea, want to open it up to the public, but they are very concerned about who has access to their API.
<p></p>These businesses are concerned about what people will do with their data and resources. They have concerns for their brand, and legal issues to wrestle with. What will developers do? How will it affect customers? Will it damage the companies reputation?

<p></p>What you need is a quality API management platform, with tools for providing visibility into how developers are using your API. If you can't build the tools you need yourself, make sure and check out the API service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, <a title="Layer7" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/layer-7-technologies-launches-new-api-portal/">Layer7</a> or <a title="Atmospher" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">Atmosphere</a>.
<p></p>Next you need an agile process and attitude for evaluating API usage and feedback, then be able to quickly evolve your API to satisfy your business objectives, adding the most value to your brand, while also building a healthy and vibrant developer ecosystem.
<p></p>One of my goals with<a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, is to pay attention to the industry as a whole, understand the best practices for API management and share this knowledge with other API owners so there is less fear and uncertainty around deploying public and private APIs.

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />According to <a title="Reuters" href="http://www.reuters.com">Reuters</a>, <a title="Twitter is preparing to launching an Advertising API" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/twitter-idUSN1E76C1Y920110713">Twitter is preparing to launch an Advertising API</a>, targeting larger advertisers, allowing them to tailor, automate, and publish ads in bulk directly into Twitter users' streams.
<p></p>Access to the Twitter Adverting API, which Twitter plans to begin in the fourth quarter, will initially be rolled out as a test involving a limited number of partners, <a title="according to Reuters" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/twitter-idUSN1E76C1Y920110713">according to Reuters</a>.
<p></p>The Advertising API is a sign that Twitter is pulling together its business model and looking to further monetize its network in the same way as Google does with its Adwords and Adsense, and Facebook with its Ad Network.
<p></p>Right now you have to <a title="submit a form" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/start">submit a form</a>, and talk with a sales person to run ads on Twitter, the new API would create an automated advertising marketplace on top of the Twitter ecosystem.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/Twitter-Advertising-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />According to Reuters, Twitter's advertising API will initially let advertisers automatically deliver ads in two formats:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Promoted Tweets" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/promoted-tweets">Promoted Tweets</a></strong> - Allowing an advertiser to sponsor any 140 character messages via Twitter
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Promoted Accounts" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/promoted-accounts">Promoted Accounts</a></strong> - Enabling advertisers to promote its own Twitter account to other users
     </li>
</ul>A marketing research firm <a title="eMarketer" href="http://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a>, estimates that <a title="Twitter is expected to generate about $150 million in ad revenue" href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008192">Twitter is expected to generate about $150 million in ad revenue</a> through its ad network in 2011.
<p></p>Evolving the Twitter advertising network to a self-service system, and adding an API for programmatic integration, will significantly increase the volume of advertising that runs through the network, putting it on par with Google and Facebook's offering.
<p></p>This kind of system is well-suited for larger advertisers that need to buy ads in bulk and run large-scale online advertising campaigns that involve thousands of different versions of an ad.
<p></p>"They can just flood the system with ad types and almost in real time they can figure out which ads are working, which are most successful, which are getting the clicks at the right price," says Debra Aho Williamson, analyst at eMarketer.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/twitter-monetization.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The release of an API is the next logical step for the Twitter advertising network, but one area that isn't mentioned in the Reuters piece -- and is critical to the overall health of the Twitter ecosystem: where do the developers fit in?
<p></p>Will developers be able participate in the advertising network and share in the revenue generated from advertising on their sites and applications?
<p></p>Developers play a central role in building sites and applications that will drive traffic and resulting revenue for Twitter and its advertisers. Giving developers an opportunity to make money from their efforts, will only strengthen the overall platform, and bring more value for advertisers and Twitter.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/07/16/tumblr-releases-api-v2/">Tumblr Releases API v2</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tumblr/Tumblr-Engineering-Blog.png" alt="" width="260" align="right" /><a title="Tumblr just released version 2.0 of the blog platform API" href="http://engineering.tumblr.com/post/7541361718/introducing-tumblrs-new-api">Tumblr just released version 2.0 of the popular blogging platform API</a>, in an effort to make developers lives a little easier when integrating with the Tumblr platform.
<p></p>The previous version of the API made distinctions between read and write operations and pushed different activity to two separate domains, the www.tumblr.com and the blog subdomain.
<p></p>The new API version consolidates all API access to api.tumblr.com and exposes two major resources in the URI: /blog and /user. Consolidation under one domain will allow Tumblr to effectively measure and balance traffic using DNS.
<p></p>The new URLs will follow a pattern, making them intuitive, allowing developers to easily discover and experiment with the API without having to rely exclusively on documentation.
<p></p>Instead of adhering to strict RESTful practices, Tumblr is looking to create simple URLs that enable manipulation by the average human.
<p></p>For example, to pull the avatar of my tumblr blog I use the following URL: <a href="http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar">http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar</a>
<p></p>The API returns the default avatar image, and if I want a larger size, I just append the size to the URL: <a href="http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar/512">http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar/512</a>
<p></p>In the first version of the Tumblr API, all data was available in XML, with JSON support added largely as an afterthought. Now Tumblr has just decide to eliminate XML, and focused on dialing in their JSON implementation. A common approach for API owners.
<p></p>The new API implements OAuth 1.0a for authentication and they are looking at upgrading to OAuth 2.0 in the neear future.
<p></p>I like how Tumblr has consolidated under a single domain, and I favor their approach to intuitive URL's over a strict RESTful implemntation.
<p></p>The Tumblr API v2 is definitely an improvement, I will see how it sizes up against the <a title="new Posterous API launched last month" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/posterous-from-saas-to-paas-using-an-api/">new Posterous API launched last month</a>.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/07/16/facebook-removes-application-directory/">Facebook Removes Application Directory</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook-removes-app-directory.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Many <a title="Facebook Developers" href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook developers</a> have been confused about what it means to submit to the Facebook App Directory, and frustrated by the length of time it took to get their applications approved.
<p></p><a title="Facebook has stated" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/523/">Facebook has stated</a> that the Facebook App Directory actually drives less than 0.5% of all application installations, with the highest number of installations actually coming from Facebook search.
<p></p>And until now, to be visible in search, you had to submit your app to the App Directory.
<p></p>In light of this data Facebook is removing the App Directory and depending on search for application discovery on the Facebook platform.
<p></p>For an app to show up in search, developers now need to go to the application detail page, and click the Submit to Search link in the left sidebar while editing the application.
<p></p>When submitted, applications are automatically available in search and there is no longer an approval process to go through. When any changes are made to application settings, it will automatically be updated in the listing.
<p></p>Obviously this approach doesn't apply to all <a title="application directories" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">API application directories</a>, but some interesting data to consider from one of the larger development platforms, when deploying your own <a title="API application directory" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/08/a-white-label-api-appstore-platform/">API application directory</a>.
