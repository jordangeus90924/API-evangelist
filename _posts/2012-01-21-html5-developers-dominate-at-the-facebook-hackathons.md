{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just wrapped up two separate Facebook Hackathons, one in New York and the other in Boston. Both events started with presentations from various Facebook team members, demonstrating different aspects of the Facebook platform.After the Facebook workshops, there was a presentation by Jim Zimmerman of Thuzi, a preferred Facebook mobile development shop from Florida. During both his talks, he asked audience  to raise their hand and show which platform they developed their mobile apps on.The breakdown in New York, from my view was about: 25% iOS 25% Android 50% HTML5 While the breakdown in Boston, from my view was about:  10% iOS 10% Android 80% HTML5 In both cities HTML5 was the clear choice of developers.</p>
