One API Iâ€™ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the [Pearson Developer Community][2]. I first wrote about them when Peasron [announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content][3] in May of 2011. Then in [August 2011 they launched three APIs][4]:

  * **[Longman Dictionary][5]** \- The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary
  * **[FT Press][6]** \- FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers
  * **[Eyewitness Guides][7]** \- The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you

After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they [released two more APIs][8] this year:

  * **[Pearson Kitchen Manager][9]** \- Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools
  * **[Nursing ][10]**
