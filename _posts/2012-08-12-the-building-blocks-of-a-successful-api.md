{% include JB/setup %}<p>When I started API Evangelist two years ago, I noticed some common practices by API owners, in how they tailored their API areas, and I started calling these API building blocks.I started a section of the site dedicated to my building block philosphy and showcased what I felt were the most common building blocks across the most successful APIs.Two years later, and after having viewed just about every API publicly available, I have updated my building blocks section, based upon the practices of 1500 of the most successful APIs.Along with this update I have also published a white paper called The Building Blocks of a Successful API.The Building Blocks of a Successful API is not meant to provide detail on implementing these building blocks, but shed light on the common ones used by the top APIs.</p>
