{% include JB/setup %}<p>I gave a talk at API Days in Paris, France this week. This talk was using some of my usual material around the building blocks of an API.As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further. This is one benefit of using reveal.js, driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.</p>
