When I set out to put on an API industry event in early 2012, I had grand visions of what it would be. Getting everyone together to discuss the best ideas, approaches the industry has to offer--while also discussing the critical topics such as open APIs, developer rights, monetization, etc.

Fast forward 10 months, and the event is a reality, and even though it doesn’t exactly look like I imagined, it is damn close--with [lots of amazing API discussions][1].

After I [announced the event has 60 speakers][2] yesterday, I saw a tweet from Dave Winer ([@davewiner][3]):

> A conference about APIs with only speakers representing corporate APIs. Not one open API, so no interop. Lost.[0ox.r2.ly][4]

Now for those of you who don’t read entire posts, I’m NOT going after Dave. We’ve already tweeted back and forth and discussed, and he is supportive. This post is about my feelings and thoughts on "open", and how we can all work together to make sure the industry is as open as possible.

First, I don’t see things as black and white. When it comes to politics, life or the API industry. To ability to snap our fingers and everything becomes open will not happen. It will be a lot of hard work and be very painful.

Next, I can honestly say there isn’t anyone else in the space who is dedicated to open APIs as much as I am. Sure Dave is much bigger name and has more history on this, but this is ALL I do. Period. I don’t work on anything else. It is my day and night job.

I have written constantly about the need for [open API building blocks][6], [open API billing and traffic control][7], all while constantly [asking what open even means][8]? My evangelism has helped guide two of the service providers in the space to deliver the first enterprise grade open source API products, from [WSO2][9] and [Alcatel-Lucent][10].  While these products aren't everything I want, they are a start.

I’m a firm believer in constantly discussing what “open” means. Is it free access, write capabilities, TOS, open source software under the hood, distributed technology, embracing open standards or is it just using the word, as many people feel comfortable with. Through these open and honest conversations, I firmly believe we’ll educate people and change their opinions one by one.

This is one of my goals at the
