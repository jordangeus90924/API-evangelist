{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just wrote about the potential ofopen source API billing and traffic control building blocks, if Google would open source their Google API Console, like they did with the Google API Explorer.I started bundling in thoughts on Google APIs Discovery Service into that post, but then realized it is a separate issue, needing its own blog post.First, Google isnt about to open source Google API Discovery Service.They issue developers of the Google APIs Discovery Service a patent license.I couldnt find any more details tonight, but Im assuming it puts this service in a different category than the rest.</p>
