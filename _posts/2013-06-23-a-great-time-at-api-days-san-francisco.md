{% include JB/setup %}<p>I went to API Days SF yesterday.Unfortunately, due to an unexpected obligation on the other coast I was unable to make it in time for the Friday kick-off.But after my plane landed at OAK yesterday I headed over to enjoy the last few talks, participate in a panel and network with everyone in attendance.I really like the API Days format.Ive done all 3 of the events now including Paris, Madrid and now San Francisco.</p>
