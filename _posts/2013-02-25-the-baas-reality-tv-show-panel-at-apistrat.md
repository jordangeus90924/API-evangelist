{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the lively discussions at the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC last week was the backend as a service (BaaS) panel I moderated towards the end of the first day.We brought together Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of Parse, Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of Kinvey, Marc Weil (@marcweil) of Cloudmine, Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of Kii, Ty Amell (@tyamell) of StackMob James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of Firebase to talk about the fast growing BaaS space.I kicked things off with some pretty standard stuff, by having each person introduce themselves and explain what they do.Next I asked them to explain what differentiates themselves from the other folks on the couch.After that, things started heating up when I brought up a discussion about BaaS pricing, from an earlier online discussion about the mertits of user, feature or pricing base upon number of API calls.</p>
