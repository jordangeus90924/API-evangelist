        <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking through each of the worlds, of my hypermedia panelists, <span>Mike Amundsen (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1mtrwki">@mamund</a><span>), Mike Kelly (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1hBxi4m">@mikekelly85</a><span>), Steve Klabnik (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a><span>), Kevin Swiber (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1oC7Udw">@kevinswiber</a><span>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a><span>), and Markus Lanthaler (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a><span>),&nbsp;</span>for <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft</a> tomorrow, reaquainting myself on what they bring to the hypermedia table, adding to my knowledge, and hopefully sharing some of the findings with you.</p>
<p>As I look through each of the hypermedia definitions, developed by my panelists, I keep feeling, that as API providers, there is still a lot of education that has to occur, to not just helping us better communicate with APIs, but also be more skilled at sharing and interacting around the resources we are making available via APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been brushing up my knowledge on <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/">Collection+JSON</a>, <a href="https://rawgit.com/mamund/media-types/master/uber-hypermedia.html">UBER</a>, <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>, <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, <a href="http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/">Hydra</a>, <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>, <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">json:api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JornWildt/Mason">Mason</a>--9 spearate format that contribute to how we design our APIs.</p>
<p>When I think about the state of APIs, i see that we are barely using our words in our communication using APIs, what we say, and how we are saying it with our APIs, is still very crude, and unstructured. I feel like we are just toddlers, learning to use our words, sentences and playing nicely together. With the rich formats available to us, I feel that in 2014, I think we have to collectively get our butts to hypermeida school, and get educated&mdash;a lot of the work has been done for, we just need to get up to speed.</p>
<p>I see a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">handful of API providers employing hypermedia in their designs</a>, but they are still few and far between.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>), Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>), at&nbsp;<a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a>&nbsp;next week. I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists. This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.</p>
<p>As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. Next up is Markus Lanthaler. I knew of JSON-LD from work I was doing in the federal government, around making government services available, before I knew Markus. I had the pleasure of meeting him when he spoke at <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> in Amsterdam, as well as share the stage with him in Germany at <a href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the outline of my research into Markus's work:</p>

<p>I'm not posting all of this information just so I can share my research, it is also because Markus has an important vision of where we should take API design, and how we should be linking our most valuable data. While I learned a lot through this process, I will also use it as a reference for my panel at API Craft, and for other stories I write in the future.</p>
<p>I've already added <a href="http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/">Hydra</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>&nbsp;as a tools in my&nbsp;<a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia API research</a>. I could spend days going through this research, but I also have 2 ther hypermedia API experts to profile, so I'm going to move on to the others, and come back to my profile of Markus in the future to continue my own hypermedia education.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>), Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>), at&nbsp;<a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a>&nbsp;next week. I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists. This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.</p>
<p>As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. Next up is Steve Klabnik. I've known Steve for a while, and have had the pleasure of having him speak at <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, as well as joined him speaking at <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris. I'm thankful for Steve's work on JSON-API, but I think that his other projects, and his consistent presence across the Twittersphere, and the intensity of his contributions to the Ruby on Rails community, is what stands out.<br /> <br /> Here is the outline of my research into Steve&rsquo;s work:</p>
<p><strong>Steve Klabnik</strong></p>
<p>I'm Steve Klabnik, and I've been a Rubyist for years now. I'm a Rails committer, instructor with Jumpstart Lab, and a prolific Open Source contributor. I think that the web is the best thing that mankind has ever built, and I care about it a lot. As the web becomes more and more programmable, we need to understand how our applications interact with the overall ecosystem, and build great services to power our shared future</p>

<p>I consider Steve a part of the consciousness of the API space, and the larger "API Economy". I feel Steve's contributions go beyond JSON-API, and provide us a critical perspective, one that is not rooted in technology, but our collective self, working to understanding not just the how, but the why of all of this crazy shit.</p>

<p>I like to showcase examples of companies who use their API communities as incubators, establishing them as a sort of external R&amp;D lab that invests in 3rd party developers who are building cool stuff on top of their API driven resources.</p>
<p>I came across an <a href="http://www.indix.com/blog/announcing-indix-api-v1-0-kickstart-program">announcement from product intelligence platform Indix</a>, in my usual monitoring of the API space, and they have a pretty cool program for their developers:</p>
<blockquote><em>Indix KickStart &ndash; a program to help startups and small businesses accelerate the development of product-aware applications and deliver rich product-aware experiences.</em></blockquote>
<p>Indix is looking to jumpstart early stage startups use of the Indix product API. Companies that have less than $1 million in funding and $100,000 in revenue are eligible apply, and Indix will evaluate the startups potential for receiving access to the Indix API at a reduced price point.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to incentivize developers usage of an API, and Indix&rsquo;s approach is one possible way to established a trusted developer access tier, where you can raise access limits, reduce costs, and potentially reducing a new startup&rsquo;s overhead, and their chances of success.</p>

Next up is Mike Kelly. I'm been tracking on Mike's work around HAL for a while now, I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/hypermedia-in-the-wild-amazon-appstream-api/">wrote about Amazon using HAL for their AppStream API</a>, a while back. I'm eager to learn more about HAL, and what it brings to the API design process, and how Mike, and HAL size up against the rest of the panelists, and their offerings.</p>
<p>Here is the outline of my research into Mike's work:</p>
<p><strong>Mike Kelly</strong><br /> <br /> <span>Mike Kelly is a software engineer from the UK. He runs an API consultancy helping companies design and build beautiful APIs that developers love.</span></p>

<p>Mike brings the Hypertext Application Language (HAL) format to the hypermedia discussion. He's been at it since summer of 2011, so he's been a pretty strong advocate in the space for some time, applying his mad skills that are polished at his consultancy <a href="http://stateless.co/">Stateless.co</a>. Let's take a quick look at HAL, and what resources I could find to support it.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><strong>HAL </strong>- Hypertext Application Language</span><br /> <br /> <span>HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API. Adopting HAL will make your API explorable, and its documentation easily discoverable from within the API itself. In short, it will make your API easier to work with and therefore more attractive to client developers. APIs that adopt HAL can be easily served and consumed using open source libraries available for most major programming languages. It's also simple enough that you can just deal with it as you would any other JSON.</span><br /> <br /> <strong>Links:</strong></p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-analytics-4.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of processing multiple emails, as well as coming down off an early morning conversation, all on the subject of analytics. A portion of the conversations are about analytics at the web site, web or mobile app level, and a portion of it was around analytics for API developers, as well as API platform providers&mdash;basically the full stack of analytics including platforms, developers, apps, all the way to the end-user.</p>
<p>Increased visibility into the API layer, and how developers and their apps are consuming API resources, is a cornerstone of API management. There are numerous solutions out there to give you analytics in websites and web apps (<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>), and within the mobile app itself (<a href="http://bit.ly/1rggWl3">Mixpanel</a>), and there are analytics at the API layer for both API providers, and the many developers who are integrating APIs into their applications and systems (<a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>).</p>
<p>API providers, with the assistance of API infrastructure solutions like <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>, have done very well in making sense of how resources are composed through a service composition layer, that includes a robust number of metrics and analytics for both provider and developer. This is great for allowing API providers to understand how developers, and their applications are consuming API resources, while at the same time delivering a subset of analytics for each individual developer regarding their individual API usage. This is great, but if a developer wants more application level information, they usually have to look elsewhere to other tools and services. (this is evolving)</p>
<p>After my conversations this morning, I was left thinking big picture about the future of analytics for the API driven, multichannel, website, single page, mobile, and Iot application stack. I am left with a vision of a tool that can handle all channels, not just the needs of the platform, and its developers, but also bring the end-users in the conversation. I need a standalone, open source framework, that I can use for not just a single platform, but something that could deployed for each end users, so it can span multiple platforms, for a single user, or group of users.</p>
<p>This is where it gets challenging, I&rsquo;m trying to think of this from a users perspective, abstracting away the provider, developer, and even the app, making the end-user the focus of the conversation. I still want to meet the needs of the provider and developers, I just want to shift the perspective, to the end deliverable, the actual &ldquo;thing&rdquo; we are looking to deliver, aka. the human element&mdash;moving the conversation furhter out of the business and geek realm.</p>
<p>I immediately think of the <a href="http://tincanapi.com/">Tin Can API</a>, aka <a href="http://bit.ly/1lEVW0y">Experience API</a>. Ok, I have to admit <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@AudreyWatters</a> made me think of it, after I described the solution I was looking for, she said, &ldquo;that sounds like the Tin Can API&rdquo;?  To which I said DOH!!! If you are unfamiliar with the Experience API, they describe themselves as:</p>
<blockquote><em>...a service that allows for statements of experience to be delivered to and stored securely in a Learning Record Store (LRS)...</em></blockquote>
<p>If we swap out the concept of an LRS for education, and call it a Platform Record Store(PRS), or if we are going to give it to each end-user to track across platforms, we call it a User Record Store (URS)&mdash;basically a online place to store your experiences. For education its an LRS, but for the wider API world I&rsquo;m calling it a PRS or URS, depending on how it is deployed.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you store the data, the Experience API lets you record just that, &ldquo;experiences&rdquo;. You can define your own objects, and verbs (actions), to be taken against those objects. The Experience API gives you a language map, authentication, authority, and many other goodies to make each &ldquo;statement of experience&rdquo; as meaningful as possible. Ok, so you are thinking, WTF is all this? An experience API really? Ok, well to put it in geek speak, its a logging API, just in this scenario we are making it about user experience instead of app, API, or just platform needs. Entering a richer realm of context, and potentially asking much more meaningful questions, rather than just logging on some bullshit metric.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore a little--If I&rsquo;m a platform provider I can track on the experiences that matter to me:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/GET of a /user API resource</li>
<li>/POST of an /image API resource</li>
<li>/POST of a /blog API resource</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the API metrics that API providers are tracking on currently, and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1lEVW0y">Experience API</a> model accommodates these common API usage experiences, while also opening up a whole new world of exploration. I think this new model would encourage API providers to explore new ways of measuring their API usage, and how resources are actually being put to use--kind of like we've been doing for years with API infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>From a developer&rsquo;s perspective, I can now can tap into those platform defined experiences for my account, and use across my apps. This is essentially what we have today from API infrastructure providers like 3Scale. Lets take to the next level, let&rsquo;s allow each developer to define their own experiences, that they can track on and use in their own applications, for example:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>View a users settings</li>
<li>Share of an image</li>
<li>View of a blog post</li>
<li>Logged out of app</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these experiences would be meaningful to the application developer, helping them understand how users are engaging with their apps. This layer of the experience stack would be open, allowing each developer to define&mdash;leaving it up to them whether they wanted to share with platform providers or not. (controversial!)</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about end-users of applications that are built. We could also use this to drive end-user analytics, allowing them to see a report of their activity on any application, or depending on how this whole idea is deployed, across applications. It would provide a web and mobile dashboard like app users are growing accustom to, as well as provide a sort of notification layer, if end-users are interested.</p>
<p><a href="http://tincanapi.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tin-can-api/tin-can-api-scorm-cloud.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>What is important about this model is transparency. It gives platforms, and developers single place to record metrics (experiences), in a way that provides transparency to the end-user.(controversial!) We can also open up the experience definitions to the end-users, letting each end-user define the things that matter to them, and the experiences they want to capture. I imagine, this is only for the savvy app user, seems like you&rsquo;d end up with a lot of ridiculous experience statements, but even if 1% of the feedback was interesting, it could provide an interesting feedback loop about what really is meaningful to end-users. Not exactly sure how you&rsquo;d integrate user-defined experiences into the application operations, but at the minimum it could be a feedback mechanism, and integration is manual.</p>
<p>From my perspective, all of the current API analytics stuff is born out of a very necessary, but technical, and boring IT realm. The experiences we are creating are very database, system, platform, app or resource directed experiences, with monetization in mind&mdash;all while trying to build the most meaningful app for end-users. We need to flip the paradigm, like we are seeing from API pioneers like Netflx, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/17/future-api-design-orchestration-layer/">who are talking about designing experience based API</a>s, instead of resource based APIs. In this way of thinking, the API is designed with the end-user experience in mind, and not blinded with where the resource came from, or how its structured&mdash;it is all based upon how it will actually be used.</p>
<p>Think of what an &ldquo;experience&rdquo; based analytics approach could do for business models, rather than focusing on the few experiences we already know, like how to monetize with the page view, app session, ad view, and add click. We could start identifying much more meaningful experiences to end-users, and yes even experiences that people are willing to pay for&mdash;the monetized experience! <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a> will love that. Reducing everything to a transaction baby! Its my job.</p>
<p>Well that concludes my analytics brain vomit for the day. I responded to my two emails, and had a fruitful call with a leading tech company about the future of analytics in the API stack, and successfully puked up this post. If you read it, I&rsquo;m very sorry, and I hope it made sense. I&rsquo;m still working through these thoughts, but it is a bucket that has been overflowing for a while now. I&rsquo;ll put on the side burner, stir my thoughts around in future stories, and figure out what is next.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/hall/hall-api-integrations.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I saw two tweets from Zapier the other day, where they were highlighting two separate SaaS platforms, who had integrated Zapier into their own platform. Both <a href="http://help.gumroad.com/customer/portal/articles/1579321-integrations">Gumroad</a> and <a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations">Hall</a> took the time to highlight the other platforms they are integrated with. I think there are a couple of interesting items in these stories&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Zapier &amp; IFTTT Integration</strong> <br /> A while back <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">I added reciprocity to this list</a> of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>, because I was seeing enough API providers, taking it upon themselves to make sure their platform had both Zapier and IFTTT integration. Ensuring your API is working with leading reciprocity providers will become even more critical for API providers, as more non-developers are putting APIs to work managing their daily personal, and professional lives.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Integration Page</strong><br /> The fact that hall has a dedicated integration page is interesting. I think it is valuable to show the platforms that an API has been officially integrated with. It helps developers, and non-developers understand the potential that exists around a platform and its API. I can also see the benefit of opening up the ability for the API ecosystem to submit their own integrations as well--you never know it might encourage other platforms to integrate, if they know they have an opportunity to be showcased.</p>
<p>I like how <a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations">Hall does their integration page</a>, and they 15+ integrations, they have a custom option, which is basically their very simple API, allowing you to post messages from your app. Hall doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a full blown API, allowing you to interact with all aspects of the platform, but I still their approach is interesting.</p>
<p>I think that integration with reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT should be default for all API providers. I also think that API providers should consider highlighting other common platform integrations like with Heroku or Github, depending on the nature of your API. You can consider providing seamless integration between platforms, as well as what I&rsquo;d consider a platform development kit (PDK)&mdash;providing open source, white lable code that allows a developer to reverse engineer your integration with other leading platforms.</p>
<p>As we spend more time in the clouds, I think providing seamless integration with other platforms, providing platform development kits (PDK), and employing reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT will become the norm.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/07/24/increasing-the-focus-on-apis-in-higher-education-is-important/">Increasing The Focus On APIs In Higher Education Is Important</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a little biased at the moment, after participating in a <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/07/22/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon-wrapup/">Reclaim Your Domain hackathon</a> with some really smart folks from multiple universities, as well as working on my first white paper on APIs in higher education, but I feel pretty strongly that higher education institutions focusing on APIs will extremely important in the next two years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly working to understand the big picture of the emerging API economy, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">the importance of the government API development phase</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">working to understand what is next for the US government API strategy</a>, while also <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">acknowledging we need the enterprise to continue waking up to the potential of APIs</a>. I think, right along with government, and the enterprise, another importance piece of the overall API puzzle is increasing the focus on <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">APIs in higher education</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The University Argument</strong><br /> If I am making a pitch to a university, I would <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">tell my Amazon API story</a>, and how APIs can open up access to institutional resources, making them more accessible across campus, and externally with partners and vendors. APIs are how startups, SMB, enterprise, and the government are increasing efficiency, agility, and delivering the web and mobile apps that are part of a larger, healthier digital strategy vision. Top universities like <a href="http://webservices.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, and <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/dashboard.action">Brigham Young University</a> or leading the way with modern API platforms, that are changing the way they do business on campus&mdash;take a look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">250+ APIs from BYU</a>, to get a idea.</p>
<p><strong>The Student Argument</strong><br /> If I am making the pitch for why students should care about APIs, during the most formative years of their lives, I would point out that APIs are already touching every aspect of their lives, from the websites they visit, to the mobile phone in their pocket. If your college years are about preparing you for the world, APIs need to front and center in your education, giving you the basics, but also allowing you to peel back the black curtain on the technology that is slowly taking over our world, and establish skills that will give you an edge in your career.</p>
<p><strong>Web Literacy</strong><br /> Computers, and the Internet are part of the higher education experience, and it is increasingly important that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> students obtain at least a basic level of web literacy to be able to operate on the web. Understanding the workings of the Internet, like HTTP, SSL, URLs, DNS, Email, and fundamentals of privacy, security, and terms of service, are essential to the education of every individual. While they may not retain everything they learn, like the rest of their education, it will provide a fundamental base for them to work from the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Domain Literacy</strong><br /> Students today are faced with understanding who they are in this big new world they are thrust into after being at home with their parents, and that includes understating and expanding their digital identity. What is the difference between university, commercial, and government web and mobile applications? Students need to have a sense of what is theirs, and what is a companies or institutions, and understand when some information or content is something they should personally own. Domain literacy is not just about learning about online domains like .com and .org, it is about understanding your own domain on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, or your student information system account, class forums, and the possibilities that are opened up when you are in control your own online domain.</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio Ownership</strong><br /> Every classroom, project and program experience for a student should be considered a potential candidate for addition to a student's portfolio. Contributing to, and managing a portfolio in 2014 is done online, allowing for a portfolio to potentially be spread across campus, corporate and other 3rd party sites, platforms, and systems. Educating students about owning their own content, data and other information, and the opportunities around data portability and APIs, in helping them assert ownership and control over their portfolio is essential to education in the digital age. I'm not talking traditional e-portfolio, I'm talking about defining, understanding, and aggregating the best of what you do online, during your college years--in preparation for entering the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Workplace Ready</strong><br /> Higher education is about preparing students for their role in society, and hopefully part of that is being a positive contributor to the workplace, and larger workforce. Modern web APIs are born out of the most tech savviest employees, developing the work-arounds, and access to resources they need to get their jobs done, and solve the problems they face. Whether it is pulling Census Bureau data, and populating a spreadsheet, or migrating the companies blog platform from blogger to a dedicated Wordpress instance, APIs are central to the skills that tomorrow's workforce will need. APIs aren&rsquo;t always about developing a website, or mobile application, they can be as simple as migrating form entries from an online form, and populating a Google Spreadsheet using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. If one of our goals is to make sure students are prepared for the workforce, APIs have to be a regular part of their educational diet, ensuring that when they hit the ground as part of the workforce, API literacy is default.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Citizen</strong><br /> APIs are already touching every aspect of life from looking for a restaurant on Yelp, to paying your taxes using TurboTax. Not every individual needs to understand the inner workings of APIs and oAuth, but they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">need to have basic API literacy</a>, so they know APIs exist, and that they can get their photos and other information out of a service they use. Every citizen needs to understand the apps on their mobile phone, and the relationship to their online accounts, and who has access to their personal information using oAuth and APIs, and how they can manage these settings. To interact with government, APIs are playing an ever increasing role, and allowing citizens to participate in the political process, access student aid, pay their taxes, and get access to their energy and healthcare data. Let's prepare our students for the future.</p>
<p>In a perfect world students need to be aware of APIs by the time they first set foot on campus. Ideally they are already exposed to them in their daily online interactions, or someday through the FAFSA process, but at the very least it should be up to the university to expose them to APIs when it comes to class registration, student information systems, or ideally as part of the <a href="http://umw.domains/">school&rsquo;s Domain of One&rsquo;s Own program</a>.</p>
<p>My argument isn't just about colleges and universities getting on board with APIs across all of campus operations, this is about faculty and administrations becoming API literate, and exposing students to APIs as part of every interaction. You don't like the student information system or class schedule when you come in as freshman? Ok, make it better. Need a list of students for a class? Here is the Google Spreadsheet to class schedule API connector. Want to bring in your posts from Tumblr into the classroom? Use the Tumblr API to get your content out, and published where you want using Zapier. Let's teach them to solve the everyday problems they face, by applying technology in sensible ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some amazing movement during my last four years of evangelizing APIs, across mutiple industries, and within city and federal government, just by educating a handful of energetic entrepreneurs and civic activists, turning on the API light--resulting in incremental change in the way companies do business, organizations and government operates. Imagine if we turned on a whole generation of citizens, helping them understand that this is the way business is done, and how personal, corporate, organizational, institutional resources are accessed, shared, and managed?</p>
<p>Similar to my efforts on APIs in the federal government over the last two years, I&rsquo;m going to turn up the focus on APIs in higher education. By 2016, I want APIs to be ubiquitous at higher educational institutions around the globe.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>), Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>), at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a> next week. I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists. This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.<br /> <br /> As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. So, first up is Mike Amundsen. I'm very aware of Mike's presence in the space, but after doing just a couple hours of refresh on what he's been up to, I'm blown away by the leadership he has brought to how we communicate with APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's dive in, here is the outline of my research into Mike's work:<br /> <br /> <strong>Mike Amundsen</strong></p>

<p><strong>ALPS (</strong>Application-Level Profile Semantics)</p>
<p>The purpose of Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) is to document the application-level semantics of a particular implementation. This is accomplished by describing elements of response representations for a target media type. For example identifying markup elements returned (i.e. semantic HTML ala Microformats) and state transitions (i.e. HTML.A and HTML.FORM elements) that advance the state of the current application.<br /> <br /> <strong>Links:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not posting all of this information just so I can share my research, it is also because Mike is a leader in the API space, and I want to better understand the role he plays, while also helping you understand along the way. While I learned a lot through this process, I will also use it as a reference for my panel at API Craft, and for other stories I write in the future.</p>
<p>I will also be adding Collection+JSON, UBER, and ALPS as tools in my <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia API research</a>. I could spend days going through this research, but I also have five other hypermedia API experts to profile, so I'm going to move on to the others, and come back to my profile of Mike Amundsen in the future to continue my hypermedia education.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://strongloop.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/strongloop/strongloop-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking through <a href="http://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-js-api-server-announcement/">the most recent API server release from StrongLoop</a>, and I can&rsquo;t help but see echoes of what I&rsquo;ve been researching, and covering across the <a href="http://kinlane.com/about/">API Evangelist network</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> has been front and center for years, but <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> is something that is just now being productized, with a wealth of new service providers emerging to provide API deployment solutions that go beyond DIY frameworks, and enterprise API gateways.</p>
<p>Let start with walking through their announcement of their StrongLoop API Server:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>LoopBack 2.0 </strong>- An open source framework for quickly creating APIs with Node, including the client SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>mobile Backend-as-a-Service -</strong> An mBaaS to provide mobile services like push, offline-sync, geopoint and social login either on-premise or in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Connectors -</strong> Connectivity for Node apps leveraging over ten supported data sources including Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB and SOAP.</li>
<li><strong>Controller - </strong>Automated DevOps for Node apps including profiling, clustering, process management and log management capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring - </strong>A hosted or on-premise graphical console for monitoring resource utilization, response times and function tracing with the ability to send metrics to existing monitoring tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as StrongLoop did in their release post, let&rsquo;s dive deeper into LoopBack 2.0, the <a href="https://github.com/strongloop">open source core</a> of StrongLoop, which they say "acts as a glue between apps or devices and data via APIs written in Node&rdquo;:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Studio - </strong>A graphical interface to complement the command-line tooling and assist developers in building Loopback models.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> -</strong> The ability to script tasks, scaffold, and template applications and externalize their configurations for multiple environments.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS 4.0</a> - </strong>The latest update, for the well known Node.js package, bringing improvements by removing bundled middleware and refactoring them into maintainable modules, revamped router to remove confusion on HTTP verb usage and decoupling Connect, the HTTP framework of Node from the Express web framework. It is also the E in the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, Node.js).</li>
<li><strong>Project Structure -</strong> An expanded directory structure has been expanded to make it easier to organize apps and add functionality via pre-built LoopBack components and Node modules.</li>
<li><strong>Workspace API -</strong> Internal API making it easier to define, configure, and bootstrap your application at design time and runtime by simply defining metadata in the form of JSON.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the few sophisticated, next generation, API deployment frameworks I have seen.  We have had gateways for a while, and we have a new breed of database and spreadsheet to API providers like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>. We also have a new wave of <a href="http://scraping.apievangelist.com">scraping</a> to API solutions from <a href="http://bit.ly/1kNmUGe">Kimono Labs</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>, but I&rsquo;d say <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a> gets us closest to the vision I have for StrongLoop, when it comes to API deployment.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/legos.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve referenced this ability in my stories on virtual API stacks:</p>

</ul>
<p>This new approach to API deployment allows us to rapidly define, deploy, and orchestrate stacks of API resources for use in our web, single page, and mobile applications. I really feel like <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">BaaS</a>, as an entire company, was just a short growth phase, that leading us to this point, where anyone can quickly deploy their own BaaS, for any broad, or niche purpose. I also see my research into the world of <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">APIs and Single Page Apps (SPAs)</a> reflected here, in StrongLoops API platform vision.</p>
<p>I feel that StrongLoop has an important take on API deployment, one that reflects where leading API, web, single page, and mobile app developers have been for a while now. The difference is that StrongLoop is providing as a standardized platform, allowing developers to much more elegantly orchestrate their entire lifecycle. You have everything you need to connect to existing resources, generate new API resources, and organize work into reusable parts, to deliver the web, single page, mobile apps you need.</p>
<p>I am closely watching this new generation of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API deployment providers</a>, companies like StrongLoop, Orchestrate, Flynn, and Cosmic. I see these players being the next generation API gateway, that goes way beyond just providing an enterprise gateway to internal assets. This newer vision is much more directly aligned with the needs of developers, enabling them to rapidly design, deploy and manage the API services they need to drive the web, single page, and mobile apps that are the vehicles in the API economy.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/07/23/models-for-api-driven-startups-built-around-public-data/">Models For API Driven Startups Built Around Public Data </a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-society-2.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had a conversation with a VC today who looking for some information on startups, who had APIs, and had built their company around public data. The two companies that were referenced in the original contact email, were companies like <a href="https://eligibleapi.com/">Eligible API</a>, and <a href="https://clever.com/">Clever API</a>. Two similar, yet very different approaches to aggregating public and data, into a viable startup&mdash;one thing to note, is Clever used to aggregate data from school districts, but now just provides login services.</p>
<p>During our conversation, we talked about the world of APIs, open data, both government and across the private sector. I spent 30 minutes helping them understand the landscape, and told them that when I was done I would generate of list of an APIs, I thought were interesting, that I would categorize into a similar space as Eligible and Clever&mdash;something that was much more difficult to quantify than I expected. Nonetheless I learned a lot, and as I do with all my research I wanted to share the story of my experience.</p>
<p>I started with the companies, that off the top of my head, had built interesting businesses around publicly available facts and data, a definition that would expand as I continued. I started with a couple APIs I know provide some common data sources via APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.factual.com/"><strong>Factual</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.singleplatform.com/"><strong>Single Platform</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.karmadata.com/Home">KarmaData</a></strong></li>
<li><a href=" http://dataweave.com/labs#ourapi"><strong>DataWeave</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Next I wanted to look at a couple of the business data APIs I depend on daily, and while I was searching I found a third. What I think is interesting about these business data providers, is their very different business models, and approaches to gathering and making the data available.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/"><strong>Crunchbase</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://opencorporates.com/"><strong>OpenCorporates</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mergent.com/"><strong>Mergent</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediately after looking through Crunchbase and Opencorporates, I queried my brain for other leading APIs, who are pulling content or data from public sources, and developing a business around them. It makes sense to look at the social data and content realm, but this is where I stop, I don&rsquo;t want to venture to far down the social media rabbit hole, but I think that these two providers are important to consider.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://dev.datasift.com/"><strong>DataSift</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://gnip.com/"><strong>Gnip</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>While Twitter data isn&rsquo;t the usual business, industry, product, and other common facts, it has grown to be the new data that is defining not just Twitter&rsquo;s business, but a whole ecosystem of aggregators, and other services that are built on consuming, aggregating and often publishing public raw or enriched social data.</p>
<p>I wanted to also step back again and look at Clever, and think about their pivot from aggregating school data to being a login service. There was another API that I was tracking on who offered a similar service to Clever, aggregating school data, that I think is important to list alongside with Clever.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://clever.com/"><strong>Clever</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.learnsprout.com/"><strong>LearnSprout</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know both Clever and LearnSprout are adjusting to find the sweet spot in what they do, but I keep them on the list because of what they did when I was originally introduced with their services. I think we can safely say that there will be no shortage of startups to come, following in Clever and LearnSprout's footsteps, unaware of their predecessors, and the challenge they face when aggregate data across school districts.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Data </strong><br />After taking another look at Clever, I also took another walkthrough at the Eligible API, and spent time looking for similar data driven APIs in the healthcare space. I think that Eligible is a shining example of what this particular VC was looking for, and a good model for startups looking to not just build a company and API around public data, but do it in a way that you can make a significant impact on an industry.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://eligibleapi.com/"><strong>Eligible API</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.goodrx.com/"><strong>GoodRX</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.openphacts.org/"><strong>Open Phacts</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I know that there are more healthcare data platforms out there, but these are a handful of the ones that have APIs, that I track on. Healthcare is one of those heavily regulated industries, where there is huge opportunity to aggregate data from multiple public and private sectors sources, and build an API driven business from.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Data </strong><br />After healthcare, my mind immediately moved into the world of energy data, because there is a task on my task list to study open data licensing as part of a conversation I&rsquo;m having with Genability. I think what this latest wave of energy API providers, and the work they do with the data of individual customers, but also wider power companies, and state and federal data, is very interesting.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://genability.com/"><strong>Genability</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wattzon.com/"><strong>WattzOn</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.tendrilinc.com/"><strong>Tendril</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.3tier.com/en/"><strong>3Tier</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>When I was in Maryland this last May, moderating a panel with folks from the Department of Energy, the conversation came up around the value of the Department of Energy data, to the private sector. I&rsquo;d say that the Department of Energy data is in the top 5 agencies, when it comes to viability for use in the private sector, and making a significant economic impact.</p>
<p><strong>Libraries</strong> <br />Pushing the boundaries of this definition again, I stumbled onto the concept of launching APIs for libraries, built around public or private collections. While not an exact match to other APIs is this story, I think what DPLA is doing, reflects what we are talking about, and about building a platform around public and private datasets (collections in this case).</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://dp.la/"><strong>Digital Public Library of America</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/"><strong>Open Library</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://api.repo.nypl.org/"><strong>New York Public Library</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Just like government agencies, public and private institutions possess an amazing amount of data, content, and media that is not readily available online, and provides a pretty significant opportunity to build API driven startups and organizations around these collections.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Data </strong><br />There is a wealth of valuable scientific data being made available via public APIs, from various organizations, and institutions. I&rsquo;m not sure where these groups are gathering their data from, but I&rsquo;m sure there is a lot of public funding, and sources included in some of the APIs I track on.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.dataone.org/"><strong>DataOne</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/"><strong>EMBL-EBI</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just two of the numerous scientific data APIs I keep an eye on, and I agree that this is a little out of bounds of exactly what we are looking for. However I think that the opportunity for designing, deploying and managing high performing, high value APIs from public and privately owned scientific data is pretty huge.</p>
<p><strong>Government Data </strong><br />As I&rsquo;m looking at these energy, and scientific APIs across my monitoring system, I&rsquo;m am presented with other government APIs, that are consumer focused, and often have the look and feel of a private sector startup, while also having a significant impact on private sector industries.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.epa.gov/envirofw/"><strong>EPA Envirofacts</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://data.energystar.gov/developers"><strong>EnergyStar</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/"><strong>Medline Plus</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>While all of these APIs are clearly .gov iniativies, they provide clear value to consumers, and I think there is opportunity for startups to play around in offering complimentary, or even competing services with these government generated, industry focused open data--going further than these platforms do.</p>
<p><strong>Quasi-Government Data </strong><br />Alongside those very consumer, industry oriented government efforts, I can&rsquo;t help but look at the quasi-government APIs I&rsquo;m familiar with, that are providing similar data driven APIs to the government APIs above.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/xml/fx.html"><strong>Federal Reserve</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://cfpb.github.io/api/hmda/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While these may not be models for startups, I think they provide potential ideas that private sector non-profit groups can take action. Providing mortgage, energy, environmental, or even healthcare services, developed around public and private sector data, will continue to grow as a viable business model for startups and organizations in coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Watchers of Government Data </strong><br />Adding another layer to government data, I have to include the organizations that keep an eye on government, a segment of organizations that have evolved around building operational models around aggregating, generating meaning from, then republishing data that helps us understand how government is working (or not working).</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://community.openspending.org/help/api/"><strong>Open Spending</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/"><strong>Sunlight Foundation</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opencongress.org/api"><strong>Open Congress</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are all non profit organizations doing this work, but when it comes to journalism, politics, and other areas, there are some viable services that can be offered surrounding, and on top of the valuable open data being liberated, generated and published by the watchers of our government.</p>
<p><strong>School Data Again </strong><br />One interesting model for building a business around government data is with Great School. There are some high value datasets available at the Department of Education as a well as Census Bureau, and using these sources have presented a common model for building a company around public data:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.greatschools.org/api/registration.page"><strong>Great Schools</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly a fan of the Great Schools, but I think it is worthy of noting. I&rsquo;ve talked with them, and they don&rsquo;t really have as open of a business model, and platform as I would like to see. I feel it is important to &ldquo;pay it forward&rdquo; when building a for profit company around public data&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with building businesses, and generating revenue around public data, but if you don&rsquo;t contribute to it being more accessible than you found it--I have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>News</strong> <br />After spending time looking through the APIs I monitor, I remembered the use of public data by leading news sources. These papers are using data from federal, state, and city data sources, and serving them via APIs, right alongside the news.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">Guardian</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs">NY Times</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/"><strong>Google Civic</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.usatoday.com/"><strong>USA Today</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These news sources don&rsquo;t make money off the APIs themselves, like Software as a Service providers they provide value-add to their core business. Census surveys, congressional voting, economic numbers, and other public data is extremely relevant to the everyday news that impacts us.</p>
<p><strong>Been Doing This For A While </strong><br />When we talk about building businesses around publicly available data, there are some companies who have been doing this a while. The concept really isn&rsquo;t that new, so I think it is important to bring these legacy providers into the conversation.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.melissadata.com/"><strong>MelissaData</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.strikeiron.com/">StrikeIron</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.xignite.com/"><strong>XIgnite</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.infoconnect.com/"><strong>InfoGroup</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these data providers have been doing it for over a decade. They all get the API game, and offer a wide range of API services for developers, providing access to data that is taken directly from, derived or enhanced from public sources. When it comes to building a business around public data, I don&rsquo;t think these four have the exact model I&rsquo;m looking for, but there are many lessons of how to do it right, and wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Weather Is Age Old Model&nbsp;</strong><br />When you think about it, one of the original areas we built services around government data is weather. Weather data is a common reference you will experience, when you hear any official talk about the potential of government data. There are numerous weather API services available that are doing very well, when it comes to digesting public data, and making it relevant to developers.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://developer.weathersource.com/"><strong>WeatherSource</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api"><strong>Wunderground</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://openweathermap.org/API">OpenWeatherMap</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Weather is the most relevant API resource I know of in the space. Weather impacts everyone, making it a resource all web and mobile applications will need. With the growing concern around climate change, this model for using public data, and generating valuable APIs will only grow more important.</p>
<p><strong>Time Zone Data </strong><br />Right there behind weather, I would say that time and data information is something that impacts everyone. Time shapes our world, and government sets the tone of the conversation when it comes to date and time data&mdash;something that is driving many API driven business models.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://timezonedb.com/api"><strong>Time Zone DB</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://services.timeanddate.com/"><strong>TimeAndDate.com</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>What I like about time and date APIs is that they provide an essential ingredient in all application development. It is an example of how government can generate and guide data sources, while allowing the private sector to help manage vital services around this data, that developers will depend on for building apps.</p>
<p><strong>Currency Conversion</strong> <br />Along with time zone data, currency conversion is a simple, valuable, API driven service that is needed across our economy. You have to know what time it is in different time zones, and know what the conversion rate between different currencies to do business in the global API economy.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://www.currencyconvertapi.com/"><strong>Currency Converter</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.exchangerate-api.com"><strong>Exchange Rate API</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In our increasingly global, online world, currency conversion is only going to grow more important. Workforces will be spread across the globe, and paying employees, buying goods and services will increasingly span the globe, requiring seamless currency conversion in all applications.</p>
<p><strong>Transit Data </strong><br />Another important area of APIs, that are increasingly impacting our everyday lives, are transit APIs, providing real-time bus, train, subway, and other public transit data to developers.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/"><strong>Google Transit</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://silverrailtech.com/journeyplanner"><strong>Silverrail</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.commuterapi.com"><strong>Public Transit Community</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://thetransitapp.com/developers"><strong>Transit App</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Transit data will always be a tug of war between the public and private sector. some data will be generated in each sphere, with some projects incentivized by the government, where the private sector is unwilling to go. Establishing clear models for public and private sector partnerships around transit data will be critical to society functioning.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate </strong> <br />While I won&rsquo;t be covering every example of building a business around public data in this story, I think I would be ignorant if I didn&rsquo;t talk about the real estate industry, one of the oldest businesses built on public data and facts.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://zillow.com"><strong>Zillow</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.trulia.com"><strong>Trulia</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the real estate industry. One of my startups in the past was build around aggregating MLS data, and I can safely say that the real industry is one of the shadiest fucking industries I know of, that is built on top of public data. I don&rsquo;t think this industry is a model that we should be following, but again, I do think there are a huge lessons to be learned from the space as we move forward building business models around public data.</p>
<p>That is as far as I&rsquo;m going to go in this story in exploring API driven businesses built on public data. My goal wasn&rsquo;t meant to be comprehensive, I was just looking to answer some questions for myself around who else is  playing in the space. This list of businesses came out of my API monitoring system, so is somewhat limited in its focus, requiring the company who is building on top of public data, to also have an API&mdash;creating quite a blind spot for this research. However this is a blind spot I'm willing to live in, because I think my view represents the good in the space, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where we should be headed</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Open Data 500</strong> <br />For the next edition of this story, I&rsquo;d like to look through the 500 companies listed in the <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/list/">Open Data 500 project</a>. I like the focus of the project from the <a href="http://thegovlab.org/">GovLab</a>, out of New York University&mdash;their description from the site sums up the project:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Open Data 500 is the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies that use open government data to generate new business and develop new products and services. Open Data is free, public data that can be used to launch commercial and nonprofit ventures, do research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.</em></blockquote>
<p>I see a few of the companies I've listed above in the Open Data 500. I&rsquo;m stoked that they provide both a JSON and CSV version of the Open Data 500, making it much easier to process, and make sense of the companies listed. I&rsquo;d like to make a JavaScript slideshow from the JSON file, and browse through the list of companies, adding my own set of tags&mdash;helping me better understand the good from the bad examples, as well as where the trends and opportunities are around developing APIs around public data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that we have a lot of work to do in making government machine readable data at the federal, state, county and city level more available, before we can fully realize the potential of the API economy. Without, high quality, real-time, valuable public data, we won&rsquo;t be able to satisfy the needs of the next wave of web, single page, mobile and Internet of things application developers. I'm also hoping we can work to establish some healthy blueprints for developing private sector businesses and organization around public data, by reviewing some of the existing startups who are finding success with this model, and build on, or compliment this existing work--rather than re-invent the wheel.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend hacking away with a small group of very smart folks, at the <a href="http://lahackathon.reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon in Los Angeles</a>. Fifteen of us gathered at Pepperdine University in west LA, looking to move forward the discussion around what we call &ldquo;Reclaim Your Domain&rdquo;. This conversation began last year, at the <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-open-learning/">#ReclaimOpen Hackathon</a>, continued earlier this year at <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">Emory University</a>, and we were looking to keep the momentum building this weekend at Pepperdine.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of who was present this weekend:</p>

<p>If you are unsure of what #Reclaim is all about, join the club, we are trying to define it as well. You can head over to <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a>, or you can also look at <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>, and the original <a href="http://umw.domains/">Domain Of Ones Own at University of Mary Washington</a> which has provided much of the initial spark behind the #Reclaim movement, for more information. Ultimately, #Reclaim will always be a very personal experience for each individual, but Reclaim Your Domain is primarily about:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>Educating, and empowering individual to define, reclaim, and manage their digital self</em></blockquote>
<p>The primary thing I got out of this weekend, beyond the opportunity to hang out with such a savvy group of educators, was the opportunity to talk through <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">my own personal #Reclaim process</a>, as well as my vision of how we can use <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/07/16/driving-the-reclaim-process-using-terms-of-service-didnt-read/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read as a framework for the #Reclaim process</a>. The weekend&nbsp;re-enforced the importance of APIs in higher education, in not just my own API Evangelism work, but contributing to the overall health of the Internet (which I will talk about in a separate post).</p>
<p>To recap what I said above, there are three domains, that you will need to learn about my current #Reclaim work:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org">Reclaim Your Domain</a></strong> - The project site for all of this work, where you will find links to all information, calendar of events, and link to individual reclaim sites.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">Kin Lane Reclaim Your Domain</a></strong> - My personal #Reclaim website where I am working on reclaiming my domain, while I also work to define the overall process.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://tosdr.org">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a></strong> - A website for establishing plain english, yet machine readable discussions around the terms of service for the platforms we depend on.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the weekend I was introduced to some other very import tools, which are essential to the #Reclaim process:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://withknown.com/">Known</a></strong> - A publishing platform that empowers you to manage your online self, available as an open source tool, or available as cloud service. I&rsquo;m still setting up my own instance of Known, and will have more information after I get setup, and play with more.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://indieauth.com/">IndieAuth</a></strong> - IndieAuth is a way to use your own domain name to sign in to websites, which is a missing piece on the identity front for #Reclaim. Same as Known, I&rsquo;ll have more information on this after I play with.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also got some quality time, getting more up to speed on two other of tools that will be be important to #Reclaim:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors">Smallest Federated Wiki</a></strong> - A simple, and powerful wiki implementation that uses the latest technology to collaborate around content, with a very interesting approach to using JSON, and plugins to significantly evolve the wiki experience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a></strong> - Reclaim Hosting provides educators and institutions with an easy way to offer their students domains and web hosting that they own and control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of two days I was able to share what I was working on, and learn about <a href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a>, and what <a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a> is up to with Smallest Federated Wiki, and get a closer look at what <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/">@mburtis</a> are up to with Reclaim Hosting, while also explore some other areas I think are vital to #Reclaim moving forward. #WIN There were also some other really important takeways for me.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon/reclaim-hackathon.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>POSSEE</strong><br /><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE"> POSSE</a> is an acronym for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. For the first time I saw an application that delivers on this concept, while also holding potential for the whole reclaim your domain philosophy--<a href="http://withknown.com/">Known</a>. I am excited to fire up my own instance of Known and see how I can actually use to manage my digital self, and add this slick piece of software to the #Reclaim stack of tools that everyone else can put to use.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of API 101</strong><br /> During the second day of the hackathon, I was asked to give an API 101 talk. I headed to the other end of the meeting area, allowing anyone who wasn&rsquo;t interested in listening to me, to continue hacking on their own. I was surprised to see that everyone joined me to learn about APIs--well everyone except <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a> (API blah blah blah). I felt like everyone had a general sense of what an API was, but only a handful of folks possessed intimate knowledge. I used the separation of websites being for humans, and APIs being for other applications and systems as the basis for my talk&mdash;showing how websites return HTML for displaying to humans, and APIs return JSON meant to be used by applications. Later in the day I also wrote a little PHP script which made a call to an API (well JSON file), then displayed bulleted list of results, to help show how APIs can drive website content. Once again I am reminded of the importance of API 101 demos, and how I need to focus more in this area.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Github 101</strong><br /> One of the topics we covered was the basics of using Github. I walked through the basic concepts that surround Github usage like repositories, forks, commits, pull requests&mdash;demonstrating how multiple users can collaborate, and work together on not just code, but content. I demonstrated how issues, and milestones can also be used to manage conversation around the project, in addition to work with repository files. Lastly, I walked through Github Pages, and how using a separate branch, you can publish HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON for projects, turning Github into not just a code and content management platform, but also a publishing endpoint.</p>
<p><strong>APIs.json Playing a Role in #Reclaim</strong><br /> After hearing <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a> talk about how Reclaim Hosting aggregates domain users within each university, I brought up <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and how I&rsquo;m using this as a index for APIs in both the public and private sector. While it may not be something that is in the immediate roadmap for #Reclaim, I think APIs.json will play a significant role in #Reclaim process down the road, and is worth noting here.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon/kin-lan-reclaim-hackathon-la.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Containerization Movement</strong><br /> One pattern I saw across the Reclaim Hosting and Domain of One&rsquo;s Own work from <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/">@mburtis</a>, is that they are mimicking what is currently happening in the <a href="https://twitter.com/docker">@docker</a> dominated containerization movement we are seeing from tech leaders like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Red Hat. Then only difference is Reclaim Hosting is doing it as apps that can be deployed across a known set of domains, spanning physical servers, within a particular institution. Containers offer portability for the #Reclaim lifecycle, for when students leave institutions, as well as for the wider public space, when people are looking to #Reclaim their digital self.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of APIs in Higher Ed</strong><br /> APIs are central to everything about #Reclaim. It is how users will take control over their digital self, driving solutions like Known. With #Reclaim being born, and propagated via universities, the API stakes are raised across higher education. Universities need to adopt an API way of life, to drive all aspects of campus operations, but also to expose all students to the concept of APIs, making part of the university experience--teaching students to #Reclaim their own course schedule, student data, and other portfolio, and other aspects of the campus experience. Universities are ground zero, when it comes to exposing the next generation of corporate employees, government workers, and #Reclaim informed citizens--we have a lot of work to do to get insitutions up to speed.</p>
<p><strong>Evolving the Hackathon Format</strong><br /> The Reclaim Your Domain LA Hackathon has moved forward the hackathon definition for me. There were no applications built over the weekend, and there were no prizes given away to winners, but there was significant movement that will live beyond just this single event&mdash;something that the previous definition of hackathon didn&rsquo;t possess for me. Fifteen of us came together Friday night for food and drink at <a href="https://twitter.com/amichaelberman">@amichaelberman</a> house. Saturday morning we came together at Pepperdine and spent the day working through ideas and tool demonstrations, which included a lot of open discussion. Saturday night we came together at our house in Hermosa Beach, where we drank, continued conversations from the day, and Jazzercised on the roof until wee hours of the morning. Then Sunday we came together for breakfast, and went back to work at Pepperdine for the rest of the day. Once done, some folks headed to airport, and the rest of headed back to Hermosa Beach for dinner, more drinks, and conversation until late in the evening.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon/reclaim-hackathon-beers.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Over the two days, there was plenty of hacking, setting up Known and Smallest Federated Wiki, as part of Reclaim Your Domain. Most attendees got to work on their #Reclaim definitions, and POSSEE workflow using Known, and learned how to generate API keys, commit to Github, and other essential #Reclaim tasks. At many other hackathons I&rsquo;ve been to, there were tangible projects that came out of the event, but were always abandoned after the short weekend. #Reclaim didn&rsquo;t produce any single startup or application, but deployed and evolved on top of existing work, and processes, that will continue long after this single event, and will continue to build momentum with each event we do--capturing much more of the exhaust from a weekend hackathon.</p>
<p><strong>The Time Is Right For #Reclaim</strong><br /> I feel #Reclaim is in motion, and there is no stopping it now. Each of the three events I&rsquo;ve done, have been extremely fruitful, and the ideas, conversation, and code just flows. I see signs across the Internet, that some people are beginning to care more about about their digital self, in light of exploitation from government, and technology companies. It is not an accident that this movement is coming out of higher education institutions, and will continue to spread, and build momentum at universities. The time is right for #Reclaim, I can feel it.</p>

        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ws"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sendgrid/sendgrid-will-smidlein+.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the API space it is easy to recognize the cool kids, the ones that are in the know. These types of personalities just understand how to get things done, don't take no for an answer, and understand the DIY, self-service nature of APIs.</p>
<p>I get a lot of folks who ask me to add them to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API Management provider section</a>, or my <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">API Integration area</a>. I always add these people to my Evernote queue, and when I get time I go through and profile them, I add them to my master CRM, and when I publish the latest round of content and data to the <a href="http://kinlane.com/about/">API Evangelist network</a> site in question, the blog post, or company listing will be updated&mdash;something that can take minutes or weeks, depending on my workload.</p>
<p>In contrast, the savvy people in the space, understand that the API Evangelist network runs on Github, as <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ separate research projects</a>, and that they can add themselves. All you do is fork the project you want to update, add yourself to the blog post, or the JSON file that drives the data listing, and submit a pull request. I don&rsquo;t always guarantee I will accept your addition, but if it is correct, and brings value to the API community, there is a good chance I will.</p>
<p>I just finished publishing a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/17/it-takes-a-team-of-evangelists-to-raise-an-api/">list of all of the SendGrid developer evangelists</a>, and I mistakenly left off Will Smidlein (<a href="https://twitter.com/ws">@ws</a>), one of the SendGrid developer evangelists. Will, being one of the cool kids, didn&rsquo;t ask, he just forked API Evangelist, added himself to the list, and submitted a pull request. Minutes later, he&rsquo;s on the blog, listed correctly as one of the evangelist.</p>
<p>I wonder how long it will take for more of my audience to realize they can help curate, and publish to API Evangelist, right alongside me--it has been this way since January of 2013. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m loving about where the API space is going, is the simplicity, and remixability of available API resources, when they are defined with machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>.  An example of this, can be found in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">my recent work to make federal government APIs more discoverable</a>.</p>
<p>I generated machine readable API definitions using Swagger, for four separate APIs out of the GSA. The APIs were spread across two separate domains:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">usa.gov</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/">explore.data.gov</a>. You can follow the details of research, at each of the project repositories, but as I continue with my work, I keep thinking about the power that having a machine readable definition for all four of these APIs, and my ability to now remix these simple, and powerful API resources into <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">virtual stacks</a>. After I work my way through the 120 government APIs I have targeted, I will have an amazing index of government API resources to compose from.</p>
<p>My vision around all of this goes beyond just <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, and finding government APIs. I want to make it so we can compose virtual stacks of API resources, that can be used in different scenarios. If you are building a public engagement app for an election, you can assemble exactly the API resources your developers will need, aggregate them using their API definition, into a single developer area&mdash;even though the APIs may span multiple federal agency developer areas.</p>
<p>In this scenario, developers don't have to go find all the API resources they need, an architect, or API lead can aggregate everything into a one-stop-shop for what the developers will need. This evolution in API delivery makes me very happy, right up until I come up against the current state of on-boarding with APIs, to get the credentials you need to use the API resource. In this particular scenario, you would have to sign up for an account with 10 or 20 separate agencies, or outside groups&mdash;stripping away any benefits gained through the remixing and aggregation of APIs.</p>
<p>How do we solve API consumer access for the API economy? I know that API providers like Mashape, and Mashery have tried to solve with their platforms. These touch on the problem, but are providing very siloed solutions--I feel we need one that works for API consumers who are using many APIs, across many providers, in an adhoc manner. As a lead architect for a mobile project, I shouldn't have to spend hours signing up my application across many different API consumer accounts.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json specification</a>, we encourage API providers to include a link to their signup page, but this is just a link. Eventually we need a machine readable API registration flow, where trusted developers can ping, receive authentication instructions, and easily obtain keys to use an API resource. I&rsquo;m sure there are legacy SOA scenarios my readers will school me on, and I&rsquo;m hoping to also learn about any existing standards available that address this. My motivation here, is to push my understanding of what is available, and hopefully jump start a conversation with API providers, about any viable solutions to authenticating across multiple APIs as seamlessly as possible, when you are developing distributed apps.</p>

<p>There are a lot of lessons to be learned from the leaders of the API space, pioneers like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> and <a href="http://sendgrid.com/team">SendGrid</a>, when it comes to running our own API programs. Fortunately for the community, most of the leading API providers are willing to share their experience and wisdom with us, such as SendGrid, with their latest series<a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/tips-tricks-beginner-developer-evangelist-part-2/"> Tips and Tricks for a Beginner Developer Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p>The blog series delivers some great API evangelism wisdom, from the mouths of evangelists, who are in the trenches, getting the word out about the email API platform, and supporting its large ecosystem of application developers. I'll let you read the tips from the SendGrid team, what I thought was interesting, was the makeup of their evangelist team.</p>
<p>You have two managers leading the charge:</p>

<p>I think the blog series from SendGrid is a look into, what it takes to run a successful API evangelism campaign. I&rsquo;ve had multiple conversations in the last couple days with API providers who are just now beginning to build their API teams, and were looking for on advice on who to hire, and how to grow and train their evangelists.</p>
<p>To anyone who is just now constructing their API team, follow the SendGrid <a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SendGrid">Twitter accoun</a>t, then follow each of the SendGrid evangelist team on Twitter&mdash;they produce a lot of great content, that will help you understand what API evangelism success will look like. You can also follow the lead of Tim and Brandon, in how they have developed the team of evangelists, and the amount of resources they are investing in the success of the SendGrid API.</p>
<p>There is not a single API program I know of that is doing evangelism perfectly, but when you pay attention to the leading providers, there are endless things you can pick up, by watching them in action&mdash;both good and bad.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. </strong>- Every API provider should consider diversity diversity when organizing their teams.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/creative-commons/cc.logo.large.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When we first conceived <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, we were a little fuzzy about which of Creative Commons licenses API providers should apply to their API definitions. As long as a provider took a stance on API copyright around your API definitions, applied a Creative Commons license, we considered an API &ldquo;in the commons&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As time has evolved, and we've had time to reflect on the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dangerous-ruling-oracle-v-google-federal-circuit-reverses-sensible-lower-court">decision that the Federal Circuit Court handed down in the Oracle v Google case</a>, we've adjusted our vision of what Creative Commons licenses should &nbsp;be applied to an API, and still be considered as part of the "API Commons".</p>
<p>Moving forward the API Commons will accept two types of Creative Commons license:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a></strong> - At a minimum we want API designers to be recognized for their work, and other designers to recognize original authorship when relevant.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a></strong> - Ideally all API designers put their API definitions into the public domain, and wave all their copyright around API designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel pretty strongly that API definitions have to remain openly licensed, re-usable, even for commercial purposes. In a perfect world we wouldn't have to apply copyright at all, but in light of the Oracle v Google case we should take a proactive stance, and apply the copyright license that make the most sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> acknowledges the rights of API designers to recognized for their works, but strongly believe that for the API economy to grow and flourish, API definitions have to be re-usable, shareable and interoperable&mdash;publish your APIs into the API Commons today.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://tosdr.org/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service-didnt-read/tos-didnt-read-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated by the <a href="http://tosdr.org/index.html">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a> project. i&rsquo;m on the mailing list, and try to make time to stay in tune, but have yet to ever contribute any bandwidth to the EXTREMELY important project, around making sense of the crazy terms of services (TOS), that we agree to in our daily lives.</p>
<p>I finally found myself at a point where I'm forced to start paying more attention to API terms of service, and hopefully will be able to slice off a little bit of dedicated bandwidth to Terms of Service; Didn&rsquo;t Read. I have two projects that have floated up on my list, and deserve some priority attention.</p>
<p>First I&rsquo;m applying the TOS Didn't Read work to a side project of mine called <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a>, which is a project to help me define my digital self, and reclaim some of the content, data and other value I generate on a daily basis online. I&rsquo;m hoping TOS Didn't Read will provide a machine readable moral backbone to the #Reclaim process&mdash;which is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;m looking to build on the TOS Didn't Read work, and apply further to the world of APIs, by defining another one of the machine readable <a href="http://apisjson.org">API.json</a> properties. The first of which are machine readable properties like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger API definitions, and the <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest, which allows you to reference the copyright for a specific API interface.</p>
<p>I want to build on the work TOS Didn&rsquo;t Read has done, apply their tracking and ranking system of online services, to the APIs that I monitor. Using APIs.json I want to encourage API providers to publish this machine readable index of their available APIs, allowing them to be indexed by API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Then, as part of each APIs.json I want to help API providers understand the benefits of machine readable API definitions, API copyright declarations, and API terms of service (TOS). I know, that is a pretty tall order, but I think it can be done.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>TOS Didn't Read provides me with a wealth of topics, and detailed points to apply when evaluating API provider&rsquo;s terms of service&mdash;which is an excellent foundation to build on top of. I've forked the <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org">TOS Didn't Read repository</a>, as part of the APIs.json organization, and will be establishing a supporting project for defining what a machine readable terms of service file might look like. I think I will call this project Terms of Service; Machine Readable, or TOS;MR.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide a meaningful list of questions (TOS;DR topics &amp; points), that we can use to quantify API providers. I want to enable API providers to answer these questions, and publish a machine readable list of relevant topics somewhere in their domain, and include as a property in their APIs.json file.</p>
<p>Ok, I have a lot of work. Luckily I'm not entirely re-inventing the wheel here. I&rsquo;m building on the existing work of TOS Didn't read, but applying specifically to APIs, and connecting it to my existing API discovery work with APIs.json.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zapier-google-docs-api-spark.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring different ways that APIs can be deployed, with an emphasis on deployment by non-developers. There are numerous cloud services available, that allow non-developers to execute common business tasks like registration forms, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/surveymonkey/google-docs/18382/surveymonkey-new-response-to-google-docs-create-spreadsheet-row/">surveys</a>, payments, and product sales, and when you combine these business functions with <a href="https://zapier.com/app/dashboard">Zapier</a>, Google Docs and <a href="https://apispark.com/">APISpark</a>&mdash;you can deploy an API, no code skills required.</p>
<p>This story begins with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/30/deploy-an-api-from-a-google-spreadsheet-using-apispark/">ability to deploy an API from any Google Spreadsheet using APISpark</a>, putting API deployment within the grasp of the average business user. Next, I want the easiest possible way to get data, from multiple sources, into a Google Spreadsheet? Answer: <a href="https://zapier.com/app/dashboard">Zapier</a> (or <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">other reciprocity provider</a>, like <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>). &nbsp;To support this, I started looking through the numerous Zapier recipes, that allow my me to publish results to a Google Spreadsheet&mdash;there are 167!</p>
<p>The most obvious <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/twitter/google-docs/4396/add-tweets-to-google-docs-row/">data source I see is Twitter</a>. Everyone time there is a Tweet from specific user, or from a specific Twitter search, you can have it published to a Google Spreadsheet, and when you have that spreadsheet connected to an APISpark API, the results will be automatically available via API.</p>
<p>The second most common source of data I see, would be cloud based forms. I see providers like <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/wufoo/google-docs/4905/save-wufoo-entry-to-google-docs-row/">Wufoo</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/gravity-forms/google-docs/16647/save-gravity-forms-submission-to-google-spreadsheet/">Gravity Forms</a>, and <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/jotform/google-docs/3379/add-jotform-submission-to-google-docs-row/">JotForm</a>, to name a few, that allow you to submit form submissions to any Google Spreadsheet, and with the APISpark integration, all your form submissions are automatically available via API.</p>
<p>After that, I see numerous <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/woocommerce/google-docs/23762/woocommerce-new-order-to-google-docs-create-spreadsheet-row/">commerce</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/paypal/google-docs/1421/add-paypal-sales-google-docs-spreadsheet-row/">payment</a>s, and other key business functions, that Zapier enables publishing of data and content into a Google Spreadsheet from. All of these services have APIs, that is why Zapier is able to do what they do, but that would require a developer to tackle with custom API integration (not for this story). This story is all about enabling non-developers to deploy APIs, from common business functions, no coding necessary--Zapier is our middleman.</p>
<p>Beyond Twitter, forms, payments, and product sales, I will explore other easy to implement, API deployment using Zapier, Google Docs, and APISpark. These represent API deployment scenarios I don't think people are tracking on, and with a little education, I think we can bring problem owners up to speed, and increase the number of APIs available, driven by average person, and the common business problems they face every day.</p>

<p>The elite technology group at the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/">GSA</a>, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">known as 18F</a>, has released the latest copy of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">API guidance for federal government agencies</a> to follow when designing their own APIs.</p>
<p>Using 18F&rsquo;s own description:</p>
<blockquote><em>This document captures 18F's view of API best practices and standards. We aim to incorporate as many of them as possible into our work.<br /><br />APIs, like other web applications, will vary greatly in implementation and design, depending on the situation and the problem the application is solving. </em></blockquote>
<p>I like the mix of info that is delivered as well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>High level design guidance that individual APIs interpret to meet their needs.</li>
<li>Low level web practices that most modern HTTP APIs use.</li>
</ul>
<p>To top it off, <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">the API Standards is hosted on Github</a>, in its own repository, and as Gray Brooks from 18F says:</p>
<blockquote><em> "Want a formal API Standards for your agency to adopt?  Fork ours, add your name to the top, and make it your own." </em></blockquote>
<p>Simple guidance like this goes a long way in helping, sometimes even very experienced developers, understand the best practices when it comes to designing, simple, modern APIs&mdash;a world where consistency and simplicity goes a long way!</p>

During my initial work, I played with <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">three separate APIs from www.usa.gov</a>, which I think demonstrates the importance of CORS, and how opening it up for APIs, makes them more portable and remix-able.</p>
<p>When it comes to the the three APIs from www.usa.gov, I do not have control over the API itself, but I wanted to create a self contained, site that showcased the government APIs, and provide interactive API documentation generated using Swagger. I made sure all three of the APIs had machine readable API definitions using Swagger, then I setup a simple HTML page, which allowed anyone to play with each of the APIs.</p>
<p>This worked great until I reached the third API, which was at a different domain than the previous two, and didn't have CORS enabled. If you aren't familiar with CORS, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</a>, which is a mechanism that allows many resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain the resource originated from&mdash;behavior that you may want to control on a web page, but for an API it is something you want to encourage.</p>
<p>CORS being enabled, is the difference between an API being portable, and remix-able, and it being locked down to its original developer portal. If an API is RESTful and has CORS enabled, any outside party (like me), can generate a machine readable API definitions for it, and compose a developer experience, that that includes the API&mdash;with or without consent of the original API provider. While this might scare the shit out of some API providers, it is the future of API driven, application architecture.</p>
<p>You can't expect all developers to find your API developer portal, and APIs need to be more portable, allowing for remixing by other API providers, backend as a service providers, and anyone who wants to feature the API resource in their developer portal. CORS is a simple thing that you can enable for your APIs that will make a big difference in how your API is found, and integrated into other applications and systems.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

I wanted to make sure that when this new, and extremely important individual assumes their role, they have my latest thoughts on how to make the Department of Commerce developer portal the best it possibly can be, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this port will be</span> the driving force behind the rapidly expanding API driven economy.</p>
<p>Secretary Pritzker does a pretty good job of summing up the scope of resources that are available at Commerce:</p>
<blockquote><em>Secretary Pritzker described how the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s data collection &ndash; which literally reaches from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun &ndash; not only informs trillions of dollars of private and public investments each year and plants the seeds of economic growth, but also saves lives.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think she also does a fine job of describing the urgency behind making sure Commerce resources are available:</p>
<blockquote><em>Because of Commerce Department data, Secretary Pritzker explained, communities vulnerable to tornadoes have seen warning times triple and tornado warning accuracy double over the past 25 years, giving residents greater time to search for shelter in the event of an emergency.</em></blockquote>
<p>To understand the importance of content, data and other resources that are coming out the Department of Commerce, you just have to look at the list of agencies that are underneath Commerce, who already have API initiatives:</p>

</ul>
<p>The data and other resources available through these agencies, underneath the Department of Commerce, reflect the heart of not just the U.S. economy, but the global economy, which is rapidly being driven by APIs, which are powering stock markets, finance, payment providers, cloud computing, and many other cornerstones of our increasingly online economy.</p>
<p>Look through those 13 agencies, the resource they manage are all vital to all aspects of the economy telecommunications, patents, weather, oceans, census, to other areas that have a direct influence on how markets work, or don't work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all behind the Department of Commerce, hiring a Chief Data Officer (CDO), but my first question is, what will this person do?&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>This leader, Secretary Pritzker explained, will oversee improvements to data collection and dissemination in order to ensure that Commerce&rsquo;s data programs are coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic.</em></blockquote>
<p>Yes! I can get behind this. In my opinion, in order for the new CDO to do this, they will have to quickly bring all of the agencies /developer program up to a modern level of operation. There is a lot of work to be done, so let's get to work exploring what needs to happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Central Department of Commerce Developer Portal To Rule Them All</strong><br /> Right now the <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/developer">Department of Commerce developer portal</a> at commerce.gov/developer, is just a landing page. An after thought, to help you find some APIs--not a portal. The new CDO needs to establish this real estate as the one true portal, which provides the resources other agencies will need for success, while also providing a modern, leading location for developers of web, mobile, Internet of things applications, and data journalists, or analyst to come to find the data they need. If you need a reference point, go look at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/">SalesForce</a>, <a href="https://go.developer.ebay.com/">eBay</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/">Googe&rsquo;s</a> developers areas&mdash;you should see this type of activity at commerce.gov/developer.</p>
<p><strong>Each Agency Must Have Own Kick Ass Developer Portal</strong><br /> Following patterns set forth by their parent, Department of Commerce portal, each agency underneath needs to posses their own, best of breed developer portal, providing the data, APIs, code, and other resources, that public and private sector consumers will need.  I just finished <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">looking through all the available developer portals for commerce agencies</a>, and their is no consistency between them in user experience (UX), API design, or resources available. The new CDO will have to immediately get to work on taking existing patterns from the private sector, <a href="https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X">as well as what has been developed by 18F</a>, and set a establish common patterns that other agencies can follow when designing, developing and managing their own agencies developer portal.</p>
<p><strong>High Quality, Machine Readable Open Data By Default</strong><br /> The new CDO needs to quickly build on existing data inventory efforts that has been going on at Commerce, making sure any existing projects, are producing machine readable data by default, making sure all data inventory is available within their agency's portal, as well as at data.gov. This will not be a one time effort, the new CDO needs to make sure all program and project managers, also get the data steward training they will need, to ensure that all future work at the Department of Commerce, associated agencies, and private sector partners produces high quality, machine readable data by default.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling To Support The Public And Private Sector</strong><br /> Within each of the Commerce, and associate agency developer portals, there needs to be a wealth of open source code samples, libraries and SDKs for working with data and APIs. This open source philosophy, also needs to be applied to any web or mobile applications, analysis or visualization that are part of Commerce funded projects and programs, whether they are from the public or private sector. All software developed around Commerce data, and receive public fundeing should be open source by default, allowing the rest of the developer ecosystem, and ultimately the wider economy to benefit and build on top of existing work.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Readable API Definitions For All Resources</strong><br /> This is an area, that is a little bit leading edge, even for the private sector, but is rapidly emerging to play a central role in how APIs are designed, deployed, managed, discovered, tested, monitored, and ultimately integrated into other systems and applications. Machine readable <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/">API definitions are being used as a sort of central truth</a>, defining how and what an API does, in a machine readable, but common format, that any developer, and potentially other system can understand. Commerce needs to ensure that all existing, as well as future APIs developed around Commerce data, possess a machine readable API definition, which will allow for all data resources to be plug and play in the API economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/18f/18F_logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Established An Assortment Of Blueprints For Other Agencies To Follow</strong><br /> The new Commerce CDO will have to be extremely efficient at establishing successful patterns that other agencies, projects and programs can follow. This starts with developer portal blueprints they can follow when designing, deploying and managing their own developer programs, but should not stop there, and Commerce will need a wealth of blueprints for open source software, APIs, system connectors, and much, much more.  Establishing common blueprints, and sharing these widely across government will be critical for consistency and interoperability--reducing the chances that agencies, or private sector partners will be re-inventing the wheel, while also reducing development costs.</p>
<p><strong>Establish Trusted Partner Access For Public And Private Sector</strong><br /> Open data and APIs, do not always mean publicly available by default. Private sector API leaders have developed trusted partner layers to their open data and API developer ecosystems, allowing for select, trusted partners greater access to resources. An existing model for this in the federal government, is within the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">IRS modernized e-file ecosystem</a>, and the trusted relationships they have with private sector tax preparation partners like H&amp;R Block or Jackson Hewitt. Trusted partners will be critical in Department of Commerce operations, acting as private sector connectors to the API economy,  enabling higher levels of access from the private sector, but in a secure and controlled way that protects the public interest.</p>
<p><strong>Army of Domain Expert Evangelists Providing A Human Face</strong><br /> As the name says, Commerce spans all business sectors, and to properly "oversee improvements to data collection and dissemination in order to ensure that Commerce&rsquo;s data programs are coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic&rdquo;, the CDO will need another human layer to help increase awareness of Commerce data and APIs, while also supporting existing partners and integrators. An army of evangelists will be needed, possessing some extremely important domain expertise, across all business sectors, that Department of Commerce data and resources will touch. Evangelism is the essential human variable, that makes the whole open data and API algorithm work, the new CDO needs to get to work writing a job description, and hiring for this army&mdash;you will need an 18F, but one that is dedicated to the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Commerce As The Portal At The Center Of The API Economy</strong><br /> The establishment of CDO at the Department of Commerce is very serious business, and is a role that will be central to how the global economy evolves in the coming years. The content, data, and digital resources that should, and will be made available at commerce.gov/developer and associated agencies, will be central to the health of the API driven economy.</p>
<p>Think of what major seaports have done for the the economy over the last 1000 years, and what role Wall Street has played in the economy over the last century&mdash;this is the scope of the commerce.gov/developer portal, which is ultimately the responsibility of the new Department of Commerce Chief Data Officer.</p>
<p>When the new CDO get started at the Department of Commerce, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">I hope they reach out to 18F</a>, who will have much of what you need to get going. Then sit down, read this post, as well my other one on, <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">An API strategy for the U.S. government</a>, and once you get going, if you need any help, just let me know&mdash;as my readers know, I&rsquo;m full of a lot of ideas on APIs.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-contract.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One conversation I had at #Gluecon this year,  was around the role an API plays in being a contract between providers and consumers, with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) from <a href="https://helloreverb.com/">Reverb</a>. API contract, is a common phrase to describe how API services are consumed, and depending on the on-boarding process, an API provider and consumer can enter into a contract for services around a set of resources, in a self-service way.</p>
<p>In the last couple years, with the increased use of API definition formats like API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML, we often reference this API definition as a tangible representation of the contract API providers and consumers enter into. In my mind, I see the API definition as one building block, in a larger set of building blocks, that are working together to form a contract, with the API definition acting as the truth.</p>
<p>If you step back and look across multiple API providers, you start to see a variety of building blocks that contribute to the overall "API Contract", that is negotiated between API provider and consumer, starting with the API definition.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br /> A machine readable definition of an API interface, using a common format like API Blueprint, Swagger or RAML, providing a definition of the surface area of the resources that are available via API. API definitions are proving to be very useful in establishing a common way to describe, communicate and collaborate around APIs, which are often extremely abstract.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /> Terms of service are the legal portion of the API contract, determining how the service can be used, keeping the company&rsquo;s interest in mind, but should also be liberal enough to allow developers and 3rd party integrators to be successful. Plain english version of terms of service go a long way in seamlessly fitting into the API contract, allowing API consumers to quickly understand where they stand.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong><br /> The privacy of a platform, is definitely a very critical element of the API contract, and sets the tone for a platform operations, contract with developers, and their promise to the end-users. An awareness, and respect of privacy issues is part of every success API platform, and feeds into the overall health of the contractrual relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Service Level Agreement</strong><br /> A service level agreement (SLA), sets the quality of service expectations within the API contract. All API consumers should have some sort of SLA that provides a definition of the services being offered, and the level of service, and the reliability end-users can expect as part of API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Service Accord</strong><br /> As an API provider, if you can&rsquo;t offer a formal SLA, you should at least provide a service accord with users, setting expectations around what level of service will be offered around an API, and while a service accord isn&rsquo;t legally binding, it can at least help set expectations, and the tone of API operations for consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Interface License</strong><br /> The Oracle v Google legal battle has brought API licensing front and center, making them part of the overall contract of API operations. Whether you apply copyright, or some other license, an API license will be part of the contract entered into between API provider and consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Data License</strong><br /> Like an API interface, the licensing of underlying data stored, and returned by an API needs to have a license defined, providing guidance for developers, and businesses that are consuming an APIs data, and how they can store, remix, and put data to use.</p>
<p><strong>Code License</strong><br /> Providing code in the form of samples, libraries, and SDKs is common practice for API providers, and the how the code is licensed will determine how API consumers integrate an API into their, providing another layer of licensing within the API contract. This doesn't end with client side code, many APIs will also offer server side API implementations, which should also be appropriately licensed.</p>
<p><strong>Deprecation Policy</strong><br /> How long can API consumers depend on an API? What sort of notification will I get before an API is deprecated? The deprecation policies of an API, play a significant role in the trust established as part of the API contract that API providers and consumers agree to.</p>
<p><strong>Roadmap</strong><br /> Contracts are know for targeting a specific period of time, but API contracts are considered to be open ended, and part of that obligation is communication and openness around an APIs roadmap, providing critical details on what is next for an API, allowing API consumers to trust that a contract will not change to quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br /> Providing a place where API consumers can see a recent history of changes to an API platform offers a reference, for how often an API changes, and how its evolved over time, balancing out marketing and potential rhetoric around API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Rate Limits</strong><br /> As an API consumer, if we are entering into a contract, I need to know how my contract will scale, and where I exist in the API supply chain. Rate limits provide a unit of measurement that can be used as part of the API contract, quantifying expectations and deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>Uptime / Availability</strong><br /> You can offer a low cost, high value API service, but if your availability and uptime sucks, you are not delivering on the contract entered into with API consumers, making this aspect of operations a very important piece of the API contract.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong><br /> Stipulating the price paid for a service is fundamental to any contract, and the pricing of a particular API represents the value that is exchanged between API provider and consumer, as part of the API contract.</p>
<p><strong>Service Tiers</strong><br /> Most modern APIs have multiple access levels, providing contract negotiation opportunities between API provider and consumer, a feature that allows API contracts to be negotiated, or re-negotiated in real-time, based upon known service tiers.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br /> A contract is a relationship between two businesses, and any relationship requires support to be successful. Direct, and indirect API support provides assurances to API consumers that once they enter into a contract, the API provider will be there to help in all phases of contract execution.</p>
<p>An API definition provides a tangible, machine readable lens to look at the API contract through, providing a quantifiable truth that describes how an API will be delivered, but the actual API contract requires a suite of other supporting elements, starting with terms of service, and continuing through to how a company supports an API, before the API contract is fully realized.</p>
<p>I'm very optimistic about the evolution of API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> in 2014, now that we have the ability to define an API, and quantify the resources interface in a machine readable format. Next we need the same for the other portions of the "API contract", so that we can negotiate contracts for online resources in an automated, frictionless, real-time way.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-telescope.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is a pretty basic concept&mdash;look at other competing or complimentary APIs in the space, before designing your own. This seems like common sense to me, but I look at APIs for a living, and I&rsquo;m interested in finding the best API patterns across business or government sectors. Even though this topic seems like a no-brainer to me, I still encounter many folks who contact me to discuss their API strategy, but have not looked at any APIs, in the same genre as the one they are looking to enter--which tells me I should be writing about this topic on a regular basis.</p>
<p>My first advice to any API provider, looking to begin new API effort, is to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">look at as many of the leading APIs out there</a>, as you have time for. Even if they aren&rsquo;t in the same genre as your API, they are leaders for a reason, and do many things that you can learn from. If nothing else, at least look at the pioneers like SalesForce, Amazon, Twitter and Google&mdash;they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Secondarily I urge developers to go look at any APIs that are doing the same thing, or portentially exist in the same genre, as your API. If you are doing a bookmark API, go look at Delicious and Pinboard. If you are doing an image API go look at Flickr and Instagram. Even if your API will be slightly different, you should look at all, accessible, patterns, that are similar to what you are trying to do do. Try to understand why these APis providers designed their interface the way they did, and actually make calls against the API, to see what you like, and what you don&rsquo;t like about their approach.</p>
<p>Once you have looked at all the APIs you can, take the best patterns you found, and make it into your own. Even if you come back around, and still think your API design is superior, you will have learned something through the process&mdash;even if you learn what you don&rsquo;t want to do, or just receive validation of your idea.  If you haven&rsquo;t done your due diligence, looking for other healthy API patterns in the space, you are wasting valuable development cycles, on something that may not actually be innovating, and moving the conversation forward.</p>

<p>In the API section, they provide a nice introduction to what is an API, and why you would use an API, including nine library focused APIs:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.librarieshacked.org/">Libraries Hacked</a> is available as a Github, so any librarian, can fork, and launch for their own purposes, with everything licensed CC-BY.  I think that librarians hold the key to our future, and ensuring librarians have the latest resources they need when it comes to APIs, open data, and open source software is critical to all of this working.</p>
<p>Sites like Libraries Hacked, not only save me a lot of time in researching priority areas like libraries, but also make me hopeful for the future, in a world where I&rsquo;m bombarded by warning signs around how technology is used, and knowing that librarians are getting equipped, makes me feel a lot better for all us.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.yodlee.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/yodlee/yodlee-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spoke with the leading financial data API aggregation providers&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yodlee.com/">Yodlee</a> last week, regarding their <a href="http://www.yodlee.com/about-us/careers/">hunt for a director of developer evangelism</a>.  Yodlee provides an aggregation API that is designed for developers who need secure access to their users&rsquo; bank, credit card, investment, and loan accounts&mdash;if you think about it, this is a pretty critical API, in what we are all calling the &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yodlee isn&rsquo;t just looking for a junior evangelist, they are looking for a director&mdash;someone to lead the charge, when it comes to evangelizing Yodlee to potential API consumers, while also supporting the community and applications that are already integrated with the financial data aggregation platform. While there are well published job descriptions for the API evangelist role, there are no universities training up, cranking out the next generation of evangelism leaders&mdash;they are a unique breed, leaving a major hurdle for API providers like Yodlee to jump.</p>
<p>Evangelists are equal parts engineer, business development, product development, sales, and marketing&mdash;a combination that is not easy to find. Yodlee and I discussed the difficulties of finding the right candidates for the role, and whether or not you emphasize the technical or the marketing skills? There are extremely few candidates who know they are evangelist material, you often have to sculpt one out of many different personality traits, and both technical and business skils.</p>
<p>Evangelism talent, at both junior, and leadership levels is going to continue to be a major stumbling block for the expanding API economy. Even with some movement in the world of API discovery in 2014, we will never be able to fully automate API discovery, let alone evangelism, management and support. At some point we are going to need more agencies, and institutions focusing on training up the next generation of evangelists, similar to social media marketing did in the last 5 years&mdash;of course, hopefully we can scale a little more sensibly, than the social media marketing world did.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the developer evangelist position at Yodlee, <a href="http://www.rockitrecruiting.com/jobs.php?cjobid=JB197383618">head over to the recruiters site</a>, and let them know I sent you.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/07/14/autodevbot-open-sources-their-api-monitor/">AutoDevBot Open Sources Their API Monitor</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://autodevbot.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/autodevbot/autodevbot-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://autodevbot.com/">API monitoring service AutoDevot</a> has opened sourced their JavaScript API monitoring solution, built on Frisby.js, called <a href="https://github.com/AutoDevBot/API-Monitor-Runner">API Monitor Runner</a>. The API monitoring tool, allows for a pretty robust configuration file, that lets you detail exactly what the service should monitor, and how it should behave when something out of the ordinary happens.</p>
<p>I though the trigger actions stood out, allowing you to take common actions when something occurs with an API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>TRIGGER_EMAIL</strong> - enable email notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_PAGER_DUTY</strong> - enable PagerDuty notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_WEBHOOK</strong> - enable a generic webhook notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_HIPCHAT</strong>- enable HipChat notification</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoDevBot, even takes things to another level, providing a ready to go Docker container, to quickly deploy API Monitor Runner, and then configure it on setup, using Docker environment params--a very interesting approach to deploying open tooling to support APIs.</p>
<p>I really like this type of deployment for vital API services, focusing on providing a simple, valuable, cloud-based service, as well as an open source version that anyone can put to use. We just saw the same moves from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/apitools-raises-the-bar-with-open-onpremise-api-testing-and-monitoring-tools/">3Scale with the release of APITools</a>, and now AutoDevBot with API Monitor Runner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see other critical building blocks of the API economy emulate this approach&mdash;there is plenty of money to be made from cloud services, while also providing open tool that will stimulate API growth across many business sectors. Which, creates more need for services.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">looked through 77 of the developer areas for federal agencies</a>, resulting in reviewing approximately 190 APIs. While the presentation of 95% of the federal government developer portals are crap, it makes me happy that about 120 of the 190 APIs (over 60%) are actually consumable web APIs, that didn't make me hold my nose and run out of the API area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the 190, only 13 actually made me happy for one reason or another:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html">OpenFDA</a></strong> - Well, I've already <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">gushed about OpenFDA</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2">Climate Data Online Web Services</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Just a clean, valuable, well done API for government.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/">National Climate Data Center</a> -</strong> Nice portal, valuable datasets, just needs some nice APIs and BOOM!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> - </strong>NREL just get it, they are doing some great APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> - </strong>DOL's approach to their API design and developer area makes me happy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://va-data.github.io/va-facilities/#!/facilities">VA Facilities Locator Web Service</a> -</strong> Only makes me happy because I did the work already. ;-)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://va-data.github.io/va-press/#!/press">VA Press Releases</a> - </strong>Only makes me happy because I did the work already. ;-)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> -</strong> Slick stuff. Nice Area. Great APIs. interactive docs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://my.usa.gov/developer/">MyUSA Citizen API</a> -</strong> Interestingly simple API, yet massive API concept, curious of the scope, implementation and use of oAuth in federal gov.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://exoapi.com/">ExoAPI</a> -</strong> Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.asterank.com/skymorph">SkyMorph/NEAT API</a>&nbsp; - </strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://marsweather.ingenology.com/">{MAAS} API</a> -&nbsp;</strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://predictthesky.org/"> Predict the Sky API</a> -</strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there are other nice implementations in there. I like the simplicity and consistency in APIs coming out of GSA, SBA, but overall federal APIs reflect what I see a lot in the private sector, some developer making a decent API, but their follow-through and launch severeley lacks what it takes to make the API successful. People wonder why nobody uses their APIs? hmmmmm....</p>
<p>A little minimalist simplicity in a developer portal, simple explanation of what an API does, interactive documentation w/ Swagger, code libraries, terms of service (TOS), wouild go a looooooooooooong way in making sure these government resources were found, and put to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, so where the hell do I start? Let's look through theses 123 APIs and see where the real low hanging fruit for demonstrating the potential of APIs.json, when it comes to API discovery in the federal government.</p>
<p>Let's start again with the <strong>White House&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers">http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;">White House Petition API</a>&nbsp;-</strong> No swagger, but simple, high value API that is totally worth doing.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Only one API made it out of the <strong>USDA</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there.

<li><strong>Severe Weather Data Inventory -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly basic interface, wouldn&rsquo;t take much to turn into modern web API.

It would be some work but could turn into a decide API with Swagger specs.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly straightforward API, Simple.

<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Education -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">http://www.ed.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of high value datasets. Says API, but is JSON file. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate APIs for it all and make machine readable definitions.<strong> (B)</strong></li>

<p><strong>Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Information Administration -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/developer/">http://www.eia.gov/developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Nice web API, simple clean presentation. Needs interactive docs.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Renewable Energy Laboratory -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">http://developer.nrel.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- Close to a modern Developer area with web APIs. Uses standardized access (umbrella). Some of them have Swagger specs, the rest would be easy to create.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Office of Scientific and Technical Information -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices">http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices</a></span>&nbsp;- Interfaces are pretty well designed, and Swagger specs would be straightforward.

<p>That is a lot of potentially valuable API resource to consume. From my perspective, I think that what has come out of GSA, SBA, and White House Petition API, represent probably the simplest, most consistent, and high value targets for me. Next maybe the wealth of APis out of Interior and FDA. AFter that I'll cherry pick from the list, and see which are easiest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm lookig to create a Swagger definition for each these APIs, and publish as a Github repository, allowing people to play with the API. If I have to, I'll create a proxy for each one, because CORS is not common across the federal government. I'm hoping to not spend to much time on proxies, because once I get in there I always want to improve the interface, and evolve a facade for each API, and I don't have that much time on my hands.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent most of the day yesterday, looking through <a href="/admin/blog/http:/18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 of the developer portals listed on the 18F Github portal</a>. While I wanted to evaluate the quality and approach of each of the agencies, my goal for this review cycle was to look for any APIs that already had machine readable API definitions, or would be low hanging fruit for the creation of <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definitions</a>, as part of my wider API discovery work.</p>
<p>I had just finished updating all my API Evangelist Network APIs to use verion 0.14 of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and while I wait for the search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> to update to support the new version, I wanted to see if I could start the hard work of applying API discovery to federal government APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally all federal agencies would publish APIs.json on their own, placing it within the root of their domain, like they do with data.json, and provide an index of all of their APIs. Being all to familiar with how this stuff work, I know that if I want this to happen, I will have to generate APIs.json for many federal agencies first. However for the APis.json to have their intended impact, I need many of the APIs to have machine readable API definitions that I can point to--which equals more work for me! yay? ;-(</p>
<p>My thinking is that I will look through all of the 77 developer areas, and resulting APIs looking for the low hanging fruit. Basically I would grade each API on its viability to be included in my federal government API discovery work. I spent minimal amount of time look at each API, and in some cases looking for the API, before giving up. I would inspect the supporting developer area, and the actual interface for complexity, helping me understand how hard it would be to hand craft a Swagger spec, and APIs.json for each agency and their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(warning contains my raw un-edited notes from doing this research, not suitable for children)</em></p>
<p>As I went through, I wrote a couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;">National Climate Data Center</a> is nice looking, and is a high profile--they should have a kick ass API!</li>
<li>Inversely <a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted&lt;/a&gt;">NOAAA Climate Data Online</a> very simple, clean and well done.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">Department of Education</a> is acceptable as dev area, only because of Socrata</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> just gets it. They just get it.</li>
<li>Some of these are billed as developer areas, but really just a single API. It is a start I guess.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I love me some <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a>. Their developer area and API is freak'n cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://my.usa.gov/developer/">MyUSA citizen API </a>has oAuth!!! WTF. How did I not notice this before? Another story, and work here.</li>
<li>MyUSA has really good, simple, high value, API resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://exoapi.com/">NASA ExoAPI</a> not just API cool, but space cool!!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foia.gov/developer.html">FOIA</a> needs a fucking API. No excuses. FOIA needs an API!</li>
<li>Some APIs it might be better to go back to data source and recreate API from scratch, they are so bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to share some of my notes, before the long list of developer areas, and their APIs. There are some specific notes for each APIs, but much of it is very general, helping grade each API, so I can go back through the list of B grade or higher APIs, and figure out which are candidates for me to create a Swagger API definition, APIs.json and ultimately adding to APIs.io.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this work I went down the <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 federal agency links</a>, which were billed as developer areas, but many were single APIs. So when a developer area resulted in multiple APIs, I grouped them together, and many of the agencies who have a single API I will group together, and include my commentary as necessary. I'm leaving the URLs visible to help as a reference, show the craziness of some of them, and because it would have been sooooo much work to apply all of them.</p>
<p>Let's start with the <strong>White House</strong>(<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers">http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;">White House Petition API</a>&nbsp;-</strong> No swagger, but simple, high value API that is totally worth doing.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is the <strong>USDA</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER">http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER</a>), which is a hodgepodge of service, no consistency whatsoever between services in interface, supporting content or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Farmers Market Directory API</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html">http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html</a></span> - worthwhile API, but soap,</li>
<li><strong>Animal Identification Management Syste</strong>m - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://vsapps.aphis.usda.gov/aims/">https://vsapps.aphis.usda.gov/aims/</a></span> - Meh</li>

Barf.</li>
<li><strong>Recreation Information Database&nbsp; -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">https://ridb.recreation.gov/</a></span> - Kinda sort of cool</li>

</ul>
<p>Overall I give USDA a <strong>D</strong> on all their APIs. A couple might be high value sources, and going after, but definitely not low hanging fruit for me. It would be easier to tackle as independent project for generating brand new APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there. The landing page looks good, but the API documentation isn't really there. Could be really easily. Looks like a well crafted API.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is Department of Commerce (<a href="http://www.commerce.gov/developer">http://www.commerce.gov/developer</a>), who definitely high some higher value resources, as well as some health API initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bureau of Economic Analysis API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm">http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm</a> -&nbsp;</span>Signed up for key, don&rsquo;t see any docs? Looks clean, but we&rsquo;ll see if anything there. An email address. yay!<strong> (C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Census Bureau API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">http://www.census.gov/developers/</a></span>&nbsp;- Yes, a real developer area with supporting building blocks. (Update, News, App Gallery, Forum, Mailing List).&nbsp;Really could use interactive document though. There are urls, but not active calls. Would be way easier if you could play with data, before committing. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>International Trade Administration Export Trade Events -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://new.export.gov/events">https://new.export.gov/events</a></span>&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t see an API<strong> (F)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology CDA Guideline Validation Tool -&nbsp; </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://ihe-pcd-con.nist.gov/PCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConcda-validation/webservice.html">http://ihe-pcd-con.nist.gov/PCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConcda-validation/webservice.html</a></span>&nbsp;- WTF is with this URL? Really? 404 <strong>(F)</strong></li>
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_api_doc.html">http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_api_doc.html</a></span>&nbsp;- Not really a web API. If I could find data, it would be a good facade project. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Legacy National Climatic Data Center RESTful Services -</strong> <a href="http://www7">http://www7</a>.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ncdc.noaa.gov/rest/</span>&nbsp;- Wouldn&rsquo;t take much to build a facade for this one, so that it would be a real API. As it is, its just too confusing. Simple, but confusing. Takes talent to do that. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>GIS Map Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.climate.gov/datasearch/">http://www.climate.gov/datasearch/</a></span>&nbsp;- Looks like a bunch of datasets, no real API found.

<li>Severe Weather Data Inventory - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly basic interface, wouldn&rsquo;t take much to turn into modern web API. Right now its just a text file, with a spec style documentation explaining what to do. Looks high value. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>General National Climatatic Data Center THREDDS Data Server -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html</a></span>&nbsp;- File store with folders and folder and folders of data.

Wouldn&rsquo;t be too much to generate a machine readable definition and make into a better API area.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Space Physics Interactive Data Resource Web Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf">http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf</a></span>&nbsp;- Well its a PDF, but looks like a decent web API. It would be some work but could turn into a decide API with Swagger specs.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Telecommunications and Information Administration -</strong> National Broadband Map - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/broadband-data">http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/broadband-data</a></span>&nbsp;- Not an API, but dataset, with a lot of work it could be turned into a decent experience. <strong>(C</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Patent and Trademark Office - </strong>Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t see any API, just a web search? <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li>International Trade Administration -&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">http://developer.trade.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- I didn&rsquo;t see any API. They talk about it, but don&rsquo;t see how to access.<strong> (F)</strong></li>

Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate interactive docs for it. Spec needed. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Climate Data Center -</strong>&nbsp;<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/</a>&nbsp;- Sexy site, well done. But no API. Datasets, so API could be created. Cache API. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next with the <strong>Department of Defense (</strong><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.defense.gov/developer/">http://www.defense.gov/developer/</a>)</span></span><span>There are 8 things billed as aPIs, with a variety of datasets, API like things, and web services available.&nbsp; Not really sure whats up? <strong>(D)</strong></span></p>
<p>We have one by itself here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arlington National Cemetary -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developer/">http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Pretty decent web API.

</ul>
<p>Then the department of education who is just riding their data.gov work as API area:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Education -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">http://www.ed.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of high value datasets.

</ul>
<p>Next some energy related efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Energy -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.energy.gov/developers">http://www.energy.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of datasets.

<li><strong>National Renewable Energy Laboratory -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">http://developer.nrel.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- Close to a modern Developer area with web APIs. Uses standardized access (umbrella). Some of them have Swagger specs, the rest would be easy to create.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Office of Scientific and Technical Information -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices">http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices</a></span>&nbsp;- Interfaces are pretty well designed, and Swagger specs would be straightforward. But docs are all PDF currently. <strong>(B)</strong></li>

<p>Ok that was it. I know there are more APIs to look at, but this is derived from the master list of federal government developer portals. This gives me what I need. Although, I'm a little disappointed I have less than 5 Swagger definitions, after looking at about 190 APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After looking at all of this, I'm overwhelmed. How do you solve API discovery for a mess like this? Holy shit!</p>
<p>I really need my fucking head examined for taking this shit on. I really am my own worst enemy, but I love it. I am obsessed with contributing to a solution for API discovery that will work in private sector, as well as a public sector mess like this. So where the hell do I start? &nbsp;More to come on that soon...</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently updated my APIs.json files for all my API Evangelist network domains, to use version 0.14, which is getting pretty close to a stable version. While I await <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a> to be updated to use this version, I wanted to to spend some time publishing APIs.json files, but this time across federal government APIs.</p>
<p>The thing I like most about APIs.json, is that you can do one for anybody else&rsquo;s APIs. In the case of our federal government, I don't anticipate any agency getting on board with APIs.json anytime soon, but I can do it for them! There are a lot of APIs in federal government, where do I get started?</p>
<p>To help me understand the scope of API discovery in our federal government <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">I looked through 77 developer portals</a>, outlined by <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. While browsing these developer portals for federal government agencies, I look at almost 190 APIs--with a goal of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">identifying the low hanging fruit</a>, when it came to API discovery across hundreds of government APIs.</p>
<p>Out of the 190 APIs, around 120 of them were actual web APIs, that were something I felt I could work with. I settled on a handful of APIs out of the GSA, hosted at <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">www.usa.gov</a>, and <a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/index.html">explore.data.gov</a>, and got to work creating APIs.json for their APIs.</p>
<p>Before I could generate an APIs.json at each of the two domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), I needed machine readable API definition for the four APIs. I purposely picked federal agency APIs that were REST(flu), and were something I could easily generate a Swagger definition for.</p>
<p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://explore.data.gov/developers/docs/federal-executive-agency-internet-domains">federal agency domain API at explore.data.gov</a> was pretty easy, ony taking me a few minutes to handcraft a Swagger definition. Then I moved on to the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtml">Federal Agency Directory API at www.usa.gov</a>, and I was happy to see there was already a Swagger definition for the API. After that I tackled the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">Social Media Registry API</a>, and <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/mobile-app-gallery/index.shtml">Mobile App Gallery API</a>, both of which I had to handcraft a Swagger definition for. The Mobile App Gallery API has a CORS issue, but I'm moving on and will setup a proxy to handle later.</p>
<p>Now I have four machine readable API definitions for some pretty valuable government APIs, and I got to work creating my APIs.json that would act as a directory for these API resources. APIs.json are designed to go into the root domain of any API provider, and the four GSA APIs I selected ran under two separate domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), so I needed two separate APIs.json files:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">www.usa.gov/apis.json</a></li>
<li><a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">explore.data.gov/apis.jso</a>n</li>
</ul>
<p>When APIs.io gets updated to the latest version of APIs.json, I will submit both of these APIs.json files for indexing. Even though I&rsquo;m not the owner of these domains, I can still submit for inclusion in the API search engine. It would be better if the GSA published the APIs.json, and Swagger API definitions at the actual domains, and submitted themselves--the listings would then show as being authoritative, and hold more weight in API searches.</p>
<p>I still have about 115 more federal government APIs to create machine readable API definitions for, and the resulting APIs.json files that will enable discovery of these APIs--this isn&rsquo;t something that will happen overnight, and will take a shit-ton of work.</p>
<p>My goal is to help harden the APIs.json format, while making APIs in federal government more accessible, and part of the larger API discovery conversation that is going on in the private sector. One of the powerful features of APIs.json, is that external actors can craft APIs.json collections, from the outside. You don&rsquo;t have to be an owner of a domain, where an API is hosted, to publish an APIs.json on its behalf--I think this represents the potential of the public sector and private sector working together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APis.json are meant to work as collections of APis, or virtual stacks of valuable API resources. Sometimes these virtual stacks are defined internally, within a domain, and sometimes they are mashups of multiple API resources, across numerous domains, by outside actors, or API curators. I will keep curating federal government APIs, generating machine readable API definitions, APIs.json files for their supporting domains--helping define this fun new world of API discovery.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apis-json-gears.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>An <a href="http://apis.json">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;file lives in the root of any domain, or subdomain, and provides references to a collection of API resources. The APIs.json is meant to be a lightweight framework, where someone can build a collection of APIs, give it a name, description, some tags, and the APIs collection points you where you need to go, to get more information about those APIs.</p>
<p>For each API, you can define a list of URLs, each with a defining &ldquo;type&rdquo;, letting you know what to expect when you visit the URL. Right now, most of those URLs are just for humans, pointing to the developer portal, document, and terms of service (TOS). We are adding other API url types, that API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> can expose in their search interfaces, like code samples, and application gallery, to the next version of APIs.json.</p>
<p>These human API URL types provide a reference, that API search engines can use to guide human users who are searching for APIs. However, where the real power of APIs.json comes in, is when an API URL type references a machine readable source, like a <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definition</a>, or an <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">API Commons manifest</a>. When it comes to API discovery, we need as many meaningful locations, that we can point human API consumers to, but also machine readable locations, that will help make API discovery much more rich, automated, and precise.</p>
<p>Imagine when I can do more than just search name, description, and tags, by keyword, much like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> works currently. Imagine when you can specify that you only want APIs that are in the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, and openly licensed. Imagine when I can search for APIs that allow me to use all my HTTP verbs, not just GET. Now, go even more in the future, when I can search for APIs who have a specific allowance in their terms of service, with a machine readable TOS type for APIs.json.</p>
<p>This is where I want to take APIs.json, and ultimately API discovery. Machine readable API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger are the very first API URL type that helps automate API discovery, and the API Commons manifest is the latest. My goal is to tackle terms of service, pricing, and other critical aspects of API integration, and push forward a machine readable definition, that can ultimately be baked into the API discovery process--in all API search engines.</p>
<p>What is important to me, is that the API URL types, in each APIs.json, remain independent, and only loosely coupled with the APIs.json format, using a simple label, and URL. I&rsquo;m not directly invested in the evolution of each Swagger version, however I am with API Commons, and potentially other future APIs.json API URL type definitions. I want anyone to be able to step up and suggest API URL types for the APIs.json spec, making APIs.json URL types a community driven API discovery layer, for the API economy.</p>

<p>When I first published 11 simple API definitions, I had developed using <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, into the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, I made a mistake when I referenced the Swagger specifications for each of the APIs. I linked to the machine readable Swagger spec, but not the raw JSON stored on Github, errorneously I linked directly to the Github page.</p>
<p>I want the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-commons/api-commons/gh-pages/data/apis.json">machine readable API datastore</a>, at API Commons, which is used to drive the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API listing page</a>, to be completely machine readable, referencing all APIs, their machine readable API Commons manifest, as well as machine readable API definition. As the smart folks over at <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a> pointed out to me, I had been flip-flopping on this. Some of my later entries were machine readable pointers, but my earlier entries were not.</p>
<p>Now all of the entries in the commons, have machine readable references to both their API Commons manifest, and API definition. I've also added a &ldquo;<a href="http://apicommons.org/format.html">format</a>&rdquo; page, to explain each of the fields, in the the API Commons manifest format, to help API providers better understand, and not make the same mistake I made.</p>
<p>The API Commons manifest is meant to be a standalone, machine readable pointer to an APIs central truth (a machine readable API definition), and associated CC-BY-SA or CC0 licensing, and now, I think we have achieved our original goals around making this happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve expanded my monitoring on the world of APIs, from just API management, which I&rsquo;ve been doing for four years, into tracking on APIs across multiple buckets I'm calling <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API monetization" href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, <a title="API aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation</a>, <a title="reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">reciprocity</a>, and <a title="API real time" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">real-time</a>. I am always working to understand who the key players are across the API space, but also make sure they are categorized into one, or many of these expanding buckets--helping me quantify things.</p>
<p>It is always very interesting to see how an API service provider fits into more than one of these buckets, as well as when new players emerge to cater to just one of these buckets, like Apiary did with API design. Playing on this theme, I was introduced to new a new API service provider, called <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMatic</a> the other day, who on the surface seems to cater to API providers with the automatic generation of SDKs, but really is a cross-over into API design, discovery, and integration, bringing a new perspective to the table.</p>
<p><strong>Generating SDKs Is The Carrot</strong><br /> As soon as you land on the APIMatic home page, they state very clearly what they do "Automatic SDK Generation for APIs&rdquo;. You can search common APIs that are available in the APIMatic API marketplace, import your own API definition, or build one using their web-based user interface&mdash;which pretty squarely makes APIMatic for API consumers, providing clear API integration benefits, but via the generation of SDKs.</p>
<p><strong>GUI Tool For API Design</strong><br /> The third option for generating an SDK from an API, is using the APIMatic web-based user interface, which allows you to build a definition of your API, using a web interface&mdash;no coding necessary.  You can create a new definition, manage its settings, define endpoints, and the underlying data model. When ready, you can generate your SDK, which is rendered, I&rsquo;m guessing using the default APIMatic format, and then also allows you to generate mock APIs, and sandbox environments--pretty squarely in the world of API design for me.</p>
<p><strong>Provides API Discovery</strong><br /> Then the first option for generating an SDK is from a marketplace of existing APIs, allowing developers to generate SDKs for the most common APIs they depend on. From an API provider standpoint, this is a huge incentive for generating machine readable API definitions like Swagger, and register with marketplaces like APIMatic. I&rsquo;d say APIMatic starts with a very Mashape style API marketplace for discovery, but then quickly focuses heavily on quality SDKS, and API integration as the end deliverable.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting API Integration</strong><br /> Since APIMatic generates the code that sits between your app and the API resources it depends on, it has a unique lens for looking into how your applications are using APIs. This provides an alternative approach to the proxies and tooling I'm seeing emerge to monitor, track, test, and report on API integration. I&rsquo;m not sure of the pros and cons to this type of API integration, but think APIMatic vision is worth taking a closer look at.</p>
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-search-import-specify.png" alt="" width="575" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Focused Software Development Kits (SDK)</strong><br /> APIMatic focuses on delivering mobile SDKs, for iOS, Android, Windows, and Java platforms. When I talked to the founders, they said they would eventually provide more web focused SDKs, but mobile is obviously a major driver of API consumption, and was the low hanging fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Centered Around Machine Readable API Definitions</strong><br /> Everything about APIMatic is centered around API definitions. When you select to import an API, you are given the option to import APIMatic, WADL, Swagger, IODocs, GoogleREST, and MashapeJSON. Each of the APIs available in marketplace have a machine readable definition, as well as the web-based form builder generating a machine readable API definition as well. These definitions are then used to generate SDKs, mock interfaces, and full circle back to listing you in the APIMatic marketplace for discovery&mdash;if you wish to make your API public.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Software Development Kits (SDK)</strong><br /> Another aspect I find interesting about APIMatic, is that they focus on not just generating code stubs, they focus on high quality SDKs. Which in an era where you here a lot of rhetoric around SDKs being poorly written, out of date, hard to maintain, and unecessary--this gives APIMatic a potentially important differentiator if they do it right. APIMatic takes pride in their code being well written, looking nice, and following good conventions--something that could go a long ways in benefiting both API providers, and consumers.</p>
<p>Seeing new breeds of API service providers continue to emerge, with even new perspectives on how the API lifecycle operates, makes me happy, and with everything centered around machine readable, common API definitions, I'm even more pleased. This is in sync with what I&rsquo;m seeing come out of the API design, deployment, management, and integration providers I've been tracking on&mdash;that API definitions are increasingly driving all stops along the API lifecycle subway.</p>
<p>I will play with APIMatic some more. To be honest, I was approaching this from an API providers perspective when I jumped on the Google Hangout with them, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they crossed over into API design, integration, discovery, as well as management. Now that I have a good idea of what they offer, I will revisit what the benefits to API providers could be. At the very least, it is another carrot for API providers to be sure and generate machine readable definitions for their APIs&mdash;without it your APIs won&rsquo;t be found, or be able to be imported, and drive the next generation of API tooling like APIMatic.</p>
<p>APIMatic is looking to meet API providers, and get your API listed, so if you reach out, make sure and let them know I sent you. If you <a href="https://apimatic.io/Account/Register?Reference=C402F205-7E97-40EF-9894-BF1AFDBA9055">use this link</a>, and sign up, you will automatically be let into the beta users group--APIMatic is currently &ldquo;invite only&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Oh, I also had a good conversation with them about the possibilities around integration of APIMatic with <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a>, and distributed API search engines like <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a>, using <a href="http://bit.ly/1ij6TTP">APIs.json</a>&mdash;so more to come. Much more!</p>

<p>I talk about this concept often, but couldn't find any definitive post on APIs opening up a company, organization, or agency to outside ideas. This is something I hear from startups, up to federal government agencies, and from well known business brands, such as Absolut Vodka.</p>
<p>Absolut was one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">keynotes at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, this last march. Eva Sjokvist, from Absolut, walked us through the development of their <a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/">Absolut Drinks Database API</a>.&nbsp;An amazing story by itself, but one thing she said that stood out to me, which is an interestingly common by-product of the API lifecycle, was the process itself opened up the company, making it more receptive to outside ideas, and collaboration.</p>
<p>I hear this sentiment often from groups who are developing API programs at their companies, and you see shining examples, like <a href="http://developer.edmunds.com/">from Edmunds.com</a> with their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/internal-api-summit-within-every-company/">internal API Summit</a>, but rarely do I see a metric to measure API driven, cultural change. APIs don't just open up your company&rsquo;s assets and resources for access by trusted partners, or potentially the public, establishing a sort of external R&amp;D lab, it has the potential to open up a valuable feedback loop as well, bringing in new ideas that have the potential to change how a group sees the world--evolving internal culture.</p>
<p>The potential for opening up a company, bringing them closer to their partners and customers, or a government agency, opening up healthier dialogue with constituents, is the most important results of an API program&mdash;greater than any single application that will get built on an API.</p>

<p>I was exchanging emails with someone regarding API design considerations at their large institutions today, and where they could find healthy patterns for API designs within their industry. As with any API provider, they were concerned with emulating the best API design patterns they could, and evolve the design of their own services. They put it like this:</p>
<blockquote><em>..."our APIs largely expose our internal mess and legacy design rather than presenting a well thought out, consistent view of the important resources and operations"...</em></blockquote>
<p>We all want to deploy the best designed API that we possibly can, but with a lack of meaningful API definition formats (until recently), and nowhere to go and search or browse for common API design patterns (something 3Scale and API Evangelist want to fix with <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1ij6TTP">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a>), it can be difficult to know exactly what is good API design for our respective industries.</p>
<p>It would be nice, if all of the APIs we designed were brand new, perfectly architected to follow best of breed REST patterns, and we had all the time in the world to research and design. In reality, many of the APIs we design will ony act as a facade for some legacy beast of a system, that won't go away anytime soon. We are working to get more places like API Commons and APIs.io available to find the best API design patterns, and you should always look at as many of the APIs in your industry as you can, when designing your APIs, but most importantly, don't be concerned with a perfect interface--right out of the gate.</p>
<p>In reality, we have to just walk a line between the perfect API design, and the ugly legacy IT worlds, we are building these API facades to hide. The sooner we get the first version of the facade up, we can then iterate, and turn our APIs into the mirror image of the designs we ultimately desire&mdash;until then it is just smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>I am continuing my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">research into how universities are using APIs</a>, and while I was going through the developer areas for the universities I track on, I noticed an interesting mobile developer toolkit, from <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>When you land on the homepage of the <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">University of Michigan developer portal</a>, to the right you will see some valuable resources that is looking to help developers think through the bigger picture of designing, developing, deploying, testing and distributing, mobile application that are built on campus resources.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan mobile developer toolkit is broken down into four separate groups:</p>
<h3>Design</h3>

</ul>
<p>I think the resources they provide, represent a very long term vision around delivering API resources to developers, who will be building applications for the institution--something that all universities should look at emulating.</p>
<p>You want developers, who are building mobile applications on top of campus API resources to be successful, so providing them with the education, training and resources they need to deliver, is critical.</p>
<p>I also think it is cool, that at the bottom of the mobile developer toolkit, they provide two other links:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/devtoolkit/collaborate">Collaborate</a> - Campus and local developer groups.</li>
<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/devtoolkit/opportunities">Opportunities</a> - App competition notices.</li>
</ul>
<p>They want their app developers to socialize with other campus application developers, and be aware of opportunities to compete in hackathons and other competitions--on and off campus.</p>
<p>Developing mobile applications is the number one incentive for universities to deploy APIs, and jumpstart their API efforts like at <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/display/SOA/Home">BYU</a>, <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">UW</a> and <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, and&nbsp;it just makes sense to provide a mobile developer toolkit for developers. Education around APIs and mobile application development is critical to the success of any API initiative, but even more so, when it occurs across a large institution, by a variety of internal and external groups.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add the mobile developer toolkit to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">list common building blocks</a> for not just university APIs, but all API initiatives.</p>

<p>I'm working a wider campaign focused on getting my shit together around my images, and part of that is continueing work I had started with my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and launch more image manipulation API resources.</p>
<p>I have a wide range of needs to resize, crop, filter, and apply other filters to photos I work with, as part of my storytelling, and if I had a set of image manipulation APIs, life would be better--so as I do with anything, I got to work building an API.</p>
<p>The result is the first, in a series of&nbsp;<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation APIs</a>. Right now I focused on some low hanging fruit, like applying filters to images, which includes Charcoal, Oil Painting, Polaroid, and Sketch. Next, I will tackle some more utility APIs like resize, crop, and rotate.</p>
<p>Like my other APIs, I will use my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">operational harness</a>, and operate a <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">cloud version of my image manipulation API</a>, where anyone can access, and take advantage of my API resources. Using my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/service-composition-for-my-screen-capture-api/">API service composition</a>, I setup access tiers for public, partners and internal usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also open source any code behind so that others can deploy image manipulation within their own infrastructure, or I'm happy to setup for you--for a fee! :-)</p>
<p>I have a number of APIs I want to get built, and image manipulation has been on my list for a while, I'm glad I finally was able to get this work started.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas while being the API Evangelist. It just comes with the territory. I have an Evernote folder that I publish these ideas to, and some of them, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">Screen Capture API</a>, I actually make a reality.</p>
<p>The other night while writing, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/02/shadow-api-launching-an-api-before-someone-else-does/">Shadow API: Launching An API Before Someone Else Does</a>, I went to add the Nebraska homestead record API idea to my Evernote, and I said, ENOUGH! I need a public place to store these ideas, and while I'm at it, I'll enable others to publish ideas there too.</p>
<p>What better way to allow collaboration around a content store or dataset, than a Github repository plus API. So I launched <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/">API Ideas</a>, as an individual API project, on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist Network</a>. I allows me to retrieve, and add to a list of API ideas, all stored on Github, using a simple web API.</p>

<p>Reciprocity works, because it is about solving a simple problem for everyday users, using APIs to take a single action&mdash;if this happens over there, use APIs, to do that over there. There are many other words used to describe this evolution of ETL in the clouds, including interoperability, and automation, I use reciprocity because it better describes what is happening as part of the growing global API economy.</p>
<p>I recently went through all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">65+ of my research projects</a>, one of them being <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and as I was working on new research areas around open data, analysis, and visualization, I started thinking about how the IFTTT (reciprocity) model could be applied to analysis and visualization&mdash;resulting in a draft model I would call <strong><em>If This Then Visualize That (IFTVT)</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The IFTVT model provides the similar feedback loop as IFTTT, but instead of a resulting action, the end goal is a visualization.  If &ldquo;end of month&rdquo;, show me overview of Foursquare checkins. If &ldquo;Tweet receives 10 favorites&rdquo;, show me a list of Twitter users. If &ldquo;bank account goes below $50&rdquo;, show me last 25 charges. How you get your IFTVT visualizations would be up to you, maybe it is email, maybe SMS, maybe some sort of iGoogle like dashboard unit.</p>
<p>As with the IFTTT model, IFTVT gives us actionable, meaningful results from our increasingly disparate digital worlds. Using reciprocity, we are slowly being able to get a handle on the cloud versions of ourselves, and I think the next step could be analysis and resulting visualizations, in bit-size, meaningful, informative chunks via the channels that matter most to us.</p>
<p>Ok, get to work geeks! I&rsquo;ll tell the story, if you build it. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to stop and reflect for a moment on the open source, distributed API search engine, that <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist developed, in support of the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json discovery format</a>. When we conceived the APIs.json API discovery format, we knew that the project would be dead in the water, if there wasn&rsquo;t a clear incentive for API providers to generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>&mdash;helping them get their APIs found.</p>
<p>Until 2014, when you said "search for APIs", it meant going to a website (<a href="http://programmableweb.com">programmableweb.com</a>), and searching for an API in a curated directory of APIs. In the last couple years, we&rsquo;ve seen an evolution on this directory search model from Mashape, in the form of a hub or marketplace. Managed directories have their place in the world of API discovery, similar to the web directory realm, but as the number of APIs grow, we are desperately needing to go beyond just directory based API discovery, and like with the web, establish a meaningful search layer&mdash;we need a Google of API search.</p>
<p>This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist developed APIs.json, and the first open tooling on top of the API discovery format, we called <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>. We do not believe APIs.json + APIs.io is the next Google, but we do feel it will jumpstart the conversation around what is needed when it comes to API discovery. How do we find the best of breed APIs, not just on keyword search in the title and description, or driven from tags? We need a way for API providers to describe their APIs, and supporting building blocks, in a machine readable, distributed way, that can be indexed by many API discovery solutions.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When searching for APIs, we will need to find specific API interfaces, with very specialized terms of service, and pricing. We will need API rating solutions like <a href="http://api500.com/">API Rating Agency</a> baked into our API search algorithms. We need an extensible API discovery format, this is APIs.json. We need an open source search engine, that can be deployed as general search engine, or deployed as a specialized, niche, API search engine serving a specific business sector, like government--this is APIs.io.</p>
<p>APIs.io now has 128 APIs in its index, submitted by 91 maintainers. We are just getting started, defining what is next for both APIs.json, and APIs.io, make sure and get involved early on, and help make your mark on this rapidly expanding world of API discovery.  You can <a href="http://apis.io/apis/add">add your APIs to APIs.io</a>, <a title="fork the open source API search engine code" href="https://github.com/apisio/apis.io">fork the open source API search engine code</a>&nbsp;(coming soon) and launch your own API search engine, or <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">provide feedback on the next version of APIs.json</a>, the format that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> help discover the valuable API resources everyone will be depending on in the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-aud-shadow.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In a perfect world, every government agency, non-profit organization, and company would have an API, and the content and data available via their website, mobile applications, and other systems, would be accessible in an easy, machine readable way. This perfect world does not exist. Even though many government agencies, non-profit organizations, and companies are getting hip to the world of APIs, there is still massive amounts of work to be done, and I'm afraid if we want to see APIs across our government, we are going to have to do much of it ourselves.</p>
<p>I was listening to an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/02/327797193/digital-homestead-records-reopen-a-crucial-chapter-of-u-s-history">NPR story on the release of files detailing Nebraska's homesteading history</a>, a project between the National Archives and National Park Service, today. I wish I could be at all federal agencies, in all meetings, advocating for an API first approach to these projects--I can&rsquo;t. So, while we can celebrate the fact that the records around Nebraska&rsquo;s history have been digitized, and <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/homestead/">the website is very nice</a>, and usable for humans, THERE IS NO API!</p>
<p>This is when the private sector has to step in and help our federal government realize the importance and potential of an API--we need a shadow API for the homestead records database. While the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/homestead/">website is great for human consumptio</a>n, we also need a simple, machine readable API that other applications can put to use. It would be nice if the National Archives and National Park Service had made the API a priority, but I think this is where the private sector needs to step in, and make it happen.</p>
<p>I have direct orders from my super secret White House contact(s) to challenge you, Joe and Jane citizen to see who can launch an API faster, around content or data that is already public (no hacking)&mdash;the federal government, or you the average tech savvy citizen. I won&rsquo;t give up my sources, but I&rsquo;m dead serious when I say the White House asked me to put the word out on this.</p>
<p>Data sources like Nebraskas homestead records, are well structured web searches, and not that difficult to scrape. A savvy programmer could easily write a script to do it, and hand roll a simple API for others access the records. I also think a tech savvy non-programmer, could make happen by employing a modern API deployment tools like <a href="http://bit.ly/1iZ9EQ6">ScraperWiki</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a>, or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>. I don&rsquo;t imagine it taking more than a day or two, to scrape the data, and deploy a simple API interface from the results.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a new concept, something API devlopers have been doing a while. The <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/2010/12/15">first Instagram API was a shadow API,</a> deployed by independent 3rd party developer, who reverse engineered the mobile application. Kimono Labs also just launched an <a href="http://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer">unofficial World Cup API</a>, allowing for <a href="http://webkite.com/world-cup/">some pretty cool applications to be built on top of the shadow API</a>. Shadow APIs have been being deployed for years, we just need to make them more of a mainstream, acceptable way to make resources available via APIs, real fast!</p>
<p>If you know of a shadow API you would like to see built, or you are available to deploy shadow APIs, let me know. There are some things I&rsquo;d like to see in quality shadow API deployments around government data (maybe another story), and I can help you get the word out when the time is right. In my opinion, if content or data is already available via a government website, or as a full data dowload, there should be an API for it. Period.</p>
<p>What do you think? Who is going to build my Nebraska homestead record API, before I can harass the National Archives and National Park Service to do it?</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a style="padding: 15px;" href="http://www.caulfield.pw:3000/view/welcome-visitors"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/smallest-federated-wiki/smallest-federated-wiki.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm always working to better understand the best of breed technology solutions available online today, and to me, this means, lightweight, machine readable apps that do one thing and do it well. One solution I&rsquo;m looking at is called the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caulfield.pw:3000/view/welcome-visitors">Smallest Federated Wiki</a>, from Mike Caulfield(<a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a>), which has been on my list for several weeks now, but one of his <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/20/smallest-federated-wiki-as-a-universal-json-canvas/">latest posts has floated it back onto my priority list</a>.</p>
<p>To understand what the Smallest Federated Wiki (SFW) is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikA5rHA1uDg">check out the video</a>. I haven&rsquo;t personally downloaded and installed yet, which is something I do with all solutions that I&rsquo;m evaluating. SFW is Node.js, and <a href="https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki-node-server">available on Github</a>, if you want to play with as well--I'm going to be installing on AWS if you need an AMI. This post is all about understanding SFW, and light the fire under my own use of SFW, and hopefully stimulating your interest.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong><br /> Building off the simplicity of the Wiki, SFW borrows from the best features of Wiki, Github, and rolled together into simple, but ultimately powerful implementation that embraces the latest in technology from Node.js to HTML5. I know how hard it can be to achieve "simple", and while playing with SFW, I can tell a lot of work has gone into keeping things as fucking simple as possible. #win</p>
<p><strong>Federated</strong><br /> I love me some Wikipedia and Github, but putting my valuable content, and hard work into someone else&rsquo;s silo is proving to be a very bad idea. For all of my projects, I want to be able maximize collaboration, syndication and reach, without giving away ownership of my intellectual exhaust (IE) . SFW reflects this emotion, and allows me to browse other people&rsquo;s work, fork, re-use, while also maintaining my own projects within my silo, and enable other people to fork, and re-use from my work as well--SFW is a sneak peak at how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> modern applications <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHOULD</span> operate.</p>
<p><strong>JSON Extensible</strong><br /> SFW has the look and feel of a new age wiki, allowing you two generate pages and pages of content, but the secret sauce underneath is JSON. Everything on SFW is JSON driven, allowing for unlimited extensibility. <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/20/smallest-federated-wiki-as-a-universal-json-canvas/">MIke's latest blog post on how SFW&rsquo;s extensibility is unlimited</a>, due to it's JSON driven architecture, is why I'm floating SFW back on my review list. My 60+ API Evangelist projects all start with basic page, and blog content, but then rely on JSON driven research for companies, building blocks, tools, services, and many other data points that I track on for the space&mdash;SFW reflects the JSON extensibility I&rsquo;ve been embracing for the last couple years, but I'm doing this manually, SFW is by default.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity And Complexity</strong><br /> SFW achieves a simplicity, combined with the ability to extend the complexity in any way you choose. I can create a simple 3 page project site with it, or I could create a federated news application, allowing thousands of people to publish, curate, fork, remix, and collaborate around links&mdash;think Reddit, but federated. I envision SFW templates or blueprints, that allow me to quickly deploy a basic project blog, or CRM, news, research, and other more complex solutions. With <a href="http://www.docker.com/">new cloud deployment options like Docker emerging</a>, I see a future where I can quickly deploy these federated blueprints, on the open web, on-premise, or anywhere I desire.</p>
<p>I have a lot of ideas that I want to contribute to the SFW roadmap, but I need to get more seat hours, playing with the code, before I can intelligently contribute. Once i get my base SFW setup, I will start brainstorming on the role APIs can play in the SFW plugin layer., and scenarios for rapidly building SFW blueprint containers.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> While SFW has been on my Evernote todo list for several weeks, it was Mike's continued storytelling which bumped up the priority. Without the storytelling and evangelism, nothing happens--something Mike references in his post.</p>

Common types of intellectual property rights include copyright, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights, trade dress, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.</a></em></blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the phrase intellectual property, specifically because it includes &ldquo;property&rdquo;. Nothing that comes from my intellect is property. Nothing. It isn&rsquo;t something you can own or control. Sorry, what gets generated from my intellect, wants to be free, not owned or controlled&mdash;it is just the way it is. I cannot be creative, generate my ideas and projects, if I know the output or results will be locked up.</p>
<p>With this in mind I want to craft a new expression to describe the result of my intellectual output, I&rsquo;m going to call intellectual exhaust (IE). I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust">term exhaust, which has numerous definitions</a>, and reflects what can be emitted from my daily thoughts. You are welcome to collect, observe, remix, learn from, or get high off of the exhaust off my daily work&mdash;go right ahead, this is one of the many reasons I work so hard each day. You my loyal reader. One. Single.</p>
<p>In my opinion, you can even make money off my intellectual exhaust, however, no matter what you do, make sure you attribute back, letting people know where your ideas come from. And if you do make some money from it, maybe you can kick some of that back, supporting the things that fuel my intellectual exhaust:  sleep, food, water, beer, and interactions with other smart people around the globe. ;-)</p>
<p>P.S. There are other things that fuel my intellectual exhaust, but my lawyer and my girlfriend say I can&rsquo;t include some of them.</p>
<p>P.S.S. My girlfriend is not my lawyer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/Amazon_S3_Site.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm spending a lot of time updating my<a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com"> API deployment research</a>&nbsp;lately, making sure it reflects what is truly going on out there in the space. In addition to tracking on legacy approaches to API deployment like enterprise API gateways, or using an open-source API frameworks, I am also trying to understand the realities of scraping data for deployment of APIs, and new solutions from API platforms like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1jLr1Pf">StrongLoop</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to the realities of deploying an API, your data or content sources is likely to come from a myriad of file stores, databases, and other systems, and I&rsquo;m looking to explore as many of the as I possibly can. Todays exploration is focused on deploying an API, using Amazon S3 as a file store. I use Amazon S3 for all my heavy object storage which includes images, PDFs, XML, JSON and CSV data stores&mdash;it makes sense that someone companies would want to deploy APIs using their Amazon S3 stores.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-s3.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APISpark as my API deployment platform, which allows me to first establish a datastore, which is mapped to a specific bucket within my Amazon S3. What I put into my buckets, and folders is up to me. I might use it to quickly provide access to my images, a folder of XML files, PDFs, or other resource. Once I have my datastore defined, I can deploy a simple web API using APISpark, which gives me all the expected features of an API&mdash;URL API endpoints, documentation, code samples, basic authentication (username / password), analytics, and much more.</p>
<p>As with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/30/deploy-an-api-from-a-google-spreadsheet-using-apispark/">Google Spreadsheet to API example I wrote on Monday</a>, this scenario allows anyone who manages content and data, to easily organize it on S3, then deploy an API for access, with no IT or developer experience required. You might need to share images, files, or other content with another department within your company or organization, partners outside the corporate firewall, or maybe some 3rd party developers you have building a new website or mobile application.</p>
<p>API deployment is getting easier, and cloud API service providers like APISpark are making API deployment something ANYONE can do&mdash;stop waiting for IT or developer resources! ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-deployment-2.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I continue my research the world of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a>, I'm trying to distill the services, and tooling I come across, down into what I consider to be a common set of building blocks. My goal with identifying API deployment building blocks is to provide a simple list of what the moving parts are, that enable API providers to successfully deploy their services.</p>
<p>Some of these building blocks overlap with other core areas of my research like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, but I hope this list captures the basic building blocks of what anyone needs to know, to be able to follow the world of API deployment. While this post is meant for a wider audience, beyond just developers, I think it provides a good reminder for developers as well, and can help things come into focus. (I know it does for me!)</p>
<p>Also there is some overlap between some of these building blocks, like API Gateway and API Proxy, both doing very similiar things, but labeled differently. Identifying building blocks for me, can be very difficult, and I'm constantly shifting definitions around, until I find a comfortable fit--so some of these will evolve, especially with the speed at which things are moving in 2014.</p>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-csv.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>CSV to API</strong>&nbsp;- Text files that contain comma separate values or CSVs, is one of the quickest ways to convert existing data to an API. Each row of a CSV can be imported and converted to a record in a database, and easily generate a RESTful interface that represents the data stored in the CSV. CSV to API can be very messy depending on the quality of the data in the CSV, but can be a quick way to breathe new life into old catalogs of data lying around on servers or even desktops. The easiest way to deal with CSV is to import directly into database, than generate API from database, but the process can be done at time of API creation.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-database.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Database to API</strong>&nbsp;- Database to API is definitely the quickest way to generate an API. If you have valuable data, generally in 2013, it will reside in a Microsoft, MySQL, PostgreSQL or other common database platform. Connecting to a database and generate a CRUD, or create, read, updated and delete API on an existing data make sense for a lot of reason. This is the quickest way to open up product catalogs, public directories, blogs, calendars or any other commonly stored data. APIs are rapidly replace database connections, when bundled with common API management techniques, APIs can allow for much more versatile and secure access that can be made public and shared outside the firewall.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Framework</strong>&nbsp;- There is no reason to hand-craft an API from scratch these days. There are numerous frameworks out their that are designed for rapidly deploying web APIs. Deploying APIs using a framework is only an option when you have the necessary technical and developer talent to be able to understand the setup of environment and follow the design patterns of each framework. When it comes to planning the deployment of an API using a framework, it is best to select one of the common frameworks written in the preferred language of the available developer and IT resources. Frameworks can be used to deploy data APIs from CSVs and databases, content from documents or custom code resources that allow access to more complex objects.</td>

<tr>
<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-proxy.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Gateway</strong>&nbsp;- API gateways are enterprise quality solutions that are designed to expose API resources. Gateways are meant to provide a complete solution for exposing internal systems and connecting with external platforms. API gateways are often used to proxy and mediate existing API deployments, but may also provide solutions for connecting to other internal systems like databases, FTP, messaging and other common resources. Many public APIs are exposed using frameworks, most enterprise APIs are deployed via API gateways--supporting much larger ideployments.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-proxy.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Proxy</strong>&nbsp;- API proxy are common place for taking an existing API interface, running it through an intermediary which allows for translations, transformations and other added services on top of API. An API proxy does not deploy an API, but can take existing resources like SOAP, XML-RPC and transform into more common RESTful APIs with JSON formats. Proxies provide other functions such as service composition, rate limiting, filtering and securing of API endpoints. API gateways are the preffered approach for the enterprise, and the companies that provide services support larger API deployments.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-connector" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Connector</strong>&nbsp;- Contrary to an API proxy, there are API solutions that are proxyless, while just allowing an API to connect or plugin to the advanced API resources. While proxies work in many situations, allowing APIs to be mediated and transformed into required interfaces, API connectors may be preferred in situations where data should not be routed through proxy machines. API connector solutions only connect to existing API implementations are easily integrated with existing API frameworks as well as web servers like Nginx.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-hosting" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- Hosting is all about where you are going to park your API. Usual deployments are on-premise within your company or data center, in a public cloud like Amazon Web Services or a hybrid of the two. Most of the existing service providers in the space support all types of hosting, but some companies, who have the required technical talent host their own API platforms. With HTTP being the transport in which modern web APIs put to use, sharing the same infrastructure as web sites, hosting APIs does not take any additional skills or resources, if you already have a web site or application hosting environment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Versioning</strong>&nbsp;- There are many different approaches to managing different version of web APIs. When embarking on API deployment you will have to make a decision about how each endpoint will be versioned and maintained. Each API service provider offers versioning solutions, but generally it is handled within the API URI or passed as an HTTP header. Versioning is an inevitable part of the API life-cycle and is better to be integrated by design as opposed to waiting until you are forced to make a evolution in your API interface.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-documents.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- API documentation is an essential building block for all API endpoints. Quality, up to date documentation is essential for on-boarding developers and ensuring they successfully integrate with an API. Document needs to be derived from quality API designs, kept up to date and made accessible to developers via a portal. There are several tools available for automatically generting documentation and even what is called interactive documentation, that allows for developers to make live calls against an API while exploring the documentation. API documentation is part of every API deployment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Code Samples</strong>&nbsp;- Second to documentation, code samples in a variety of programming languages is essential to a successful API integration. With quality API design, generating samples that can be used across multiple API resources is possible. Many of the emerging API service providers and the same tools that generate API documentation from JSON definitions can also auto generate code samples that can be used by developers. Generation of code samples in a variety of programming languages is a requirement during API deployment.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-scraper.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Scraping</strong>&nbsp;- Harvesting or scraping of data from an existing website, content or data source. While we all would like content and data sources to be machine readable, sometimes you have just get your hands dirty and scrape it. While I don't support scraping of content in all scenarios, and business sectors, but in the right situations scraping can provide a perfectly acceptable content or data source for deploying an API.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Container</strong>&nbsp;- The new virtualization movement, lead by Docket, and support by Amazon, Google, Red Hat, Microsoft, and many more, is providing new ways to package up APIs, and deploy as small, modular, virtualized containers.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- Github provides a simple, but powerful way to support API deployment, allowing for publsihing of a developer portal, documentation, code libraries, TOS, and all your supporting API business building blocks, that are necessary for API effort. At a minimum Github should be used to manage public code libraries, and engage with API consumers using Github's social features.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Terms of Use / Service</strong>&nbsp;- Terms of Use provide a legal framework for developers to operate within. They set the stage for the business development relationships that will occur within an API ecosystem. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API. Make sure an APIs TOS pass insepection with the lawyers, but also strike a healthy balance within the ecosystem and foster innovation.</td>

<p>Spreadsheet are the most used datastore in business. When Google came out with their web-based spreadsheet, it was a game changer (for those who have access), when it came to managing, collaborating and sharing small data sets.</p>
<p>When it comes to data management, not all of us live in the world of big data, and spreadsheets are a quick and dirty data store that gets the job done.  As the web was maturing, Google saw an opportunity, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs">launched the labs version of Google Spreadsheets in mid 2006</a>, bringing spreadsheets into the web 2.0 era of the Internet. In 2014, the next step, in the evolution of the spreadsheet, is to be able to plug spreadsheets directly into the API economy, allowing spreadsheet data stewards to make their valuable content and data available to web, mobile and Internet of things (Iot) developers via simple web APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/gdata/samples/spreadsheet_sample">Google Spreadsheets allows for accessing data via a JSON feed natively</a>, and I wrote about adding an API, plus management layer on top of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">private</a> Google Spreadsheet, but there is also an instant, cloud-based approach to deploying an API from Google Spreadsheet, using <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>. Restlet has taken their open source REST framework, launched it as a service, and opened up the possibility for anyone to deploy an API, from an existing Google Spreadsheet&mdash;no coding necessary.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-spreadsheet-api.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>APISpark has provided both the API deployment, plus API management layer, spreadsheet owners will need. This is an important evolution in the API economy, because it allows people who are actually managing vital data to securely expose it, for use in applications, without needing any developer or IT resources. This will bring data stewards closer to the actual people who need their data, whether it be internally between systems or business units, externally with partners, or even publicly for anyone looking to use a dataset on a website or application.</p>
<p>A lot can be lost in translation, when a dataset has to go through IT, or developers before it can be made available as an API, not to mention the cost savings in being able to cut out the middleman. If we can equip any small business, enterprise, non-profit, or government data steward, who spends their day managing content and data in spreadsheets, with the ability to securely expose, and easily manage APIs from those data sources&mdash;imagine the fuel that will be fed to the API economy.</p>
<p>I am working on other walk-throughs, demonstrating how to expose datasets managed in <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Google Spreadsheets, as APIs, using APISpark.</a> When I get up, I will publish here on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, as well as on my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API Deployment research site</a>, for folks to learn from.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/legos.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working the great feedback we've had on <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, an adding everything to the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">Github issues for consideration in the next version</a>. Today I&rsquo;m spending a little time thinking through the big picture of APIs.json, and some of the building blocks I'd like to see reflected when API providers generate their APIs.json.</p>
<p>Each API listed in an APIs.json has what we are calling: <em>"Properties Elements&rdquo;.</em> The properties element is a collection, with two values: <em>type and url.</em> While we provide you with a base set of property element types you can reference:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Swagger</li>
<li>RAML</li>
<li>Blueprint</li>
<li>WADL</li>
<li>WSDL</li>
<li>TermsOfService</li>
<li>InterfaceLicense</li>
<li>StatusPage</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>AlertsTwitterHandle</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to continue providing, &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; types that we recognize, while also leaving properties elements, being as organic as possible&mdash;meaning you can define your own references, and tell the story of why these are important building blocks in your own API strategy. We will continue adding the best properties we see being used, to the APIs.json spec.</p>
<p>To prepare for the next version of APIs.json, I want to have the next list of reserved property types. Working from my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a> I&rsquo;ve identified X I&rsquo;d like to see in the next version:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

</ul>
<p>These are the building blocks I think are important to API operations. Currently all of these will be links to human readable pages, within an APIs developer portal, but eventually I envision all of these potentially being machine readable.</p>
<p>I know, this is a big vision, but I intend to make it a reality. The first machine readable element on this list is the InterfaceLicense, which will reference the <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">machine readable JSON manifest</a> for <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>Next on the list is TermsOfService, which I will be using <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read&rsquo;s</a> machine readable format, and applying it to the world of APIs. If there are any types you&rsquo;d like to see in the next version of APIs.json, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues/44">Github issue I created for this discussion</a>, and make sure it is on the list.</p>
