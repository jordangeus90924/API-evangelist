The ability to explain your API to developers and potential developers critical to the success of your API. While it's important to be able to explain to potential business partners and customers about the problems your API solves, at the end of the day it is crucial that you be able to provide them with the tools -- and the documentation -- to actually do it.

The importance of documentation -- samples, training materials, guides, docs -- can't be understated. Quality [documentation and reference material for your Application Programming Interface][1] (API) can be the difference between a developer adopting your API or moving on to another vendor. And yet these can be difficult documents to collect and/or to write.
