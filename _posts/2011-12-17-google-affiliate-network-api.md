Google just launched their new [Google Affiliate Network API][1], which allows publishers and advertisers to automate various tasks related to the [Google Affiliate Network][2].

The Google Affiliate Network is the affiliate network, formerly known as Doubleclick Performics, which was part of [Googleâ€™s Doublick acquisition in April of 2007][3].

Using the new Google Affiliate Network APIs, developers can programmaticaly manage:

  * **Advertiser Lookup** \- Publishers can now use the Google Affiliate Network API to access data that advertisers have chosen to share with them.
  * **Event and Order Details** \- Developers can easily integrate data from events that occur in Google Affiliate Network into their own website's workflow and internal systems.
  * **Publisher Lookup** \- Advertisers can use the API to look up data that publishers have chosen to share with them

I need to play with the network more to understand how it works from both an advertisers and publishers perspective.

It looks like an interesting addition to the suite of publishing, advertising and revenue generating tools from Google like [Google Analytics][4], [Google Adwords][5], [Google Adsense][6] and [Google Webmaster Tools][7].
