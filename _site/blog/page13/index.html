			<p><em>25 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I'm always learning from the API pioneers, and trying to understand how they are pushing forward the API conversation. I'm neck deep in profiling AWS APIs, as well as Google APIs. One common pattern I'm seeing across both providers is the support for API access in both Visual Studio and Eclipse IDEs.&nbsp;
Google is helping developers find APIs within both of the leading IDE platforms. They have long had some Eclipse plugins for their API infrastructure, but I recently noticed&nbsp;they also have a pretty robust solution for Visual Studio developers. The Google APIs .NET library is made available in Visual Studio using the&nbsp;NuGet package manager, opening up access to a significant portion of their API stack.
Amazon also provides Eclipse and Visual Studio tooling as part of their&nbsp;AWS toolbox. Opening up access the AWS API catalog to developers in the IDE they are are using to build their applications and craft their system integrations. I don't know how much time you've spent looking through the AWS catalog, but it can be a timesucker--giving me access to APIs in my native environment makes a lot sense.
I feel like API innovation in the IDE is right there with API integration into our continuous integration workflows, and the usage of Github. You should haven't to depend on Google to find your APIs, they should be right at your fingertips in your IDE, no matter whether they are for your applications, or for managing your API operations. All your internal, and 3rd party APIs should be baked into your development, and continuous integration environments, allowing you to orchestrate exactly the application experience, and life cycle you desire. This is just one of the fronts I'd like to see API discovery evolve in coming years, reaching developers with new APIs and paths during design and development, as well as across continuous integration stages of our work.

			<p><em>25 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>I just got an email from my DNS provider CloudFlare about rate limiting and protecting my APIs. I am a big fan of CloudFlare, partly because I am a customer, and I use to manage my own infrastructure, but also partly due to the way they understand APIs, and actively use them as part of their business, products, and services. Their email spans a couple areas of my research that I find interesting, and extremely relevant: 1) DNS, 2) Security, 3) Management. They are offering me something that is traditionally done at the API management layer (rate limiting), but now offering to do it for me at the DNS layer, expanding the value of API rate limiting into the realm of security, and specifically in defense against DDoS attacks--a serious concern. Talk about an easy way to add value to my world as an API provider. One that is frictionless, because I'm already depending on them for the DNS layer of my web, and API layers of operations. All I have to do is signup for the new service, and begin dialing it in for my all of my APIs, which span multiple domains--all conveniently managed using CloudFlare. Another valuable thing CloudFlare's approach does, in my opinion, is to reintroduce the concept of rate limiting to the world of websites. This helps me in my argument that companies, organizations, institutions and government agencies should be considering having APIs to alleviate website scraping. Using CloudFlare they can now rate limit the website while pointing legitimate use cases to the API where their access can be measured, metered, and even monetized when it makes sense. I'm hoping that CloudFlare will be exposing all of these services via their API, so that I can automate the configuration of rate limiting for my APIs at the DNS level using APIs. As I design and deploy new API endpoints I want them automatically protected at the DNS layer using CloudFlare....[<a href="/2017/04/25/api-rate-limiting-at-the-dns-layer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>There is some rumors circling about more government open data going way, this round is at the EPA. The EPA says the data isn't going anywhere, but understandably there are some serious concerns about the availability and reliability of environmental data from federal agencies during a Trump administration. With the looming government shutdown, I'll renew some of my old arguments around how we can make government data more accessible and making a difference--thoughts I developed during the 2013 shutdown. Communication And CollaborationFirst and foremost, communication around API operations is essential for any kind of reliability. Too often the providers behind APIs, and even consumers of APIs are radio silent. Refusing to coorindate and communicate around the realities of API operations and integrations. I don't expect all government APIs to stay in operation for every, but I to expect all API providers to be honest and communicative about past, present, and future of API operations. Access To The Raw DataAlongside every government data API, there should be a download to the raw data behind the API. This is the best way to keep data available. Allowing developers to download and put data to use directly in their local environment, bypassing or augmenting any dependence on the API. Remember that not everyone will have the resources and skills to make this happen, so it shouldn't be instead of API, but complimenting any API, providing more complete access for those who need it.  Use And Share A Common API Definition And SchemaWhen you define and share your API using machine readable specifications like OpenAPI it has the potential to turn an single API into a common set of federated APIs, all working together for a common goal. In addition to helping generate API documentation, and code in a variety of languages, an OpenAPI for all government APIs would make them more accessible, as well as reusable. Cached Or Slave API DeploymentWhen any API employs a common API definition...[<a href="/2017/04/24/the-concern-around-availability-and-reliability-of-government-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>Data is power. If you have valuable data, people want it. While this is the current way of doing things on the Internet, it really isn't a new concept. The data in databases has always been wielded alongside business and political objectives. I have worked professionally as a database engineer for 30 years this year, with my first job building COBOL databases for use in schools across the State of Oregon in 1987, and have seen many different ways that data is the fuel for the engines of power. Data is valuable. We put a lot of work into acquiring, creating, normalizing, updating, and maintaining our data. However, this value only goes so far if we keep it siloed, and isolated. We have to be able to open up our data to other stakeholders, partners, or possibly even the public. This is where modern approaches to APIs can help us in some meaningful ways, allowing data stewards to sensibly, and securely open up access to valuable API resources using low-cost web technology. One of the most common obstacles I see impeding companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies from achieving API success, center around restrictive views on data licensing, not being able to separate the data layers by using APIs, and being overly concerned about a loss of power when you publish APIs. You worked hard to develop the data you have, but you also want to make accessible. To protect our interests I see many folks impose pretty proprietary restrictions around their data, which ends up hurting its usage and viability in partner systems, and introducing friction when it comes to accessing and putting data to work--when this is the thing you really want as a data steward. Let me take a stab at helping you reduce this friction by better understanding how APIs can help you peel the licensing onion layers back when it comes to your valuable data.

			<p><em>24 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>I talked about Google's shift towards providing an SLA across their cloud services last week, and this week I'd like to highlight APIMetric's&nbsp;Cloud API Service Consistency (CASC) score, and how it can be applied to determine if an API is meeting their SLA or not. APIMetric&nbsp;came up with the CASC Score as part of their APImetrics Insights analytics package, and has shown been very open with the API ranking system, as well as the data behind. The CASC score provides us with an API reliability and stability ranking for us to apply across our APIs, providing one very important layer of a comprehensive API rating system&nbsp;that we can use across the industries being impacted by APIs. I said in my story about Google's SLAs that companies should have an API present for their APIs. They will also need to ensure that 3rd party API service providers like APIMetrics are gathering the data, and providing us with a CASC score for all the APIs we depend on in our businesses.&nbsp; I know that external monitoring service providers like APIMetrics, and API ranking systems like the CASC score make some API providers nervous, but if you want to sell to the enterprise, government, and other critical infrastructure, you will need to over it. I also recommend that you work hard to reduce barriers for API service providers to get at the data they need, as well as get out there way when it comes to publish the data publicly, and sharing or aggregating it as part of industry level rating for groups of APIs. If we want this API economy, that we keep talking about to scale, we are going to have to make sure we have SLAs, and ensuring we are meeting them throughout our operations. SLA monitoring helps us meet our contractual engagements with our customers, but they are also beginning to contribute to an overall ranking system being used across the industries we operate...[<a href="/2017/04/24/a-ranking-score-to-determine-if-your-api-was-sla-compliant/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I've been working my way through all of the Google APIs, making sure I have an OpenAPI for each API, as well as an APIs.json&nbsp;for the entire API operations. One of the things I index as part of each APIs.json&nbsp;when it is present, is a service level agreement (SLA). Something I found to quickly becoming standard across Google APIs.
In this round of research, I found 17 API-driven services at Google that had an SLA present:

App Engine - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/sla
BigQuery - https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sla
Compute - https://cloud.google.com/compute/sla
Container Engine - https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/sla
DataFlow - https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/sla
DataProc - https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/resources/sla
DataStore -&nbsp;https://cloud.google.com/datastore/sla
DNS - https://cloud.google.com/dns/sla
Cloud Key Management - https://cloud.google.com/kms/sla
Machine Learning Engine - https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/sla
Maps - https://enterprise.google.com/maps/terms/maps-sla.html
Prediction - https://cloud.google.com/prediction/sla
Pub/Sub - https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/sla
Spanner - https://cloud.google.com/spanner/sla
SQL - https://cloud.google.com/sql/sla
StackDriver - https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/sla
Storage - https://cloud.google.com/storage/sla

Like the rest of the startup space recently, Google has been making the shift towards selling to the enterprise. The days of having open access to APIs, with no business model involved, and no guarantees a certain level of service are gone. Before any large organization is going to bake an API into their operations, they are going to need an SLA present as part of the deal.
I'll keep an eye out for other API providers who make an SLA available, and see if I can keep track of this shift to doing business the enterprise in startup land. I have some more questions about SLA beyond just revenue exchanged for an API, and how an API contract, backed by an SLA holds up as part of the startup life cycle--more specifically, how it holds up as part of an acquisition.

			<p><em>21 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>As one of my clients is preparing to move their API from deployment to management, I'm helping them think through what is necessary to make sure their API is ready for use by a wider, more public group of developers. Ideally, I am brought into the discussion earlier on in the lifecycle, to influence design and deployment decisions, but I'm happy to be included at any time during the process. This is a generalized, and anonymized version of what I'm proposing to my client, to help make sure their API is ready for prime time--I just wanted to share with you a little of what goes on behind the scenes at API Evangelist, even when my clients aren't quite ready to talk publicly. External Developer Number OneThe first place I can help with the release of your API is when it comes to being the first external developer and fresh pair of eyes on your API. I can help with signing up, and actually making calls against every API, to make sure things are coherent and stable before putting in the hands of 3rd party developers at a hackathon, amongst partners, or the general public. This is a pre-requisite for me when it comes to writing a story on any API or doing additional consulting work, as it puts me in tune with what an API actual does, or doesn't do. The process will help provide you with a new perspective on the project after you have put so much work into the platform--in my case, it is a fresh pair of eyes that have on-boarded with 1000s of APIs. Crafting Your API Developer PortalYour operations will need a single place to go to engage with everything API. I always recommend deploying API portals using Github Pages, because it becomes the first are to engage with developers on Github, as part of your overall API efforts.

			<p><em>21 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>I am working with an enterprise group to develop a curriculum that will be used across internal training workshops executed around the globe. They are looking to push their entire company towards an API way of doing things, and empower business and IT groups to realize their API potential. I'm anonymizing the company, as they have not agreed to me talking about publicly, but as I do, I wanted to share my work behind the scenes, and help other organizations&nbsp;be aware of the work that I do. The API training curriculum is going to be designed to reach and bring up to speed three levels of internal users: API Beginners -&nbsp;The introduction to the world of APIs for business or technical groups. API Partners -&nbsp;An outward focus for how APIs bring value to the organization and operations. API Trainers -&nbsp;Training the next generation of trainers, evangelists, and storytellers within the organization. The beginner level will be designed for all employees to attend, no matter which group they come from. The second level of training will focus on equipping the more outward focused employees, with the third tier focusing on the long-term institutionalization of an API-first approach across the company. Customized tiers can be developed in the future, but these three levels will get things moving across all areas of global operations. Here is a summary of how the training will be developed and executed: Design Curriculum&nbsp;- Design, develop, and prepare the curriculum, and the materials for all three workshop levels. Run Pilot Sessions&nbsp;- Conduct 2-3 pilot sessions with a controlled group of users, with possible changes, and additions to the content. Execute Workshops&nbsp;- Execute workshops in up to five countries initially, targeting only English speaking regions in the first round. Train the Trainer -&nbsp;Organize a train-the-trainer session for future API Evangelists, and workshop trainers, preparing for future rollout.

			<h3><a href="/2017/04/21/continuous-integration-conversational-interfaces/">Continuous Integration Conversational Interfaces</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I recently wrote about how Zapier's new command line interface has a continuous integration feel to it, and while I was writing the piece, I kept thinking about how these integration apps could be used as part of conversational interfaces. I'm thinking about messaging, voice, or even embeddable conversational interfaces, and Zapier's CLI could be used to define some known conversational scenarios we encounter on a regular basis.
I'm thinking about the side of conversational interfaces that is more known and scripted. I'm not thinking about creating applications that could hold their own in a natural language conversation, but ones could be defined as part of known business processes, matching a well-defined question and set of rules. "put new RSS feed post into Google Sheet", or "take new Instagram photos, and Tweet it out". A well-scripted set of business actions that I conduct on a regular basis. Applications defined and managed via Zapier CLI, that are continuously integrated, into the conversational interfaces I use regularly use - Slack, Twitter, Facebook, my browser, and SMS on my iPhone.
I want an application&nbsp;for each of the micro conversation I have with online services each day. If a new conversation hasn't been defined, I want an easy way to articulate myself in terms of the 750+ applications that Zapier integrates with, and a way to have these Node.js applications introduced into the continuous integration for my conversational interfaces. I want all my conversational interfaces to be automated, with hundreds or thousands of little conversations going on in the background of my operations each day. The command line seems like an appropriate layer to make these conversational requests a reality--especially since Zapier is already having the conversations with the service I'm depending each day.

			<p>The world is built on stories. People enjoy telling and hearing stories. Stories are the lifeblood of what I do as the API Evangelist and are the number one way I stay in touch with people across many different industries and around the globe. As a single person shop there is only so many calls I can conduct in any single day, and there are only so many folks I can ping on a regular basis to stay in touch--I rely on the power of stories to do the hard work for me, acting as the distributed glue in my world. When I connect with someone new via Twitter, email, or in person, I always close up the conversation with, "if you ever have any good stories for me to tell, either anonymously, or directly, make sure and reach out". I do need the stories, but my primary objective in doing this is to keep the communication channels open and encourage folks to do the heavy lifting when it comes to remembering to reaching out to me and renew the connection between us. The urge to share (and be heard) or hear a good story is always much stronger than the desire to buy or sell a product (aka sales lead), making this approach produce the return on investment (ROI) I am looking for. I see my approach in contrast to the urge to tip of major tech blogs about a product release or investment because it often isn't about the tech--it almost always is about the humans. Companies want to talk to Techcrunch when a product, feature, investment, or press releases, and people contact me when something good or bad has happened involving the humans. Sure, I still get the regular release engagement, but it is the stories that truly matter to me, and to my readers. Storytelling is the way I reach a large audience on a regular basis, and the way that a...[<a href="/2017/04/20/stories-are-the-best-way-to-keep-the-door-open/">Read More</a>]</p>

I have three developers who are ready to work on some projects, as well as an ongoing stream of potential developers I would like to keep busy working on a variety of implementations. I am focusing attention on the top four cloud platforms that companies are using today: AWS, Azure, Google, and Heroku.&nbsp; I am looking to develop a rolling wave of projects that will run on any cloud platform, as well as taking advantage of the unique features that each provider offers.

Heroku -&nbsp;A project site outlining the services, tooling, projects, and communication around HSDS Heroku development. I want to incentivize the develop of APIs, that follow v1.1 of the HSDS OpenAPI. I'm encouraging PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js implementations, but open to other suggestions. I would like to have very simple API implementations in each language, running on all four of the cloud platforms, with push button (or at least easy) installation from Github for each implementation. Ideally, we focus on single API implementations, until there is a complete toolbox that helps providers of all shapes and sizes. Then I'd love to see administrative, web search, and other applications that can be implemented on top of any HSDS API.

			<p>Integration platform as a service (iPaaS) provider Zapier recently launched a command line tool for managing your integrations, adding an interesting dimension to the platform--leaning in what feels like a continuous integration direction. The integration platform has long had a web builder for managing your integrations with over 750 API-driven services, using their APIs, but the command line interface feels like it's begging to be embedded into your development workflow and life cycle.&nbsp; Zapier is catering to engineers by allowing them to: Bring your Node libraries. Zapier CLI Apps are made entirely of Node JS code. Use whichever libraries from NPM that you like. You can control every aspect of how Zapier interacts with your API, and our schema defines how authentication, Triggers, Actions, and Searches work. Run your tests before you deploy. We believe unit testing is the best way to ensure high-quality code. You can use Mocha or another Node testing framework to feel confident in the code you deploy to Zapier. Your app can live in source control. Every aspect of your integration&mdash;and every change you make&mdash;is written in code. That means you can track changes with Git or other source control like you do on other projects. Version your app. You work in releases or sprints for the rest of your projects, why not do the same with your Zapier app? Turn your app updates into versions, then migrate some or all of your users to the latest version. Collaborate with teammates. You don&rsquo;t need to go it alone with your Zapier integration. A CLI app can be owned by more than one Zapier account, with new members quickly added using the tool. That way, the whole team can deploy updates to your Zapier app. Here are the benefits of the Zapier CLI over the current web builder: Coding locally. As mentioned above, you build CLI Apps on your local machine&mdash;not on Zapier's website. Improved control over authentication flow.

			<p><em>19 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>In my travels over the last couple of weeks I have found myself in two separate cities, listening to two separate stories about using APIs to help protect some valuable data, that someone was trying to defend, but also putting out there with APIs in hopes of generating revenue to keep things ing. Often times when you mention APIs to someone, they automatically think they will have less control over their data in a digital environment, but increasingly company's are realizing that they actually have the potential to result in more control. In Oxford, UKWhile in Oxford I met with the dictionaries&nbsp;API team, as well as other groups in charge of the important resource, including the OED team. They have been working on their dictionary content since 1884. They have put a significant amount of work into their dictionaries, and are very keen on defending the value of this important resource, while also making it available for use by partners, as well as the public. They are looking for APIs to help them define their dictionary API resources, and evolve them based on the feedback of their trusted partners who are approved to use the APIs. In Boulder, COWhile in Boulder I met with a 211 data service provider, and a handful of their 211 operators who are looking for APIs to help them protect their valuable resources. Each city, county, or state organization has invested a lot into their databases of organizations, locations, and services that deliver vital human services in their local area. It takes a good deal of investment to maintain an up to date 211 system, and these operators are looking to fund that hard work using APIs, while also defending the integrity of their valuable resource--striking just the right balance with APIs. APIs are not a guarantee that your data will always be in a perfect state, and only in the hands of the right people, but a well-managed API...[<a href="/2017/04/19/protecting-our-valuable-data-with-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I've been tracking on how API providers operate their partner programs for a while now, in hopes of pulling together some sort of blueprint that other API providers can follow. I'm always happy to find stop along the API life cycle where an API provider has already developed a robust operational API, like the Google Partner API.
The Google Partner API provides the essential building blocks of a pretty sophisticated partner program API including company, messaging, company, lead, offer, status, profile, user, relations, and analytics. It is a nicely designed APIs, providing a complete set of paths, with lots of detail and robustness when it comes to the surface area of the API, the data it returns.&nbsp;
When you look at the documentation for the Google Partner API, it provides a good example of where Google is taking their API design across the company, by providing a REST, as well as a gRPC version of the resource. All future APIs at the search giant will be following this approach, providing simpler REST APIs, then higher performance editions if you want with gRPC.
Next time I update my partner API research, this story will be present. I will look for other partner API examples, and then take the design patterns present in the Google Partner API, and publish the OpenAPI for the project, as a suggestion for how you could design your partner API. Maybe I can even convince someone to craft some server-side implementations of the API, on a variety of platforms.

			<p><em>19 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I have been ranting about an icon set for the API community for over a year now. I want there to be more than just a set of SDK programming language icons. Something that would give us a visual API vocabulary, and allow us to plan, share, and implement API infrastructure like AWS is beginning to do with their own icon set, and their latest visual tooling for defining your architecture.
While profiling Google APIs, I'm seeing a pretty disorganized approach to logos beyond just core services, the absence of any dedicated icons that represent specific Google APIs. Amazon is pretty far ahead of the game when it comes visual iconography to represent the services they offer, and will dominate when it comes to visual life cycle tooling, unless Google, Microsoft, or some other provder&nbsp;begin to invest in meaningful icons.
Ideally, someone will do this in a more open source way, giving us the Schema.org for icons that represent cloud computing, machine learning, and the many other API driven resources being put to work today. Even if it is an open source solution, each service provider will have to be involved in some way, and invested in the process to some degree. I picture a world where API service providers like Zapier don't have to develop their own iconography, and there is a wealth of well thought out, and simply design icons for everyone to pick from.
What are you waiting for Google--get to work! ;-)

			<h3><a href="/2017/04/18/yaml-templates-for-api-operations/">YAML Templates For API Operations</a></h3>
			<p><em>18 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I am seeing a significant number of infrastructure orchestration solutions in the cloud start using YAML templates as the core setting of settings and instructions for workflows. Amazon recently introduced YAML templates for your AWS CloudFormations, where you can define the infrastructure templates you are using throughout the API life cycle. These AWS YAML templates are fast becoming the central definition to be used across AWS operations, with support in the AWS Service Catalog.
Whether you use AWS or not, working to define your infrastructure using YAML templates help define what is going on. I'm seeing significant adoption of OpenAPIs in YAML, and I'm even beginning to create API operational indexes using APIs.json&nbsp;converted into YAML (there is a naming lesson in there). I also have YAML templates for each area of my API lifecycle research, providing me machine readable definitions for everything from news to patents, that I then use across my API research&nbsp;and storytelling.
I feel the same way about YAML as I did about JSON a decade ago, and it is quickly becoming my preferred format for any structured data, no matter where it is used in my operations. YAML + Github is quickly becoming the engine for some interesting ways of delivering infrastructure, and specifically API infrastructure, in a consistent way that is easy to communicate with others. This example focuses on AWS usage of YAML, but it is something I'm seeing from Google&nbsp;and other tech giants. I think the readability of YAML (minus quotes and brackets) makes it accessible to a wider audience beyond developer groups, something that is going to be critical to doing APIs at scale.

			<p><em>18 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I'm always amazed at the number of companies I work with that do not consider log files a first class data system. Log files for servers, web servers, and other systems or applications are only for when something goes wrong. I have to admit, I'm in the same situation. I have APIs on the logging for my API management layer, but I do not have easy API access to my Linux servers or the Apache web server that runs on top of them.&nbsp;
I know that some companies use popular solutions like New Relic to do this, and I keep track on about eight API friendly logging solutions. I'm going to have to spend some time in my API logging research digging around for a solution I can use to stand up an API for my server(s). I'm not looking for any tooling on top of it, just something dead simple to parse my log files, put into a database, and allow me to wrap in a simple API for developing things on top of it.
The first thing I'll build is some analytics. Maybe there is some ready-to-go solution already out there, that are API-drive and familiar with server, or web server logs? It bothers me that logs aren't a first class data system in my operations. Maybe the awareness of crafting and developing against a logging API would help me get more in tune with this layer of data exhaust being generated from my operations daily. I'm guessing it will also help me get a handle on performance and security across my systems, helping take the health my operations up a notch or two.

Each API has the essential building blocks like getting started, documentation, pricing, and other resources. I don't see any machine readable index like APIs.json or OpenAPI but will keep an eye out. If I have the time I will generate an index for the project after I'm done with some of the other leading cloud and machine learning platforms like AWS and Google.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I'm in the middle of evolving a data schema to be a living breathing API. I just finished generating 130 paths, all with the same names as the schema tables and their fields. It's a natural beginning to any data-centric API. In these situations, it is easy for us to allow the backend system to dictate our approach to API design, rather than considering how the API will actually be used.
I'm taking the Human Service Data Specification (HSDS) schema, and generating the 130 create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) API paths I need for the API. This allows the organizations, location, services, and other details being managed as part of any human service API that will be managed in a very database-driven way. This makes sense to my database administrator brain, but as I sit in a room full of implementors I'm reminded that none of this matters&nbsp;if it isn't serving an actual business objective.
If my API endpoints don't allow a help desk technician properly search for a service, or a website user browse the possibilities to find what they are looking for, my API means nothing. The CRUD is the easy part. Understanding the many different ways my API paths will (or won't) help someone find the services they need&nbsp;or assist a human service organization to better reach their audience is what the API(s) are all about, not just simply reflecting the backend system, and then walking away calling the job done.

I rarely worry about these things, and in reality, I want to see way more competition and outlets when it comes to short and long form API storytelling--the API space needs as many voices as it possibly can. I'd like to see domain specific evangelists emerge, beyond individual API advocates. Someone covering industrial, machine learning, healthcare, and other significant verticals. We need to begin to cultivate domain expertise, and preferably&nbsp;vendor-agnostic, and tooling-comprehensive knowledge and accompanying storytelling. Some of these verticals are in desperate need of leadership, and I just don't have the time to focus in on any single area for too long. We need more practical, and hands-on API storytelling like we are seeing from the Nordic APIs. They are rocking the storytelling lately, exceeding the quality I can achieve on API Evangelist. They are hitting all the important areas of the&nbsp;API life cycle, and their storytelling is genuine, useful, and not pushing any single product or service. The Nordic APIs is invested in educating the community, something that makes their work stand out--emulate what they are up to if you need a model to follow, don't follow mine. #seriously If you are an API provider or possibly aggregator and marketplace, consider following the lead of BBVAOpen4U API Market, they produce some interesting content, as well as also have a good way of sharing and syndicating quality content from across the API space.&nbsp;I've seen a lot of companies come and go when it comes to aggregation and syndication of API stories.

			<p>
I am working to push forward my embeddable API research today, so I'm on the hunt for new tools and standards that can be included in my research and put to work by API providers. One of the top reasons for doing embeddable tools is the sharing of information and media on the web. Share buttons have become ubiquitous, so I wanted to have some standard approaches to making them a default part of API operations.
While monitoring the API space I came across "a proposal to add an API to the web for sharing text, URLs and images to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice":
Web Share&nbsp;is a proposed web API to enable a site to share data (text, URLs, images, etc) to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice. It could be a system service, a native app or another website. The goal is to enable web developers to build a generic "share" button that the user can click to trigger a system share dialog.
&nbsp;The current options for sharing content from a web page are:

Share buttons to specific web services (e.g., Facebook and Twitter buttons).
Share buttons built into the browser UI. Many browsers, especially on mobile, have a "share" button that sends the current page URL to a native app of the user's choice.

Web Share provides a pretty simple, yet useful example for sharing links. I'm adding it to tmy toolbox for my embeddable research. Once I gather a variety of other tools and standards I will step back to look at the 100K view. I'm hoping to stimulate a more embeddable approach to conversational interfaces, something that us asynchronous antisocial folk can work with, going beyond just voice, and messaging.&nbsp;

			<p><em>14 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>In the summer of 2012, Steve Willmott approached me with the idea of doing an API conference. We had both been discussing the need for a vendor-neutral&nbsp;API conference throughout the year, and now he wanted to make it a reality. We got to work talking to potential sponsors to see if the idea would be financially viable, and after a handful of conversation, we quickly had the sponsor support we needed to go ahead with the real thing. The first API Strategy &amp; Practice (APIStrat) was scheduled for December 2012 in New York City, but had to be rescheduled to February of 2013 due to&nbsp;Hurrican Sandy. Honestly, it ended up working out well, with the first APIStrat ended up being sold out. After we did New York, we followed up with San Francisco, Amsterdam, Chicago, Berlin, Austin, and the latest edition in Boston last November, and after seven events, the conference will now be operated by the Linux&nbsp;foundation, as part of the OpenAPI Initiative. I'm very happy to see the conference mature to this level. The conference has been a forum for sharing API knowledge for over three years, so it makes sense to elevate it as part of the movement at the OAI, something that is bigger than just the OpenAPI specification. The conference will have more reach, and resources available to it. APIStrat will have a much bigger events team, allowing it to continue to grow and evolve, beyond what Steve, myself, and the 3Scale team were able to make happen. It was a no-brainer to give the conference to the Linux Foundation, and the OAI--I couldn't imagine any better home for the conference I helped create. I wanted to take a moment and thank Steve, and the 3Scale team for making APIStrat a reality. Without their support, it never would have been a thing. I was fortunate enough to ride the train, and help stimulate the conversation.

I am working through the AWS APIs&nbsp;and the Google APIs, and profiling the building blocks across both of these API operations. My objective in doing this work is to learn as much as I possibly&nbsp;can about how these companies are doing APIs. After diving into Google's APIs I noticed that they were slightly more ahead of the curve when it comes to providing server level agreements (SLA) for their cloud APIs, than AWS.
I noticed nine while working through Google APIs:

BigQuery - https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sla
StackDriver - https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/sla
Key Management Service - https://cloud.google.com/kms/sla
Datastore - https://cloud.google.com/datastore/sla
Pub/Sub - https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/sla
Maps - https://enterprise.google.com/maps/terms/maps-sla.html
Prediction - https://cloud.google.com/prediction/sla
Compute -&nbsp;https://cloud.google.com/compute/sla
App Engine - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/sla

I noticed five SLAs while working through AWS APIs:

EC2 - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/sla/
Route 53 - https://aws.amazon.com/route53/sla/
S3 - https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/
CloudFront - https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/sla/
RDS - https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sla/

I am sure there are other dedicated SLA pages I'm missing, as well as SLAs embedded in the documentation and terms of service of systems. From what I can tell, these dedicated SLAs for APIs are in response to a shift in the landscape to sell more services to the enterprise, requiring that these details of doing business move front and center. With the volatility often associate with APIs in recent years, I'm guessing an API SLAs will continue to become an essential element in all API integration decisions in coming years.
There has been enough movement in the area of API service level agreements for me to consider adding a dedicated research area to my work. I've written about the SLA APIs I've stumbled&nbsp;across, and seeing SLAs float to the top with the bigcos, so it makes sense to pay closer attention to what is happening. Eventually, I'll aggregate the common building blocks across the API SLAs I'm finding, and the other more unique approaches to ensuring API reliability and stability&nbsp;when doing business online today.

			<p><em>14 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>I am working to take an existing API, built on top of an evolving data schema, and move forward a common API definition that 211 providers in cities across the country can put to use in their operations. The goal with the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) API specification is to encourage interoperability between 211 providers, allowing organizations to better deliver healthcare and other human services at the local and regional level. So far, I have crafted a v1.0 OpenAPI derived from an existing Code for America project called Ohana, as well as a very CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) version 1.1 OpenAPI, with a working API prototype for use as a reference. I'm at a very important point in the design process with the HSDS API, and the design choices I make will stay with the project for a long, long time. I wanted to take pause and open up a conversation with the community about what is next with the APIs design. I am opening &nbsp;up the conversation around some of the usual API design suspects like how we name paths, use headers, and status codes, but I feel like I should be also asking the big questions around use of hypermedia API design patterns, or possibly even GraphQL--a significant portion of the HSDS APIs driving city human services will be data intensive, and maybe GraphQL is one possible path forward. I'm not looking to do hypermedia and GraphQL because they are cool, I want them to serve specific business and organizational objectives. To stimulate this conversation I've created some Github issues to talk about the usual suspects like versioning, filtering,&nbsp;pagination, sorting,&nbsp;status &amp; error codes, but also opening up threads specifically for hypermedia, and GraphQL, and a thread as a catch-all for other API design considerations. I'm looking to stimulate a conversation around the design of the HSDS API, but also develop some API design content that can help bring some folks...[<a href="/2017/04/14/from-crud-to-an-api-design-conversation-with-human-services/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I wrote a post asking what it would take to migrate OpenAPI tooling from version 2.0 to 3.0 of the API specification, and Mike Ralphson (@PermittedSoc) commented about some of the projects he's been working on involving the latest specification version. Which I hope is a good sign of things to come, when it comes to moving from version 2.0 to 3.0 in 2017.
Mike has developed an OpenAPI converter and validator to help people migrate their OpenAPI definitions from 2.0 to 3.0. The open source tool also has an online version of the OpenAPI converter and validator for using in the browser, and of course, it also has an OpenAPI conversion and validation API, because ALL API tools and services should have an API--it is just good API craft.
It makes sense that some of the first tools to emerge are for conversion. Many API developers will need to convert their existing API definitions into version 3.0 of the specification to begin learning about what is new with OpenAPI 3.0. If you have examples of OpenAPI 3.0 definitions for your API, please publish them to Github and share with me, so I can help point folks to examples in the wild that they can learn from as we make this shift.

			<p><em>13 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>I am working on version 1.1 of the API definition&nbsp;for the human services data specification (HSDS), and I needed some help articulating the differences between version 1.0 and 1.1, which are both defined using the OpenAPI 2.0 specification. I manage all of my OpenAPIs using Github, but I needed a friendlier way to show the diff between two JSON files, than what Github provides. I got to work on a version that would run using Liquid, that would work in Jekyll, which all my sites and tools run in. I have a variety of API documentation tools that run on Github, so I wanted to develop an interface that showed two separate OpenAPI definitions side by side on a simple HTML page, so at this stage, I'm playing with different ways of showing the differences between paths, and other elements of the API definition. I'm not entirely happy with what I have, but I started applying a red DIFF label to any path that isn't represented in the previous API definition. It works well for helping me see which API endpoints have been added or changed in the latest version. Currently, I am just looking to understand the differences in paths available, but I will be diff for headers, parameters, and other elements of the API definition. I'm worried about things getting too cluttered with bigger API definitions. I'm trying to keep things fast loading, and something I can work with non-developers on, so I want to be thoughtful about what I add, and how I add it to the layout. I'm looking to get a group of business users up to speed on where things are going with the spec, and encourage them to get more involved with future versions--so not scaring them off is an important part of this conversation.

			<p><em>12 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>I have been profiling all of the Google APIs lately, a process that always yields a significant amount of stories for my notebook. One element of Google's approach to delivering APIs that I found relevant in the Google+ portal, was their embeddable tooling. This is an area of the API lifecycle I'm regularly evangelizing, and always looking for good examples to support my research.
I think that the six embeddable tools Google offers up as part of their social API represent the top embeddable tooling I see across this space. Partially because of the dominance of social media platform, but also because they make sense to end-users, and accomplish common things that people want to accomplish online.

Share, follow, and vote buttons are relevant to any platform with user accounts. Is yours available via API, enabling this type of tools? Then the badges, snippets, and embedded posts are relevant to any company, organization, institution, and agency looking to share content over the web (everyone wants to do this). I'm going to start a list of essential embeddable building blocks, providing a getting started list for companies looking to develop embeddable tooling for their consumers--Google gives me another good reference to add to my research.
I wish someone would start an API embeddables service, something like Zapier, but for embeddable content, tooling, and actions. I've talked about this in terms of conversational interfaces, but think there is an opportunity to do specifically for API-driven content. Allowing people to easily authenticate, and generate profile badges, embeddable content listings and details, and other long tail content opportunities. I'll keep beating this drum until something emerges--because it is what I do.

			<p>I'm always on the hunt for new ways to define, design, deploy, and manage API infrastructure, and thought the AWS Cloud Formation Designer provides a nice look at where things might be headed.&nbsp;AWS CloudFormation Designer (Designer) is a graphic tool for creating, viewing, and modifying AWS CloudFormation templates, which translates pretty nicely to managing your API infrastructure as well. While the AWS Cloud Formation Designer spans all AWS services, all the elements are there for managing all the core stops along the API life cycle liked definition, design, DNS, deployment, management, monitoring, and others. Each of the Amazon services is available with a listing of each element available for the service, complete with all the inputs and outputs as connectors on the icons. Since all the AWS services are APIs, it's basically a drag and drop interface for mapping out how you use these APIs to define, design, deploy and manage your API infrastructure. Using the design tool you can create templates for governing the deployment and management of API infrastructure&nbsp;by your team, partners, and other customers. This approach to defining the API life cycle is the closest I've seen to what stimulated my API subway map work, which became&nbsp;the subject of my keynotes at APIStrat in Austin, TX. It allows API architects and providers to templatize their approaches to delivering API infrastructure, in a way that is plug and play, and evolvable using the underlying JSON or YAML templates--right alongside the OpenAPI templates, we are crafting for each individual API. The&nbsp;AWS Cloud Formation Designer is a drag and drop UI for the entire AWS API stack. It is something that could easily be applied to Google's API stack, Microsoft, or any other stack you define--something that could easily be done using APIs.json, developing another layer of templating for which resource types are available in the designer, as well as the formation templates generated by the design tool itself.

As I was trying to articulate how API providers can put Github to work as part of their API operations in another story, I came across the Github Explore section. I thought that the list of items on the home page helps demonstrate that Github is more than just about managing open source code--which is the common perception regarding what you do with Github amongst muggles. I feel that these nine areas reflect the top uses for Github in 2017: Policies - From federal governments to corporations to student clubs, groups of all sizes are using GitHub to share, discuss, and improve laws. Tools for Open Source - Software to make running your open source project a little bit easier. Open source organizations - A showcase of organizations showcasing their open source projects. Design essentials - This collection of design libraries are the best on the web, and will complete your toolset for designing stunning products. Social Impact - Open source projects that are making the world a better place. Open data - Examples of using GitHub to store, publish and collaborate on open, machine-readable datasets. Package managers - Across programming languages and platforms, these popular package managers make it easy to distribute reusable libraries and plugins. DevOps tools - These tools help you manage servers and deploy happier and more often with more confidence. Machine learning - Laying the foundations for Skynet There are other galleries available via the Github Explore section, but I think this list provides a nice snapshot. I was pleased to see open data as a showcase, which included the APIs.guru API directory, something I'd like to see become an entire category of API catalogs and directories. It also makes sense that the foundations for Skynet are being laid using Github as part of its machine learning showcase.

			<p>I've been an advocate for OpenAPI since it's release, writing hundreds of stories about what is possible. I do not support OpenAPI because I think it is the perfect solution, I support it because I think it is the scaffolding for a bridge that will get us closer to a suitable solution for the world we have. I'm always studying how people see OpenAPI, both positive and negative, in hopes of better crafting examples of it being used, and stories about what is possible with the specification. When you ask people what OpenAPI is for, the most common answer is documentation. The second most common answer is for generating code and SDKs. People often associate documentation and code generation with OpenAPI because these were the first two tools that were developed on top of the API specification. I do not see much pushback from the folks who don't like OpenAPI when it comes to documentation, but when it comes to generating code, I regularly see folks criticizing the concept of generating code using OpenAPI definitions. When I think about OpenAPI I think about a life cycle full of tools and services that can be delivered, with documentation and code generation being just two of them. I feel it is shortsighted to dismiss OpenAPI because it falls short in any single stop along the API lifecycle as I feel the most important role for OpenAPI is when it comes to API literacy--helping us craft, share, and teach API best practices. OpenAPI, API Blueprint, and other API definition formats are the best way we currently have to define, share, and articulate APIs in a single document. Sure, a well-designed hypermedia API allows you to navigate, explore, and understand the surface area of an API, but how do you summarize that in a shareable and collaborative document that can be also used for documentation, monitoring, testing, and other stops along the API life cycle.  I wish everybody could read...[<a href="/2017/04/11/openapi-as-an-api-literacy-tool/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Establishing a feedback loop with your API community is one of the most valuable aspects of doing APIs, opening up your organization to ideas from outside your firewall. When you are designing new APIs&nbsp;or the next generation of your APIs, make sure you are tapping into the feedback loop you have already created within your community, by providing access to the alpha, beta, and prototype versions of your APIs. The Oxford Dictionaries API is doing this with their latest additions to their stack of word related APIs, by providing early access for their community with two of their new API prototypes that are currently in development: The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is the definitive authority on the English language containing the meaning, history, and pronunciation of more than 280,000 entries &ndash; past and present &ndash; from across the English-speaking world. Its historical record of the English language is traced through more than 3.5 million quotations ranging from classic literature and specialist periodicals to film scripts and cookery books. bab.la offers quick and easy translations and answers to everyday language questions. As part of the Oxford Dictionaries family, it provides practical support to people using a language that is not their mother tongue. To get access to the new prototypes, all you have to do is fill out a short questionnaire, and they will consider giving you access to the prototype APIs. It is interesting to review the questions they ask developers, which help qualify users&nbsp;but also asks some questions that could potentially impact the design of the API. The Oxford Dictionaries API team is smart to solicit some external feedback from developers before getting too far down the road developing your API&nbsp;and making it available in any production environment. I do not think all companies, organizations, and government agencies have it in their DNA to design APIs in this way. There are also some concerns when you are doing this in highly competitive environments, but...[<a href="/2017/04/11/getting-feedback-from-your-api-community-when-developing-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

During the discussion, one of their team members asked me about the paradox of what I was advising as&nbsp;the API Evangelist. He was speaking of the dangers of opening up APIs, establishing logging and awareness layers for all the data, content, and algorithms being served up as part of everything we do online. My prepared talk for the conversation was purposefully optimistic, but the conversation also was about the realities of all of this on the ground, at a company like the Oxford University Press--making the conversation a pretty good look at the paradox of API evangelism for me.&nbsp; I still believe in the potential of APIs, although I'm increasingly troubled by how APIs are used by technology companies. So it is easy for me to slip into the optimistic&nbsp;API Evangelist, over the hellfire and brimstone API Evangelist, when crafting talks with groups like the Oxford University Press. The Oxford Dictionaries API is easy to get excited about, even though I"m not entirely excited about the areas I'm informing them about like voice, bots, and machine learning. It is easy to focus on the good that APIs can do at an organizations like Oxford University Press, understanding that they are mission focused, and will be bringing meaningful solutions to the API space, but I would be negligent if I didn't discuss the challenges and dangers of doing APIs. I want the Oxford Dictionaries API to be successful. I want them to be able to generate revenue so they can keep doing interesting things, and I want them to sensibly do APIs and protect the valuable resources they possess, that they have invested so much time into creating and maintaining.

			<p>This is from a conversation I had with the Oxford Dictionaries API team last week while in Oxford. I led a conversation with 30-40 folks across several teams at the Oxford University Press offices. I tried to paint a relevant and realistic picture of the world of APIs, as it would pertain to their organization. I talked for about an hour, with another hour of discussion with the group, where we discussed some of these areas in more detail. History of APIsTo help connect the dots of where the world of APIs is going I wanted to take a brief walk through the history of APIs and make sure everyone is up to speed. The current wave of web APIs began in early 2000's with SalesForce, Amazon, and eBay leveraging web technologies to deliver commerce related IT services that leverage web technology over traditional enterprise approaches. These early API efforts focused on the integration of CRM, sales, and auction or affiliate related commerce activity, following the first dot-com bubble. Then around 2003, a new type of companies emerged that was employing APIs to connect people online&nbsp;and help them share links, images, and other social content, over the buying and selling of products. Flickr, then Facebook and Twitter emerged as API pioneers, opening up simple web APIs that allowed their communities of developers to integrate, and develop new websites and applications that helped drive the social evolution of the web. By 2006, API pioneer Amazon had internalized APIs at the commerce giant, requiring internal groups to use them to conduct business internally at the company, something that would result in a new web service for storing information on the web they called Amazon S3. Shortly after they released Amazon S3 they also launched a second API for deploying and managing servers on the Internet, changing how companies can deploy infrastructure for the web--something we now collectively call cloud computing. This is when the web API thing...[<a href="/2017/04/10/my-oxford-dictionaries-talk-about-the-world-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Apr 2017</em></p>
			<p>I have had a number of requests from folks lately to write more about Github, and how they can use the social coding platform as part of their API operations. As I work with more companies outside of the startup echo chamber on their API strategies I am encountering more groups that aren't Github fluent&nbsp;and could use some help getting started. It has also been a while since I've thought deeply about how API providers should be using Github&nbsp;so it will allow me to craft some fresh content on the subject. Github As Your Technical Social NetworkThink of Github as a more technical version of Facebook, but instead of the social interactions being centered around wall posts, news links, photos, and videos, it is focused on engagement with repositories. A repository is basically a file folder that you can make public or private, and put anything you want into it. While code is the most common thing put into Github repositories, they often contain data file, presentations, and other content, providing a beneficial way to manage many aspects of API operations. The Github BasicsWhen putting Github to use as part of your API operations, start small. Get your profile setup, define your organization, and begin using it to manage documentation or other simple areas of your operations--until you get the hang of it. Set aside any pre-conceived notions about Github being about code, and focus on the handful of services it offers to enable your API operations. Users - Just like other online services, Github has the notion of a user, where you provide a photo, description, and other relevant details about yourself. Avoid making a user accounts for your API, making sure you show the humans involved in API operations. It does make sense to have a testing, or other generic platform Github users accounts, but make sure your API team each have their own user profile, providing a snapshot of everyone involved. &nbsp;...[<a href="/2017/04/10/an-introduction-to-github-for-api-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I'm keeping an eye on the different approaches by API service providers when it comes to providing API editors within their services and tooling. While I wish there was an open source GUI API editor out there, the closest thing we have is from these API service providers, and I am trying to track on what the best practices are so that when someone does step up and begin working on an open, embeddable solution, they can learn from my stories about what is working or not working across the space. One example I think has characteristics that should be emulated is the API Spec Editor from Stoplight. The GUI editor lets you manage all the core elements of an OpenAPI like the general info, host, paths, and even the shared responses and parameters. They even provide what they call a CRUD builder where you paste the JSON schema, and they'll generate the common paths you will need to create, read, update, and delete your resources. Along the way you can also make calls to API endpoints using their interactive interface, helping ensure your API definition is actually in alignment with your API. The Stoplight API Spec Editor bridges the process of defining your OpenAPI for your operations, with actually documenting and engaging with an API through an interactive client interface. I like this approach to coming at API design from multiple directions. Apiary first taught us that API definitions were about more than just documentation, and I think our API editors should keeping evolving on this concept, and allowing us to engage with any stops along the API life cycle&nbsp;like we are seeing from API service providers like Restlet. I'm already keeping an eye on Restlet and APIMATIC's approach to providing a GUI API design editor within their solutions&nbsp;and will keep an eye out on other providers as I have time.

			<p>I'm endlessly fascinated by APIs&nbsp;and enjoy studying their evolution. One of the challenges in helping evangelize APIs that I come across regularly is the many different views of what is or isn't an API amongst people who are API literate, as well as helping bring APIs into focus for the API newcomers&nbsp;because there are so many possibilities. Out of the two, I'd say that dealing with API dogma is by far a bigger challenge, than explaining APIs to newbies--dogma can be very poisonous to productive conversations and end up working against everyone involved in my opinion.&nbsp; I'm enjoying reading about the evolution in the API space when it comes to GraphQL and gRPC. There are a number of very interesting implementations, services, tooling, and implementations emerging in both these areas. However, I do see similar mistakes being made regarding dogmatic behavior, aggressive marketing tactics, and shaming folks for doing things differently, as I've seen with REST, Hypermedia, and linked data efforts. I know folks are passionate about what they are doing, and truly believe their way is right, but I'm concerned you will all suffer from the same deficiencies&nbsp;in adoption I've seen with previous implementations. I started API Evangelist with the mission of counteracting the aggressive approach of the RESTafarians. I've spent a great deal of time thinking about how I can turn average developers and even business folks on to the concept of APIs--no not just REST or just hypermedia, but web APIs in general. Something that I now feel includes GraphQL and gRPC. I've seen many hardworking folks invest a lot into their APIs, only to have them torn apart by API techbros (TM) who think they've done it wrong--not giving a rats ass regarding the need to actually help someone understand the pros and cons of each approach. I'm confident that GraphQL will find its place&nbsp;in the API toolbox, and enjoy significant adoption when it comes to data-intensive&nbsp;API implementations.

			<p><em>30 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>The Runscope team recently published a post on a pretty cool approach to using Google Sheets for running API tests with multiple variable sets, which I thought is valuable at a couple of levels. They provide a template Google Sheet for anyone to follow, where you can plug in your variable, as well as your Runscope API Key, which allows you to define the dimensions of the tests you wish to push to Runscope via their own API. The first thing that grabs me about this approach is how Runscope is allowing their customers to define and expand the dimensions of how they test their API using Runscope in a way that will speak to a wider audience, beyond just the usual API developer audience. Doing this in a spreadsheet allows Runscope customers to customize their API tests for exactly the scenarios they need, without Runscope having to customize and respond to each individual customer's needs--providing a nice balance. The second thing that interests me about their approach is the usage of a Googe Sheet as a template for making API calls, whether you are testing your APIs, or any other scenario an API enables. This type of templating of API calls opens up the API client to a much wider audience, making integration copy and pastable, shareable, collaborative, and something anyone can reverse engineer and learn about the surface area of an API--in this scenario, it just happens to be the surface area of Runscope's API testing API. Runscope's approach is alignment with my previous post about sharing data validation examples. A set of assertions could be defined within a spreadsheets and any stakeholder could use the spreadsheet to execute and make sure the assertions are met. This would have huge implications for the average business user to help make sure API contracts are meeting business objectives. I'm considering using this approach to empower cities, counties, and states to test and validate human services API implementations...[<a href="/2017/03/30/using-google-sheet-templates-for-defining-api-tests/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>Many API providers I meet have the "build it and they will come" mentality, thinking that if they build an API, developers will come and use it. It does happen, but many APIs only have so many direct uses, and will have a limited number of resulting implementations. This is one of the reasons I recommend companies do APIs in the first place, to get beyond the obvious and direct implementations, and incentivize entirely new applications that a provider may not have considered. Developing innovative applications an API provider may not have considered is the primary focus of companies I talk to, but only a handful have begun thinking about the other APIs that are out there that might compliment an API. An example of this is with my friends over at the Oxford Dictionary APIs, where building applicaitons with built-in dictionaries is pretty obvious. However, the complimentary API partnering and usage might not be as obvious, something I'm encouraging their team to think more about. What are some examples of complimentary APIs for the Oxford Dictionaries API? API Design - This example is more meta API, than complimentary API, but I'd like to see more API design tooling to begin to use dictionaries as part of their GUI and IDE interfaces. Providing more structure to the way we design our APIs, helping ensure that the design of leading APIs are more intuitive, and coherent--achieving a less technical interface, and something that speaks to humans. Machine Learning - I'm using a number of machine learning APIs to accomplish a variety of business tasks from object recognition in images, to text and language pattern recognition in content I produce or curate. There are a number of opportunities to extend the responses I get back from these APIs using a dictionary, helping increase the reach of the machine learning services I employ, and making them more effective and meaningful in my business operations.

			<p><em>30 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>Slack released their Slack Buttons last year, to help as they state "reduce the number of small yet high-frequency tasks that quietly devour a user&rsquo;s time." I know folks are obsessed with voice, bot, and other conversational interfaces, but I agree with Slack, that there is a huge opportunity to help users execute common API-driven functions with a single push of a button. It is something I blog about regularly, helping folks realize the opportunity in the development of API driven, embeddable buttons, that go beyond what Slack is doing and would run anywhere on the web, in the browser, or even on mobile and other Internet connected devices. Zapier has taken a stab at this with Push by Zapier, and they have the inventory of APIs to support it. However, what I am thinking about should be even easier, embeddable anywhere, and leverage the web technology already in use (forms, inputs, GET, POST, etc.). If in a browser it should work like bookmarklets, and if it exists within the pages of a website or application, it should work as some simple copy/paste HTML with minimum JS when necessary to avoid blockage by ad blockers and other privacy protection tooling. I understand that it is easy to follow the pack when it comes to the latest technology trends, and I'm sure voice and bots will gain some mindshare when it comes to conversational interfaces. However, sometimes we just need the easy button for those high-frequency tasks that quietly devour our time, as Slack puts it. As I see JSON-LD embedeed into more web pages, further pleasing the Google search algorithm, there would also be more semantic opportunities for browser buttons to engage with the data and content within web pages in a more meaningful, and context aware way. API driven buttons and similiar embeddables and browser tooling is such an interesting opportunity that I would tackle myself, but I'm so resistant to anything that might...[<a href="/2017/03/30/an-opportunity-to-emulate-slack-buttons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am playing around with the Open API for the Oxford Dictionaries API, and I'm struck by the importance of not just dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionaries, but also the importance of OpenAPI, and API providers defining their APIs like the Oxford folks have. While we aren't as far down the road as we are with the English dictionary, we are beginning to make progress when it comes to defining the paths, parameters, and other characteristics using OpenAPI, learning to speak and communicate in the digital world using APIs. We use words to craft titles, paragraphs, outlines, and other ways that we communicatie in our personal and professional lives. We also use words to craft titles, paragraphs, outlines, collections, and other ways our systems our communicating in our personal and professional lives using the OpenAPI specification. In both these forms of communicating we are always trying to find just the right words, or series and orders of words to get across exactly the meaning we are looking for--we just have centuries of doing this when it comes writing and speaking, and only a decade or so of doing this with defining our digital resources using APIs. Eventually, I'd like to see entire dictionaries of JSON Schema, ALPS, or other machine readable specification, available by industry, and topic. The way we craft our API definitions and design our APIs often feels like we have barely learned to speak, let alone read or write. I'd like to see more reuse of common dictionaries already in use by leading API providers, and I'd like to see us get more thoughtful in how we express ourselves via our API definitions. The most successful APIs I find out there don't just provide a machine readable interface, they provide an intuitive interface that makes sense to humans, while also being machine readable for use in other systems.

			<p>When I started API Evangelist back in 2010 the only stop along the API life cycle that service providers were talking about was API management. In 2017, there are numerous stops along the API life cycle from design, to testing, all the way to deprecation. The leading API providers are expanding the number of stops they service, and the smart ones are making sure that if they only service on or two stops, they do so by providing via API definitions like OpenAPI, ensuring their customers are able to seamlessly weave multiple service providers together to address their full life cycle of needs. I've been working with my partner Restlet to advise them on expanding their platform to be what I consider to be an API life cycle provider. When I first was introduced to Restlet they were the original open source enterprise grade API deployment framework. Then Restlet became a cloud API deployment and management provider, and with their acquisition of DHC they also became an API client, and testing provider. Now with their latest update, they have worked hard to help their developer and business customers service almost every stop along a modern API life cycle, from design to deprecation. While Restlet is developing tooling to help companies define what the API life cycle means to them, the heartbeat of what Restlet delivers centers around API definitions like OpenAPI and RAML. API definitions provide the framework when your designing, deploying, documenting, managing, and testing your APIs using Restlet. They also provide the ability for you to get your API definitions in and out of the platform, and load them into potentially other API services, allow API operators to get what they need done. In my opinion, making API definitions just as importan tas any other service or tooling you offer along the API life cycle.

The topic was in alignment with another post I was working on regarding what I'd like to see fro API startups, but I think Anil articulates it better than even I could, and I think folks are going to respect it a lot more when it comes from a seasoned veteran like him, over an opinionated evangelist like me.

We&rsquo;re not gonna take features away from you and then start charging for them. This is one of those tricky things that a lot of companies do when they start building a business model for their product &mdash; they ask, &ldquo;what would people pay for?&rdquo; And then they realize&hellip; oh crap, the stuff people want to pay for is already offered for free.

			<p>Building a business is hard. Building a business that depends on other business is hard. We would like it if all of our vendors stuck around forever, but this is not the reality of doing business in today's climate. My stance on this situation that nothing lasts forever, but startups and the enterprise could be more honest about the business of startups, which is seriously beginning to impact the trust we all have in the platforms, tools, and APIs we depend on for our businesses. I was working my way through some legacy tweets, and I came across Parse's Twitter home page, which I think sums up the promise being made by each wave of startups, and the end results of these promises--although I have to say that Parse actually handled it pretty well, compared with other startups that I have seen in action. Building apps is not easy. However, we need solutions that will get us all the way there. I actually think that in the end, Parse handled it pretty well, better than StackMob did, when Paypal bought them. In the end, you could take the open source version of Parse and install it, and they communicated the deprecation pretty well, giving folks quite a bit of time to take care of business. However, this is the way it should be from day one. There should be APIs, and open source available to ease operation and migration--as well as communication about what the future will hold. If API focused startups don't start being more honest about their true business strategy, and the realities of the future from day one, fewer developers and users will buy what is being sold. Sure, there will always be new waves of young developers who will still believe, but the more experienced folks, who are often in charge of making purchasing decisions, will become increasingly skeptical about baking in APIs into their operations--screwing this up for the rest...[<a href="/2017/03/28/i-think-the-parse-twitter-page-sums-it-up-pretty-well/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
There are a number of things at work making this whole web API thing actually work. One of them that came up while I was at Google discussing APIs a couple weeks ago, while we were listening to Dan Ciruli (@danciruli) was the importance of being able to see an API request in the browser. It is something I think we often overlook when it comes to understanding why web APIs have reached such a wide audience.
I remember when I first realized I could change the URL in my Delicious account and get an XML listing of my bookmarks--this is when the API light first went on in my head. The web wasn't just for humans, it could be structured for use in other websites. Seeing the XML in the browser presented me links in a machine readable way, that triggered me to think about else I could with them, and which other systems I could put them to work in.
Being able to see the results of an API call in the browser helps stimulate the imagination when it comes to what is possible. This is similar to why API client tooling like Postman and Restlet Client are popular with developers--they help us see the possibilities. While not all APIs are simple enough to allow for viewing in the browser, when at all possible, we should keep things this easy, because you never know when it will make a mark, and help folks better understand what is going on under the hood, allowing them to put our APIs to work in ways we never expected.

			<p>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions. The guide is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world OpenAPI Spec is currently the most used API definition format out there, with the number of implementations, and tooling, with API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other formats trailing behind. It can make sense to support a single API definition when it comes to an individual platforms operations, but when it comes to interoperability with other systems it is important to be multi-lingual and support multiple of the top machine-readable formats out there today. In my monitoring of the API sector, one service provider has stood out when it comes to being a truly multi-lingual API definition service provider--the SDK generation provider, APIMATIC. The company made API definitions the heart of its operations, generating what they call development experience (DX) kits, from a central API definition uploaded by users--supporting OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other top formats. The approach has allowed the company to quickly expand into new areas like documentation, testing, continuous integration, as well as opening up their API definition translation as a separate service called API Transformer. API Transformer allows anyone to input an API Blueprint, Swagger, WADL, WSDL, Google Discovery, RAML 0.8 - 1.0, I/O Docs - Mashery, HAR 1.2, Postman Collection 1.0 - 2.0, Mashape, or APIMATIC Format API definition and then translate and export in a&nbsp; API Blueprint, Swagger 1.0 - 1.2, Swagger 2.0 JSON, Swagger 2.0 YAML, WADL - W3C 2009, RAML 0.8 - 1.0, Postman Collection 1.0 - 2.0, and their own APIMATIC Format. You can execute API definition translations through their interface or seamlessly integrate with the API Transformer API definition conversation API.

			<p>I was roaming through Google's Prediction API, and I thought their prediction gallery provides us a look at a shift occurring right now in how we deliver APIs.&nbsp;I predict that machine learning galleries and marketplaces will&nbsp;become all the rage, independently operating like Algorithmia, or part of a specific API like the Google prediction gallery. Ok, let me put it out there that I hate the use of word prediction. If I was naming the service, I would have called it "execution", or more precisely a "machine training (MT) model execution API". I know I'll never get my way, but I have to put it out there how bullshit many of the terms we use in the space are--ok, back to the API blah blah blah, as my daughter would say. A common element of API portals for the last decade has included an application gallery, showcasing the apps that are developed on top of an API. Now, when an API offers up machine learning (training) (ML) execution capabilities, either generally or very specialized model execution (ie, genomics, financial), there should also be a gallery of available mobiles, or simply models that have been delivered as part of platform operations--just like we have done with APIs &amp; applications. I see this stuff as the evolution of the algorithmic layer of API operations. Meaning that most APIs are delivering data or content, but there is a 3rd layer that is about wrapping algorithms, and in the current machine learning and artificial intelligence craze, this approach to delivering algorithmic APIs will continue to be popular. It's not an ML revolution, it is simply an evolution in how we are delivering API resources, leveraging ML models as the core wrapper (Google was smart for open sourcing TensorFlow). Developing ML models, and making them deployable via AWS, Google, Azure, as well as marketplaces like Algorithmia will become a common approach for the API providers who are further along in their...[<a href="/2017/03/27/i-predict-a-future-flooded-with-google-prediction-galleries/">Read More</a>]</p>

The guide is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world. The U.S. Data Federation is a federal government effort to facilitate data interoperability and harmonization across federal, state, and local government agencies by highlighting common data formats, API specifications, and metadata vocabularies. The project is focusing on being a coordinating interoperability across government agencies by showcasing and supporting use cases that demonstrate unified and coherent data architectures across disparate agencies, institutions, and organizations. The project is designed to shine a light on &ldquo;emerging data standards and API initiatives across all levels of government, convey the level of maturity for each effort, and facilitate greater participation by government agencies&rdquo;--definitely in alignment with the goal of this guide. There are currently seven projects profiled as part of the U.S. Data Federation, including Building &amp; Land Development Specification, National Information Exchange Model, Open Referral, Open311, Project Open Data, Schema.org, and the Voting Information Project. By providing a single location for agencies to find common schema documentation tools, schema validation tools, and automated data aggregation and normalization capabilities, the project is hoping to incentivize and stimulate reusability and interoperability across public data and API implementations. Government agencies of all shapes and sizes can use the common blueprints available in the U.S. Data Federation to reduce costs, speed up the implementation of projects, while also opening them up for augmenting and extending using their APIs, and common schema. It is unclear what resources the U.S. Data Federation will have available in the current administration, but it looks like the project is just getting going, and intends to add more specifications as they are identified.

			<p><em>27 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I wrote about how gRPC API implements deliver a tighter&nbsp;API contract, but I wanted to also explore more thought from that same conversation, about how hypermedia APIs can help deliver a more evolvable API contract. The conversation where these thoughts were born was focused on the differences between REST and gRPC, in which hypermedia and GraphQL also came up. Leaving me thinking about how our API design and deployment decisions can impact the API contract we are putting forth to our consumers. In contrast to gRPC, going with a hypermedia design for your API, your client relationship can change and evolve, providing an environment for things to flex and change. Some APIs, especially internal API, and trusted partners might be better suited for gRPC performance, but when you need&nbsp;to manage volatility and change across a distributed client base, hypermedia might be a better approach. I'm not advocating one over the other, I am just trying to understand the different types of API contracts brought to the table with each approach, so I can better articulate in my storytelling. I'd say that hypermedia and gRPC approaches give API providers a different type of control over API clients that are consuming resources. gRPC enables dictating a high performance tighter coupling by generating clients, and hypermedia allows for shifts in what resources are available, what schema are being applied, and changes that might occur with each version, potentially without changes to the client. The API contract can evolve (within logical boundaries), without autogeneration of clients, and interference at this level. As I learn about this stuff&nbsp;and consider the API contract implications, I feel like hypermedia helps API provides navigation change, evolve and shift to deliver resources to a more unknown, and distributed client base. gRPC seems like it provides a better contract for use in your known, trusted, and higher performance environments. Next, I will be diving into what API discovery looks like in a gRPC world, and...[<a href="/2017/03/27/a-looser-more-evolvable-api-contract-with-hypermedia/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I was taking a look at the new Uber Driver API and trying to understand the possibilities with the API, and some of the the motivations behind Uber's launch of the API. According to Uber, "our Driver API lets you build services and solutions that make the driver experience more productive and rewarding. With the driver's permission, you can use trip data, earnings, ratings and more to shape the future of the on-demand economy." Providing an interesting opportunity for partners to step up and help build useful apps that Uber drivers can leverage in their worlds, helping them be more successful in their work. The first dimension of the Uber Driver API I find interesting is that it is not an API that is about their core business--ridesharing. It is focused on making their drivers more successful, and developing tools, and integrations that make their lives easier. I could see something like this evolving to other platforms like AirBnB, and other sharing or gig economy platforms, helping operators make sense of their worlds, while also strengthening partnerships and hopefully their relationship with operators along the way.&nbsp; The second dimension I find interesting is thinking about why Uber is publishing their Driver API. At first glance it is all about making their drivers happy--something Uber needs a lot of help with currently. However, once you think a little more about it, you can start to see a bigger picture that Uber is looking to paint of their drivers. The company's leverage over drivers has proven to only go so far, and they need to understand more about the lives of their drivers, and if they can invite corporate partners to do their taxes, and potentially other key tasks in their lives, a greater picture of their&nbsp;life will come into focus.&nbsp; If an Uber driver is also a Lyft driver, the Uber Driver API gives them more of a look into their competitor's accounting.

			<p><em>24 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>It is common for API providers to be really private with their APIs, and we often hear about providers restricting access as time goes by. So, when API providers loosen up restrictions on their APIs, inviting wider use by developers, making them public--I think it is worth taking notice.&nbsp; A recent example of this in the wild is from the API poster child Twitter, with their Periscope video service. Twitter has announced that they are slowly opening up access to the Periscope video API, something that has been only available to a handful of trusted partners, and via the mobile application--there was no way to upload a video without using your mobile device. Twitter is still "limiting access to fewer strategic partners for a period", but at least you can apply to see if your interests overlap with Twitters interests. It also sounds like Twitter will continue to widen access as time goes on, and as it makes sense to their Periscope strategy. While I wished we lived in a world where API developers were all well behaved, and API providers could open up services to the public from day one, this isn't the reality we find on the web today. Twitter's cautious approach to rolling out the Periscope API should provide other API providers with an example of how you can do this sensibly, only letting in the API consumers that are in alignment with your goals. Slowly opening up, making sure the service is stable, and meets the needs of consumers, partners, as well as helps meet a platform's business objectives. Hopefully, Twitter's approach to launching the Periscope API provides us with a positive example of how you can become more public APIs, instead of always locking things down. There is no single way to launch your APIs, but I'd say that Twitter's cautious approach is probably a good idea when you operate in such a competitive space, or when you don't have...[<a href="/2017/03/24/moving-apis-out-of-the-partner-realm-and-making-them-more-public/">Read More</a>]</p>

One of the areas that slows API adoption is a lack of awareness of the concepts and specifications that make the web work among developers who are providing and consuming APIs. The modern API leverages the same technology that drives the web--this is why it is working so well. The web is delivering HTML for humans, and APIs are using the same to deliver machine-readable data, content, and access to algorithms online. If a developer is not familiar with the fundamental building blocks of the web, the APIs they provide, and the applications they build on top of APIs will always be deficient.

			<p>I was studying examples of how I can validate the data returned from a human services APIs demo, and develop a set of API tests, as well as API service providers who can implement the tests, for cities to consider as part of their API deployments that are serving up locations and organizations where you can find critical services. I'm looking for examples of the common things like API availability and response time, but I'm also looking to get very granular and specialized to organizational, location, and service APIs.

The image I borrowed from RunScope helps visualize what I'm talking about, showing us how we can keep an eye on the basics, but also getting really granular when specifying what we expect from of our APIs. I have a pretty good imagination when it comes to thinking of scenarios I want to test for, but I'm also looking for any API providers who might be already sharing their tests&nbsp;and being more transparent when it comes to their API monitoring and testing practices. If you know of any API&nbsp;providers that would be willing to share the lists of what types of things they test for, I'd love to hear more.&nbsp;
I'm thinking a regular blog series on different examples of how people are testing APIs from a diverse range of business sectors might help stimulate people's imagination when it comes to API testing concepts. I'm thinking it is another area that we could all learn a lot from each other&nbsp;if there was just a little bit of sharing. I'd love it if the examples were machine readable and reusable in any API testing service, but I would settle for just a blog post, or sharing of a bulleted list of API tests via email, or another channel. ;-)

			<p>Building on earlier stories about how my API partners are making API deployment more modular and composable, and pushing forward my understanding of what is possible with API deployment, I'm looking into the details of what DreamFactory enables when it comes to API deployment. "DreamFactory is a free, Apache 2 open source project that runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. DreamFactory is scalable, stateless, and portable" -- making it pretty good candidate for running it wherever you need. After spending time at Google and hearing about how they want to enable multi-cloud infrastructure deployment, I wanted to see how my API service provider partners are able to actually power these visions of running your APIs anywhere, in any infrastructure. Using DreamFactory you can deploy your APIs using Docker, Kubernetes, or directly from a Github repository, something I'm exploring as standard operating procedure for government agencies, like we see with 18F's&nbsp;US Forest Service ePermit Middlelayer API--in my opinion, all federal, state, and local government should be able to deploy API infrastructure like this. One of the projects I am working on this week is creating a base blueprint of what it will take to deploy a human services API for any city in Google or Azure. I have a demo working on AWS already, but I need a basic understanding of what it will take to do the same in any cloud environment. I'm not in the business of hosting and operating APIs for anyone, let alone for government agencies--this is why I have partners like DreamFactory, who I can route specific projects as they come in. Obviously, I am looking to support my partners, as they support me, but I'm also looking to help other companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies better leverage the cloud providers they are already using.

The guide&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world. The OpenAPI Specification, formerly known as Swagger is approaching an important milestone, version 3.0 of the specification, but it is also the first major release since the specification was entered into the Linux Foundation. Swagger was the creation of Tony Tam of Wordnik back in 2010, but after the project was acquired by SmartBear in 2015, the company donated the specification to the newly formed OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) which is part of the Linux Foundation. Swagger has now been reborn as the OpenAPI Specification, and in early 2017 is approaching its first major release under the guidance of a diverse group of governing members. Version 3.0 of the API specification format has taken a much more modular, and reusable approach to defining the surface area of an API, enabling more power and versatility when it comes to describing the request and response models, as well as providing details on the common components that make up API usage like the underlying data schema and security definitions. There are numerous changes to the API specification, but there are just a handful that will have a significant impact across every stop along the API life cycle where API definitions are making an impact. Hosts When describing your API, you can now provide multiple hosts, allowing you to better deal with the complexity of how APIs might be located in a single location, or spread across multiple cloud location, and global infrastructure. Content Negotiation You can now provide content objects to define the relationship between response objects, media types, and schema, opening up the negotiation of exactly the type of content needed, encouraging the design...[<a href="/2017/03/23/api-definition-open-api-specification-3-0-0rc0/">Read More</a>]</p>

I'm keeping an eye on the different approaches to deploying infrastructure coming out of AWS, Google, Microsoft and other providers. In my version of the near future, we should be able to deploy any API we want, in any infrastructure we want with a single push of a button. We are getting there, as&nbsp;I'm seeing more publish to Heroku buttons, AWS and Azure deployment packages, and I recently came across the Google Cloud Launcher, which I think will work well for deploying a variety of API driven solutions--we just need more selection&nbsp;and a button!
All the parts and pieces for this type of push button API deployment exist already, we just need someone to step up and provide a dead simple framework for defining and embedding the buttons, abstracting away the complexities of each cloud platform. I want to be able to take a single manifest for my open source or wholesale API on Github, and allow anyone to deploy it into Heroku, AWS, Google, Azure, or anywhere else they want. I want the technical, business, and legal complexities of deployment abstracted away for me, the API provider.
API management has matured a lot over the last 10 years, and API design and definitions are currently flourishing. We need a lot more investment in helping people easily deploy APIs, wherever they need. I think this layer of interoperability is the responsibility of the emerging API service providers like Restlet, DreamFactory, or maybe even APIMATIC. I will keep tracking on what I'm seeing evolve out of the leading cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and now Google with their Cloud Launcher. I will also keep pushing on my API service provider partners in the space to enable API deployment like this--I am guessing they will just need a little nudging to see the opportunity around providing API deployment in this seamless, cloud-agnostic way.

I have written before about having a set of icons for the API sector, for SDK related icons, and also about how Amazon is getting more organized when it comes to icons for the AWS platform, as I beat this drum about the need for common imagery. While I am glad that Amazon is started to think about iconography when it comes to working with APIs at scale, a lead that Google and Microsoft should follow, I'm hoping that API icons are something that someone will tackle at the same level as say a Schema.org. I would like to see API provider (company) level icons, building on the work of Devicon, but I'd also like to see individual icons developed for common resources that are made available via APIs--like compute, storage, images, video, etc. What Amazon is doing provides the best model we have so far, but I want to make sure icons are not vendor specific. I would like to see a universal icon to represent a compute API for instance, whether it was Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Think about IFTTT or Zapier, but something that would universally represent the valuable bits and bytes we are putting to use via individual platforms, but are increasingly also moving around between platforms--I want a common visual iconography we can use to communicate about what is being done with APIs. There is a ton of work involved with establishing a project of this scale. Ideally, it is something that would also involve API providers, and not just be an external thing.

The guide&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world. A lot of attention is given to APIs and the world of startups, but in 2017 this landscape is quickly shifting beyond just the heart of the tech space, with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes are putting APIs to work. API definitions are being applied to the fundamental building blocks of the tech sector, quantifying the computational, storage, images, videos, and other essential resources powering web, mobile, and device based applications. This success is now spreading to other sectors, defining other vital resources that are making a real impact in our communities. One API making an impact in communities is the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), also known as the Open Referral Ohana API. The project began as a Code for America project, providing an API, website, and administrative system for managing the organizations, locations, and the human services that communities depend on. Open Referral, the governing organization for HSDS, and the Ohana API is working with API Evangelist and other partners to define the next generation of the human services data specification, API definition, as well as the next generation of API, website, admin, and developer portal implementations. The HSDS Specification API isn&rsquo;t about any single API, it is a suite of API-first definitions, schema, and open tooling that cities, counties, states&nbsp;and federal government agencies can download or fork, and employ to help manage vital human services for their communities. Providing not just a website for finding vital services, but a complete API ecosystem that can be deployed incentivizing developers to build important web, mobile, and other applications on top of a central...[<a href="/2017/03/22/api-definition-human-services-api-specification/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>It is easy for me to get excited about a new API. I'm an engineer. I'm a dude. I am the API Evangelist. It easy to think about the potential for good when it comes to APIs. It is much harder to suspend the logical side of my brain&nbsp;and think about the ways in which APIs can be used in negative ways. As a technologist it is natural for me to focus in on the technology, and tune out the rest of the world--it is what we do. It takes a significant amount of extra effort to stop, suspend the portion of your brain that technology whispers to, and think about the unintended consequences, and the pros and cons of why we are doing APIs. Technologists aren't very good at slowing down and thinking about the pros/cons of connecting something to the Internet, let alone whether or not an API should even exist in the first place (it has to exist!). As I read a story about the increases in DDOS attacks on the network layer of our online world, I can't help but think that with each new API we deploy, that we are significantly increasing the attack surface area for our businesses, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. It feels like we are good at thinking about the amazing API potential, but we really suck at seeing what a target we are putting on our back when we do APIs. We seem to be marching forward, drunk on the potential of APIs&nbsp;and Internet-connected everything. We aren't properly securing the technology we have, something we can see playing out with each wave of vulnerabilities, breaches, and leaks. We are blindly pushing forward with new API implementations, and using the same tactics we are using for our web and mobile technology, something we are seeing play out with the Internet of Things, and the vulnerable cameras, printers, and another object we are connecting to the Internet...[<a href="/2017/03/21/with-each-api-we-increase-the-attack-surface-area/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>This is my regular public service reminder of why I do API Evangelist. I do not evangelize APIs because I think everybody should be doing them, that they are the solution to all of our problems, or because I have an API I want you to buy (I have other things for you to buy). I do API Evangelist because I want to better understand how platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and others are operating&nbsp;and impacting our personal and professional lives. I do believe in APIs as an important tool in our professional toolboxes, but Silicon Valley, our government(s), and many other bad actors have shown me that APIs will more often be used for shady things, rather than the positive API vision I have in my head. I still encourage companies, organizations, institutions,&nbsp;and agencies to do APIs, but I spend equal amount of time ensuring people are doing APIs in a more open and equitable way&nbsp;while still encouraging folks to also embark on their API journeys--taking more control over how we store, share, and put our bits and bytes to work each day.&nbsp; APIs are playing a role in almost every news story we read today, from fake news and elections to cyber security,&nbsp;healthcare with the FHIR API standard, or banking with PSDS, to automobiles and transportation with Tesla and Uber. I can keep going all day long, talking about the ways APIs are influencing and delivering vital aspects of our personal and professional lives. In ALL of these situation's it's not the API that is important, it is the access, availability, and observability of the technology that is impacting the lives of humans--APIs are just the digital connector where our mobile phones and other devices are being connected to the Internet. I like to regularly remind myself why the fuck I'm doing API Evangelist, so I don't burn out like I have before and end up roaming the streets foaming at the mouth...[<a href="/2017/03/21/reminding-myself-of-why-i-do-api-evangelist/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
Most of the APIs I look at are special snowflakes. The definition&nbsp;and designs employed are usually custom-crafted without thinking other existing APIs, or standards that already in place. There are several contributing factors to why this is, ranging from the types of developers who are designing APIs, to incentive models put in place because of investment&nbsp;and intellectual property constraints. So, whenever I find an API that is employing an existing standard, I feel compelled to showcase&nbsp;and help plant the seeds in others minds that we should be speaking a common language instead of always being a special snowflake.
One of these APIs that I came across recently was the Google Spectrum Database API which has employed a standard&nbsp;defined by the&nbsp;IETF Protocol to Access White Space (PAWS). &nbsp;I wouldn't say the API is the best-designed API, but it does follow a known standard, that is already in use by an industry, which in my experience can go further than having the best-designed API. The best product doesn't always win in this game, sometimes it is just about getting adoption with the widest possible audience.&nbsp;I am guessing that the Google Spectrum Database API is targeting a different type of engineering audience than their more modern, machine learning and other APIs are, so following standards is probably more of a consideration.
I wish more APIs would share a little bit about the thoughts that went into the definition and design of their APIs, sharing their due diligence of existing APIs and standards, and other considerations that were included in the process of crafting an API. I'd like to see some leadership in this area, as well as some folks admitting that they didn't have the time, budget, expertise, or whatever the other reasons why you are a special snowflake. It is a conversation we should be having, otherwise, we may never fully understand why we aren't seeing the adoption we'd like to see with our APIs.

			<p><em>20 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I have the latest edition of my API definition research published, complete with a community-driven participation model, but before I moved on to my design, deployment, and management guides, I wanted to take a moment and connect my OpenAPI toolbox to this research.
My API definition research encompasses any specification, schema, or authentication and access scope used as part of API operations, providing a pretty wide umbrella. I am always on the hunt for specifications, schema, media types, generators, parsers, converters, as well as semantics and discovery solutions that are defining the layers of the API space.&nbsp;
This is one reason I have my OpenAPI Toolbox, which helps focus my research into the fast-growing ecosystem developing around the OpenAPI specification. I'm always looking for people who are doing anything interesting with the OpenAPI specification. When I find one I get to work crafting &nbsp;a title, description, image, and project link so that I can add to&nbsp;the OpenAPI Toolbox YAML file, driving the toolbox website. If you are developing any open tooling that uses the OpenAPI specification please let me know by submitting a Github issue for the toolbox, or if you are feeling brave...go ahead and add yourself and submit a pull request.
My OpenAPI Toolbox is connected to my API definition research at the hip. The toolbox is just a sub-project for my wider API definition research. If you are doing anything interesting with API definitions, schema, or scope please let me know. I am happy to add to my API definition research. The best of the best from my API definition research and the OpenAPI Toolbox will be included in my industry guide, receiving wider distribution than just my network of API Evangelist sites.

			<p><em>20 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I talked about the gap between developer relations and support at Google, something that Sam Ramji (@sramji) has acknowledged is being worked on. Support for a single API can be a lot of work&nbsp;and is something that is exponentially&nbsp;harder with each API and developer to add to your operations, and after looking through 75 of the Google APIs this weekend, you see evidence that Google is working on it. While there are many Google APIs that still have sub-standard support for their APIs, when you look at Google Sheets you start seeing evidence of their evolved approach to support, with a consistent set of buttons that tackle many of the common areas of API support. For general questions, Google provides two buttons linked to StackOverflow: The search just drops you into Stack Overflow, with the tag "google sheets api", and the ask a new question drops you into the Stack Overflow submit new question form. For bug reporting, they provide a similar set of buttons: The search and report bug buttons drop you into the Google Code issues page for Google Sheets, leveraging the issues management for the Gooogle Code repository--something that can just as easily be done with Github issues. Then lastly, they provide a third set of buttons when you are looking to submit a feature: Even though there is a typo on the first button, they also leverage Google Code issue management to handle all feature requests. Obviously working to centralize bug and feature reporting, and support management using Google Code--something I do across all my API projects using Github organizations, repositories, and their issue management. I'm guessing Google Support is tapping into Google Code to tackle support across projects at scale. These support buttons may seem trivial, but they represent a more consistent approach by the API giant to be consistent in how they approach support across their API offerings--something that can go a long way in my experience. It gives...[<a href="/2017/03/20/google-support-buttons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I keep an eye on over 70 areas of the API sector, trying to better understand how API providers are getting things done, and what services and tooling they are using, while also keeping my perspective as an API consumer--observing everything from the outside-in. The most important area of my research is API definitions--where I pay attention to the specifications, schema, scopes, and other building blocks of the API universe.&nbsp; The way my research works&nbsp;is that I keep an eye on the world of APIs through monitoring the social media, blogs, Github, and other channels of companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies doing interesting things with APIs. I curate information as I discover&nbsp;and learn across the API sector, then I craft stories for my blog(s). Eventually, all of this ends up being published to the main API Evangelist blog, as well as the 70+ individual areas of my research from definition to deprecation.&nbsp; For a couple years now I have also published a guide for the top areas of my research, including API definitions, design, deployment, and management. These guides have always been a complete snapshot of my research, but in 2017 I am rebooting them to be a more curated, summary of each area of my research. My API definition guide is now ready for prime time after receiving some feedback from my community, so I wanted to share with you. I am versioning and managing all of my API industry guides using the Github repositories in which I publish each of my research areas, so you can comment on the API definition guide, and submit suggestions for future editions using the Github issues for the project.&nbsp;My goal with this new edition of the API Evangelist API definition guide is to make it a community guide to the world of API definitions, schema, scopes.

I've rebooted my industry guides to be a more polished, summary version of my research instead of the rougher, more comprehensive version I've bee publishing for the last couple of years. I'm looking for my guides to better speak to the waves of new people entering the API space, and help them as they continue on their API journey. In addition to being a little more polished, and having more curated content, my API guides are now going to also be more of a community thing. In the past I've kept pretty tight control over the content I publish to API Evangelist, only opening up the four logos to my partners. Using my API industry guides I want to invite folks from the community to help edit the content, and provide editorial feedback--even suggesting what should be in future editions. I'm also opening up the guides to include paid content that will help pay for the ongoing publication of the guides with the following opportunities available in the next edition: One Page Articles - Sponsored suggested topics, where I will craft the story and publish in the next edition of the guide--also published on API Evangelist blog after the guide is published.

			<p><em>16 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I am spending some time adding more tools to my OpenAPI Toolbox, and I'm looking to start evaluating what it will take for tooling providers to evolve their solution from version 2.0 of the OpenAPI Spec to version 3.0. I want to better understand what it will take to evolve the documentation, generators, servers, clients, editors, and other tools that I'm tracking on as part of my toolbox research. I'm going to spend another couple of weeks populating the toolbox with OpenAPI solutions. Getting them entered with all the relevant metadata. Once I feel the list is good enough, I will begin reaching out to each tool owner, asking what their OpenAPI 3.0 plans are. It will give me a good reason to reach out and see if anyone is even home. I'm assuming that a number of the projects are abandoned, and even that their owners do not have the resources necessary to go from 2.0 to 3.0. Regardless, this is something I want to track on as part of this OpenAPI toolbox research. The overall architecture of OpenAPI shifted pretty significantly from 2.0 to 3.0. Things are way more modular, and reusable&nbsp;in there, something that will take some work to bring out in most of the tooling areas. Personally, I'm pretty excited for the opportunities when it comes to API documentation and API design editors with OpenAPI 3.0 as the core. I am also hoping that developers step up to make sure that the generators, as well as the server and client code generators become available in a variety of programming languages--we will need this to make sure we keep the momentum that we've established with the specification so far. If you are looking at developing any tooling using OpenAPI 3.0 I'd love to hear from you. I'd like to hear more about what it will take to either migrate your tool from version 2.0 to 3.0&nbsp;or even hear what it will take...[<a href="/2017/03/16/what-will-it-take-to-evolve-openapi-tooling-to-version-3-0/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I spent a day last week at the Google Community Summit, learning more about the Google Cloud road map, and one thing I kept hearing them focus on was the notion of being able to operate on any cloud platform--not just Google. It's a nice notion, but how real of a concept is it to think we could run seamlessly on any of the top cloud platforms--Google, AWS, and Microsoft.&nbsp; The concept is something I'll be exploring more with my Open Referral, Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) work. It's an attractive concept, to think I could run the same API infrastructure in any of the leading cloud platforms. I see two significant hurdles in accomplishing this: 1) Getting the developer and IT staff (me) up to speed, and 2) Ensuring your databases and code all runs and scales seamlessly whichever platforms you operate in. I guess I'd have to add 3) Ensure your orchestration and continuous integration works seamlessly across all platforms you operate on. I am going to get to work deploying an HSDS compliant API on each of the platforms. My goal is to have just a simple yet complete API infrastructure running on Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. It is important to me that these solutions provide a complete stack helping me manage DNS, monitoring, and other important aspects. I'm also looking for there to be APIs for managing all aspects of my API operations--this is how I orchestrate and continuously integrate the APIs which I roll out. Along with each API that I publish, I will do a write up on what it took to stand up each one, including the cloud services I used, and their API definitions. I am pretty content (for now) on the AWS platform, leveraging Github Pages as the public facade for my projects, and each repositories acting as the platform gears of API code, and definitions.

			<p><em>16 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
The Postman team has been hard at work lately,&nbsp;releasing their API data editor, as well as introducing variable highlighting and tooltips. The new&nbsp;autocomplete menu contains a list of all the variables in the current environment, followed by global variables, making your API environment setups more accessible from the Postman interface. Introducing a pretty significant time saver, once you have your environments setup properly.
This is a pretty interesting feature, but what makes me most optimistic, is when this approach becomes available for parameters, headers, and some of the data management features we are seeing emerge with the new Portman data editor. It all feels like the UI equivalent of what we've seen emerge in the latest OpenAPI 3.0 release, helping us better manage and reuse the schema, data, and other bits we put to use across all of our APIs.&nbsp;
Imagine when you can design and mock your API in Postman, crafting our API&nbsp;using a common vocabulary. Reusing environment variables, API path resources, parameters, headers, and other common elements already in use across operations. Imagine when I get tooltip suggesting that I use Schema.org vocabulary, or possibly even RFCs for a date, currency, and other common definitions. Anyways, I'm liking the features coming out of postman, and I'm also liking that they are regularly blogging about this stuff, so I can keep up to speed on what is going on, and eventually cover here on the blog, and include in my research.

			<p><em>15 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I wanted to provide an easy way to publish and share some of the tools that I'm tracking on in the OpenAPI ecosystem, so I launched my API toolbox. In addition to tracking on the name, description, logo, and URL for OpenAPI tooling, I also wanted to categorize them, helping me better understand the different types of tools that are emerging. As I do with all my research, I published the OpenAPI Toolbox as a Github repository, leveraging its YAML data core to store all the tools.&nbsp;
It will be a never ending project for me to add, update, and archive abandoned projects, but before I got too far down the road I wanted to also begin tracking on the license for each of the tools. I'm still deciding whether or not I want the toolbox to exclusively contain openly licensed tools, or look to provide a more comprehensive directory of tooling that includes unknown and proprietary solutions. I think for now I will just flag any tool I cannot find a license for, and follow up with the owner--it gives me a good excuse to reach out and see if there is anyone home.
Eventually, I want to also provide a search for the toolbox that allows users to search for tools&nbsp;and filter by license. Most of the tools have been Apache 2.0 or MIT license, details that I will continue to keep tracking and reporting on. If you know of any tooling that employs the OpenAPI Specification that should be included feel free to submit a Github issue for the project, or submit a pull request on the repository and add it to the YAML data file that drives that OpenAPI Toolbox.

			<p><em>15 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I was following the discussion around adding a&nbsp;WebAPI class to Schema.org's core vocabulary, and it got me to think more about the role Schema.org has to play with not just our API definitions, but also significantly influencing API discovery. Meaning that we should be using Schema.org as part of our OpenAPI definitions, providing us with a common vocabulary for communicating around our APIs, but also empowering the discovery of APIs.&nbsp; When I describe the relationship between Schema.org to API discovery, I'm talking about using the pending WebAPI class, but I'm also talking about using common Schema.org org within API definitions--something that will open the definitions to discovery because it employs a common schema. I am also talking about how do we leverage this vocabulary in our HTML pages, helping search engines like Google understand there is an API service available: I&nbsp;will also be exploring how I can better leverage Schema.org in my APIs.json&nbsp;format, better leveraging a common vocabulary describing API operations, not just an individual API. I'm looking to expand the opportunities for discovering, not limit them. I would love all APIs to take a page from the hypermedia playbook, and have a machine readable index for each API, with a set of links present with each response, but I also want folks to learn about APIs through Google, ensuring they are indexed in a way that search engines can comprehend. When it comes to API discovery I am primarily invested in APIs.json (because it's my baby) describing API operations, and OpenAPI to describe the surface area of an API, but I also want this to map to the very SEO driven world we operate in right now. I will keep investing time in helping folks use Schema.org in their API definitions (APIs.json&nbsp;&amp; OpenAPI), but I will also start investing in folks employing JSON+LD and Schema.org as part of their search engine strategies (like above), making our APIs more discoverable to humans as well as...[<a href="/2017/03/15/thinking-about-schema-org039s-relationship-to-api-discovery/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I saw an interesting chasm emerge while at a Google Community Summit this last week, while I heard their support team talk, as well as their developer relations team discuss what they were up to. During the discussion, one of the companies presents discussed how their overall experience with the developer relations team has been amazing, their experience with support has widely been a pretty bad experience--revealing a potential gap between the two teams. This is a pretty common gap I've seen with many other API platforms. The developer relations team is all about getting the word out, and encouraging platform usage&nbsp;and support teams are there to be the front line for support&nbsp;and being the buffer between integration, and platform engineering teams. I've been the person in the role as the evangelist when there is a bug in an API, and I'm at the mercy of an already overloaded engineering team, and QA staff, before anything gets resolved--this is a difficult position to be in. How wide this chasm becomes ultimately depends on how much of a priority the API is for an engineering team, and how overloaded they are. I've worked on projects where this chasm is pretty wide, taking days, even weeks to get bugs fixed. I'm guessing this is something a more DevOps&nbsp;focused approach to the API life cycle might help with, where an API developer relations and support team have more access to making changes&nbsp;and fixing bugs--something that has to be pretty difficult to deal with at Google scale. Anyways, I thought the potential chasm between developer relations and support was worthy&nbsp;enough to discuss and include in my research. It is something we all should be considering no matter how big or small our operations are. There is no quicker way to kill the morale of your API developer relations and support teams by allowing a canyon like this to persist.

			<p>I was reviewing the latest changes with Visual Studio 2017&nbsp;and came across the section introducing connected services, providing a glimpse of Microsoft APIs baked into the integrated development environment (IDE). I've been pushing for more API availability in IDE's for some time now, something that is not new, with Google and SalesForce having done it for a while, but is something I haven't seen any significant movement in for a while now. I have talked about delivering APIs in Atom using APIs.json, and have long hoped Microsoft would move forward with this in Visual Studio. All APIs should be discoverable from within any IDE, it just makes sense as a frontline for API discovery, especially when we are talking about developers. Microsoft's approach focuses on connecting developers of&nbsp;mobile applications, with "the first Connected Service we are providing for mobile developers enables you to connect your app to an Azure App Service backend, providing easy access to authentication, push notifications, and data storage with online/offline sync". In the picture, you can see Office 365 APIs, but since I don't have Visual Studio I can't explore this any further. If you have any insight into these new connected services features in the IDE, please let me know your thoughts and experiences. If Microsoft was smart, all their APIs would be seamlessly integrated into Visual Studio, as well as allow developers to easily import any other API using OpenAPI, or Postman Collections.&nbsp; While I think that IDEs are still relevant to the API development life cycle I feel like maybe there is a reason IDEs haven't caught up in this area. It feels like a need that API lifecycle tooling like Postman,&nbsp;Restlet Client, and Stoplight are stepping up to service the area. Regardless I will keep an eye on. It seems likno-braineriner for Microsoft to make their APIs available via their own IDE products, but maybe we are headed for a different future where a new breed of...[<a href="/2017/03/15/azure-and-office-apis-in-visual-studio/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was learning more about gRPC from the Google team last week, while at the Google Community Summit, as well as the API Craft SF Meetup. I'm still learning about gRPC, and how it contributes to the API conversation, so I am trying to share what I learn as I go, keeping a record for others to learn from&nbsp;along the way. One thing I wanted to better understand was something I kept hearing regarding gRPC delivering more of a tighter API contract between API provider and consumer. In contrast to more RESTful APIs, a gRPC client has to be generated by the provider. First, you define a service in a .proto file (aka Protocol Buffer), then you generate client code using the protocol buffer compiler. Where client SDKs are up for debate in the world of RESTful APIs, and client generation might even be frowned upon in some circles, when it comes to gRPC APIs, client generation is a requirement--dictating a much&nbsp;tighter coupling and contract, between API provider and consumer.&nbsp; I do not have the first-hand experience with this process yet, I am just learning from my discussions last week, and trying to understand how gRPC is different from the way we've been doing APIs using a RESTful approach. So far it seems like you might want to consider gRPC if you are looking for significant levels of performance from your APIs, in situations where you have a tighter relationship with your consumers, such as internal, or partner scenarios. gRPC requires a tighter API contract between provider and consumer, something that might not always be possible, depending on the situation.&nbsp; While I'm still getting up to speed, it seems to me that the .proto file, or the protocol buffer definition acts as the language for this API contract. Similar to how OpenAPI is quickly becoming a contract for more RESTful APIs, although it is often times much looser contract.

			<p><em>14 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
In 2017 I think that getting our act together when it comes to our data&nbsp;schema will prove to be just as important as getting it together when it comes to our API definitions and design. This is one reason I'm such a big fan of using OpenAPI to define our APIs because it allows us to better organize the schema of the data included as part of the API request and response structure. So I am happy to see Postman announce their new data editor, something I'm hoping will help us make sense of the schema we are using throughout our API operations.
The Postman data editor provides us with some pretty slick data management UI features including&nbsp;drag and drop, a wealth of useful keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, and other timesaving features. Postman has gone a long way to inject awareness into how we are using APIs over the last couple of years, and the data editor will only continue developing this awareness when it comes to the data we are passing back and forth. Lord knows&nbsp;we need all the help we can get&nbsp;when it comes to getting our data backends in order.
The Postman data editor makes me happy, but I'm most optimistic about what it will enable, and what Postman has planned as part of their roadmap. They end their announcement with "we&nbsp;have a LOT of new feature releases planned to build on top of this editor, capabilities inspired by things you already do using&nbsp;spreadsheets". For me, this points to some features that would directly map to the most ubiquitous data tools out there--the spreadsheet. With a significant&nbsp;portion of business in the world is done via spreadsheets, it makes the concept of integration into the API toolchain a pretty compelling thing.

			<p>I spent last week in San Francisco listening to Google's very machine learning focused view of the future. In addition to their Google Next conference, I spent Tuesday at the Google Community Summit, getting an analyst look at what they are up to. Machine Learning (ML) was definitely playing a significant role in their strategy, and I heard a lot talk of machine learning marketplaces. Beyond their own ML offerings like video intelligence and vision APIs, Google also provides you with an engine for publishing your own ML models. They also have a machine learning advanced solution lab, throwing a machine learning hackathon, and pushing a machine learning certification program&nbsp;as part of their cloud and data offerings. As the Google machine learning roadmap was being discussed throughout the day, the question of where can I publish my ML models, and begin selling them, came up regularly--something I feel like is going to be a common theme of the 2017 ML hype. I'm guessing we will see a relationship between the Google ML engine, Google Cloud Endpoints emerge, and eventually some sort of ML marketplace like we have with Algorithmia. We are already seeing this shift in the AWS landscape, between their Lambda, ML, API Gateway, and AWS Marketplace offerings. You see hints of the future in the AWS serverless API portal I wrote about previously. The technology, business, and politics of providing retail and wholesale access to algorithms and machine learning models in this way fascinates me, but as with every other successful area of the API economy, about 90% of this will be shit, and 10% will be actually doing anything interesting with compute&nbsp;and APIs. I'm doing all my image and video texture transfer machine learning model training using AWS and Algorithmia. I then use Algorithmia to get access to the models I've trained, and if I ever want to open up partner level (wholesale), or public (retail) access to my ML Models I...[<a href="/2017/03/13/lots-of-talk-about-machine-learning-marketplaces/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I've been simmering on thoughts around Uber's greyballing&nbsp;for some time now, where they target regulators and police in different cities, and craft a special Uber experience just for them. Targeting users like this are not new, all companies do it, it's just that Uber has a whole array of troubling behavior going on, and the fact that they were so aggressively pushing back on regulators, is why this is such a news story. I'm familiar with this concept because greyballing is embedded in the DNA of APIs, we just call it API management. Every web, mobile, and device that uses an API have a unique fingerprint, identifying the application, as well as the user. Not all apps&nbsp;or users are created equal, and everyone gets's a tailored experience. I wanted to explore the spectrum of experiences I see on a regular basis, helping us all understand how this broadway production works. Greyballing - Uber's situation is focused on creating a special scenario for regulators, but many companies also do this for their competitors, and anyone they see as a threat. Smoke and mirrors for those who threaten you is the name of the game. Sales Funnel - Where are you in my sales funnel? Based upon your application or user fingerprint, and IP address you will receive a different experience, support, and access to resources--the bigger opportunity you are, the better experience you will get. Country - Due to laws in specific countries, platforms have to deliver a different experience based upon the country, and region an application and user are operating within.&nbsp; Virtualization - We regularly create sandboxes, staging, and alternate means of providing an environment for applications and users to operate in, delivering a more virtualized experience, based upon platform objectives. Analytics - Dashboards, analytics, and other visualizations provide us with snapshots of our world.

			<p>I am spending time learning more about what Airmap is doing with their digital notice and awareness system. I first learned about what Airmap was up to when I learned they&nbsp;were behind the notifications of national parks, and forest fires that displayed via the iPhone enabled radio controller for my DJI Phantom 3 Pro drone. I found it to be a pretty slick way to&nbsp;notify me of issues with the drone, my radio signal, and the environment around me, so when I came back to civilization I set out researching more about what Airmap does, staying in tune with what they are up to ever since. Now, Airmap's&nbsp;digital notice and awareness system caught my attention: AirMap&rsquo;s Digital Notice &amp; Awareness System works by sending an encrypted digital flight notice from a drone operator to a secure airspace management dashboard accessible by airspace authorities. Moving this beyond just the drone operator getting notifications about device or environmental conditions based upon my latitude, longitude, and elevation. This system allows for an event driven notification system to be put in place between drone operator(s) and the cloud, modeling an airplane flight control system, but for the drone universe.&nbsp; For me, this is just one possible control system for drones--a cloud, mobile, and device based flight control system. I'm thinking about movie production, agricultural, mining, disaster, and many other types of control systems. Airmap&nbsp;provides you with some of the APIs you will need to develop a drone platform and/or application(s) that will deliver in these areas: Status API - Provide nearby airspace information, including advisories, and notice requirements. Airspace API - Interact with the surrounding airspace including its obstacles, rules, and requirements. Flight API - Create and query flights, verify a pilot meets flight requirements, and provide digital notice. Pilot API - Manage a pilot's profile, preferences, and provide identity verification.

			<p>I spend a lot of time connecting the dots with APIs, trying to understand what resources are available via an API, and then how I can actually put them to use. I can usually land the documentation page of an API, and be up to speed about what resources are available, and have a basic level of understanding of how I can put the APIs to work withing 15 minutes--if the API is reasonably designed, and somewhat documented. Where things get tougher for meÂ and require much heavier of a cognitive load, is going from the basicsÂ to understanding what is possible when you can really connect the dots between all the APIs a provider makes available. While I was profiling, and learning more about the AWS API Gateway, which is an API that let's you deploy and manage your APIs, I found that their usage of the hypermedia format HAL, significantly contributed to me going from basicsÂ to aÂ better understanding the big picture, and what is possible at scale. Each API path I learned about gave me a wealth of links describing what was possible next, providing details on what I should be doing next, perpetually introducing and teaching me about what is possible with the AWS API Gateway. I am hyper aware of the cost of getting up and running using an API. As a one person shop, reviewing thousands of APIs, my time is precious. I've looked at all of the AWS APIs, and it's easy to get a basic understanding of the resources available with their classic action= approach, but I rarely ever see the big picture of what is possible with the API. After spending the same amount of time in the AWS Gateway API as I would have spent learning any of the other AWS APIs, I found that I had a much greater understanding of what was possible, due to the presence of the hypermedia design pattern.

			<p>I'm learning a lot about HTTP/2 and gRPC this week, so I have been thinking about how we isolate ourselves by focusing in on individual toolsets, where we should really be expanding our horizons, helping ensure we have the most robust and diverse API toolbox we possibly can. Depending on what part of the tech universe an engineer comes from they'll have a different view on just exactly what I mean when I say API to them. The most common perspective that people respond with is REST. Folks automatically think this is what I mean when I say API--it isn't. That is your dogma&nbsp;or your gullibility to other people's dogma--please expand your horizons. When I say APIs, I mean an application programming interface that leverages web technology (aka HTTP, HTTP/2). Sure REST is the dominating philosophy in this discussion, but I see no benefit in limiting ourselves in this fashion--I see API as a toolbox, with the following toolsets: REST - Considering Roy Fielding's&nbsp;guidance when it comes to leveraging HTTP in my API design. Hypermedia - Considering the web, and the role that links can play in your API design. Webhooks - Helping keep APIs a two-way street, expanding your API to respond to events not just single requests. GraphQL - Helping put powerful query tooling in the hands of API consumers when working with large and complex datasets. gRPC - Acknowledging that the HTTP protocol is evolving, and our API contract can evolve along with the specification. This represents the major toolsets that are currently in my API toolbox. Sure there are a number of other individual tools and specifications in there as well, but this represents the top tier toolsets I am looking at when it comes to getting things done. In my opinion, there is a time and place for each of these toolsets to be put to use.

			<p>I have been learning more about the way Google designs and defines their APIs after their release of their API design guide. When I research a company's APIs I always spend time looking through their Github repositories for anything interesting, and while poking around in Google's I found a repository of "interface definitions for a small (but growing) set of Google APIs". I keep track of any Github repo I find containing API definitions, but Google's repo stood out because it contained a set of API definitions that covered both APIs that support both REST and gRPC. Straight from the Github repo, they support two ways of access APIs: "Google APIs use&nbsp;Protocol Buffers&nbsp;version 3 (proto3) as their Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages. The same interface definition is used for both REST and RPC versions of the API, which can be accessed over different wire protocols." JSON over HTTP: You can access Google APIs directly using JSON over HTTP, using&nbsp;Google API client libraries&nbsp;or third-party API client libraries. Protocol Buffers over gRPC: You can access Google APIs published in this repository through&nbsp;GRPC, which is a high-performance binary RPC protocol over HTTP/2. It offers many useful features, including request/response multiplex and full-duplex streaming. This is the first example of this I've seen in the wild, and it feels like we are shifting from an HTTP to an HTTP/2&nbsp;API world. I don't think regular old REST or web APIs are going anywhere, I think they'll continue to be a staple, but it looks like Google is laying the groundwork for two-speed APIs, that are defined using a common API definition--you pick the speed you need. I've been hearing tales of gRPC usage for a while and seeing more APIs defined using protocol buffers, but Google's approach signals a wider more significant shift for me.

			<p><em>09 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I read a lot of content about APIs. I read a lot of redundant and fluffy marketing and technical jargon, trying to understand exactly what an API does, or doesn't do. Before I criticize, I have to admit that crafting really good API marketing and documentation is hard. Only about 5% of what I read is good, a significant portion is just incomplete and lazily done by someone who doesn't care--the rest is actually incorrect, misleading, and straight up hype. There are three layers to the API hype onion in my experience: Marketing - The fluff on the main page written by the marketing team who usually doesn't care about the API and has taken the time to get to know what it does. Documentation - The technical fluff in the API portal usually written by someone technical, and not quite possessing the skills to talk to humans, let alone coherently explain something to another human being. API - The actual naming, ordering, parameters, and overall request and response structure for an API that actually accomplishes something--it may not always accomplish exactly what I'm looking for, but at least it is. While I still read marketing&nbsp;and documentation, because they provide me with clues about the intent behind API operations, when I actually want the honest take of what an API does, I always go straight to the API and get to work making API calls. This is a problem that is only increasing as we enter into the artificial intelligence and machine learning hype phase. After you finish writing the marketing, documentation, and have your API up and running--step back, and re-read everything, and think about the synchronicity between these three areas of your operations. It takes a lot of practice&nbsp;and hard work to do right, but I think if you just take a moment, step back, and think about these layers to how you articulate what your APIs does--you will immediately find yourself in...[<a href="/2017/03/09/the-three-layers-of-api-hype/">Read More</a>]</p>

To help you in your journey, and mine, I try to document any official versioning strategies published by API providers I research. Today I have one from Google, providing some very interesting insight into how they version their APIs. Google uses&nbsp;Semantic Versioning, which follows this approach to each version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, incrementing the: MAJOR&nbsp;version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR&nbsp;version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, PATCH&nbsp;version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. When it comes to their REST APIs Google puts the version in URL, and I'm still learning more about their approach to how it's applied to the proto package for gRPC APIs. They also have some good advice when it comes to what is breaking and non-breaking changes. Backwards-compatible (non-breaking) changes: Adding an API interface to an API service definition Adding a method to an API interface Adding an HTTP binding to a method Adding a field to a request message Adding a field to a response message Adding a value to an enum Adding an output-only resource field Backwards-incompatible (breaking) changes: Removing or renaming a service, field, method or enum value Changing an HTTP binding Changing the type of a field Changing a resource name format Changing visible behavior of existing requests Changing the URL format in the HTTP definition Adding a read/write field to a resource message This Google API versioning advice comes from their API design guide. I also found some versioning advice from them as part of the Google Cloud Endpoints documentation, which provides...[<a href="/2017/03/09/guidance-on-versioning-your-api-from-google/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>This is the third post in my effort to try and define the three sides of my API monitoring. I'm trying to quantify what is needed as a sort of API industry monitoring dashboard -- if there is such a thing. To help me think through this, I have taken my approach to monitoring the API space and I'm breaking them up into three buckets API awareness, API observability, and now API ratings. While the three areas share many common characteristics, the motivations behind each area are significantly different--enough so, I want to look at them and evolve them separately. A rating system for the API space is something I usually get one or two requests to discuss each quarter, sustained throughout the year. I have very different actors approaching me to solve this, from hedge fund managers, to venture capital managers, to startups and enterprise organizations. Everyone (except one) who has approached me to date has been woefully unaware of the scope of doing something like creating a Standard and Poors or Moody's for the API economy, which is always a red flag for me when it comes to understanding their motivations. I do not have the resources to develop an API ranking system on my own, and I have no desire to exclusively own such a thing--it needs to be an open, community driven thing. However, I do have interest it trying to define possible algorithms for such a ranking system, derived from the approach I've developed for myself. I am driving this work from a master dump of my research, and the approach I have used to track on in the world of APIs since 2010--an analyst 100K view, and here is what I'm considering... Discovery -&nbsp;If we are rating APIs, they need to be discoverable, and accessible--if you can't find them, understand what they do, and kick the tires--you really can't rate something.

			<p><em>08 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I just wanted to take a moment and highlight some folks who are doing interesting things with APIs. I spend a lot of time focusing on the companies, products, and services from&nbsp;the sector, but I don't talk a lot about individual people. So I wanted to pause for a moment and just highlight a couple of people doing really interesting things with APIs right now.
If have been paying attention to API definitions in the last year, then you probably have come across APIs.guru, the Wikipedia for APIs. They have 244 OpenAPI definitions available in their catalog, which&nbsp;is the most comprehensive directory of machine readable API definitions out there. If you have an OpenAPI for your API you should be publishing it to APIs.guru. if you don't, you should be creating one, and then publishing it to APIs.guru.
Here are the hardworking, API-savvy folks behind APIs.guru:





Ivan Goncharov

Twitter:&nbsp;https://twitter.com/E1Goncharov





Roman Hotsiy 

Twitter:&nbsp;https://twitter.com/RomanHotsiy
Github:&nbsp;https://github.com/RomanGotsiy

&nbsp;




I am in the middle of a project where I am building on the work these two have invested in with APIs.guru. I'm hoping that with the next wave of this work, I'll have some complete API definitions I can contribute to APIs.guru. I encourage you to make sure your API definitions are published to the directory so that other people like me can include your APIs in our work.
Beyond the APIs.guru directory, I recommend checking out their Github repository, as they are doing some interesting things with GraphQL. If you need help crafting an API definition for your API platform, or in need of other API advice, I recommend messaging the APIs.guru team. I'm sure they'd be happy to talk to you, and see where they can help you with your API efforts.

			<p>This is an outline I pulled together for a potential project I am working on this week. It's derived from my research, and previous workshops I've done with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies in the past. I wanted to share here, in hopes it would stimulate API-focused conversations with some interesting folks. I put together a framework to guide a full day discussion between us, which will leave you with a greater awareness of what an API focus can bring to your company, and leave you with a strategy that you could apply to your API operations back home. This framework is assembled from the last seven years of monitoring the API practices of leading companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others, but tailored to meet the needs of a retail and digital commerce focused company. I don't expect you to digest everything here in a single reading, it is the complete list of building blocks which we will move around, and organize in a guide for you to take back with you. API 101I wanted to start with the basics&nbsp;and help provide you and your organization grasp the fundamental concepts of why having an API focus is important to doing business in 2017. It is important that all stakeholders have a base level awareness of the what and why of APIs are, as well as the technical, business, and legal implications of API operations. Here is an outline for our discussion: What Is API?&nbsp;- Discuss your overall web strategy, and discuss how your API operations will augment, complement, and extend your web presence. Why do API?&nbsp;- Cover why APIs will help you deliver to web and mobile, as well as bring more flexibility in any&nbsp;system to system integrations internally, and with your partners.

			<p><em>07 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>There is a reason why I encourage API providers to look at not just the technology of APIs&nbsp;but also invest heavily into the business and politics of API operations. There is a reason I evangelize a more open, web-based approach to doing APIs, even if you are peddling hardware and device APIs. It is because there are a number of human-centered elements present when doing APIs, that will&nbsp;define your services, and ultimately contribute to whether or not they are a success&nbsp;or a failure. One example of this from my API news curation archives is from the Sonos API ecosystem, and a pretty big blunder in communication the audio device platform made late last year, that is significantly impacting their partnerships in 2017. &nbsp;Directly from the CEPro article: A collective cheer roared from home-technology installers at&nbsp;CEDIA Expo 2016, when&nbsp;Sonos announced an API&nbsp;for home-automation integration starting with&nbsp;Control4&nbsp;(Nasdaq:&nbsp;CTRL),&nbsp;Crestron,&nbsp;iPort,&nbsp;Lutron&nbsp;and&nbsp;Savant. These partners &ndash; and most other respectable smart-home systems providers &ndash; have integrated with Sonos for many years, albeit with unsanctioned drivers created through reverse-engineering of a fairly straightforward UPnP-based protocol. But the new API kind of snuck up on dealers and vendors alike, with their customers waking up to a brand new&nbsp;Sonos&nbsp;experience in late December, courtesy of an auto-update by Sonos. The new experience was inferior to the original, with users unable to access Spotify or Amazon Music from the home automation system, except to select favorites created through Sonos&rsquo;s own app. When you are operating an API that many different businesses depend on, communication is essential. this is why I advocate that API providers always have a clear communication and support strategy, as well as the road map, issue management, and change log processes. Every single change has to be considered for its impact on the community, and you have to have a plan for how you will be communicating and supporting&nbsp;your API consumers needs around a change.&nbsp; This is also why API providers should be understanding the...[<a href="/2017/03/07/there-is-more-to-this-than-just-having-an-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I am finally seeing more solutions available for API providers when it comes to publishing an portal for their API operations. I've long had my minimum viable API portal definition, which I recently deployed to support the Miami Open211 API, and I also wrote about AWS serverless approach to an API portal. Next up, is a WordPress solution from my API management partner Tyk.
The WordPress API portal solution has the following features:

Automatic developer registration on Tyk when developers sign up in WP
Configuration of API policies available for token registration
Developers may request an access token for the available API policies
Automatic or manual approval of key requests
Storage of token (references) by name and API policy
Revoking of tokens by developer
Display usage statistics per key
Request quota usage per key

All the basics you need when standing up a basic API operation. If WordPress is your go-to content management system, then it might make sense for you to think about API portal&nbsp;in these terms. The&nbsp;Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS)&nbsp;is already using the plugin&nbsp;in production, and you can download the plugin on Github, or find it over at WordPress.org.
We need multiple versions of API portals like this, designed for every type of platform a company, organization, institution, and government agency might be already using as a default platform for their operations. This is why API management providers need to follow Tyk's&nbsp;lead and make sure your solution is API driven--practicing what you preach so that your API management solution can be integrated anywhere.

			<p><em>07 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I have been processing Google's API design guide, and an unexpected part of the work has been learning more about gRPC, which Google is&nbsp;"converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs." -- something I have not seen in an API design guide until now. "gRPC uses&nbsp;protocol buffers&nbsp;as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing both the service interface and the structure of the payload messages", and is something I'm hearing more chatter about from larger providers, which I think represents the evolving world of API design beyond the old REST days. According to the site, "gRPC is used in last mile of computing in mobile and web client since it can generate libraries for iOS and Android and uses standards based HTTP/2 as transport allowing it to easily traverse proxies and firewalls. There is also work underway to develop a JS library for use in browsers. Beyond that, it is ideal as a microservices interconnect, not just because the core protocol is very efficient but also because the framework has pluggable authentication, load balancing etc. Google itself is also transitioning to use it to connect microservices." To help me learn anything I need an example to reverse engineer, showing me how things work--so here are the examples they provide from the site: Google Cloud BigTable Client APIs Google Cloud PubSub APIs Google Cloud Speech APIs I'm going to add a research area for gRPC, similar to hypermedia, as well as GraphQL. It helps me better keep track of the&nbsp;news&nbsp;about each approach to crafting APIs, and a single place I can go to reference service providers, and working examples. I've had gRPC / Protocol Buffers on my monitoring list for some time now, but seeing Google invest so heavily in this area gives me a signal that I should be paying attention to gRPC more, and gathering more examples that I can share with my readers.

			<h3><a href="/2017/03/06/thinking-about-openapi-provenance/">Thinking About OpenAPI Provenance</a></h3>
			<p><em>06 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I am building on the great work by the APIs.guru team, assembling a collection of Google definitions. I will be forking their Google Open definitions and wrap them in APIs.json indexes, so I can analyze the APIs at the 100K level, and potentially augment, and enrich the existing OpenAPIs that the APIs.guru team has worked so hard on.&nbsp;
When APIs.guru crafts an OpenAPI for an API, they have a set of OpenAPI extensions that&nbsp;provides a snapshot of the history for each OpenAPI. They provide six OpenAPI extensions, specific to their API discovery objectives:
x-apiClientRegistration:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://console.developers.google.com' x-logo: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/product/2x/blogger_64dp.png' x-origin: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;format: google &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/blogger/v3/rest' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;version: v1 x-preferred: true x-providerName: googleapis.com x-serviceName: blogger
I like that they include the origin of thier API definitions. I want to do the same, but I would like to turn x-origin into a collection so that I can add multiple entries into it, and evolve it beyond just origin. I want to show the provenance for the API definition, that I build mine on top of APIs.guru's hard work, and that they built theirs on Google's using their discovery format. I'm going to add x-provenance to mine&nbsp;and start tracking on the source of where my API definitions originate and include anything else present when I imported.
It is important that we are able to have many different copies of an API's definition, in a variety of formats. There will be copies of API definitions all over Github, and the web, for a variety of different purposes. I'd like to see more stewards of API definitions include some sort of origin, provenance, and history for their API definitions. If they are yours, they are authoritative and it isn't necessary, but if they are for 3rd party APIs, try to capture as much information as you can about where it comes from, to help everyone understand it's history.

			<p>This is a repeat story of one I&nbsp;wrote two years ago, but things haven't changed so I'm going to rant about again, 2017 style. We need someone to develop an open source, visual API design editor. There is the Swagger Editor, but that is more a web IDE, and I'm looking for a well designed, intuitive, visual editor for managing your OpenAPI definitions, that is embeddable and easily integrated into any web or mobile system. There are examples of nice visual API design editors with some of the leading API service providers, but I'm looking for something any API service provider could put to work. I included these examples in my last story, except I'm including Stoplight this round instead of Gelato, because they gave me an upgrade my account message,&nbsp;and wouldn't let me see the interface. These are currently my favorite three API design editors: Restlet&nbsp;- A design, deployment, management service provider. APIMATIC&nbsp; - An SDK, API definition transformer, and continous integration provider. Stoplight&nbsp;- An API design, definition, documentation, and orchestration provider. I enjoy using all three of their API design interfaces. They are well thought out&nbsp;and provide what you need to design new APIs, as well manage the design of your existing APIs. While they are doing a good job at this, it is something I'd like to see standardized, and open sourced, so that other service providers do not have to reinvent the wheel here. We shouldn't have to use a different API design interface for each service we depend on, we need a common editor, making things more familiar.&nbsp; Ok, rant over. This is something I'll keep talking about until there is a solution. Oh, I have to say, I am impressed with what the Materia&nbsp;team has done for API design on the desktop. Between them and Stoplight, there has been positive motion forward. I'm just looking to give things another nudge and help folks understand the opportunity.

			<p><em>06 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>Everyone developing APIs struggles with API design. Ok, maybe a few of the gurus out there don't, but the rest of us need education, practice, and ideally someone or something to help guide us through the best practices when it comes to API design. I try to track what different companies are doing when it comes to API design, and maintain a list of any API design guides I come across in my work. If you are looking to start getting a grasp on API design at your company, organization, institution or agency, I recommend starting on the journey to define your own API design guide--you will be surprised what you can learn along the way. You can kick things off by visiting my API design research, but I strongly recommend you head over to the API Stylebook, and build on this important work. My friend Arnaud has aggregated 12 of the leading API design guides out there and is currently processing Google's API design guide, adding more knowledge&nbsp;to the repository. He takes each API design guide and breaks them down into common API design topics that you can consider as part of your own process, and resulting guide. His work is all machine readable and forkable so that you can easily assemble your own guide, and get to work learning, defining, and refining--then you can submit your guide to the API Stylebook when you are ready. API design and API definitions are the top two most trafficked areas of my website in 2017, and most of 2016. API design is top of mind for API providers who are further along in their journey, and the ones who are seriously rocking it usually have some sort of guide, helping keep things consistent. If you need any help, feel free to reach out. I am not an API design expert, but I know my way around the finer details, and concepts at play, and I'm happy...[<a href="/2017/03/06/do-you-have-an-api-design-guide-for-your-operations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was dreaming of a more modular, event-driven approach to API monetization&nbsp;the other day, and I found myself thinking more about the motivations behind each API call made, from the perspective of both the consumer and the provider. With this story I am just thinking about just the POST, or how we usually add something to a system via API--this is not always the case, but it is the common usage of the verb.&nbsp; I don't have any numbers to support this, but the majority of APIs I encounter are GET only. The more mature API platforms have diverse stacks, using their verbs, but when companies are just getting going with their API operations, they rarely use POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. When it comes to having APIs, and incentivizing developers to generate some&nbsp;value using APIs, it seems like a company wants to encourage the creation of valuable data and content. I was talking with Lufthansa Airlines the other day, and one of the things that they said to me that stood out&nbsp;when we were talking about the different APIs available, was that none of them matter if someone doesn't buy (POST) a ticket. Today, while on the phone with one of my partners, they asked if they could put my industry guides behind a lead generation form--something I allow my partners do. However, I wish more of them had a POST path for me to submit new leads, share stories, topics, and other times, for a variety of reasons--I promise would help generate value with each API call. With this work I am ramping up for my API monetization and API plan research, thinking about the bigger picture of how we generate value, as well as make money doing all of this. I guess that I am just lamenting the stagnation of how APIs are being designed, and deployed, with any sensible or even creative monetization strategies.

			<p><em>03 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>Google released an API design guide recently. I'll be adding the design guide to the list of examples I have in my API design research. The Google API design guide is pretty straight forward in its purpose, with a goal of helping, "developers design&nbsp;simple, consistent and easy-to-use&nbsp;networked APIs", but I thought it was noteworthy that they were also looking to help "converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs." gRPC and Protocol Buffers has been on my task list to learn more about for a while now, but without any projects at scale, it's probably not a task I'll find much time for anytime soon. I'll try to carve off more time to learn how folks like Google are doing it, through their guides and storytelling. One thing I did know, which Google reinforces is that"many companies use socket-based RPC APIs to carry most network traffic, which can be orders of magnitude higher than public REST APIs." I like&nbsp;their approach that, "both RPC APIs and HTTP REST APIs are needed for various reasons. Ideally, an API platform should provide best support for all APIs". They also provide a note that "This Design Guide explains how to apply REST principles to API designs independent of programming language, operating system, or network protocol. It is NOT a guide solely to creating REST APIs." I like this because we are getting past the notion that API design is simply about REST--it is clearly evolving to be more about getting the work&nbsp;done&nbsp;than any single philosophy or dogma. In addition to encouraging more API providers to craft an API design guide for their companies using API Stylebook, and sharing their API design guides with the public, I will also be encouraging companies to think beyond just REST when they consider their API design best practices.

			<p><em>03 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>There have been many advances in the way that we deploy APIs in the last couple of years, but I still want more of an embeddable, push botton way to deploy generic or even more specialized APIs. This is something I've ranted about before, asking where the deploy to AWS and Google buttons. I'm seeing more AWS solutions emerge, helping deploy from Github using AWS Codeploy, and the regular number of deploy to Heroku buttons, but not the real growth I'd like to see occur--making it a drum I will keep beating&nbsp;until I get what I want. I was working on my OpenAPI toolbox, cataloging open source tools that put the OpenAPI specification to work, and came across a deploy with Heroku button for the Grape Doorkeeper, which helps you "create an awesome versioned API, secured with OAuth2 and automatically documented". This should be the&nbsp;default for all server-side API deployment frameworks, allowing push button deployment of any open source API framework to the cloud platform of your choosing. If I have my way, it won't just be API frameworks that will have deployment buttons. Specialized API designs, available in a variety of frameworks will be available for deployment with a single click of a button. We should be able to deploy a product API, or a user API, to AWS, Heroku, Google, or Microsoft, with a single click. There should be a wealth of open source templates for us to choose from on Github, with deploy buttons, and easy to follow wizards that help us set things up properly. Smells like an opportunity to me. I'll have to think more about where the revenue would come from in such a model, but I'm sure it would be easy enough to upsell deployments to some premium features and services. I understand that both the areas of API design and API deployment are playing catch-up with API management at the moment, but someone needs to get to...[<a href="/2017/03/03/deploy-a-grape-doorkeeper-driven-api-to-heroku-with-a-click-of-a-button/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I was handed the URL for a human services API implementation for Miami. It was my job to now deploy a portal, documentation, and other supporting resources for the API implementation. This project is part of the work I'm doing with Open Referral to help push forward the API conversation around the human services data specification (HSDS). I got to work forking my minimum viable API portal definition, to provide a doorway for the Miami Open211 API. &nbsp;Next, I got to work on setting up a basic presence for the human services API. I started with giving the portal a title, and a basic description of what the service does, then I got to work on each of the portal elements that will help people put the data to work. Getting StartedIt can be hard to cut through what you need to get going with an API&nbsp;and cut through all the information available. The portal has a getting started page providing a basic introduction, a handful of links to the documentation, code, and where to get help--the page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository. AuthenticationI included an authentication page to make it clear that the API is publicly available, but also provide a placeholder to explain that we will be opening up write access to the organizations, locations, and services that are being made available--the page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository. Frequently Asked QuestionsNext, I wanted to always have the most frequently asked questions front and center where anyone can find it. I am using this page as a default place to publish any questions asked via Github, Twitter, or email. The page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository.

			<p><em>02 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I used to have a Github repository dedicated to Swagger tooling and implementations, but I took it down after Swagger was donated to the Linux Foundation. I've rebooted it as my OpenAPI Toolbox, providing a single Github repository for managing an active list of open source tooling built on top of the OpenAPI specification.
Here is a snapshot of my toolbox of OpenAPI-driven solutions, as it stands today. This site is a Jekyll-driven website running on Github, using Github Pages. The tools in this toolbox are driven by a YAML file in the _data folder for this repository, with the HTML pages driven using Liquid.
Here are the tools organized by type of implementation (something that is evolving quickly):















Documentation


Generators


Servers









&nbsp;



Clients


Editors

&nbsp;



Here they are organized by programming language, providing another dimension to look at the tooling being developed on top of OpenAPI.




 






  
 
  
 
  


 

  
 
  
 
  



This project is forkable using the Github repository, and accessible as JSON. If you have a tool you think should be added, or there is something that needs fixing, you can submit an issue on the Github repository, or submit a pull request. It is meant to be a community project, designed to be forkable, shareable, and machine-readable.
I've just started adding the tools I have in my database. I only have 37 so far, but will be adding more as I have time. Once I have it up to date, I will start thinking about other ways to slice and dice the tools, to better understand what is being built on the OpenAPI specification, what tools are being built on the upcoming 3.0 version, as well as working to identify where the gaps and opportunities are for developing tooling.

			<p><em>02 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>I was learning about the approach Amazon has taken with their serverless API developer portal, and highlighting their approach to API plans, and couldn't help but think there was more to it all than just rate limiting your API. Amazon's approach to API plans is in alignment with other API management providers, allowing you to deploy your APIs, meter, rate limit, and charge for access to your API--standard business of APIs stuff. Controlling access to a variety of API resources is something that has been well-defined over the last decade by API management providers like 3Scale, and now Tyk&nbsp;and DreamFactory. They provide you with all the tools you need to define access to APIs, and meter access based upon a wide variety of parameters. While I haven't seen the type of growth I expected to see in this area, we have seen a significant amount of growth because API management providers are helping to standardize things--something that will grow significantly because of availability&nbsp;from cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google. We have a lot of work ahead of us, standardizing how we charge for API consumption at scale. We have even more work ahead of us to realize that we can turn all of this on its head, and start paying for API consumption at scale. I do not understand how we've gotten so hung up on the click and the view, when there are so many&nbsp;other richer, and more meaningful actions already occurring&nbsp;every second, of each day online. We should be identifying these opportunities, then paying and incentivizing developers to consume APIs in most valuable way possible.&nbsp; With modern approaches to API management, we already have the infrastructure in place. We need to just start thinking about our APIs differently. We also need to get better at leveraging POST, PUT, and PATCH, as well as GET, when it comes to paying for consumption.

			<p><em>01 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I come across more companies managing their OpenAPI definition as a single Github repository. One example of this is from the New York Times, who as the API definitions for their platform available as its own Github repository. It demonstrates the importance of maintaining your API definitions separately from any particular implementation, such as just your documentation.
You can find Individual OpenAPIs for their&nbsp;archive_api, updated description, article_search,books_api, community, geo_api, most_popular_api, movie_reviews, semantic_api, times_tags, timeswire, top_stories&nbsp;broken down into separate folders within the Github repository. The NYT also provides markdown documentation, alongside the machine-readable OpenAPI definition in each folder, helping make sure things are human-readable.
It just makes sense to manage your API definitions this way. It's more than just documentation. When you do this, you are taking advantage of the repository and version control features of Github, but you also open things up for participation through forking and pull requests. The resulting definition and machine readable contract can then be injected anywhere into the integration&nbsp;and API lifecycle, internally or externally.
I personally like it when companies manage their API definitions in this way. It gives me a central truth to work with when profiling their operations, something that will be used across my research and storytelling. The more you describe your APIs in this way, the more chance I will be writing about them&nbsp;and including them across my work.

			<p>I was playing around with the&nbsp;new Github topics, and found that it provides an interesting look at the API space, one that I'm hoping will continue to evolve, and maybe I can influence. I typed 'api-' into Github's topic tagging tool for my repository, and after I tagged each of my research areas with appropriate tags, I set out exploring these layers of Github by clicking on each tag. It is something that became quite a wormhole of API exploration. I had to put it down, as I could spend hours looking through the repositories, but I wanted to create a machine-readable mapping to my existing API research areas, that I could use to regularly keep an eye on these slices of the Github pie--in an automated way. Definitions&nbsp;- These are the topics I'm adding to my monitoring of the API space when it comes to API definitions.

			<h3><a href="/2017/03/01/a-machine-readable-definition-for-your-aws-api-plan/">A Machine Readable Definition For Your AWS API Plan</a></h3>
			<p><em>01 Mar 2017</em></p>
			<p>
I was learning about the AWS Serverless Developer Portal, and found their API plan layer to be an interesting evolution in how we define the access tiers of our APIs. There were a couple different layers of AWS's approach to deploying APIs that I found interesting, including the AWS marketplace integration, but I wanted to stop for a moment and focus in on their API plan approach.
Using the AWS API Gateway you can establish a variety of API plans, with the underlying mechanics of that plan configurable via the AWS API Gateway user interface or the AWS API Gateway API. In the documentation for the&nbsp;AWS Serverless Developer&nbsp;Portal, they include a JSON snippet of the configuration of the plan for each API being deployed.
This reminds me that I needed to take another look at my API plan research, and take the plan configuration, rate limit, and other&nbsp;service composition API definitions I have, and aggregate their schema into a single snapshot. It has been a while since I worked on my machine-readable API plan definition, and there are now enough API management solutions with an API layer out there, I should be able to pull a wider sampling of the&nbsp;schema in play. I'm not in the business of defining what the definition should be, I am only looking to aggregate what others are doing.
I am happy to see more folks sharing machine-readable OpenAPI definitions describing the surface area of their APIs. As this work continues to grow we are going to have to also start sharing machine-readable definitions of the monetization, plan, and access layers of our API operations. After I identify the schema in play for some of the major API management providers I track on, I'm going to invest more work into my standard API plan definition to make the access levels of APIs more discoverable using APIs.json.
