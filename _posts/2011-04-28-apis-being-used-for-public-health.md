<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/foursquare/foursquare-health-api-usage.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />[Foursquare just highlighted an innovative use of their API][1], that alerts people to public health issues.

[DontEat.at][2] is a service which merges city health code records with the [Foursquare API][3] to warn people via text message, when they check into a restaurant that has recorded health code violations.

An excellent example of the power of APIs for mashing up data and providing real-time value that can even be used for the public good.
