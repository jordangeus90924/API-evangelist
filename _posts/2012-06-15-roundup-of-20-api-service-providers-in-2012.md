Its been over six months since I did my [roundup of 11 API service providers on ProgrammableWeb][1].  I've been seeing enough new entries into the space, I think its time to do another roundup, providing a single list of API service providers for you to explore.

I will start with I called the grandfathers of the space.  The ones who were doing it before APIs became all cool.

Layer 7 products simplify the management of open API for developer communities, partner and cross-divisional integration via SOA, cloud connectivity, and enterprise mobile enablement for BYOD (bring-your-own-device) initiatives. 

After my post in October of 2011, two other providers came out of the woodwork and said, "Hey! what about us?  We've been doing this a while too!"  So I have to include them this time.

It provides a secure point of entry to fend off denial of service threats, code injection, and other malicious traffic.

Then there are the three major players in API management, that have been dominating the current landscape:
