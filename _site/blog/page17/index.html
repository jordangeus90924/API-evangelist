			<p>Having quotes from your customers on your company website is a no-brainer. Finding the best examples of brands and companies putting your valuable service, or tool to work demonstrates it has value, and that people are using it.
While playing around with a new chrome add-on reverse engineering tool called&nbsp;CRX Extractor, I noticed the quote at the bottom of their page:

They win in my book for having a funny, but also pretty realistic endorsement for why you should be using a product. I'm using the tool to better understand how browser add-ons are putting APIs to work&nbsp;and evolve my own creations as well, but I can see reverse engineering them to make sure they are secure is a pretty important aspect of operating your company securely online.
When it comes to marketing your API, make sure you have quotes from smart people, as well as brands that people know, makes sense, but I would also add that making them funny, and allowing ourselves to laugh along the way can make a significant impact with the right people as well

			<p><em>24 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
One of the reasons why crafting API definitions like OpenAPI Spec for our APIs, and openly sharing them on the web, is so that the pattern will get used, and reused by other API providers. That might sound scary to some companies, but really that is what you want--your API design used across an industry. Your API definition is not your IP, it is the magic behind your API, and the way you approach all the supporting elements around your API operations.
There are numerous industries where I'd like to see a common API definition emerge, and get reused, and one of the more obvious ones is in the area of building permits. Open Permit has shared their API definition, by publishing the OpenAPI Spec to drive their Swagger UI documentation. This is a great example of an API definition that should be emulated across the industry&nbsp;because the money to be made is not around the API design, but the portion of our economy that the API will fuel when it is in operation.
Can you imagine if all cities, contractors, and vendors who service the construction industry could put APIs to use, and even better, put common patterns to use? If you have ever tried to build something residential or commercial&nbsp;and had to pull a permit, you understand. This is one industry where APIs need to be unleashed, and we need to make sure we share all possible API definitions&nbsp;so that they can get used, and we aren't ever re-inventing the wheel.

			<p><em>24 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was introduced to a new open source, Dockerized API operations solution called Wicked, that was developed by the integrated cloud and desktop solutions provider, the Haufe Group. There are a number of open source API management solutions out there, and an even greater number of API frameworks that can help you deploy your APIs, but Wicked is the first to span several areas of the API life cycle including DNS,&nbsp;deployment, containers, authentication, management, and&nbsp;documentation, Built On Existing Open Source API GatewayThe Haufe Group built the core of Wicked on top of an existing open source API management solution, further augmenting, evolving, and improving on an existing solution: Kong API Gateway - Use Mashape Kong to protect and proxy your backend APIs Why reinvent the wheel? It makes sense to build on existing solutions for API management, developing on top of what is already being used by API architects and developers. Simple Developer OnboardingWicked employs the latest approaches to allowing developers to onboard with an API, sticking to what is already working for API providers, and what developers expect:&nbsp; Authenticate with email and password - Let your users sign up with their email address and a password. Email addresses will be automatically validated by sending out verification emails. Authentication with GitHub or Google - You may also configure signup and login using OAuth2 with GitHub and/or Google. These identities will be treated as 'verified' automatically. I like that they let you use Github or Google on top of the standard email and password setup. I've been aggregating all my personal API developer accounts under my single @kinlane Github account, and when I set up a business account I authenticate using my @apievangelist Github account--more API providers should offer this, to help us all organize our accounts. Using Modern API AuthenticationThere are a handful of proven approaches out there for allowing developers to authenticate against an API, and Wicked allows for two of the most common&nbsp;approaches:...[<a href="/2016/08/24/a-wicked-good-open-source-api-deployment-and-management-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>There are two distinct types of APIs I keep an eye on. One is what I call my life cycle APIs, which are the APIs of the service providers who are selling services and tools to API providers and developers. The second category is what I call my stack network, and these are the individual API providers, who offer a wide range of API resources--you can find both of these types on the home page of API Evangelist.&nbsp; The 50+ life cycle APIs I track on can be used by companies to manage almost every stop along a modern API life cycle. In theory, all of these service providers have APIs. In reality, they do, but they do not practice what they preach&nbsp;and often do not make their APIs easily discoverable. I have said it a thousand times before--if you sell online services to API providers, you should have an API. Period. At some point in the future, I will have profiled all of the companies included in my API life cycle research, like I did for API monitoring, and be able to provide a comprehensive API stack across all the providers for all stops along the life cycle. Ideally, each provider would have their own OpenAPI spec, but I'm still getting many of them to make their APIs public, convincing them of the importance of also having an API definition for their API will come next. Then I'll continue pushing on them to allow for the import / export of API definitions, so their customers can more easily get up and running with their services--if you need an example of this in the wild, take a look at Sandbox, or over at API Metrics. I'd love to see someone take this idea and run with it beyond what I'm able to do as a one-man act. There are numerous API aggregation solutions already out there for financial, healthcare, images, documents, and more.

			<p><em>23 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I wrote the other day about the interesting opportunity opening up within the satellite imagery API layer, and earlier about the similar opportunity that is being expanded within the fast growing dimension of our world being opened up with drones. Layers within maps are nothing new, and is something that Google has pushed forward early on in the history of APIs with Google Maps, but I feel is further being expanding on as APIs open new dimensions like satellites and drones. Then being further expanded on by adding API access to each layer for augmenting, and injecting other valuable API resources into these newly created API dimensions. Let's see if I can successful describe the multiple API dimensions being opened up here. APIs are providing access to maps of our physical world, whether it is on the ground, from the air with drones, or from space with satellites, and these API-driven maps have layers, which are also made available via APIs, allowing other API driven resources like weather, forest fires, restricted spaces, and temporary or permanent elements are being injected. Once injected, these API-driven mapping resources with API injected resources are also being made available via APIs, providing entirely new, and specialized resources--that is a lot of APIs! I am not even touching on the physical devices who put these maps to work also possessing APIs, like the drones, GPS units, cars, etc. This is just the expanding layer that is opening up via the multitude of API driven mapping resources&nbsp;and is further expanded when you look at the video layer which drones, mobile phones, automobiles, security cameras, and other Internet-connected devices are opening up. Drones, automobiles, and others will share layers with the mapping resources, but other video resources also will possess their own layers for augmenting the experience on the web, mobile, and television. The part of this that is really striking to me isn't just the overlapping layers between mapping, video, and...[<a href="/2016/08/23/the-expanding-api-layers-that-overlap-our-physical-and-virtual-worlds/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
Sharing your platform's road map with the public, and your community is an often overlooked aspect of API operations&nbsp;but is one that can go a long way to communicate your plans for the future with your community. This is why I carved the concept out into its own research area, to help me better understand how the successful API providers, as well as API service providers are publishing, sharing, and communicating around their road map.
One example of this recently is out of the API documentation service provider Readme.io, who didn't just publish a nice, simple, and clean road map for their platform, they also told the story of the process. This is a great way to announce that you have a road map for the platform but is also something you should repeat as often as possible, telling the story of what you just added to the road map and as much detail on why.
Sharing your road map, and the story behind goes a long way in lowering the anxiety around what the future holds for your API consumers, something that lets them know that you care about them enough to share what you have planned. In my opinion, a road map for an API platform shows that you have empathy for your community, and is something I like to encourage and support, by showcasing the process of your road map storytelling here on my blog when I can.

			<p><em>23 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I was reading the post from open data service provider Socrata about "putting citizens first"&nbsp;when it comes to opening up city, county, state, and federal government data. One of the headlines they showcased was "Texas overhauls open data portal, prioritizes commonly requested info"--which is a pretty sensible thing to consider for not just government, but also companies thinking about what to open next.
First, let me emphasize that I am talking about open data that is already published on the web in another format (or should be). What the State of Texas is doing is what I call the low-hanging fruit for API deployment--if it is on your website, it should also be available in a machine-readable&nbsp;format. Ideally, you offer HTML, as well as JSON, XML, and other relevant formats side by side within a single domain using content negotiation, but no matter how you accomplish it, the priority is making sure that commonly requested information is accessible to those who need it.
It is a shame that Texas is only now considering this with the latest revision of their portal, ideally government agencies and companies would be applying this way of thinking by default. If it is on your website as HTML, most likely it has already been deemed important, which is why it was made self-service on the open web in the first place. If you are planning on deploying an API or open data portal, and you are just wondering where you should start, make sure to learn from the State of Texas, and prioritize the commonly requested information.

			<p>
I am coming across more API providers who have carved off specific "skills" derived from their API, and offering up as part of the latest&nbsp;push to acquire new users on Slack or Facebook. Services like Github, Heroku, and Runscope that API providers&nbsp;and developers are putting to work increasingly have bots they employ, extending their API driven solutions to Slack and Facebook.
Alongside having an application gallery, and having an iPaaS solution showcase, maybe it's time to start having a dedicated page to showcase the bot solutions that are built on your API. Of course, these would start with your own bot solutions, but like application galleries, you could have bots that were built within your community as well.
I'm not going to add a dedicated&nbsp;bot showcase page until I've seen at least a handful in the wild, but I like documenting these things as I think of them. It gives me some dates to better understand at which point did certain things in the API universe begin expanding (or not). Also if you are doing a lot of bot development around your API, or maybe your community is, it might be the little nudge you need to be one of the first APIs out there with a dedicated bot showcase page.

			<p><em>22 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm pretty skeptical about many of the reasons behind why companies are connecting devices to the Internet using APIs--I am just not convinced this is the best idea when we already have so many security issues with the standard, and mobile web. Regardless, I'm constantly working to understand the motivation behind a company's motivation to do APIs, as well as what they are telling their customers.&nbsp; I published a story last week about&nbsp;defining the industrial programmable automation controller (PAC) strategy using an API, which focuses on the approach by Opto 22. To support their efforts the industrial automation provider offers up a dedicated page to educating their customers on why you would want to use REST, providing some bullets: Archive&nbsp;I/O and variable data from the PAC directly into Microsoft SQL Server using&nbsp;Microsoft's T-SQL&mdash;no OPC or ODBC required Read data from and write&nbsp;data to the PAC&nbsp;from&nbsp;your browser or web-based application using&nbsp;JavaScript. Read or write PAC data using your favorite programming language&mdash;C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Python, and many more Build a mobile application that directly accesses data on your PAC&mdash;using Java, Swift, or Xcode&nbsp; Build a data flow application for communicating with cloud platforms and cloud APIs, using Node-RED and our new SNAP PAC Nodes. Each of the industrial controllers "includes&nbsp;an HTTP/HTTPS server and RESTful API, compatible with any programming language that supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)". In my opinion, this reflects the wider API space that is serving the web and mobile objectives, allowing for integration using any programming language, as well as opening up the devices to API orchestration solutions using iPaaS, and the variety of other API service provider solutions available in the market. Ultimately I think using web technology is inexpensive, and avoids the usage of proprietary, vendor specific solutions. As the ability to offer up a web server on any physical object becomes easier and cheaper, the usage of web APIs to interact, integrate, and orchestrate around physical objects will only...[<a href="/2016/08/22/what-is-a-restful-api-and-why-does-it-matter-to-iot/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
The APIs which have seen the greatest adoption across the API space, always provide the functionality that developers are needed in their applications. It is either because the platform is already in use by their users (ie. Twitter, Facebook), or just provides the core feature that is required (ie. SMS, Email). There are an unprecedented number of high-value APIs out there, but I think many API providers still struggle when it comes to defining them in a way that speaks to the needs that web, mobile, and device app developers will be needing.
I have explored this topic before, discussing the importance of exposing the meaningful skills our APIs possess for use in the next generation of messaging and voice apps, as well as asking whether or not our APIs have the skills they need in a voice and bot enabled world. I am not 100% behind the concept that voice and bots are the future, but I am 100% behind defining our API resources in a way that immediately delivers value&nbsp;like they are doing in these environments.
The approach used by Alexa, when it comes to developing "skills" is an important concept for other API providers to consider. Even if you aren't targeting voice enablement with your APIs, the model provides many positive characteristics you should be emulating in your API design, helping you deliver more meaningful APIs. For me, thinking in terms of the skills that your APIs should be enabling, better reflects the API journey, where we move beyond just database and other very technical resources, and providing the meaningful skills developers need for success, and end-users (aka humans) are desiring.

			<p><em>22 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>My "fellow"&nbsp;Presidential Innovation Fellow&nbsp;Mollie Ruskin (@mollieruskin), was doing some work with veterans recently and stumbled across a pretty disturbing example of how racial bias is being baked into the algorithms that are driving our online, and increasingly offline worlds. This morning I was searching #&lrm;Google for images of #&lrm;Veterans for a project. I stumbled upon a photographer who had taken hundreds of beautiful photographs of Veterans all in the same style. I clicked on a few striking portraits...I quickly noticed something very troubling. When doing image searches, I often use the 'related images' feature to uncover more pictures relevant to what I'm hunting for, as was the case this time around. Where most of the photos returned related images of other veterans, one photo of a smiling black male vet in his uniform fatigues, garnered a series of related images that were all mugshots of CRIMINALS. The tools we use to fuel our 21st century lives are not the seemingly neutral blank slates we imagine them to be. They are architected and shaped by people, informed by our conscious and unconscious biases. Whether this is reflecting back a dark mirror on what people click on or surfacing a careless design in an algorithm, this random search result shines a little more light on the more subtle and insidious ways racism is baked into our modern lives. For my friends who work at the big tech giants which are increasingly the infrastructure to our lives, please help make sure your institutions are addressing this stuff. (And thanks to those of you who already have been.) #&lrm;BlackLivesMatter PS: Recently saw a great talk about this idea of 'oppression' in our algorithms. Def worth a watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRVZozEEWlE This isn't some edge weird case, this is what happens when we craft algorithms using development teams that lack diversity. Racial bias continues to get baked into our algorithms because we refuse to admit we have a problem, or unwilling to...[<a href="/2016/08/22/the-racial-bias-being-baked-into-our-algorithms/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
Technology evangelists are nothing new, but are something I think is continuing to expand as the Internet continues to crack open more of the core areas of the tech sector. I specifically chose the term API Evangelist to define what I did evangelizing for all APIs, but all I was really doing is following the lead of evangelism pioneers like Amazon, Google, and even Microsoft.&nbsp;
There has long been discussion around evangelism vs advocates, and I've seen companies also choose to adopt an ambassador format. I have also been interested to see the evolution of Docker's Captain's&nbsp;program--who are "Docker experts and leaders in their communities who demonstrate a commitment to sharing their Docker knowledge with others".&nbsp;
I also stumbled across a post out of the MongoDB as a service provider Compose showcasing what they call the database advocate, whose "job is not to guard the database from the world but to advocate the best ways to use it and offering the tools to optimize that usage". In their view, the outdated DBA is going away, with the database advocate emerging as a much more friendly, outward facing, pragmatic gatekeeper for databases within the enterprise.
It makes me happy to see the open ethos brought to the table by web APIs spreading to all the layers of the tech stack, making the world of virtualization and containers more accessible. As an old database guy, it makes me really, really happy to see it also spread to the world of databases--I am hoping that it is something that continues to spread to all layers.

			<p><em>22 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I have been talking with&nbsp;Nick Houghton over at Sandbox&nbsp;about the state of OpenAPI Spec driven API documentation, and the lack of a machine-readable core when you deployed Slate driven documentation. He was wanting the same thing--a good looking, dynamic API documentation that was OpenAPI Spec driven.
He recently got back to me&nbsp;and found a solution that worked for them: "Ended up just templating the Swagger JSON myself rather than relying on Slate etc to do it. So model/resources are Swagger annotated, CI pushes out Swagger JSON and Angular UI parses in the browser, works quite well I think".
Nick is on a similar path that I am, as I work to simply API documentation using OpenAPI Spec, and provide specialized views of APIs using Liquid. We are looking for the simplicity, control, and beauty of Slate, but the machine readable core of OpenAPI Spec--allowing us to keep the core specification for the API up to date, and the documentation is always the latest.
They are going to write up their journey on their blog (as all API service providers should), and share with us. I'll probably&nbsp;do another write-up once I get more details on how they created the templated API docs using OpenAPI Spec and Angular. I also like how they have the OpenAPI Spec JSON pushed out as part of the CI life-cycle--something I'll cover more as part of my API life-cycle orchestration research.

I saw that the contact API solution FullContact recently purchased the professional network management solution Conspire. Thankfully FullContact is good about blogging about the move, and the details of the motivations behind their decision -- without this type of storytelling I wouldn't even have known it happened.
One thing I noticed in the blog post was that "Paul, Alex, and the entire&nbsp;Conspire&nbsp;team have been fabulous partners with FullContact, having utilized our&nbsp;Person API&nbsp;as a part of the Conspire offering". Acquisitions from within an API ecosystem is not new. It is why many companies do APIs in the first place, to help identify talent within their ecosystem like Paypal does, and complimentary companies and teams like FullContact has done.
There are many mating rituals you can perform as a startup these days, and building an interesting product, service, and company on top of an API is a pretty cool way to accomplish this. Obviously, it is easier said that done, but if you can identify a real-world business problem, and develop a solution to solve this problem on top of an API, and get some real traction--it can lead to some pretty interesting outcomes.

			<p>I was going through the Cisco Devnet ecosystem and stumbled across their sandbox environment. I thought it was worth noting that they provided several different types of sandbox environments, with a rolling list of available sandbox instances at any point in time. Cisco provides seven different types of sandboxes: Networking&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Networking Sandbox allows you to remotely access Cisco Networking technologies. Each Sandbox contains either simulated or physical network elements as well as access to developer tools. Some Sandboxes also provide for the creation of synthetic traffic.&nbsp; Collaboration&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Communication and Collaboration Sandbox allows you to remotely access Cisco Collaboration technologies in a cloud lab. Labs contain Cisco UC services: Unified Communications Manager, Unified Presence, and Unity Connection. In these labs you can build and test integrations to support features such as Instant Messaging/ presence, voicemail, and conferencing services into your application or using e.g. the Jabber Web SDK.&nbsp; Compatibility Testing&nbsp;-&nbsp;The DevNet Sandbox IVT program allows users to complete Interoperability Verification Tests (IVT) in our labs with your engineer as an option to using an authorized Cisco IVT partner services lab.

			<p><em>19 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I was playing around with the free and the now paid layers of Stoplight.io, and wrote a previous piece about their lack of a public pricing page, and I noticed they provided an anonymous&nbsp;layer to their API modeling service--without logging in, you can play around with their HTTP client tool, and make requests to an API.
The anonymous version is super limited compared to their full solution, but I think the presence of an&nbsp;anonymous edition opens up an interesting discussion. It appears Stoplight.io has done a lot of work lately to separate the layers of v2 of their service, and provide a public, free, as well as paid, and enterprise editions of their API modeling solution.
With the shrinkage of freemium these days in the API space and the tightening down on free trials, an anonymous layer is compelling. It isn't something that would work for all API service providers, but it is at least something to consider as you are working to define the layers like Stoplight.io has been doing.

			<p><em>19 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I received an email from Stoplight.io about their version updates, which included the phasing out of the free beta period--makes sense. I clicked on the "you can view pricing, and setup billing, on your account billing page" in the email, and was taken to the register page.&nbsp; To clarify a little bit, I have an account with Stoplight.io, which I registered using my @kinlane Github account. I'm logged in as my @apievangelist Github account presently as I'm doing some work with multiple repos, and I really didn't want to log out of @apievangelist and log in with my @kinlane just to see the pricing. So I head directly to the public website of Stoplight.io to look for pricing--which I can't find within 30 seconds (standard approach). When this happens I will then Google for the [API name] + "pricing"--nothing. Ultimately I did log with my @kinlane Github so that I can see the pricing because I genuinely want to keep my account, as Stoplight.io made it into the highly useful tool category for my world. I just wanted to articulate the friction I experienced, so Stoplight.io can consider, but also so that the rest of you can consider. My preference is that you always make your pricing page public. I understand that this is difficult for startups that are just getting going, are in beta phase, etc., but I feel like in 2016 it should be the default practice for API providers, as well as service providers. Even if your service is in beta, and you aren't charging for it yet, you should have a dedicated page to explaining this, and keep it updated as you evolve. Please do not make me log in just to review your service, understand what it does, and find your&nbsp;pricing. This is bad for helping analysts like me understand what you are up to (no I don't want a briefing), and is bad for your customers who are trying...[<a href="/2016/08/19/i-know-it-is-hard-when-you-are-just-getting-started-but-please-make-your-pricing-page-public/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I've been an&nbsp;advocating for API providers to embrace integration platform as a service provider&nbsp;(iPaaS) for three years now, encouraging them to&nbsp;make sure their API is accessible via popular platforms like Zapier. While I don't push these as a required building blocks for all providers, they definitely are what I'd consider as the common building block across many of the successful APIs I keep an eye on.
Making sure your API is available on iPaaS platforms, and you are showcasing these opportunities is becoming more and more important. Another positive move you can make when it comes to&nbsp;iPaaS,&nbsp;is to tweet out what is possible on a regular basis like&nbsp;#mce_temp_url#the transactional and marketing email API provider Mailjet does--here are a couple examples of this in the wild:

Connect @Mailjet + @send_with_us to leverage email marketing with awesome deliverability
Sync @Mailjet + @Fullcontact to auto add contacts from business cards to email lists&nbsp;
Sync @Mailjet + @GravityForms to automatically create contacts from new form entries
Sync @Mailjet + @Evernote to save new subscribers to a new note automatically

I may add this type of activity to my list of common API evangelism building blocks. It is something that I think compliments the fact that you have iPaaS integration solutions, and you are showcasing them within your API portal. It just makes sense that you should also be regularly tweeting out these opportunities, and making it known to your followers, and hopefully your API consumers.
Tweeting out the iPaaS opportunities available for an API is a great to reach beyond just the developer API consumer, and potentially reach the actual business consumer, who is probably going to have a real world problem that they hopefully will be able solve using your API--opening up a whole other dimension to how your API can be put to work.

			<p>
It always bums me out that the cool kid startup APIs always get the lion share of the attention when it comes to APIs in the tech news. Which I guess makes it my responsibility to show the ACTUAL cool kid APIs, like the&nbsp;Chronicling America API from The Library of Congress, which provides access to information about historic newspapers and select digitized newspaper pages.
The Library of Congress provides APIs for&nbsp;searching&nbsp;the newspaper directory and digitized page contents using OpenSearch,&nbsp;auto suggesting&nbsp;of newspaper titles, links&nbsp;using a stable URL pattern, and&nbsp;JSON&nbsp;views of all newspaper resources. They also provide&nbsp;linked data&nbsp;allowing you to&nbsp;process and analyze newspaper information with "conceptual precision" (oooooh I like that), as well as&nbsp;bulk data&nbsp;for your deeper research needs.
I wish that ALL newspapers had APIs like the New York Times and The Guardian do, and information was available to the public by default, and that everything was automatically synced to any archive or collection that was interested in it, like the Libary of Congress. I know that newspapers are having a hard time in the digital age, and I can't help but feel that APIs would help them evolve, and shift until they find their voice in the digital age.

			<p>
As I was writing up a story on Mailjet tweeting out the iPaaS opportunities around their&nbsp;email API, I noticed their Twitter bio. It is subtle, but having spent a great deal of time looking for the support channels for an API, this is a potentially huge time saver. It is what I do best, discovering these simple, subtle things that the successful API providers are doing.
I always encourage API providers to use Twitter as a support channel&nbsp;because it doesn't just provide support, it also is a public demonstration that you give a shit about your API consumers, and will actively work to help them solve their problems. I've seen APIs who offer no support, or a minimal number of support channels, while also seemingly&nbsp;working very hard to hide them--leaving you feeling like you will never get help when you need it.
Mailjet provides links to their status page, as well as a link where you can submit a trouble ticket in their Twitter bio. I would consider their Twitter bio pretty well crafted with the first half explaining what they do(for new users), and the second half providing information on how to get support(for existing users). It is a subtle, positive thing that all API providers should consider doing--thanks for the lead Mailjet.

			<p><em>18 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
In September of 2015, I asked when are we going to get a save as JSON in our spreadsheets? I was doing a lot of work saving spreadsheets as CSV files, something I can easily do programmatically, but I was doing it manually as part of a workshop. After I downloaded each CSV file, I then converted to a JSON file--leaving me asking, "where is the save as JSON"?
As I've been reviewing new Microsoft's Excel API, I got to thinking about the need for a save as JSON option, and now I think that this line of thought was not forward thinking enough. A "save as" just does not speak to the future of machine readable spreadsheet interactions in an online world. Save as CSV, TSV, are very desktop oriented visions of using Excel, and in 2016 we need more.
The&nbsp;Microsoft's Excel API&nbsp;plus OAuth&nbsp;opens up an endless number of opportunities for working with data available in spreadsheets. Microsoft will have to open up the navigation in the online version of Microsoft Excel to the API developer community, allowing for users to subscribe to 3rd party API driven&nbsp;solutions like, save as JSON, open in Github as CSV, visualize with D3.js, and anything else that developers dream up via the Microsoft Excel API.
Maybe this is already possible in the Microsoft Excel online navigation, regardless, there will also be opportunities for extending these options via browser add-ons, as well as integration directly within 3rd party solutions, that use OAuth and the Microsoft Excel API to access valuable data that is locked up in spreadsheets. I enjoy that APIs are constantly pushing me to re-evaluate my legacy ways of thinking, and help me look more towards the future.

			<p><em>18 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I work as hard as I can to understand every sector being opened up using web APIs, and the network level is one that I need to push my awareness&nbsp;of, partially because I find it interesting, but mostly because of the impact it can have on every other aspect of how the Internet works (or doesn't).
To get started I went over to Cisco Devnet, and took a look at their pxGrid solution, which is a "multivendor, cross-platform network system that pulls together different parts of an IT infrastructure such as security monitoring and detection systems, network policy platforms, asset and configuration management, identity and access management platforms", which provides "you with an API that will open up a unified framework that will enable you to integrate to pxGrid once, then share context with any other platform that supports pxGrid".&nbsp;
I'd categorize pxGrid as&nbsp;network&nbsp;API aggregator in my world, providing a single, seamless API to access resources at the network level. Of course, all the network endpoints have to speak pxGrid, but the platform provides me with an introductory blueprint for how web APIs are being applied to network resources, for device configuration and management, as well as identity and security services. I'm not a network professional, but I do know that Cisco devices are pretty ubiquitous, and with the company historically having over 50% market share, I'm betting it is a&nbsp;good place to kick off my learning.

			<p><em>18 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>Early on in 2013, I started a research project to keep an eye on a specific type of API driven service provider, like IFTTT and Zapier, who were enabling individuals and businesses to move data around in the cloud. This new wave of startups was moving from what we traditionally called ETL in the enterprise, which was about extracting, transforming, and loading data between various systems, into the cloud era.&nbsp; I'm an old enterprise database guy, and ETL has been an essential tool in my toolbox for quite some time--according to Wikipedia ETL is: Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) refers to a process in database usage and especially in data warehousing that performs: Data extraction &ndash; extracts data from homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources. The IT teams that I have historically been a part of have employed ETL to make sure data was where it was needed within the enterprise. As IT began its evolution to the web, the need to migrate data between systems outside the firewall increased. We were increasingly extracting, transforming, and loading data via FTP, web services, and web APIs outside the firewall, and even migrating data between systems that exclusively existed in the cloud. Increasingly the data we were migrating was using web APIs&nbsp;and began employing a more granular approach to how authentication occurred for each "extract and load"--oAuth. With the growth of shadow IT, and the adoption of software as a service (SaaS) solutions, individuals, and businesses were needing to move documents, media, and other vital data or content between the cloud services which we were increasingly depending on. APIs were enabling savvy tech users to migrate and sync their data between systems, and startups like IFTTT and Zapier saw the opportunity and jumped in with their new offerings. I do not talk about IFTTT, as they choose to not pay all of this forward by offering an API, and also opt to ignore the transparency that APIs bring...[<a href="/2016/08/18/continuing-my-struggle-for-reciprocity-as-etl-evolves-into-the-cloud-as-ipaas/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Aug 2016</em></p>

I have been finding quite a few nuggets of wisdom out of the&nbsp;recent release of the Microsoft Excel API. This is what I enjoy doing as the API Evangelist, evaluate and gather any positive or negative activities performed by the leading API players, craft blog posts in hopes that other API providers will read, enabling them be more successful in their own API operations.
As part of my monitoring, I am also looking for significant trends that may reflect other wider industry opportunities, beyond any individual API. I am always telling API providers to think about integrating iPaaS solutions like Zapier into their operations as early as possible, and I think Microsoft's acknowledgment in their release emphasizes the importance of iPaaS.
Here is the language, directly out of Microsoft's release post:
Zapier lets users easily automate tedious tasks. Zapier recently announced a new&nbsp;Excel integration, powered by Excel REST API, with near-infinite use cases, like simplifying a data collection process. Users can now build zaps where data is automatically added into Excel from other services, like emails and surveys, making Excel the data repository for all your connected services.
I am guessing that Microsoft Excel API team did their homework, and saw the number of Google Sheet integrations available on Zapier. When it comes to integration platform as a service, being able to take data, content, and other resources and put it into a spreadsheet, has to be in the top 10 of use case scenarios. Moving the bits and bytes we are creating on the web daily, and making available via the familiar spreadsheet UI, is increasingly how business gets done on the ground at the average organization.
I guess there are two nuggets here for my API provider audience: 1) iPaaS, and specifically Zapier integration is growing important 2) Making sure your API is available as Zapier integration with Excel and Google spreadsheets might be something else you will want to consider too!

			<p><em>17 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I am pretty impressed with the casual release of the Microsoft Excel API, which I think is a pretty significant milestone for the world of APIs. One of the subtle elements of their API release that I think is worth noting, is the support flow they provide. Here is the actual text from the release blog post for the Excel API:
"Give us your feedback on the API and documentation through&nbsp;GitHub&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stack Overflow, or make new feature suggestions on&nbsp;UserVoice."
This is the most open, and casual I think I've seen Microsoft ever be. They are allowing the community to suggest edits to their API documentation using Github, encouraging the conversation on their own forum, as well as outside their ecosystem, on Stack Overflow.&nbsp;
I don't know. Maybe I'm reading too much into it. They just seem like they are getting better with each API they have released, and the Excel API release was much more casual, natural, and less rigid than I'm used to from Microsoft.
I can't speak to the technical design of each endpoint yet, as I haven't played with enough, but the overall experience of the Microsoft Office Dev Center is surprisingly modern, simple, and intuitive. There are still a lot of places where it feels like a knowledgebase&nbsp;and not an API community, but overall it exceeds what I'm used to from Microsoft when it comes to APIs.
I have to admit, I didn't hold out much hope for Microsoft when it came to catching up on cloud and APIs--something that is changing with each API they release.

			<p><em>16 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I regularly come across organizations who have blogs without RSS feeds. Sometimes I will drop people a line and ask if they have one, or let them know it would be very useful to have an RSS feed easy to find. This is also a topic I write about regularly to help remind folks that RSS is&nbsp;not dead.&nbsp; Almost every time I write about the topic I get a handful of people who tell me you don't need RSS anymore, you just tweet out your blog posts--nobody uses RSS readers after Google Reader went away. While it might be true that some folks have abandoned their feed readers, I think they were casual readers in the first place, and serious analysts still very much depend on RSS. I wish I could help folks understand the power they are giving away to Twitter by thinking like this. I am happy to share a piece of my digital self with Twitter, but as with all platforms I use, I will be considering at every turn the benefit or damage to my own brand. RSS from your blog, at your domain, strengthens your brand and puts you in control of the syndication. You can still use services like Zapier to take each new RSS entry and automatically Tweet out--you don't have to relinquish control of distribution to Twitter. This is the dangers of these platforms, every platform wants you to spend as much time generating content and media on their platform. This is how they make money, off your activity and hard work--please don't give it up for free, or at the cost of your own brand. If you are a professional, and expect to make a living from your business, products, services, and brand--you need to maximize the control, licensing, and distribution of your content--give up only what you need. There is no reason to make a deal with Twitter that exclusively gives them full control over...[<a href="/2016/08/16/not-having-rss-for-your-blog-and-just-relying-on-tweeting/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I've heard of numerous API providers shutting down their API programs after a couple months because they didn't see the number of new users, and integrations they had hoped for. It is so easy for us technologists to shoot for the moon, while also simultaneously shooting ourselves in the foot&nbsp;when it comes to defining where the bar should be for our operations.&nbsp;
Remember, we are not all Twilio. For most of us our API will never be our primary product, and operating it will be less than a glorious affair--meaning you will never be written up in Techcrunch ;-). We are entering into the really mundane, business as usual phase of the API industry, and things will not be as exciting or sexy as they have been, and we need to make sure our APIs stay real, and reliable amidst all of the tech delusions we have on a regular basis.&nbsp;
Even if your API is not the next amazing tech sensation, it doesn't mean you can't operate following the lead of the giants like Twilio, Amazon, and Google. You can run a first class shop, even if you don't make the front page of Reddit for the launch, and get all the hacker kids building amazingly cool stuff in the first weeks. To do this you need to set some realistic goals for operations, that aren't based on the often fantasy world of Silicon Valley.
It is likely your company's website wasn't a major hit when it first launched either, and you didn't ditch it because it was underperforming. I'm guessing your goals were probably a little more realistic, and in alignment with your primary business objectives. Your API is no different than your web efforts, it will take time to do it properly, and probably require a few adjustments along the way--do not give up before you have a chance to find success.

			<p><em>16 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>At any point in time, there are numerous emails in my inbox, LinkedIn messages, and DMS, asking me if I would "just jump on the phone to discuss the latest" about an API. I get a regular stream of these, which makes it pretty impossible for me to actually make time to do, and if I did make time to talk to each of these API providers, I wouldn't have time to actually write up stories and guides for my site. I'm sure it can be frustrating for folks who just want to share the latest with me, but I hope you will understand that I am just a one man show, and I have to prioritize. I recommend that you also get better at managing your time, and write up each of the things you wanted to talk to me about as a blog post, and then share out via your API platform's Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook (you have all those right?).&nbsp; I am not a fan of being the recipient of embargoed or top-secret information, as EVERYTHING I do tends to be very public. If you publish your&nbsp;information&nbsp;as a blog post, it is much more likely that I will see it, and read it, than I will if it is an email. Plus you get the bonus of me being able to share out the link, and the wider API community getting to learn about it as well. It is just way more efficient for you to tell your story publicly&nbsp;than it is for us to jump on the phone--for both of us. Handling yourself this way will continue to pay dividends, as the chances, I will write about something in the future increases if I have the link bookmarked--something that will rarely happen if we talk about on the phone. This played out in my story on the role API definitions are playing with API integrations, where I linked to&nbsp;Clearbit,&nbsp;Cronofy,&nbsp;Best Buy, and&nbsp;SparkPost&nbsp;stories...[<a href="/2016/08/16/instead-of-just-discussing-via-phone-you-should-publish-your-api-goings-on-to-your-blog/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I was learning more about the Programmable Automation Controller (PAC) API from Opto 22 and fouind myself intrigued by their usage of the word strategy to describe the role a web API can play when it comes to making the industrial automation process more programmable. I'd say the over API design is still very rough and represents the engineer's view of a PAC, but the potential for industrial IoT strategy orchestration is still present.
I'm learning about PAC APIs through the lens of my drone API research, where the role an API can play in the devices strategy creation, as well as execution. Meaning, with a drone, I can use the API to get at the data from one or many drone flights, as well as use the data, then the API again, to help me execute on the strategy. When this line of thought is applied in an industrial setting, the potential for an API driven strategy increases pretty dramatically.
A PAC API takes this strategy concept further down the road for me than it did with the drone alone. Each PAC can have its own DNS, and its own API, and the overall&nbsp;industrial process I am building a strategy for might contain many different PACS--allowing me to orchestrate in&nbsp;an unlimited number of industrial scenarios. I guess the API surface area for a PAC-enabled industrial workflow expands, contracts, and communicates very differently than it has for a single drone or even a drone fleet. I will have to take what I've learned from PACs and apply to drones.
This is the part of my API Evangelist existence I enjoy the most--the cross-pollination between the different sectors I am learning about.

			<p><em>16 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>As the debate over whether you need an SDK for your API or not&nbsp;has rumbled over the last couple of years, API specification formats like OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and API Blueprint have been gaining traction. As this has progressed, I've asked myself several times whether or not API providers even need SDKs anymore. Not just because of the complexities of developing and maintaining, but because more developers are using web clients like Postman and DHC to evolve their integrations. Apigee Explorer and Swagger UI documentation demonstrated that many developers needed to play with an API as they were learning about what resources were available, and how to use them. I think the evolution of API clients like Postman, DHC, PAW, and others have shown that this phase of playing, exploration, and non-code integration can go well beyond just integration&nbsp;and should actually be neverending across stops along the API life cycle. It is just anecdotal at the moment, but looking at the API providers who have embedded the Get Postman Button on their sites like Clearbit, Cronofy, Best Buy, and SparkPost, it seems to me that having your API definition available for your developers is growing more important than having SDKs. Developers are getting more traction by loading the Postman Collection, and other common specification format into their client, testing, and other tooling, than they are cracking open the language library of their choice. This is something I'll further validate through my research. One critique I have on this, is I'm seeing the benefits of this approach focus around Postman, which I'm a big fan of, and a user, but represents just a handful of stops along the API life cycle (client, testing), and not the wider spectrum that OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint would offer. I have yet to see any of these formats follow my advice like Postman did&nbsp;and get to work on an embeddable solution for OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint--giving Postman a...[<a href="/2016/08/16/api-definitions-are-slowly-becoming-more-important-than-having-sdks/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
When you hear about the Internet of Things (IoT) you often hear about the hopeful consumer side of thing, like with Nest thermostat, and the next wave of Internet-connected devices that will change our personal worlds forever. Personally, when I think about the concept of Internet-connected devices actually seeing adoption, and getting traction, I think of it being applied in an industrial setting.&nbsp;
The RESTful&nbsp;programmable automation controllers (PACs) APIs out of Opto 22 resemble this vision of IoT which I have in my head. APIs making everyday objects used in a variety of industrial processes, programmable, and accessible over wired or wireless networks. Making everything from manufacturing&nbsp;to water and energy facilities more automated and efficient, while potentially generated data that can be used to monitor, and optimize these industrial workflows--this is IoT.
The dream of home automation just doesn't do it for me. I just don't buy the Jetsons vision of the home, but I can buy into the potential for IoT making the industrial processes which we depend on to make our world operate more efficient. Consumer IoT seems like a bandwagon to me, but proven industrial equipment manufacturers like Opto 22 realizing the potential of web API infrastructure, and baking it into the devices they manufacture, seems like real world IoT business to me.

			<p><em>15 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I'm a big fan of the concept of serverless APIs and microservices, but not so much of the name. I get it, the space needs new concepts to rally around, and I'm the first to admit even the concept of an API is bullshit, but when people say serverless, it always makes me chuckle--especially when people work so hard to sell it (who am I to make fun of that).
Often when I come across a serverless solution, it is often bundled with the phrase "100% serverless", a description which usually then contains the 2-6 vendor solutions used to deploy said serverless solution. I know there is no use in pointing out there are always servers behind serverless solutions, but can I at least point out the vendor dependencies involved? Are the vendor dependencies better or worse than our dependencies on servers (that never went away)? IDK. WTF. BBQ.
In support&nbsp;of this&nbsp;line of thinking, I want to start promoting the concept of vendorless&nbsp;APIs and microservices. You know the ones that employ web, and open source technology? Then I can label my microservices as vendorless,&nbsp;made from the finest gluten free, organic HTTP, free-range web concepts available today!

			<p><em>15 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
Being able to provide different levels of access for a single API has been one of the telltale characteristics of any modern web API. Savvy API providers know they don't just make their valuable API resources publicly available for anyone to use, they know you can craft a logical set of plans that are in alignment with your wider business objectives, outlining how any developer can put an API to use--this is the essential&nbsp;business of APIs.
Mashery was the first API management provider to standardize this approach to API access, something further evolved by 3Scale, Apigee, and others. Amazon's release of their API gateway wove API management into the fabric of what we call the cloud, and the introduction of usage plans, does the same for API service composition. Making the identification, metering, limiting, and monetization of resources made available via APIs, a default function of operations in the cloud.
Being able to take any digital asset, whether it is data, content, or an algorithmic resource, and make available via a URL, and control who has access, while also metering their usage, and charging different rates for this usage, is where the business of APIs rubber meets the road. API service composition lets you dial in exactly the right levels of access, and usage, required to fulfill a business contract, delivering precisely the service that customers are wanting for their&nbsp;web, mobile, and device apps.
It's taken a decade for this key element of doing business on the web to mature beyond just a handful of vendors, then into an assortment of open source solutions, and now something that is just baked into what we know as the cloud--allowing us to plan API access consistently and universally across all the digital resources we are increasingly storing and operating in the cloud.

			<p>
I was going through the getting started pages for the APIs that I keep an eye on, pulling together an outline of what I'd consider to be some of the best elements across all the API providers. Then I came across the getting started page from Constant Contact, and I'd say they win for being the clearest and concise API getting started page of them all.&nbsp;
Constant Contact's approach to their getting started page has given me a good start for my outline, including essential links to setup your account, create a new application and get your keys. Constant Contact also provides required documentation, an API tester, and supporting code libraries. Additionally, they encourage you to certify your integration as a partner and get published in their integration marketplace--providing a pretty well thought out getting started page in my opinion.
I am going to take what I've learned here, and craft a sample getting started page for my minimum viable API portal definition. I'm sure some of you are snickering at me paying attention to API operations at this level of detail, but I wouldn't underestimate the ability of a well crafted API getting started page to reduce friction with developers. I want to give API providers with a simple template they can follow when publishing a getting started page.
With the next release of my API portal, I'll have a good example of a getting started page, which will be heavily influenced by Constant Contact.

			<p><em>10 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I am all about marking down the important milestones that help define the API sector. It is what I've been working to define as my history of the web APIs&nbsp;for the last six years. An API has to make its mark in pretty big way before I'll add as an official milestone in my version of the last 17 years of the web APIs.&nbsp;
I'll give it some time, but I'm thinking the recently released Excel API from Microsoft is going to get added pretty quickly. I think the next five years of API evolution is going to be much less exciting than the previous five years, with numerous small businesses publishing their valuable data, content, and complex algorithms via the Excel API.
This stage of API deployment won't be filled with API heroes like Amazon, and Twilio, but will still make a seismic shift in the landscape just through the pure volume of data that is made available--we won't be able to keep up. I don't think all the DB to API connectors collectively add up to the number of spreadsheet-driven data, content, algorithmic, and visualizations that will be driving business decisions out there in the future.
I am not a diehard fan of the spreadsheet, as I'm a database guy, but in my 25+ year career, there is no single more important business tool out there than the spreadsheet. Giving Excel native API capabilities by default will dramatically increase the number of high-value APIs available. It will be something that I cannot ignore, and will have to do some playing around with the API, to see what is possible.

			<p><em>10 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
The messaging platform&nbsp;Slack made waves when they launched their Slack Fund as part of their API release, putting up $80M to invest in developers who were interested in building cool things on the API. Slack has continued telling their story, talking about how they have invested some of the fund and are being pretty transparent about which API integrations made the cut.&nbsp;
After reading about the Slack Fund I wanted to see which other APIs were investing in their communities like this. Next, I came across the Alexa Fund where Amazon is investing in developers building voice-enabled apps, giving their Echo platform the boost of applications it will need to find success. After poking around the AWS platform, you also find they have also had their AWS Grants program, investing in the best of breed projects that use the AWS platform to give back to the world.
I came across a number of other fund announcements about available funds, only to find the pages gone, but MailChimp had an interesting accounting of their fund which they started in November of 2010, pledging $1M to "provide developers with funding assistance to build integrations on our email platform". I also found another fund developer fund out of Cisco, to encourage development with&nbsp;Cisco Spark&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tropo, and the other APIs they provide at&nbsp;Cisco DevNet, that was noteworthy.
There are not enough examples of API investment funds out there for me to add the concepts as what I'd consider being a common API building block, but there are enough out there, especially from leading pioneers, to keep me paying attention. API developer funds don't seem like something you have to go as big as AWS or Slack did, but it seems to me, if you provide a small fund like MailChimp did, it could incentivize development significantly--at least make your launch be fewer crickets.

I am always looking for simple advice I can give to API providers to make their developers and would-be developers integration as friction-less as possible. When it comes to making the code available for your API I recommend providing a wealth of samples, libraries, and full blown SDKs for your developers. Also make sure these code resources are as easy to find within your developer portal, as well as being openly licensed and available on your API platform's Github profile.
Adding to this advice I would also recommend that you take the top 10 programming languages and platforms out there, and perform a quick Google search for the key phrase, and see what comes up, on a regular basis. I tend to find interesting conversations around an API when I do this. Inversely it can also provide some interesting signals that an API isn't very active within specific communities, and there probably isn't much existing support.
For me, searching for API [name] + [programming language] or [platform name] = some interesting reflections of activity around an API. I can also imagine that this would provide a way for API providers to learn where the gaps in their outreach are, and give them another way to reach their developers or potential developers--demonstrating that SEO plays a significant&nbsp;role in successful API operations.

			<p><em>09 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I am still learning about the recent API release out of Apple, and working to keep up with the volume of resources coming out of the Amazon Alexa ecosystem, but one thing I know for sure is Amazon is way ahead of the game, and Apple will have to invest a lot more resources if they expect to catch up. Apple may have the device advantage, but Amazon is leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to how you develop a community in support of voice-driven applications.
I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's release was in response to the waves Amazon is making with their voice platform. When it comes to the platform battles between tech giants, they can throw the necessary resources at things to play catch up, but it is something that other smaller players will not be able to always navigate. I'm reviewing a number of device-focused API efforts lately, and the ones who launched with an API are always ahead in the game.
Learning to do APIs well takes time, and learning to grow your API community of developers and partners will always take time to do properly--you just can't throw resources at it to make things scale properly. You might as well kick things off with an API and platform approach, even if it is in beta, and limited--at least you are getting going in a limited environment. Siri has been out there for a while now, but not as a platform, and I'm going to wager this will be a significant handicap.
What is your approach to technology? Is it more like Siri, or is it more like Alexa?

			<p><em>09 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was reading a post from the Electronic Frontier Foundation asking some great questions about having a safety protocol for things like the DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge. It is good to see EFF leading this conversation, providing us with some important things to consider as part of any security related work, whether it's in the cyber theater&nbsp;or just guiding your ethics as a small business, analyst or freelance hacker (I happen to be all three).&nbsp; To hopefully contribute somewhat to the conversation, I wanted to think through some of the questions I ask when defining and helping folks secure their slice of the API landscape. There are two distinct portions of the conversation I wanted to chime in on, speaking to the areas that I find the most friction with when mapping out, and securing infrastructure. The Dangers Of Being An API Cartographer In The Shadows Behind Mobile And Internet of ThingsOnly a small fraction of web APIs available today are intentionally open to the public. The majority of web APIs out there are developed to support web, mobile, or device-based apps, delivering resources on the open Internet, but not meant to be viewed, accessed, and documented by 3rd parties. API developers and architects heavily focused on the end deliverable, the web, mobile, system, or device integration, they do not consider the API to be open to the public--thus perceived as a private API, even though it uses public infrastructure. Many people frown on even mapping out this shadow API world, let along making and API definition or documentation publicly available.&nbsp; If I can publicly get access to a website, application, or device, I can map out the APIs, simply by routing traffic on my computer through a proxy. Before we can ensure this portion of our public infrastructure is secure, we must map it out, and we must change popular opinion to view this infrastructure as public, and begin securing it like it is,...[<a href="/2016/08/09/where-is-the-ethical-line-when-defining-and-securing-the-api-landscape/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
According to Wikipedia, in mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform a calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. These often very abstract inventions are increasingly guiding our personal and professional worlds from deciding what we read on Facebook, scanning the videos uploaded to your Twitter and Vine feed, to whether or not you might commit a crime again, and even predict potential police misconduct.
I see the concept of an algorithm applied in many different ways, some are very simple and easy to understand, and some are not so easy to understand, and operate as black boxes. One of the reasons I like APIs so much is the possibility of introducing some transparency into how algorithms work (or don't). APIs do not give visibility into the inner workings of algorithms by default, but when they are done right they can significantly contribute to a&nbsp;wider understanding of how they work.&nbsp;
As with other areas of the API space that I research, I'm intrigued with algorithms, how they are being used, and the role APIs can play in the wider conversation. I added an APIs and algorithms research project, to help be understand how algorithms are being wielded, the news, companies, and code and schemas which are framing the conversation. The information I aggregate here will fuel my overall perspective of the intersection of API and algorithms, and maybe yours too.

When I talk about how much I believe in APIs, all I am really saying is how much I believe in the web. The web is how humans are consuming and sharing data, content, and algorithms with each other using the Internet, and APIs are how systems, applications, and devices are doing this via the Internet.
I do not advocate for any single API, company, tooling, or technology. I am evangelizing for an open web. This is why I am always a little ashamed at how incomplete my understanding is of the core concepts that make up the web&nbsp;and the specifications that are driving it. Thankfully there are people like&nbsp;Erik Wilde (@dret) who work tirelessly to help us understand them, and make available in a simple way&nbsp;like he did with his Web Concepts project.
Erik has organized&nbsp;13 Web Concepts for use to learn about, detailing&nbsp;445 distinct specifications across the&nbsp;International Organization for Standardization (ISO),&nbsp;Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),&nbsp;Java Community Process (JCP)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are a number of these specifications I'm already aware of, but there are numerous others I am not, and that just isn't right.&nbsp;
To help me increase my awareness and hopefully yours as well, I'm going to regularly tweet out individual concepts, and their specifications, linking to Erik's work. I encourage you to bookmark his work and get to work improving your web literacy where possible, and consider forking his work and sharing within your organization as well. It is important that we are all aware of these core building blocks of the web, and are reusing existing concepts and specifications across our work, wherever possible.

			<p>
I wrote a story last week about how Airmap is positioning itself to be an API broker within the fast growing Drone industry. I also stumbled across the satellite imagery API out of Astro Digital, and specifically their&nbsp;3rd Party Real-Time Data API&nbsp;which is designed "to combine mass amounts of data, like adding live weather data on top of imagery"--resembling the layer of the drone industry which Airmap is investing in.
Airmap&nbsp;is delivering geo-intelligence for applications used when flying drones, Astro Digital has an API which injects geo-intelligence at the satellite image layer--I guess the satellite layer would be one layer up from the drone layer when it comes to APIs providing access to our physical world. Which leaves me considering all the other potential layers of our physical world being opened up using APIs.
Security cameras, sensors, and other Internet-connected devices are rapidly opening up our physical world using APIs. The API solutions being opened up by Airmap and Astro Digital are allowing us to access, inject, remix, and make decisions in real time. I find this intriguing because there are so many dimensions present beyond just a single resource being made available via an API, and allows for true multi-API integration, while also employing APIs to direct physical activity like drone flights.
Beyond the myriad of API implementations that are available within this new landscape, I feel it is also is something that demonstrates the opportunity surrounding weather data, government open data (FAA situation data), and other relevant data, content, media, and algorithms being opened up today. I find it endlessly fascinating to try and&nbsp;keep up with the different ways that API-driven resources are being used to open up and generate revenue, taking advantage of opportunities that are emerging as this new API landscape expands both digitally and physically.

			<p>In 2006 Amazon introduced me to the idea that you could deploy global infrastructure using web APIs. This was when web APIs went from the hobby level (ie. photos, social, links) workbench, and became a tool I could actually use in my business toolbox. Web APIs weren't just used or fun and games anymore, opening up my eyes to the endless possibilities when you make the web programmable using APIs.&nbsp;
In 2016, I see a number of APIs show up on my monitoring radar, and honestly, most of them are not that notable--then you come across the solutions like the dead simple satellite imagery API from Astro Digital. I'm increasingly finding myself tracking on the collision APIs are having with our physical world, so I see a lot of interesting (and some not so) APIs, but I find the notion that you can get the latest picture of a specific place on earth is a pretty significant milestone for web APIs.
For me the Astro Digital satellite imagery API demonstrates for me the power of the&nbsp;Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)--I can get a snapshot of any location on earth, and manipulate my view of it using a single URI, from within any web or mobile application. This is just one of many APIs available to the average developer today, providing access to a wealth of high-value resources, that used to only be accessible to larger companies who could afford it.
I just wanted to pause for a moment, and take notice of some of the important resources that are being made available via APIs today, because I feel like the landscape is shifting pretty quickly with the introduction of these valuable resources. When companies small companies can work with the same resources as large enterprises and institutions, interesting things are possible.

			<p><em>05 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have done a lot of reading in the last week, catching up on my monitoring of the API space. I have read a couple of posts about the reliability of APIs, and the overall viability of building applications, and businesses based upon them. A couple of the posts were focusing on the shuttering of ThinkUp, but a couple others were just part of the regular flow of these stories that question whether we can depend on APIs or not--nothing new, as this is a regular staple of bloggers and the wider tech blogosphere. My official stance on this line of thinking is that I would not want to be building a business, and application that depends on leading API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others, but I will happily build a business, applications, and system integration on APIs. You see, this isn't an API issue, it is a business and vendor viability issue. As with other sectors, there are badly behaved business, and there are well-behaved businesses--I try to choose to do business with the well-behaved one's (can't always achieve this, but I try). I find the ongoing desire of the startup culture to point out how unreliable APIs are, while simultaneously&nbsp;supporting the overall business tone set by venture capital investment, often delusionally blind levels of support, is just not reconcilable. I'm not saying all VC investment is bad, so don't even take this down that road. I am saying that the quest for VC investment, and the shift in priorities once VC investment is acquired, then further shift with each additional round, and the final exit is setting a tone that is completely at odds with API reliability.&nbsp; The problem really begins when APIs become the front-end for this blame. If I depend on vendors for my brick and mortar store, and the delivery trucks don't reliably bring my products, I don't talk about how you can't depend on trucks--I find new...[<a href="/2016/08/05/reconciling-how-reliable-apis-are-while-also-embracing-tone-set-by-vc-investment/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I've seen quite a few&nbsp;incomplete&nbsp;API efforts in my time as the API Evangelist. It is why I aggregate the most common building blocks I see across successful API providers like Twilio and organize them into blueprints anyone can follow like my minimum viable API footprint definition. It doesn't take much effort to pull together a basic API presence like this&nbsp;and is something that can go a long ways to help onboard new API consumers.&nbsp;
There are a number of interesting APIs out there like the AirControl API, which gives you programmatic access to enterprise-grade wifi and wireless network solutions from Ubiquiti Networks, but then quickly reduces a pretty robust API effort to being just a PDF document. I still keep an eye on these APIs like this because they offer value, and give a look at how ubiquitous web APIs are becoming. It also demonstrates how much more work I have ahead of me when it comes to educating the coming wave of device API providers.&nbsp;
Another thing this demonstrates for me&nbsp;is that this wave of Internet-connected device APIs will also suffer from many of the same illnesses that API providers have had when deploying APIs for mobile applications. These APIs are often hastily designed and deployed, where documentation, authentication, and security are often an&nbsp;afterthought or not even a thought at all.
I am working on reworking some of my forkable Github templates for deploying API portals. I am going to create a minium viable API portal solution that can be easily&nbsp;forked, helping API providers quickly launch a more coherent presence&nbsp;without much effort. I'm going to also create a complete API portal solution that takes into consideration the complete list of building blocks for an API presence that I've gathered from across the API landscape.

			<p><em>05 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
As the number of available API definitions out there grows, I am increasingly coming across variations of APIs that I already have included in my API Stack. It can be tedious to try and sync these with existing copies, so I wanted to take a look and see if there was anything already available out there, that would help provide a diff for either OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or API Blueprint.
The most common one I found referenced was a Ruby one for OpenAPI Spec from&nbsp;Civis Analytics. Next, I found a pretty interesting web tool, which provides its Node.js source code on Github, including a CLI edition. After these two solutions, I only found one more for RAML, but couldn't find anything for API Blueprint.
I wanted to think beyond just the common API definition formats&nbsp;and look for diff tools that would work just for JSON. I found Diff which was pretty interesting, as well as DiffSync which provided a real-time&nbsp;diff for JSON. I haven't tried any of them out, I am just trying to compile a list of what is out there&nbsp;before I dive into what their capabilities are.
I have a master database of API definitions where I can just import API definitions that I find, and it will add any new paths, parameters, and schemas it comes across. I would much rather have the ability to just run each version through a diff tool, and be able to select which elements I want to have merged. For now, I will just implement a custom layer to my API monitoring system, but I would like to see API diff move forward similar to we saw the conversation evolve with the introduction of&nbsp;API Transformer.

			<p><em>05 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I first came across Airmap as I was learning about them acting as the middle man for DJI drone updates via the Department of Interior. After this story, I added them to my database of companies that I track on. Then as I was monitoring my feeds I saw they were now working with IBM to get weather information for use by drone manufacturers, operators, and those impacted by drone activity.&nbsp;
Airmap&nbsp;positions themselves as "airspace Intelligence", offering low-altitude airspace management solution for unmanned aircraft. When you consider the drone as just one of many devices being connected to the Internet, the role intelligence providers like Airmap will play when it comes to system to system integrations, and web or mobile application development in each space--the company seems to be well-positioned for success in the drone industry.
Airmap is working hard to define the physical space, the constants, as well as some of the most ephemeral layers of our physical world like weather, forest fires, and events that are increasingly impacting our online reality via the web and our mobile phones. Airmap is aggregating valuable data, like the updates they get from the Department of Interior (open data) to the partner data like they will be ingesting like the weather data from IBM.&nbsp;
Airmap provides access to their&nbsp;flight conditions and other airspace data from Airspace via API(s), and has established&nbsp;some pretty significant manufacturer relationships, as well as open and partner data sources--providing the beginnings of a pretty interesting Internet of things business blueprint for what I'd consider to be a sort of API broker. When you consider the influence some of these API brokers have in the&nbsp;governance of airspace around nuclear power plants or even the Olympics, and govern an assortment of&nbsp;Internet-connected devices--the API opportunity appears to be pretty interesting.

			<p><em>04 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was happy to stumble across the Better Business Bureau API the other day. I was working on a piece about "the API economy", and looking for real world examples of how APIs could actually contribute positively (or negatively) to the actual economy, and found the useful API.&nbsp; The Better Business Bureau&nbsp;provides five API endpoints for consumers: Organization Search - This endpoint will allow you to search for Organizations that are known to the BBB. &nbsp;Organizations may include businesses or charities. Organization Collections - BBB Partners will need to be able to identify collections of Organizations that they care about and be able to manage those collections and receive Organization info and updates on them as needed. Bulk Retrieval - This section defines the message specification that will be sent back to the API partners who request a bulk data transfer. &nbsp; Push Notifications - BBB Partners have the need to be notified when BBB data updates occur for the records or a collection of records they are currently subscribed to. BBB Investigation/Application for Accreditation - This endpoint allows submission of organizations for BBB investigation and application for BBB accreditation. They provide&nbsp;a pretty valuable service, which is significantly amplified when there is an API present. Being able to find out which companies are accredited or have complaints against them in real time has endless potential for impacting real world decisions that may influence the economy one way or the other. Being able to automate this process for a digital age, convinced me that this should be in the list of APIs that reflect my thoughts on the wider API economy. I will be including the&nbsp;Better Business Bureau API&nbsp;in my overall API ranking research, which is something I've explored in the past, but will be spending some more time thinking in the&nbsp;context of the API economy. I will also profile the BBB API, to contribute to the design patterns I will be considering when it comes...[<a href="/2016/08/04/thinking-about-the-better-business-bureau-api-in-context-of-the-overall-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was reading some of the blog posts, Reddit&nbsp;and Hacker News threads about Microsoft's release of their API design guide. While many of the comments are technically correct, the tone in which they are delivered, and the intent behind their delivery is one of the biggest contributing factors to why we have such wild inconsistencies in API design across the landscape.&nbsp; API Evangelist was born in 2010 out of frustration with the Restafarian pundit class. I made it my mission to help tell stories of the technical, business, and politics of APIs in an inclusive way, that didn't make people feel stupid for what they didn't understand. Even after six years of doing this, I am still learning things about APIs and being regularly reminded that there are few absolutes when it comes API design, definition, deployment, management, or any of the other 50+ stops along the API life cycle that I track on.&nbsp; I stopped sharing my blog posts to Hacker News, Reddit, and DZone (reversed after they invested in change) because of hostile responses to my thoughts. I cannot imagine what it is like to work hard on your API design strategy at a company, then share publicly, only to get flamed because it wasn't REST compliant. Many folks will never even attempt this for fear of being flamed, and those that do, will often never make the mistake twice.&nbsp; This is the opposite of what we want. We want EVERYONE organizing, publishing, and sharing their API design patterns so that we can all learn from each other. We don't want to make people feel stupid for what they do not know. We want to encourage everyone to learn, grow, evolve, and build on each other's design patterns and work from across the API sector.&nbsp; Let's work to encourage more companies to craft, publish, and share their API design patterns.

			<p>I saw the potential for collaboration when it came to using web APIs back around 2004 and 2005. I was seeing innovative companies opening up their digital assets to the world using low-cost, efficient Internet technology like HTTP, opening things up for potentially interesting approaches to collaboration around the development of web and mobile applications on top of valuable digital resources. This approach has brought us valuable platforms like Amazon Web Services and SalesForce.&nbsp; Common API discussions tend to focus on providing APIs to an ecosystem of developers&nbsp;and encouraging the development of&nbsp;web and mobile applications, widgets, visualizations, and other integrations that benefit the platform. In the course of these operations, it is also customary to gather feedback from the community&nbsp;and work to evolve the APIs design, available resources, and even the underlying data model--extending collaboration to also be about the APIs, and underlying resources, in addition to just building things on top of the API. This approach to designing, defining, and deploying APIs, and then also web and mobile applications on top of these APIs is nothing new, and is something that I have been tracking on for over the last six years. The transparency that can be injected into the evolution of data, content, and potentially the "algorithms behind" with APIs is significant, which is how it became such a big part of my professional mission, and fueling my drive to spread the "gospel" whenever and wherever I can.&nbsp; Ok, so how can APIs contribute to algorithmic transparency? To fully grasp where I am taking this, you need to understand that APIs can be used as an input and output for data, content, as well as algorithms. Let's use Twitter as an example. Using Twitter and the Twitter API I can read and write data about myself, or any user, using the /account and /users API endpoints--providing the content and data portion of what I am talking about.

			<p><em>04 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>I find myself thinking about what the terms of service we agree to for online services are doing to our lives. Whether we see the effects or not, they are guiding almost everything we do in our personal and professional worlds. They are something that began on our desktop computers, migrated to our more mobile laptops, then deeper into our personal lives via our mobile smartphones. We rarely understand what we are agreeing to when we check the box for these terms of service, which leaves me really surprised to see us accept the application of terms of service to everyday objects we depend on, as part of the Internet of Things movement. As physical objects in our lives get connected to the Internet, they begin to generate valuable data, requiring software to manage--all being directed by the terms of service set forth by the manufacturer.&nbsp; You can see this playing out as manufacturers like GM and John Deer are limiting what you can do with their physically connected equipment. These terms of service are changing the meaning of ownership, and evolving te physical things we purchase into subscriptions, instead of outright ownership. Following the tone of the conversation set by terms of service which is guiding software, this new breed of terms of service being applied to physical objects in a way that heavily benefits manufacturers, shifting as much the risk as possible to the consumers, leaving many of the benefits as possible for themselves. In the rapidly expanding online and mobile worlds we (consumers) have almost no tools that help us manage the terms of service we are agreeing to, and almost no leverage when it comes to how these are crafted, changed, and applied. Why the hell would we keep this rapid pace continuing into the physical world, as well as our online worlds? It just doesn't pencil out?

			<p>I had heard about the Zika virus research that was going on at the&nbsp;University of Wisconsin listening to an NPR episode this last spring. I finally had the time to dig into the topic a little more, and learn more about where the research is at, and some of the software behind the sharing and collaboration around the research. The urgency in getting the raw data and results of the research out to the wider scientific community caught my attention and the potential for applying API related approaches seems pretty huge. When it comes to mission-critical&nbsp;research that could impact thousands or millions of people, it seems like there should be a whole suite of open tooling that people can employ to ensure sharing and collaboration are real time and frictionless.&nbsp; As I dug into the Zika virus research, I was happy to find the LabKey technology employed to publish the research. I do not know much about them yet, but I was happy to see the open source community solution, developer resources including a web API for integrating with research that is published using the platform. There are plenty of improvements I'd like to see added to the API and developer efforts, but it is a damn good start when it comes to making important scientific research much more shareable and collaborative.&nbsp; I'll spend more time learning more about what LabKey currently offers, and then I'll work to establish some sort of next steps blueprint that would employ other modern API approaches to help ensure important research can be&nbsp;made more real-time, aggregated, interoperable, and shareable using technology like definitions, Webhooks, iPaaS, and other common areas of a modern API effort.

			<p><em>03 Aug 2016</em></p>

I've been reading a number of stories about concerns within the Department of Interior about the usage of DJI drones as part of their UAV operations. Whether or not the federal agency actually issued a ban on using the drones is another story, regardless I wanted to extract this concept and apply to the wider world of Internet of Things, in which drones are definitely a poster child for.
In our race to connect devices to the Internet, at the consumer and industrial level, what considerations are being made regarding what data is collected, how this information is transmitted (via which networks), and ultimately where is data being stored (which country). Obviously, this is something the federal government is beginning to think about, but I'm guessing hasn't fully formed an approach to dealing with this problem consistently across agencies.&nbsp;
People love to dismiss individual consumer right to know about their data at this level, as nobody cares enough, but at the corporate, institutional, and agency level we better be taking things a little more seriously. If you are uploading your organizational intelligence unknowingly to servers out of the country, or in jurisdictions where it might be easily shared with your competitors or rival factions--you might want to be thinking about switching providers. ;-)
As platform providers how will we be certifying the chain of custody for the Internet-connected devices we are manufacturing, and within the applications and system they employ? As device consumers, how will we ensure that ALL the devices we are employing are in sync with our organizational mission and governance?&nbsp;
So many interesting questions being asked right now, as we race to wire up our physical world to the Internet...

I wish every time you came across facts and statistics in any news story, blog post, report, and beyond, there would be an interactive experience like you get with the US Census Bureau's QuickFacts tool.&nbsp;
QuickFacts provides statistics for all states and counties, and for cities and towns with a population of 5,000 or more, and provides everything I think you need to make the case behind any facts and statistics you are presenting.
Using the tool you get a table, chart, map, data download, email results, and share via popular social networks as well as embeddable tooling. The QuickFacts experience should be a default for all storytelling around open data.&nbsp;
The Census team has clearly worked very hard to make a wealth of very complicated data much more accessible, usable, and easily understood through proven approaches to telling stories using open data.
If you are in the business of publishing open data and APIs&nbsp;and building analytics and visualization tools, follow the lead of the US Census Bureau, and develop easy to use API tooling like the QuickFacts solution.

			<p><em>02 Aug 2016</em></p>
			<p>
API Evangelist is focused on helping push for sensible API-driven transparency wherever I can get it. When done in sensible ways an API can crack open the often black box&nbsp;that is the algorithm,&nbsp;giving us access and more control over our online experience.
One of the most significant algorithmic bottlenecks that govern our daily lives is our mobile data plans. All of our mobile phones are governed at the data plan level--this is where the telecom companies make their money, throttling the bits and bytes we depend on each day.&nbsp;
The mobile data plan is a great place to discuss the algorithmic and data transparency that APIs can assist with, and one example of this in action is with the Google Mobile Data Plan API. Google wants more access at this level to improve the quality of experience for end-users when using mobile applications like Youtube, which can be severely impacted by data plan limits, while also significantly impacting your data plan consumption if not optimized.
There is so much opportunity for discussion between mobile network operator, API providers, developers, consumers at the data plan level. I know mobile network operators would rather keep this a black box, so they can maximize their revenue, but when you crack the network layer open with a publicly available API, there will be a number of new revenue opportunities.
Data plans affect all of us, every single day. We need more transparency into the algorithms that meter, limit, and charge us at the mobile data plan layer. We need the platforms we depend on each day to have more tools to optimize how applications consume (or do not consume) this extremely (seemingly) finite, and valuable resource (thanks, telcos!).&nbsp;
I've added an algorithms area to my research to keep an eye on this topic, curate stories I find, and share my own thoughts when it comes to algorithmic transparency using APIs.

			<p>I have been spending a lot of time this summer thinking about how devices are being connected to the Internet, specifically when it comes to drones. As I was traveling around the countryside flying drones, I increasingly came across stories about drones being a nuisance, and most notably being a big huge problem for firefighting crews.&nbsp; I am flying a DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone, so I was interested to see DJI recently enable real-time geofencing capabilities for drone pilots. If you are unfamiliar with how these drones work, your drone controller is simply an iPad enabled joystick&nbsp;and a mobile application which becomes your control center. Before you can fly the drone the application goes through a whole series of checks making sure all of the drones variety of systems are all in check.&nbsp; These drones are hyper aware of their location, maintaining a very detailed flight and activity log. The new DJI geofencing capabilities will now give you updates on wildfire, military, prison, nuclear power plants and other flight hazards via the DJI GO mobile application. DJI get's its information from airspace intelligence company Airmap, who gets their information from Federal Aviation Administration&nbsp;Temporary Flight Restrictions&nbsp;(TFR)&nbsp;feed--all driving drone pilot(s) decision on whether it's safe to fly or not. "GEO by default limits flights into or take-off within locations that raise safety or security concerns. If a flight within one of these locations has been authorized, GEO allows users with verified DJI accounts to temporarily unlock or self-authorize their flights. This unlock function is not available for sensitive national-security locations", according to the DJI Geo system overview. It is interesting to see how this update can be used as an advisory, or something that prevents the operation of a very geo-aware, and&nbsp;Internet-connected device.&nbsp; This is the part of drone activity I find intriguing. I thoroughly enjoy flying them, but the precedent being set for potentially the future of Internet-connected devices is what I find infinitely more...[<a href="/2016/08/02/direct-government-connection-into-internet-of-things-devices-like-we-are-seeing-with-drones/">Read More</a>]</p>

I am incredibly humbled by the community's response, and honestly, I'm not well equipped to deal with this type of attention. I know there are some folks out there who think I am some sort of attention seeker, but that is the part of all of this that I really struggle with the most. I have to step aside from myself to be able to write. Otherwise, I'm left incapacitated. I am incredibly thankful for the API community. I have had the bar set pretty high for this community throughout the last six years, and you managed to raise it beyond what I had already set in my mind. I kindasorta thought some of you were reading my rants, but it kind of terrifies me now how many of you actually were. Sooooooo....while I received some very fine bids on API Evangelist this week, as well as some pretty creative solutions for keeping alive and generating revenue, I'm going to accept the community's bid for the domain. It will remain the community's API Evangelist voice, as it has 87.34% of the time (I am a sellout, just not very good one) over the last six years -- I will just leave it as is.

			<p><em>23 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>
It has been six years since I started API Evangelist. A personal matter has come up which will require my attention for at least six months, probably upwards of a year. Which in the tech world can be centuries--when you are dealing in real time.&nbsp;
With this in mind, I will be putting the apievangelist.com domain, and @apievangelist Twitter account up for auction. When I come back (if I do), I'm perfectly happy starting over, and I need all the funds I can get to get me through the summer, and API Evangelist is the only asset I own.
I am very sorry for the impact on my business partners, but family and human beings come first, and I'm sure they will be fine. If you want the short and sweet on what I'm doing head over to kinlane.com blog, and if you want to follow the story of what I'm up to this summer you can head over to dronerecovery.org.
The&nbsp;apievangelist.com&nbsp;website does over 50K page views monthly with about 30K uniques. The Twitter account has 5K followers, and growing every day--perfect for any API company. I'm taking bids for all of it to fund what I'm doing the next few months. API Evangelist is worth a lot to me, so I'm starting the bidding at 10K, and accepting the highest bidder by May 27th.&nbsp;
Email your bids to [email&#160;protected] The entire site runs on Jekyll via Github, so I can just transfer domain, and transfer the organization to you via Github. If the site does not sell, I will just leave up, and contemplate its future at a later date.
Thank you for all your support--it was a fun ride.

			<p><em>12 May 2016</em></p>

API management is the oldest area of my research. The area has been being defined since Mashery first opened its doors in 2006&nbsp;and continues to be defined with the recent IPO by Apigee, and the entry of AWS into the sector with the AWS API Gateway. API management is often defined by the services offered by these companies, but also by the strategies of leading API providers in the space.
My API management research walks through the common building blocks of the space, the open source tooling, and API service providers who are serving the space. I first started this guide in 2010 and 2011 and have worked to evolve with each release, as well as the fast pace change that seems to occur in the space.
This guide touches on, and often overlaps with my other areas of research (as everything was born out of this), but should provide you with what you need as a checklist for evolving your existing API management strategy, or help you craft a brand new one for your new API. This guide has a heavy focus on a service provider led approach to API management, but with the growth in open source solutions lately, I'm working to evolve more towards a DIY approach to making it work.
I fund my research through consulting, selling my guides, and the generous support of my sponsors. I appreciate your support in helping me continue with my work and hope you find it relevant in your API journey.

In the last couple of years, I've seen the concept of API design go from being something the API elite discuss, to something that involves business users, and something that has spawned a whole ecosystem of service and tooling providers.&nbsp;
This API design research covers the concepts people often associate with API design, like REST, and Hypermedia, but also touches on other media types, API definitions, and many of the services, tooling and other solutions that have emerged to serve the space.

Here is the chapter from the task force's recommendations: Many of the discussions within the task force centered around the notion that the patient directed app of our purview supports the patient&rsquo;s HIPAA right to access his/her own PHI from a Covered Entity, as required under HIPAA &sect; 164.502. This could be characterized in several ways: the individual requesting access to their information an entity designated by the individual to receive a copy of PHI (as part of the individual exercising his/her right to access PHI) the medium on which the individual requests that PHI be provided or transmitted as part of the individual exercising his/her right to obtain a copy of PHI Alternatively, the patient directed app may also be characterized as a third party formerly authorized by the individual to receive PHI or a tool for engaging the individual in treatmentEach of these scenarios creates challenges when attempting to determine oversight of an app&rsquo;s behavior there is not one clear solution.

The next round of the Oracle v Google Java API Copyright battle has kicked off again in San Francisco after being sent back to the lower court by the United States Supreme Court. This round is all about deciding if Google's usage of the Java API in their Android platform was allowed under fair use. If I was in San Francisco I would be there to hear the case first hand--I am lucky there are some really smart folks covering the case&nbsp;and live tweeting things.
I went through the Tweets from&nbsp;Sarah Jeong (@sarahjeong), contributing editor at @Motherboard, Parker Higgins (@xor), EFF activist, and Mike Swift (@Swiftstories), Senior Correspondent for MLex. They are all providing some smart, and pretty amusing commentary on what is going on, so I wanted to organize the relevant Tweets into a Twitter collection summary for inclusion in my research.&nbsp;

  Oracle v Google 
  

I will add more tweets to it each day of the trial, and since it's a Twitter collection, it will update here on the blog post, or if you'd rather,you can access it directly&nbsp;via Twitter. I have no idea how long this round of the case will play out, but I will definitely be tuning in, and ranting about it when I have time.&nbsp;
Let me know if there is anyone else covering the trial, that I should be including in the Twitter collection. I want to try and capture as complete of a record as possible, from multiple perspectives if possible. While I am bummed that the precedent for copyright has been established for APIs, I'm hopeful that we can look at this round as an API literacy opportunity. ;-)

It is a powerful concept, when you think about APIs existing, not just for helping integrate healthcare systems, and innovate around the development and delivery of the web and mobile applications, but doing it all because of, in service of, and at the direction of the patient. The document has grabbed my attention because this is the first time I've seen such an end-user focused API vision in the wild. While these electronic healthcare record APIs will be used for system integration, delivering web and mobile apps, and benefiting healthcare platform operators, and developers, the reason for the APIs will be existing is to benefit the patient. This just isn't how things are done in Silicon Valley, where you always focus on benefits for the platform, its partners and investors first, maybe the developers secondarily, but in most cases the end-user is just an afterthought. In startup culture, things are just turned on its head, allowing for some serious imbalance in how we do things with APIs. There are a wealth of topics for me to work through from the task force recommendations out of ONC and HHS.

How we define our APIs has dramatically changed in recent years. Since Swagger came onto the scene around five years ago, there has been a rapid growth in the number of open formats, tooling, and services to help us define APIs. Companies are using API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and API.json to communicate about their APIs at almost every stop along the API life cycle. This is my research to better understand all the moving parts in this fast growing sector.
This guide focuses on API definition formats like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint, as well as schema formats like JSON Schema, and MSON, but I also touch on media types, link relations and other common building blocks for defining our APIs so they speak a common language. While there is some open tooling included in this guide, I'm trying to focus on the specifications, and formats themselves, and help make sense of the amount of information available to us.
I fund my research through consulting, selling my guides, and the generous support of my sponsors. I appreciate your support in helping me continue with my work and hope you find it relevant in your API journey.

			<p><em>10 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>I get brought into a lot of API discussions with IT departments from companies, institutions, and government agencies, which are often coordinated by business groups who are interested in better meeting their goals using APIs. This is often an immediately charged conversation, with IT coming to their table with a whole array of baggage.&nbsp; In about 75% of the situations, IT, and developer representatives are nice, or rather they are tight-lipped, relying on a myriad of smoke &amp; mirrors to defend their dark arts. Let me stop for a moment, and put out there that I was IT director from 1998 through 2010. I'm not saying IT are bad people, but there are a wide variety of ways we slow, obfuscate, and distort the conversation to be in our favor -- takes one to know one. I wouldn't say that I was 100% honest in my approach to being an IT leader, but I tried my hardest to keep things as transparent as I possibly could. Anyways, in a couple of the &nbsp;IT discussions I've had lately, there was an OpenAPI Spec available to define the resources that were on the table, and in a handful of other conversation there were not. Keep in mind that most of these scenarios are with a more traditional version of IT, not with startup technology groups (a whole different beast). As I step back, I am taking notice of the harmonizing effect that an API definition can have, in keeping conversations focused, productive, and moving forward toward a common goal. In the conversations without an OpenAPI Spec, back-end systems and legacy processes dominated the discussion, even though we are all on a conference call to discuss an external, partner, and public facing API. In the discussions where an OpenAPI Spec was present, we focused on exactly which resources were needed (nothing more), and the details (params, responses, etc) that were needed by all consumers--essentially providing us with a...[<a href="/2016/05/10/cutting-through-the-smoke-amp-mirrors-of-it-discussions-using-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

To help me work through the task force's recommendations, I will be blogging through many of the different concepts at play.&nbsp; Beyond the usage of "patient-directed&nbsp;APIs" that I wrote about earlier, I thought the pragmatic view on API privacy and security was worth noting. When it comes to making data, content, and other digital resources available online, I hear the full spectrum of concerns, and it leaves me optimistic to hear government agencies speak about security and privacy in such a balanced way. Here is a section from the API task force recommendations: Like any technology, APIs allow new capabilities and opportunities and, like any other technology, these opportunities come with some risks. There are fears that APIs may open new security vulnerabilities, with apps accessing patient records "for evil", and without receiving proper patient authorization. There are also fears that APIs could provide a possible "fire hose" of data as opposed to the "one sip at a time" access that a web site or email interface may provide. In testimony, we heard almost universally that, when APIs are appropriately managed, the opportunities outweigh the risks. We heard from companies currently offering APIs that properly managed APIs provide better security properties than ad-hoc interfaces or proprietary integration technology. While access to health data via APIs does require additional considerations and regulatory compliance needs, we believe existing standards, infrastructure, and identity proofing processes are adequate to support patient directed access via APIs today.

			<p>I wrote a post about Twilio using magic phone numbers that let their developers test out functionality without incurring any charges for deploying live phone numbers, making calls, and sending SMS. After publishing my post, Runscope CEO, John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) said he was behind the original spec for the Twilio magic numbers. @kinlane ha I wrote the magic numbers spec. The implementation was better than my design but it&rsquo;s funny to see it recognized so much later &mdash; John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) May 9, 2016 John&nbsp;continued to share some of the logic that went into his original spec: @kinlane I borrowed the idea from payment processors using magic numbers to generate specific kinds of outcomes like declines &mdash; John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) May 10, 2016 Which I think adds another dimension to the concept of having test numbers like this. Different numbers give you different outcomes, and different credit card numbers give you different results. What else could you do with test numbers&nbsp;and unique identifiers? Existing invoice and order numbers for different commerce situations. Seems like you could load just about anything into any alpha and / or numeric that you would want to. Around the turn of the century (I don't think I've ever said that) I used to work on web applications for non-profit organizations where I used to build campaign code tracking for large, and lengthy mail, phone, fax, and other types of activities. We had 6 to 8 digit identifiers, which every two digits had unique meanings--allowing us to build a pretty robust set of scenarios that helped us track every step in the campaigns evolution.&nbsp; Anyways, I think the concept is worthy of further exploration. I could see API providers crafting a pretty robust set of keys that could represent almost any object served up as part of API operations, with a very structured approach for how you tailor a multitude outcomes involving these objects.

			<p>As I push out stories on the next round of the Oracle v Google API copyright case, considering how I will write about API deprecations and acquisitions I'm privy to, and document the continued march by the enterprise into the world of APIs -- I begin to see how APIs will continue to wither on the vine, and never reach their full potential in an increasingly&nbsp;toxic&nbsp;environment. The Oracle v Google is just the first of many battles to occur between tech giants when it comes to APIs&nbsp;and the application of intellectual property laws. With the number of patents out there that focus on APIs as the thing that is protected by IP, not just the thing behind the API being protected, the copyright of the common API patterns&nbsp;we enjoy&nbsp;will just be the tip of the iceberg. This is how the giants will battle it out, leaving the rest of us fighting for scraps in the cracks. Legal tussle like what we see between Oracle&nbsp;and Google will become commonplace in the future as the enterprise&nbsp;fights for what they think is their&nbsp;"property" when it comes to integrations, collaboration, sharing, and automation. These battles will take place after this current wave of "interest in APIs" by the enterprise, where these large entities have sent their scouts out to map this uncharted (and mildly threatening) wilderness, understand what everyone is doing, and file patents based on what they see. Simplifying enterprise operations, actually innovating, or truly achieving integration is&nbsp;farthest from their mind. While we are all busy doing the work, these IP cartographers are mapping out the exhaust from our labor. Alongside all of this, another shift in the winds is occurring, that will reduce some very useful, innovative, and valuable API patterns to just portfolio items of the enterprise. As VC funding cycles shift, the startups who are doing the most interesting things with APIs will have their work gobbled up by the enterprise, either through direct acquisitions,...[<a href="/2016/05/09/apis-will-wither-on-the-vine-and-never-reach-their-full-potential/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I'm spending a lot of time in the Twilio API ecosystem this week, so you will hear multiple stories about what they are up to. This one is highlighting their Call Feedback API and the growing amount of what I'd consider as infrastructure APIs from leading API platforms. The more API platforms mature, the more I see APIs deployed to assist API consumers manage their integrations, as well as get a the core API resources being made available.
Twilio's feedback API focuses on a single API resource, a call, but could just as easily be applied equally as a quality of service feedback endpoint for anything you are serving up, like video, bot responses, recommendations, and beyond. I like the idea of having one endpoint for serving up a resource, and another endpoint for reporting the quality of service around the resource.&nbsp;

Now that I have filed a report on Twilio's approach to using APIs as part of their platform operations, I will be keeping a closer eye out for other platforms doing similar things. I will consider adding it to my stack of existing API infrastructure APIs, alongside access to account, application, billing, and analytics via an API.
As the growth of API integration continues, I will continue looking at the API pioneers for examples of how we can be providing more infrastructure focused API resources, that allow API consumers to manage, orchestrate, and automate their API integrations. As developers use a larger number of APIs to drive any single application or system integration, the need to automate accounts, apps, pricing, billing, analytics and feedback loops is only going to grow.

			<p><em>08 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>One thing I look at closely when I review API platforms&nbsp;is how they approach the monetization of their API resources, and the resulting plans, pricing, and access tiers. How platforms think about, and present this aspect of their operations provide a wealth of insights into what a company's motivations are behind their API operations.
I found the approach by 3D printing API platform i.materialise&nbsp;to be an interesting approach which goes beyond just charging for API access and focuses on helping API consumers align their business model with i.materialises. i.materialise presents API consumers with two possible routes, with the first being referral based, and the second being a deeper, white label relationship.

&nbsp;
The i.materialise API provides consumers with access to a &nbsp;full stack of 3D printing APIs, allowing you to upload your model, determine what it will cost to print, all the way to assisting you with order fulfillment, delivery, and invoicing. The i.materialise approach to API monetization is different than other APIs I talk about because it's not about paying for API access. In this situation, it's about providing API access to the manufacturing life cycle -- one that is 3D printer driven.&nbsp;
While I think utility-based, pay as you go API pricing represent the majority of how we approach API consumption at the moment, I think having your business model aligned, and focused on existing, tangible products and services holds a huge amount of untapped potential for APIs. I'm thinking there are endless numbers of small business out there who would benefit from the process of mapping out their product supply chain&nbsp;and service lifecycles, then the opening up of things as a simple web API--even if it is just for internal, and trusted partner use.

			<p><em>07 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am always on the hunt for the little things that make API integration easier, and while working to certify my Twilio API definition, I noticed their test credentials. When you are playing with the Twilio API, it's pretty easy to add new keys, and create new apps, but they also offering test credentials along with what they call "Twilio's Magic Numbers" so that you can play without connecting to real phones or making actual charges on your account.

Many APIs provide you access to data or content, but Twilio enters the additional realm of much more complex, programmatic API resources. When getting up and going with these types of APIs, it really helps to have a sandbox to play in, and a ready to go set of test credentials provides this for users by default.
If you are offering up more than just data and content, via your API, you may want to follow Twilio's lead, and create a set of permanent, or even regularly changing set of test accounts for consumers to use. It made my onboarding with Twilio, significantly easier.

I am sure there is some equation we could come up to describe the amount of ideology and / or dogma present alongside each bit and byte of code. Something that exponentially increases with each additional line of code or MB on disk. An example of this in action, in the wilds of the API space, is the difference between an SDK for an API, and just a single sample API call.&nbsp;
The single API sample is the minimum viable artifact that enables you to get value from an API -- allowing you to make a single API request and receive a single API response. Very little ideology, or dogma present (its there, but just smaller quantities). Now, if an API provider provides you with a Laravel SDK in PHP, or a JAX-RS SDK in Java, and React.js SDK, I'm significantly cranking up the volume on ideology&nbsp;and dogma involved with this code. All contributing what type of technical debt I'm willing to assume along the way, with each of one my API integrations, and wider technological solutions.
I work hard to never hold up any single technology as an absolute solution, as there are none, but I can see a potential for the latest wave of "serverless" approaches to delivering code potentially helping us unwind some of our technical debt. Like most other areas of technology, simply choosing to go "serverless" will not provide you the relief you need, but if you are willing to do the hard work to decouple your existing code, and apply the philosophy consistently to future projects, the chances "serverless" might pay dividends in the reduction of your technical debt will increase greatly.

			<p><em>07 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am doing way more work on the creation of machine-readable OpenAPI Specs for APIs, indexed using machine-readable APIs.json&nbsp;files than I am the actual creation of APIs lately. About half of the API definitions I create are for existing APIs, with the rest of them describing APIs that should exist. With the existing APIs, in some cases, I am creating client-side code, but mostly just focusing on a well crafted API definition. When it comes to the new API designs, I am focusing on a complete API definition, but also crafting both server-side, as well as client-side code around the definition--when needed. Even when I do craft server or client code for an API definition, the value of the code is significantly lower than the definition(s). In my mind the code is disposable. I want to be able to throw it away, and start over with anything I am building, at any point. While I have made significant ideological investments into using Linux for my OS, AWS for my compute and storage hosting, MySQL for my database, and PHP + Slim for my API deployment framework, the code that operates within this framework has to be transient. Some code might end up having a long, long life, but if a piece of code isn't generating value, and in the way, I want to either get rid of it or rewrite it to better meet the requirements. When it comes to delivering technology in my world, my investments are increasingly in the API definitions, underlying data schemas, and the data and content that is actually stored and transmitted within. The PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is valuable, but a second class citizen to the JSON, and YAML representations of my APIs, schemas, and the valuable data and content stored. For me personally, having made significant investments in a variety of tech solutions historically, this provides me with the flexibility I need to live in the...[<a href="/2016/05/07/i-am-seeing-significant-returns-from-investing-in-definitions-over-code-when-it-comes-to-my-api-strategy/">Read More</a>]</p>

There are many different ways to actually deploy an API. If you are a larger, more established company, you probably have existing&nbsp;tools, services, and processes set forth by IT for deploying APIs. If you are a startup, your developers probably have their own frameworks, or possibly a cloud service they prefer using. This guide looks to map out the world of API deployment, and some of the common ways companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are deploying APIs in 2016.
This API deployment guide breaks out many of the common companies, and tools while also looking to identify some of the common building blocks employed by leading providers, in support of API deployment across organizations of all shapes and sizes. This research is conducted by API Evangelist and is the just aspect of a modern API lifecycle, one that includes over 50 stops, from API design to deprecation, with deployment being just one area you should be considering.
I work to update my guides regularly, and if purchase a copy, you'll get any updates to it for the next year. Every reader of API Evangelist guides helps support this research and enables the work to continue--thank you!

			<p><em>03 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have been tracking on how APIs are used in higher education for some time now, keeping an eye on almost 50 campus API related efforts. I have my University API guide&nbsp;that I regularly update, but I was eager to push forward my storytelling around what is going on, so I have been working on some papers telling the story behind some of the top higher ed API implementations which I have access to. What better way to kick this off, than to showcase my favorite campus API group, over at Brigham Young University (BYU). The team led by CIO Kelly Flanagan (@kelflanagan) have embraced APIs on campus in a way that keeps my excited about APIs, and what is possible. In my opinion, BYU isn't just using APIs to shift IT strategy at the school, they are using APIs to shift how their students and faculty see technology, and put it to work on their terms.&nbsp; I'm pretty familiar with what has been happening at BYU when it comes to APIs, as I see Kelly and his team regularly, but I jumped on a Google Hangout with them, so that I could get the latest. The results is a short five page essay, about the history of the API efforts on campus, some of the benefits to faculty and students, and a glimpse at the future of APIs at the school.&nbsp; The paper is freely available for you to download as PDF, but I will also be working on some stories that I used&nbsp; the paper, as part of my regularly blogging here on API Evangelist. I want to keep bringing attention to what they are up to at BYU, but also generate attention at other schools about what is possible when it comes to APis. As I note in the paper, I'm also working with Davidson College in North Carolina, and will be working to keep spreading the conversation to other schools.

			<p><em>02 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am always working as hard as I can to develop as complete as possible OpenAPI Specs for the APIs that I monitor. I call this my API Stack research. When possible, in addition to mapping out API operations for an API using APIs.json, I also work to create a machine readable OpenAPI Spec for each API. In most cases I only have the time to profile the surface area of an API -- the host, base url, all properties, and required parameters. I don't always have time to reach what I'd consider to be a complete API definition. This is something that takes authenticating, achieving a successful request and response for each endpoint present, then generating JSON schema for each response -- this takes a significant amount of effort to do properly. Thankfully in addition to investing in this work myself, I am also getting the assistance of my partners like&nbsp;Dream Factory, who are interested in getting specific API definitions completed, and make sure they have complete API definitions for the leading APIs out there today. Here are a handful of them I'm working on producing this week: AngelList&nbsp;- Working to define all the endpoints for the startup, and investment platform API. Alchemy&nbsp;- Working to define all the endpoints for the machine learning API. Century Link&nbsp;- Working to define all the endpoints for the cloud computing API. Docomo&nbsp;- Working to define all the endpoints for the telco, image, machine learning API. Stipe&nbsp;- Working to define all the endpoints for the payment API. Twilio&nbsp;- Working to define all the endpoints for the voice &amp; messaging API. Verizon&nbsp;- Working to define all the endpoints for their Internet of Things (IoT) API. I've assigned each API its own Github repo to store the OpenAPI Specs, as well as indexing them using APIs.json, and facilitating the conversation using the Github issues.

			<p><em>02 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I was learning more about using the Link header for pagination yesterday, as part of my work on the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), and this approach to putting hypermedia links in the header got me thinking about other possibilities. Part of the reason I was considering using the Link header for pagination on this particular project was that I was looking to alter the existing schema as little as possible -- I liked that I could augment the response with links, using the header.
Another side thought I had along the way were around the possibilities for using it to augment 3rd party APIs, and APIs from an external vantage point. It wouldn't be too hard route API requests through a proxy, which could add a header with a personalized set of links tailored for each API request. If the request was looking up flights, the links could be to value add services that might influence the decision like links to hotels, events, and other activities. If you were looking up the definition of a word, the links could be to synonyms--endless possibilities.
You wouldn't have to just use it for pagination, and other common link relations, you could make it more about discovery, search, or even serendipity injected from outside sources. Anyways, I think the fact that you can augment an existing response using a header opens up a lot of possibilities for adding hypermedia behaviors to existing APIs. It might also be an interesting way to introduce existing API owners to hypermedia concepts, by showing them the value that can be added when you provided valuable links.

			<p><em>02 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>
As my API Stack work gets more attention, folks are reaching out to me to see if I have done certain APIs, or see if I'd prioritize some of the ones already on the list. One thing I'm also noticing is that people are often looking for the JSON schema of each of the API responses, just as much as they are looking for the OpenAPI Spec for the API surface area.
I had someone looking for the complete schema for the Reddit API today, while I was&nbsp;working to authenticate, and record the responses to each endpoint for&nbsp;AngelList, AlchemyAPI, CenturyLink, NTT Docomo, Stripe, Twilio, and Verizon. An OpenAPI Spec for the request structure of an API will get you a long ways in on boarding and learning about an API, but you will need the schema to complete any integration.
This is one of the reason I'm working to establish a better process for certifying that an OpenAPI Spec is complete, because without the definitions, providing a JSON schema, will only get you part way--still so much work to be done. This is why API service providers are looking to have it defined, because a complete spec is what will be used to map to other systems, tools, and services.
After spending a couple days going through Schema.org, and working on the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), I'm feeling the gravity of having common, machine readable schema available for the industry to work from. I've spent a number of cycles in the last two years creating OpenAPI Specs for APIs, but often stopping short of requiring the JSON schema to be present. From here forward, I will equally prioritize the response schema --it is proving to be just as valuable as the response described using OpenAPI Spec.

			<p><em>02 May 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I was revisiting the concept of pagination for a specific project I am working, and after consulting my API research, I came up with a suitable approach using a Link Header. Beyond applying this in my specific project, I thought the usage of the header for pagination would be a suitable topic for helping with HTTP header awareness -- a topic I will be writing about regularly, to help folks be more aware of useful approaches to using HTTP headers.
Github has the best example of using the link header for pagination that I could find. Github uses the&nbsp;Link response header to hold a handful of Hypermedia link relations including next, last, first, and prev. Providing a nice way to handle not just pagination, but potentially any other related action you might want to take around an API response. It also provides a way to augment link relations to any existing API design, without adding to the actual response body -- which is one reason I decided to use it for my existing project.&nbsp;
HTTP headers are a critical aspect of API integration, and an area that I feel many developers are lacking awareness of. Which is why I will be working harder to write up simple uses like Link header for pagination, that can help API providers, as well as API consumers better use common HTTP header patterns. To be clear, the Link header is not unique to Github, and is something that is articulated in RFC 5988 for web linking. Something I will add as a tooling to my API design research, so it can be considered as part of an overall API design toolbox.

			<p>I was playing with Microsoft's API Catalog, a tool to visualize and analyze the API overlap between standards specifications and type systems within browsers, and their footer caught my eye. I am always looking for quality examples of companies doing platform communications and support well, and I think their layout, and available building blocks in their footer, is worthy of showcasing.

For me, these numbers, and the available communication and support building blocks, send the right signals--that a platform is alive and active. These are the data points I tune into, to understand how well a platform is doing, or not doing. There are no absolutes when it comes to this type of monitoring, as anything can be gamed, but sign Github activity, road map evolution, and blog storytelling can provide a vital heartbeat for any healthy API platform.&nbsp;

			<p><em>28 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>
We are picking up speed with the planning for @APIStrat in Boston this November, and with the event committee assembled, and the call for talks open, we are looking at what the possible topics are for sessions. We have seeded the list with the usual suspects like API design, management, testing, monitoring, and others, but we want to also consider what the alternative topics are, and what is relevant to the API sector in 2016.&nbsp;
What is most important to you in 2016? Is it the trendier topics like bots, voice, and IoT? Is it more practical things like evangelism, versioning, and discovery? Is it the technical, business, or politics of APIs that are impacting your operations most in 2016? If you want to come and present on it, make sure you submit your talk by May 20th. Otherwise you are welcome to tweet at us, email at us, write a blog post, commit to a Github repo, or any other way you desire--we'll add into the mix, for the event committee to review.
It is a lot of work to make sure @APIStrat keeps reflecting the wider API movement after 3 years, and we depend on you keeping us informed. I'm enjoying the fact that we are only doing one event this year, as it is giving us more lead time to engage in discussions with the community, and continue making it an inclusive event. Another thing I'd like to hear about from y'all, is what is relevant to Boston, something I'm sure I will learn more about as I continue my profiling of Boston area businesses.&nbsp;
Let me know your thoughts please!

As an API consumer, I'm given access to valuable business API asset, which I'm expected use in a respectful way, that is always in alignment with a providers terms of service -- an environment where so much can go wrong, and does each day. I watch companies take a wide range of tones when it comes to setting the stage for this relationship. Some companies are super protective of their valuable content (like Marvel Comics), some are very communicative and inviting like Slack (inject your bot into us). where others wobble between a more open, the back to strict, like Twitter has done over the last couple years. In my opinion, it comes down to how you see your digital resources, and your belief in intellectual property -- when I you, I mean you and your investors. I try NOT to read all the patent notifications that come into my reader, as it fucking depresses me, but everyone once in a while I have to revisit to help remind everyone, what an illness patents will be, when it comes to APIs working. This fragile relationship I speak of above, operates well, or not very well, depending on how loose, or how much friction exists at this layer. There are plenty of examples out there of APIs who do not do well when they restrict, or too heavily meter API consumers.&nbsp; To help build an image in your mind. Imagine the Twitter API, and all the apps that have been built on it. OK, now add in Stripe for payments, Dropbox for storage, Instagram for Images, Facebook for Social, Amazon EC2 for compute,...[<a href="/2016/04/28/more-patents-turning-apis-into-an-invasive-royalty-generating-virus/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was reminded by my friend Mike Amundsen of the importance of storytelling in our world. When I am asked by anyone doing APIs, what is the most important thing they should be doing, my answer is always "storytelling". I don't care if its internally, publicly, on the corporate blog, or your personal blog, tell the story of what you are doing. I do not care how good your API is, if you aren't telling the story of this, nobody is going to care.&nbsp; When I hold up storytelling as the most important tool in your toolbox within developer groups, they often snicker, dismissing it. I also have a contingent of my NOT fanbase in the API space who love to dismiss me with -- nobody reads or cares about stories! I'm never phased by these folks, my focus is on the people who are truly trying to build community, and reach their intended audience. #NoHaterz While stories swirl all around is many forms, the one I like to reference the most, is when it comes to the mating ritual that is startup funding. If you are looking to get funding for your startup, you have to be sending the right signals, otherwise your VC mate will never be interested in you. You will need to be on TechCrunch, Venture Beat, and other tech blogs. Hacker News, Reddit and Hacker News needs to be in sync. Your stories should also be in sync with what is floating around VC firm blogs, aggregate, and other investor related streams.&nbsp; Startup valuations are are defined by an ocean of stories crashing on the shore each day. Bots are a thing because of storytelling. We are focusing on selling to the enterprise and abandoning B2C solutions because of storytelling. Google loves them some moonshot storytelling. Elon Musk understand the importance of the right story at the right time. Stories of what people are using. Stories of what people are...[<a href="/2016/04/28/a-regular-reminder-that-storytelling-is-the-most-important-tool-in-your-api-toolbox/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I came across the Wikimedia Unique Devices data set, which also is served up as an API endpoint, along with the other APIs the platform offers. The data set and API provides access to a list of unique devices that have visited Wikipedia, for a specific period of time.
The data set and API only has data back to January currently, but I'm sure is something that will evolve over time. I really like the fact that we have organizations who are operating at scale, and are open and willing to share their data. This type of information is high value, and is something that can help us all better understand the ever shifting digital landscape around us--thank you Wikimedia for making accessible.
While playing with their Unique Device API, I also noticed how transparent they are with their page view data, also making it available as simple set of API endpoints. I know Wikimedia is a non-profit, but I can't help but feel their way of doing things provides a blueprint that other commercial platforms should consider following.

			<p>I am working with my partner Cloud Elements to build out a community of evangelists, who are interested in delivering on many of the essential building blocks I track on when it comes to API evangelism. I get regular requests from companies who are looking for evangelism and advocacy resources -- in desperate need of smart folks who can help craft content, crank out code, in the service of evangelizing a platform. The work I'm doing with Cloud Elements, is the early work to help deliver on what API providers, and service providers are needing. Right now we are on-boarding new folks to the concept, and getting feedback on what some of the common elements, and challenges will be. One of the folks I'm engaging with on this is expert PHP and API developer, tech lead, author, consultant and open source maintainer, Lorna Mitchell (@lornajane). Lorna is one of several folks I've been working with to help deliver on API Evangelist projects ranging from blog, and white papers, to training, and how-to guides. If you are a PHP developer, have been learning about Git and Github in the last couple of years you have probably come across Lorna's work. I was talking to my friend Mark Body on Skype today, and mentioned Lorna and he said oh yeah, I've used her Git training materials before, in my stories and talks -- something I echoed as well, having pointed my readers and clients to her training materials regularly. After five years of doing what I call hacker storytelling, writing code, JSON, and stories about APIs, I understand how much hard work goes into creating content that is educational and simple, focused on very technical topics like APIs, while also driving search engine traffic over long periods of time. Lorna has done very well these areas,crafting blog posts that will keep being surfaced in Google searches for a long time to come, and help walk people through...[<a href="/2016/04/26/content-that-lives-on-when-you-invest-in-the-right-api-stories-training-and-guides/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>One of the side effects of the recent bot craze, is that I'm getting to showcase the often very healthy API practices of Slack, as they grow, scale, and manage their developer ecosystem. Slack is beginning to renew my faith that there are API providers out there who give a shit, and aren't just looking to exploit their ecosystems. There are two Slack blog posts that have triggered these thoughts, one on the Slack platform road map, and a little thing about release notes, both of which reflect what I would love to see other API providers emulate in their platform operations. Slack is going the extra mile to set the right tone in their community, with what I consider to be some of the essential communication building blocks of API operations, but they simply call "keep in touch": Recent updates&nbsp;-&nbsp;We improve the Slack platform every day by releasing new features, squashing bugs, and delivering fresh documentation.

			<p><em>25 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>
Despite popular belief in Silicon Valley, there are many different ways to fund the design, development, deployment, and operation of valuable API resources. Not all APIs are destined to be the next Amazon, Twitter, or even Twilio. Some APIs just need exist, be available, and will never be a revenue engine--one of these APIs is the Court Listener API.
Version 3.0 of the Court Listener API possesses 15 valuable endpoints, providing access to&nbsp;courts, dockets, opinions, people, sources, ratings, and other details about how laws are made in the United States. With their latest release containing a comprehensive database of judges and the judiciary, to be linked to Court Listener&rsquo;s corpus of legal opinions authored by those judges.
Increasingly APIs like Court Listener, and the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) API, are capturing my attention. These types of APIs represent the type of impact I'm looking to make using APIs, going beyond what APIs can do for a single application or industry, but what they can do for wider sections of our society. Focusing on getting agile, nimble, and more efficient in how craft laws in our country, and how we make sure people are fed, and find the government services they need in their life.
The Court Listener API depends on grants, and donations to operate, which is an approach I will be showcasing more when it applies to APIs that deliver valuable human, civic, and research related resources. APIs like the Court Listener API provide an important window into how our local, state, and federal judicial system is operating (or not), and will need our financial support to do what they do. Which I think is a very viable approach to designing, deploying, and operating APis -- that is, if we all step up and support these efforts.

			<p>I am using my minimum viable API operations definition tool to continue profiling the API sector, this time to size up the Slack API community. Slack is kind of a darling of the API space, so it kind of seem silly to profile them, but profiling those who are doing this API think right, is what API Evangelist all about--whether I follow the hype or not.

			<p><em>25 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am gearing up for another wave of API definition work, so I am taking the opportunity to produce some more tooling that assists me in the process. One of the tools I want to build, is a simple solution for walking me through one or many OpenAPI Specs, and push me to make sure every parameter has a complete set of descriptions. I possess amazing powers of bullshit, and can craft default description for almost anything I come across, but it would be nice to have an an ever evolving autocomplete dictionary to augment my existing super powers.&nbsp; I already have an APIs.json driven autocomplete tool, that loops through all the parameters within the OpenAPI Specs that are indexed. I just needed a rich set of fields and parameters to pull from -- Schema.org. The rich vocabulary that is Schema.org possesses 992 properties across 642 schema types. I've long wanted to craft OpenAPI Specs for Schema.org, but needed a reason to help push things forward, and this is a perfect opportunity to kick things off. As a starting point, I created 642 separate OpenAPI Specs. One for each of the schema types. I already have an API that will generate an OpenAPI Spec from any JSON schema, building out GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, as well as a default 200 response, and connecting it to the schema for the API response definition. As I was doing the work I realized that I didn't want to limit the OpenAPI Specs to just the JSON version, so as I generated I also published a YAML version. Next I'm going to use these 642 OpenAPI Specs as an autocomplete index for helping me quickly fluff up the parameters of other existing API definitions. Next I'll work on wiring up the hierarchies and relationships present in the Schema.org definitions. Right now, none of the OpenAPI Specs will validate as the parameter types aren't all valid, but I...[<a href="/2016/04/25/openapi-specifications-for-642-of-the-schema-org-types/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am working on one possible API definition for the Human Services Definition Specification (HSDS), and the next phase of this work involves bringing in a small group of technical, and non-technical folks to have discussions around their API designs, in context of the master specification I am looking to pull together.&nbsp; To help drive the discussion I am wanted to use the OpenAPI Specification that I created for HSDS, and I also knew I wanted to use Github issue management to help keep track of the synchronous, and asynchronous conversation that would occur around it. However Github tends to have a perceived barrier to entry for many non-developers (which I don't fully get), so I wanted to leverage the platform, but also soften the way everyone discussed the overall specification, as well as each individual endpoint. The HSDS specification is pretty verbose, and I needed a way to have conversations at the high level, but also down to the endpoint level. To help facilitate this, I got to work on a prototype micro tool which enables a conversation around any API(s) that are indexed within an APIs.json file, producing a human readable list of endpoints, parameters, etc., but then uses Github issue management as the core of the conversation.&nbsp; Resulting in my APIs.json Annotation tool. It is just a first draft, so there will be a lot of changes that need to occur. I'm going to test it against 20+ APIs.json collections I have defined as part of my API Stack work to try and harden it a little bit. My APIs.json Annotation tool runs in my single repo app style, leveraging Jekyll + Github Pages + Github API to operate--Github is the front and backend. Anyone can view the conversation, but if you want to participate you have to be added to the Github repository, and pass in a Github personal token. This is something I often automate with a simple Github login,...[<a href="/2016/04/23/using-my-apis-json-annotation-tool-to-drive-an-api-design-conversation-via-github-issues/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I tend to only work in environments where I have full control over the server, so Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is never really an issue for any of the APIs I have control over, but is a pervasive problem for APIs, and JSON files I come across on the web. This is one of the reasons I really enjoy the fact that I publish all of my JSON driven, hacker storytelling projects using Github Pages and Jekyll.
In the last couple weeks I have been working on a bunch of micro tools that deliver specific functionality which can then be used throughout the API life cycle. All of these apps are developed using JavaScript, and depend on being able to read from any number of JSON file stores. Sometimes these files are stored within the project, but most likely I'm calling the remote JSON files of other projects, something that depends on the sharing of resources across domains.
If I am publishing a JSON file publicly on the open Internet, I want it to be accessible from anywhere. CORS has to be default. The speed, and agility at which I'm able to ingest and work with APIs.json files, and the OpenAPI Spec indexes they contain, sets me up for some serious nimbleness across my work.
If you are working with open data on the web, make sure and consider the CORS enablement by default when working with your JSON data on Github. It will make your life easier, as well as anyone else who will be looking to consume the valuable data you are putting out there.

			<p>I'm always on the hunt for like-minded folks who I can partner with, and bring needed products, services, and tools to the API space. If someone is selling something to the API space, its likely I have had a conversation with them about the sector at some point. I always enjoy these regular encounters, but its the handful of them that continue, and evolve into deeper relationships that I enjoy the most. One of most recent relationship which I have been cultivating, is with a new API startup called Hitch. I have a long history with both the founders Bruno Pedro (@bpedro) and Luke Miller (@lukeam), in their previous lives with API Changelog and 3Scale, but began talking with them more heavily bout their vision for Hitch earlier this year. I have spent considerable time with Luke and Bruno discussing the current state of the API life cycle, from design to deprecation, helping contribute to their vision and road map in any way that I can. As Hitch prepares to shift into higher gear, helping API providers build community, the Hitch team asked me to join the team in an advisory capacity. I am always happy to share my thoughts, experience, and views on the space, but I'm stoked for the opportunity to help advise them on their road map. As Hitch evolves, you'll hear me tell more stories about the solutions they are bringing to the API life cycle.

			<p><em>22 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was just participating in an interesting conference call about multiple API implementations, which are putting the Human Services Definition Specification (HSDS) to use. The call was brought together discuss a shift in the current path one of the projects was taking, which involved using Azure Search Service, and whether or not the original vendor solution was still necessary, because the cloud solution appeared to meet all their needs. I sat and listened to the pros and cons of each approach. Why Azure allowed them to quickly meet the project needs, and could scale. Why the other vendor solution had a more holistic view of the problem, and shared the investment from many implementations. I had nothing to offer. The only common ground I had was around the already established schema for delivering human services. I didn't have any awareness of each individual project, the resources and skills available each group possessed, or a belief in any particular cloud platform, database solution, or programming language. While Azure, and the other vendor approach dominated the first part of the conversation, everyone one on the call was in agreement around HSDS driving everyone's schema, while also agreeing were missing a common approach to defining and delivering the API. The vendor on the call was working on the next version of their API which used the HSDS format, with the Azure driven solution spoke HSDS as well. To add to the mix, I am also working on two additional implementations that will also be speaking HSDS--we all just needed a common approach to defining the API. As the next step, I suggested scheduling another call, where I walk through the API definition I am applying to my projects, providing a YAML version of my OpenAPI Spec definition.

			<p><em>22 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>My friend Tom Woodward is continuing his personal API journey on his blog, sharing more of his thoughts around taking control over his information, and sharing some of the conversational exhaust that his journey has generated. The conversation around what what is "personal API", is where the value in all of this for me, something that is full of endless perspectives, and views of what APIs do. Which is one of the things I truly love about APIs, as they mean so many different things to different folks. As i mentioned before, when I mention the concept of personal API to some of my engineering friends, they seem to always focus on people designing, developing, and operating an API stack on their own server, or at home. The recent post from Tom, focuses around a comment from our other friend Alan, who commented on his previous post, talking about the process of personal API being, "a bit binary (reclaim or &ldquo;let it burn&rdquo;)". I'm thinking Alan's perspective has been strongly influenced by Tom's heavy "reclaim" desires, as well as two other friends, who have embarked on similar journeys. I'm endlessly intrigued by the dimensions of personal API that people are drawn into, and focus on. That personal API is about hosting or managing your API, or just about getting your information out of someones platform. When I read Tom's post, I actually do not see local or cloud, reclaim or let it burn, I see Tom working to understanding what information he generates online, understand the tradeoff's around the platform where this information lives, then logically making decisions around how he manage this. Sure this might involve abandoning platforms, and could involve setting up some self-hosted APIs, but more often it will not. I can't help but think Alan might be missing some details of his own personal API journey, as a result of his focus on his friends. When we focus to heavily on...[<a href="/2016/04/22/empowering-you-to-make-informed-decisions-around-your-information-is-what-the-personal-api-is-about/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I always have an inbox full of requests from companies asking me to take a look at their APIs, and provide any feedback that I can. I do conduct a more formal review for some companies, but I also enjoy looking through the API operations of any API, just as part of my regular monitoring (if I have time). When I do have time, the first part of any scope of review, is to see if it meets my definition of a minimum viable API operation. This is a definition I've been refining for over five years now, looking through thousands of APIs. Even with all this refinement, I still need a single place I could go, and quickly apply to any of the APIs that are in my review queue. My objective in doing these reviews is partly to help me get to know what an API does, but also provide feedback to the API providers, as well as generate stories that I can share with my readers, helping them polish their own strategy along the way. To help me streamline the reviews I do, and deliver feedback to API providers, I created a little micro tool for my self, that I can use as a checklist while I go through the operations of each API in my queue. To beta test my minimum viable API operation definition tool,&nbsp;I profiled the 3D printing API i.Materialise.

			<p><em>21 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>A &nbsp;huge pet peeve for me is when a company has a blog, but not provide an RSS feed--it really grinds my gears! Although it is something that aggravates me, I understand many of the reasons behind it. People just don't see their blog through an outside lens. They visit other company blogs when they want to read them, usually via a bookmark, or possibly rely on an email digest once a week--they aren't RSS reader users. RSS consumers were always a niche (that almost went mainstream), but is one that has taken a big hit with the closing of Google Reader. I'm sure most of the companies would immediately turn on an RSS feed if I dropped them an email, but I'd rather write about it, and reach just the cream (my readers) on top of the API space. One of the most important side effects of being on the API journey in my opinion, is that expansion, evolution, and fine tuning of your powers for empathy that will occur along the way. Your API developer portal becomes a front line for conversations with the outside world, where you will carefully(hopefully) share your most precious internal resources, and entertain external views on how they should be exposed and put to use.&nbsp; In my experience companies who are able to think outside the corporate firewall, do the best with APIs, with those who are open to culture change in close second--everyone else will falter. I can't help but feel that RSS is a very 101 example of this in action. I want you to read my blog, but because I didn't think beyond what I do, and my peers, when it comes to providing and consuming blogs, having an RSS feed didn't occur to me. If I was an RSS reader user, and the absence of RSS was a pain point, my tune would be different. You can see this awareness in play over at...[<a href="/2016/04/21/api-rss-and-the-ability-to-look-at-your-company-through-an-external-lens/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I've heard the same thing for years--that the average person will never care about their digital stuff enough to ever want to learn about APIs, let alone for the concept of the personal API to ever be a thing. People love to comment, and tweet it at me anytime I talk about evangelizing APIs to normals, about reclaiming your domain, or the concept of the personal API.&nbsp; First off, you aren't original. IT has been telling the normals to not worry their :pretty little head" about the technical details for many, many years. It is how those with the power stay in power. If people are technically literate, and we built simple technology solutions for people, they wouldn't need us, or buy our bullshit. It is a very scary notion for many of us very insecure technologists.&nbsp; I've worked as a professional developer since 1987, IT lead since 1998, and been evangelizing the API opportunity since 2004. These arguments are nothing new for me, but it does fascinate me that people think they are original, with very little awareness of the larger machine they operate on behalf of when they wield these statements. Like I should stop doing what I do, and having the expectations that I have, because the entire world will not fall into line -- its all or nothing. ?? WTF I do not think in scale like you do. You are the slave in believing that all your ideas should scale. Not me. I'm happy if I reach one person. People like Tom Woodward (@twoodwar), who understand that personal APIs are not about a single, perfect stack of APIs, living on a single beautiful server in your living room. Which is another rookie assault I get from fantasy believing developers looking to disarm my notion of the personal API, with their extremely simple view of what it is a "personal API". Tom is well on his way, when it comes to...[<a href="/2016/04/19/the-average-person-will-never-care-about-their-digital-stuff-enough-for-personal-apis-to-be-a-thing/">Read More</a>]</p>
