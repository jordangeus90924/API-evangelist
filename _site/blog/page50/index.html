        <span class="post-date">09 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/baas-trends.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just got off the phone with a new Backend as a Service provider <a href="http://bizmobify.com/">BizMobify</a>, who is looking to deliver BaaS services to the enterprise.  The timing for the call couldn't be better, as I'm updating up my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/08/overview-of-backend-as-a-service-baas-white-paper/">BaaS white paper</a> this week, and one thing I'm expanding is looking at it through the enterprise lens.</p>
<p>As I dust off my research on BaaS I'm re-visiting my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/08/overview-of-backend-as-a-service-baas-white-paper/">BaaS research site</a> and re-watching the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service">BaaS Panel from API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC</a> last February. This is helping me understand where the space what last winter and early spring.</p>
<p>As we move into the last quarter of 2013 I'm reminded of how fast the BaaS space is maturing. There are new providers continuing to enter the space, but I also see continued energy and releases from the BaaS leaders like Parse and Kinvey.</p>
<p>Kinvey, AnyPresence and StackMob will all be at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php">#APIStrat on October 24th and 25th in San Francisco</a>. While we won't be having another BaaS focused panel, they will be sharing their insight on the space in separate sessions.</p>
<p>From my vantage point I see BaaS providers being a key channel for API providers to reach developers in 2014, and definitely an area I will keep tracking on and working to understand.</p>
<p>If you are an API provider, you should be paying attention to BaaS providers, because they offer a channel for your API resources to reach developers. Developers may not care about your resource all by itself, but when bundled with the best of breed BaaS tools as well as other API resources, it may look much more appealing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/data-gov/data-gov-shutdown.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>The federal government shutdown today. At the Department of Veterans Affairs we are still working through next monday, so it was business as usual today for me.</p>
<p>One of my projects is preparing a list of APIs and data assets for a hackathon in NYC that is focusing on developing apps for veterans, called <a href="http://feastongood.com/2013/conference/hackathon">The Feast</a>. My goal is to aggregate a list of as many usable assets as possible so developers don't have to go to multiple locations to locate them.</p>
<p>Many of the assets are available at <a title="VA.gov" href="http://www.va.gov/">VA.Gov</a>, but there are others that I knew were on <a title="Data.gov" href="http://data.gov">Data.Gov</a>. As soon as the page loaded at Data.Gov, I got a friendly message:</p>
<blockquote><em>Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available. We sincerely regret this inconvenience.</em></blockquote>
<p>Basically, no data for me. No datasets for download, no APIs allowing me access information.  Which leaves me questioning the entire reason I'm in government. I came here to open up data and build APIs, then convince you to use them in your applications, widgets, visualizations and other innovation projects.</p>
<p>It is my way to find a way around <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANY</span> obstacle. There is nothing that will stop me. I will keep working no matter what. However, this is a pretty big obstacle, something that makes me question my faith in APIs in government. I can deal with just about anything, but if I evangelize APIs, that can be turned off at any point, for an unknown amount of time? Ummm&hellip;WTF? Unnacceptable!!</p>
<p>There is always a work-around. I will find a solution that will work for me(and you), but it leaves me questioning quite a bit about this API evangelism from within the federal government.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure to connect with the talented Code for America fellow, Moncef Belyamani(<a href="https://twitter.com/monfresh">@monfresh</a>)&nbsp;this week and talk about a very meaningful API project, called the <a title="The Ohana API" href="http://ohanapi.org/">Ohana API</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The Ohana API is a project from the San Mateo County team of Code for America fellows that is aiming to create open access to community social services, with an initial emphasis on food security."</em></p>
<p>I couldn't' think of a more important use of APIs, than making sure people can find the soical services they need--especially services that ensure people are fed.</p>
<p>I'm also impressed with the approach of <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/&lrm;">Code for America</a> in giving Github a central role in the project. The <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/">API project</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohanakapa-ruby/">API wrapper in Ruby</a> and a cool <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-pdf/">API to PDF generator</a> are all available on Github.</p>
<p>The Oahana API is only in alpha, they are looking for people to help the Code for America team take it to the next level with approaches to keep the data current and developing an SMS interface.</p>
<p>The Ohana API project itself, and the model used by Code for America, provides an important blueprint for how technology can be applied, and make a difference in our daily lives in a scalable way.</p>
<p>This type of work keeps me coming back back and working on API Evangelist, even after three years of covering a space that often leaves me pretty discouraged.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2013</span>
        <p>I'm working on taking inventory of data assets at the Department of Veterans Affairs. While eventually this will include private data assets, in the beginning we are focusing on data that can be made public without being worried about personally identifiable information or health information.</p>
<p>There are a lot of hurdles to get over, including educating people about what is a data asset, as well as the process of identifying, preparing, publishing and listing the data assets in a publicly available marketplace.</p>
<p>We are at the point where everyone is looking around for potential data assets that can be included in the current open data inventory cycle.  It is proving to be a challenge for folks to find datasets they can include. To help the process along I've set my focus on the public website, va.gov, and finding data that has already been published in various formats on the site.</p>
<p>Data and content is already available on the public web site represents the low hanging fruit when it comes to identifying open data that should be made available in machine readable formats like JSON and XML as well as available in APIs.</p>
<p>This approach works in both the public and private sector. If you feel it is valuable enough to have on your already, it is a perfect candidate to make available as open data or API.  Once you get the hang of identifying, processing and publishing this open data and APIs, you can start the much more difficult process of looking for harder to identify data sets and resources.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-post.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm playing with different approaches to rapidly design, develop, deploy and manage APIs using Github. While about 90% of what I'm building runs on Github, there is still about 10% that runs on Amazon EC2.</p>
<p>There are just some aspects of a proper API interface that I can't do on Github. My recent prototypes use swagger and allow for much of the API interactions to occur via Github. I a working to carve off any elements I can from the architecture, including using JSON files stored at Github as the database backend for the API.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you look at my recent <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/dev-hub/index.html">Dev Hub</a> prototype, you can browse the API interface, thanks to <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>, and when you make API calls to the endpoints via Amazon EC2, the REST interface is just acting as a search, filter and REST facade for the JSON files that are actually stored on Github--eliminating the need for a database backend.</p>
<p>This approach allows me to develop light-weight REST facades for JSON data stores as well as for other APIs. I'm playing around with different ways that I can use this thought process to push government APIs to the next level, and building on my earlier thoughts today on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/25/a-huge-need-for-writeable-apis-in-government/">need for writable APIs in federal government</a>.</p>
<p>I'm evolving earlier designs I have in my archives of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform-/">BeyondGET or OtherVerbs, an Augmented API Platform</a>, where I'm looking to provide an augmented layer that makes existing APIs writable.  Marrying these legacy thoughts with my current approaches using Github plus EC2 APIs, I strongly feel that Github has huge potential for being a POST, PUT and DELETE layer for federal government APIs.</p>
<p>Using a REST facade on EC2 I can easily proxy existing government APIs, then using a swagger definition I could seamlessly weave in a POST, PUT and DELETE layer that would write to JSON files hosted at Github using the Github API.</p>
<p>I'm in early thoughts on this work, and will start playing with examples of how this can work with real, live government APIs.  I think it has legs though. I'm not very confident that we can get the government to allow users to write and update data via APIs without demonstrating the value of this. Which means we need to make it happen externally of government, show the value and then get buy in from key decision makers.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-pen-hand.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I asked a question on Twitter last night: <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/status/382685108014428160">Any examples of government APIs that allow for write (POST, PUT, PATCH) capabilities? I'm looking for existing agencies who have implemented already</a>. While I was asking for examples of APIs, by motivations were specifically about finding an example of terms of use for a government writable API.</p>
<p>After spending some time looking and listening to peoples responses, there isn't much in the wild when it comes to writable government APIs, however it is clear that there is a huge demand for writable APIs, and a lot of opinion that this could be the thing that changes how government operates for the better.</p>
<p>The best examples that my followers pointed me to was with the <a href="http://open311.org/">Open 311</a> iniative:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://dc.gov/DC/About+DC.Gov/Terms+and+Conditions#1">Washington, DC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dev.cityofchicago.org/docs/api/tos">Chicago, IL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/mcg/user_rights.html">Montgomery County MD</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There was another DoD API that allows users to POST information, and then only allows them to only update their own information, but wasn't exaclty the open write I was looking for.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://clauselogic.altess.army.mil/banner">Clause Logic Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Clay Johnson (<a href="https://twitter.com/cjoh">@cjoh</a>), the author of <a href="http://www.informationdiet.com/">The Information Diet</a>, has a great <a href="http://dobtco.github.io/fixing-procurement-ebook/final/fixing-procurement-ebook/#how-to-fix-procurement-2-up-the-api-game">post on how writable APIs can help fix the government procurement process</a>. Demonstrating one solid example of how government could be more efficient through the sensible use of APIs.</p>
<p>The biggest <a title="case study I can find of writable APIs in federal government was the IRS Modernized e-File system" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/15/irs-modernized-efile-mef-a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy-draft/">case study I can find of writable APIs in federal government was the IRS Modernized e-File (MeF) system</a>, but the goal of this research is to find an existing example of terms of use for writable APIs in the federal government, and after looking through all the e-File documentation I couldn't find any terms of use that covered developers submitting tax forms to the IRS via MeF web services.  I will spend more time looking, I'm sure they are in there somewhere.</p>
<p>If you know of any examples of of the federal government using APIs and allowing the public to to submit data, content or forms through APIs, please let me know.  It is something I will keep researching, writing about and advocating for.</p>
<p>Executing APIs as a two-way street is essential to successful API and open data strategies in both the public and private sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/csv-converter/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/csv-converter-github.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to building applications within the federal government, there are numerous road-blocks to innovation. I'm currently assisting with the inventorying of open data assets at the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as across numerous other federal agencies.</p>
<p>The two biggest bottlenecks of this process are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>File Conversion</strong> - Converting Excel and CSV data assets into JSON and XML</li>
<li><strong>File Storage</strong> - Where do you put data assets once you have available in CSV, JSON and XML</li>
</ul>
<p>When I hit these road-blocks, it is my nature to find quick and dirty technical solutions (hacks) to get around these obstacles, and do it in a way that can be taught to others, allowing them to overcome these challenges in their own worlds.</p>
<p>The solution I've employed involved discovering and forking of a kick ass data conversion tool called <a href="https://github.com/shancarter/Mr-Data-Converter">Mr. Data Converter</a>, and quickly the tool retrofitted with some of my own enhancements:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/">HTML5 File API</a> - Allows me to acces file content without server side technology.</li>
<li><a title="oAuth" href="https://oauth.io/">oAuth.io</a> - Dead simple, client side oAuth for Github and other platforms.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/michael/github">Github.js</a> - A JavaScript API wrapper for Github, enabling client-side interaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I quickly stripped down Mr. Data Converter to have only the features I desired, added a file upload capabilities that used the File API to access CSV files without a server side layer, then after authenticating with oAuth.io via Github, I used Github.js to post the original CSV and converted JSON or XML files directly to the same Github repo that the file conversion application runs in.</p>
<p>This approach allows me to run the Excel / CSV conversion app 100% on Github using Github Pages--an blueprint that allows anyone to fork and run within their own Github accounts.  I'll spend more time hardening the code, and documenting it, to make it easier to use, and empower anyone to use in their own open data inventorying initiatives.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/csv-converter/">see it in action live on Github Pages</a>, and get at the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/csv-converter/tree/gh-pages">code behind in the Github repository</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/09/22/html-to-markdown-api/">HTML to Markdown API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/#api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/fuck-yeah-markdown/fuck-yeah-markdown-api.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm slowly getting my blog world in order after the move from my own proprietary blogging platform to using Github + Jekyll hosted using Github Pages.</p>
<p>I've been using HTML pages for blog posts at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and other blogs, with 3 years of blog posts at API Evangelist and about 6 years at Kin Lane. There is a lot of legacy content to move from my EC2 driven blogs to Github.</p>
<p>Every time I would try and publish the posts as is, Github would reject my commit when it hit posts that didn't have compliant HTML, making it near impossible to publish everything.  I was trying to clean up as much of it as I could, but it wasn't good enough.  I needed a way to convert to markdown and clean house.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Ben Balter(<a href="/admin/blog/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>) from Github recommend a very cool API called <a href="http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/#api">Fuck Yeah Markdown</a>, which takes my legacy HTML pages and converts it to much cleaner markdown.</p>
<p>When I first started using Jekyll I wasn't really sold on markdown, in my mind I didn't mind hand rolling my HTML tags--I have been doing it for years. After Ben suggested I use markdown in my newly minted Github Jekyll projects I started to see the benefits.  It is way easier to manage content that is being published as a blog, page or otherwise when it is markdown.</p>
<p>I am just finishing up converting all of API Evangelist and Kin Lane to use markdown, and will be using the <a href="http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/#api">Fuck Yeah Markdown API</a> to convert blog posts from HTML generated in my blog editor to markdown before publishing to Github.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>The Internal Revenue Service is the revenue arm of the United States federal government, responsible for collecting taxes, the interpretation and enforcement of the Internal Revenue code.</p>
<p>The first income tax was assessed in 1862 to raise funds for the American Civil War, and over the years the agency has grown and evolved into a massive federal entity that collects over $2.4 trillion each year from approximately 234 million tax returns.</p>
<p>While the the IRS has faced many challenges in its 150 years of operations, the last 40 years have demanded some of the agency's biggest transformations at the hands of technology, more than any time since its creation.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the IRS began wrestling with the challenge of modernizing itself using the latest computer technology. This eventually led to a pilot program in 1986 of an new Electronic Filing System (EFS), which aimed in part to gauge the acceptance of such a concept by tax preparers and taxpayers.</p>
<p>By the 1980s, tax collection had become very complex, time-consuming, costly, and riddled with errors, due to what had become a dual process of managing paper forms while also converting these into a digital form so that they could be processed by machines. The IRS despereatly needed to establish a solid approach that would enable the electronic submission of tax forms.</p>
<p>It was a rocky start for the EFS, and Eileen McCrady, systems development branch and later marketing branch chief, remembers, &ldquo;Tax preparers were not buying any of it--most people figured it was a plot to capture additional information for audits." But by 1990, IRS e-file operated nationwide, and 4.2 million returns were filed electronically. This proved that EFS offered a legitimate approach to evolving beyond a tax collection process dominated by paper forms and manual filings.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="even-federal-agencies-cant-do-it-alone" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#even-federal-agencies-cant-do-it-alone"></a>Even Federal Agencies Can't Do It Alone</h3>
<p>Even with the success of early e-file technology, the program did not get the momentum it needed without the support of two major tax preparation partnerships--H&amp;R Block and Jackson-Hewitt. These helped change the tone of EFS efforts, making it more acceptable and appealing to tax professionals. It was clear that e-File needed to focus on empowering a trusted network of partners to submit tax forms electronically, sharing the load of tax preparation and filing with 3rd party providers. And this included not just the filing technology, but a network of evangelists spreading the word that e-File was a trustworthy and viable way to work with the IRS.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/irs-efile-logo.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/irs-efile-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="bringing-e-file-into-the-internet-age" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#bringing-e-file-into-the-internet-age"></a>Bringing e-File Into The Internet Age</h3>
<p>By 2000, Congress had passed IRS RRA 98, which contained a provision setting a goal of an 80% e-file rate for all federal tax and information returns. This, in effect, forced the IRS to upgrade the e-File system for the Internet age, otherwise they would not be able meet this mandate. A working group was formed, comprised of tax professionals and software vendors that would work with the IRS to design, develop and implement the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Modernized-e-File-(MeF">Modernized e-File(MeF)</a>-Program-Information) system which employed the latest Internet technologies, including a new approach to web services which used XML that would allow 3rd party providers to submit tax forms in a real-time, transactional approach (this differed from the batch submissions required in a previous version of the EFS).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="moving-beyond-paper-one-form-at-a-time" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#moving-beyond-paper-one-form-at-a-time"></a>Moving Beyond Paper One Form At A Time</h3>
<p>Evolving beyond a 100 years of paper process doesn't happen overnight. Even with the deployment of the latest Internet technologies, you have to incrementally bridge the legacy paper processes to a new online, digital world. After the deployment of the MeF, the IRS worked year by year to add the myriad of IRS forms to the e-File web service, allowing software companies, tax preparers, and corporations to digitally submit forms into IRS systems over the Internet. Form by form, the IRS was being transformed from a physical document organization to a distributed network of partners that could submit digital forms through a secure, online web service.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="technological-building-blocks" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#technological-building-blocks"></a>Technological Building Blocks</h2>
<p>The IRS MeF solution represents a new approach to using modern technology by the federal government in the 21st century Internet age. In the last 15 years, a new breed of Internet enabled software standards have emerged that enable the government to partner with the private sector, as well as other government agencies, in ways that were unimaginable just a decade ago.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="web-services" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#web-services"></a>Web Services</h3>
<p>Websites and applications are meant for humans. Web services, also known as APIs, are meant for other computers and applications. Web services has allowed the IRS to open up the submission of forms and data into central IRS systems, while also transmitting data back to trusted partners regarding errors and the status of form submissions. Web services allow the IRS to stick with what it does best, receiving, filing and auditing of tax filings, while trusted partners can use web services to deliver e-Filing services to customers via custom developed software applications.</p>
<p>Web services are designed to utilize existing Internet infrastructure used for everyday web operations as a channel for delivering trusted services to consumers around the country, via the web.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="an-xml-driven-communication-flow" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#an-xml-driven-communication-flow"></a>An XML Driven Communication Flow</h3>
<p>XML is a way to describe each element of IRS forms, and its supporting data. XML makes paper forms machine readable so that the IRS and 3rd party systems can communicate using a common language, allowing IRS to share a common set of logic around each form, then use what is known as schemas, to validate the XML submitted by trusted partners against a set of established business rules that provide enforcement of the IRS code. XML gives the ability for IRS to communicate with 3rd party systems using digital forms, applying business rules to reject or accept the submitted forms, which then can be stored in an official IRS repository in a way that can be viewed and audited by IRS employees (using stylesheets which make the XML easily readable by humans).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="identity-and-access-management-iam" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#identity-and-access-management-iam"></a>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3>
<p>When you expose web services publicly over the Internet, secure authentication is essential. The IRS MeF system is a model for securing the electronic transmission of data between the government and 3rd party systems. The IRS has employed a design of the Internet Filing Application (IFA) and Application to Application (A2A) which are features of the Web Services-Interoperability (WS-I) security standards. Security of the MeF system is overseen by the IRS MITS Cyber Security organization which ensures all IRS systems receive, process, and store tax return data in a secure manner. MeF security involves an OMB mandated Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) Process, requiring a formal review and testing of security safeguards to determine whether the system is adequately secured.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="business-building-blocks" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#business-building-blocks"></a>Business Building Blocks</h2>
<p>To properly extend e-File web services to partners isn't just a matter of technology. There are numerous building blocks required that are more business than technical, ensuring a healthy ecosystem of web service partners. With a sensible strategy, web services need to be translated from tech to business, allowing partners to properly translate IRS MeF into e-filing products that will deliver required services to consumers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="four-separate-e-filing-options" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#four-separate-e-filing-options"></a>Four Separate e-Filing Options</h3>
<p>MeF provided the IRS with a way to share the burden of filing taxes with a wide variety of trusted partners, software developers and corporations who have their own software systems. However MeF is just one tool in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/Filing">suite of e-File tools</a>. These include Free File software that any individual can use to submit their own taxes, as well as free fillable digital forms that individuals can use if they do not wish to employ a software solution.</p>
<p>Even with these simple options, the greatest opportunities for individuals and companies is to use commercial tax software that walks one through what can be a complex process, or to depend on a paid tax preparer who employ their own commercial versions of tax software. The programmatic web service version of e-file is just one option, but it is the heart of an entire toolkit of software that anyone can put to use.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="delivering-beyond-technology" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#delivering-beyond-technology"></a>Delivering Beyond Technology</h3>
<p>The latest evolution of the e-file platform has technology at heart, but it delivers much more than just the transmission of digital forms from 3rd party providers, in ways that also make good business sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster Filing Acknowledgements - Transmissions are processed upon receipt and acknowledgements are returned in near real-time, unlike the once or twice daily system processing cycles in earlier versions</li>
<li>Integrated Payment Option - Tax-payers can e-file a balance due return and, at the same time, authorize an electronic funds withdrawal from their bank accounts, with payments being subject to limitations of the Federal Tax Deposit rules</li>
<li>Brand Trust - Allowing MeF to evolve beyond just the IRS brand, allowing new trusted commercial brands to step up and deliver value to consumer, like TurboTax and TaxAct.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without improved filing results for providers and customers, easier payment options and an overall set of expectations and trust, MeF would not reach the levels of e-Filing rates mandated by Congress. Technology might be the underpinning of e-File, but improved service delivery is the thing that will seal the deal with both providers and consumers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="multiple-options-for-provider-involvement" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#multiple-options-for-provider-involvement"></a>Multiple Options for Provider Involvement</h3>
<p>Much like the multiple options available for tax filers, the IRS has established tiers of involvement for partners to be involved with the e-File ecosystem. Depending on the model and capabilities, e-File providers can step up and be participate in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic Return Originators (EROs) - ERO prepare returns for clients or have collected returns from taxpayers who have prepared their own, then begin the electronic transmission of returns to the IRS</li>
<li>Intermediate Service Providers - These providers process tax return data, that originate from an ERO or an individual taxpayer, and forward to a transmitter.</li>
<li>Transmitters - Transmitters are authorized to send tax return data directly to the IRS, from custom software that connect directly with the IRS computers</li>
<li>Online Providers - Online providers are a type of transmitter that sends returns filed from home by taxpayers using tax preparation software to file common forms</li>
<li>Software Developers - write the e-file software programs that follow IRS specifications for e-file.</li>
<li>Reporting Agents - An accounting service, franchiser, bank or other person that is authorized to e-file Form 940/941 for a taxpayer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IRS has identified the multiple ways it needed help from an existing, evolving base of companies and organizations. The IRS has been able to design its partner framework to best serve its mission, while also delivering the best value to consumers, in a way that also recognizes the incentives needed to solicit participation from the private sector and ensure efforts are commercially viable.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="software-approval-process" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#software-approval-process"></a>Software Approval Process</h3>
<p>IRS requires all tax preparation software used for preparing electronic returns to pass the requirements for Modernized e-File Assurance Testing (ATS). As part of the process software vendors notify IRS via an e-help Desk, that they plan to commence testing, then provide a list of all forms that they plan to include in their tax preparation software, but do not require that vendors support all forms. MeF integrators are allowed to develop their tax preparation software based on the needs of their clients, while using pre-defined test scenarios to create test returns that are formatted in the specified XML format. Software integrators then transmit the XML formatted test tax returns to IRS, where an e-help Desk assister checks data entry fields on the submitted return. When IRS determines the software correctly performs all required functions, the software is approved for electronic filing. Only then are software vendors allowed to publicly market their tax preparation software as approved for electronic filing -- whether for usage by corporations, tax professionals and individual users.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="state-participation" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#state-participation"></a>State Participation</h3>
<p>Another significant part of the MeF partnership equation is providing seamless interaction with the electronic filing of both federal and state income tax returns at the same time. MeF provides the ability for partners to submit both federal and state tax returns in the same "taxpayer envelope", allowing the IRS to function as an "electronic post office" for participating state revenue services -- certainly better meeting the demands of the taxpaying citizen. The IRS model provides an important aspect of a public / private sector partnership with the inclusion of state participation. Without state level participation, any federal platform will be limited in adoption and severely fragmented in integration.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="resources" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#resources"></a>Resources</h3>
<p>To nurture an ecosystem of partners, it takes a wealth of resources. Providing technical, how-to, guides, templates and other resources for MeF providers is essential to the success of the platform. Without proper support, MeF developers and companies are unable to keep up with the complexities and changes of the system. The IRS has provided the resources needed for each step of the e-Filing process, from on-boarding, to how to understanding the addition of the latest forms, and changes to the tax code.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="market-research-data" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#market-research-data"></a>Market Research Data</h3>
<p>Transparency of the MeF platform goes beyond individual platform operations, and the IRS acknowledges this important aspect of building an ecosystem of web service partners. The IRS provides valuable e-File market research data to partners by making available e-file demographic data and related research and surveys. This important data provides valuable insight for MeF partners to use in their own decision making process, but also provides the necessary information partners need to educate their own consumers as well as the general public about the value the e-File process delivers. Market research is not just something the IRS needs for its own purposes; this research needs to be disseminated and shared downstream providing the right amount of transparency that will ensure healthy ecosystem operations.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="political-building-blocks" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#political-building-blocks"></a>Political Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Beyond the technology and business of the MeF web services platform, there are plenty of political activities that will make sure everything operates as intended. The politics of web service operations can be as simple as communicating properly with partners, providing transparency, or all the way up to security, proper governance of web service, and enforcement of federal laws.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="status" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#status"></a>Status</h3>
<p>The submission of over 230 million tax filings annually requires a significant amount of architecture and connectivity. The IRS provides real-time status of the MeF platform for the public and partners, as they work to support their own clients. Real-time status updates of system availability keeps partners and providers in tune with the availability of the overall system, allowing them to adjust availability with the reality of supporting such a large operation. Status of availability is an essential aspect of MeF operations and overall partner ecosystem harmony.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="updates" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#updates"></a>Updates</h3>
<p>An extension of MeF platform status is the ability to keep MeF integrators up-to-date on everything to do with ongoing operations. This includes providing alerts when the platform needs to tune-in platform partners to specific changes with tax law, resource additions, or other relevant news of operations. The IRS also provides updates via an e-newsletter, providing a more asynchronous way for the IRS MeF platform to keep partners informed about ongoing operations.</p>
<p>Updates over the optimal partner channels are an essential addition to real-time status and other resources that are available to platform partners.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="roadmap" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#roadmap"></a>Roadmap</h3>
<p>In addition to resources, status and regular updates of platform status of the overall MeF system, the IRS provides insight into where the platform is going next, keeping providers apprised with what is next for the e-File program. Establishing and maintaining the trust of MeF partners in the private sector is constant work, and requires a certain amount of transparency -- allowing partners to anticipate what is next and make adjustments on their end of operations. Without insight into what is happening in the near and long term future, trust with partners will erode and overall belief in the MeF system will be disrupted, unraveling over 30 years of hard work.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="governance" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#governance"></a>Governance</h3>
<p>The Modernized e-File (MeF) programs go through several stages of review and testing before they are used to process live returns. When new requirements and functionality are added to the system, testing is performed by IRS's software developers and by IRS's independent testing organization. These important activities ensure that the electronic return data can be received and accurately processed by MeF systems. Every time an IRS tax form is changed and affects the XML schema, the entire development and testing processes are repeated to ensure quality and proper governance.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="security" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#security"></a>Security</h3>
<p>Secure transmissions by 3rd parties with the MeF platform is handled by the Internet Filing Application (IFA) and Application to Application (A2A), which are part of the IRS Modernized System Infrastructure, providing access to trusted partners through the Registered User Portal (RUP). Transmitters using IFA are required to use their designated e-Services user name and password in order to log into the RUP. Each transmitter also establishes a Electronic Transmitter Identification Number (ETIN) prior to transmitting returns. Once the transmitter successfully logs into the RUP, a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Handshake Protocol allows the RUP and transmitter to authenticate each other, and negotiate an encryption algorithm, including cryptographic keys before any return data is transmitted. The transmitter&rsquo;s and the RUP negotiate a secret encryption key for encrypted communication between the transmitter and the MeF system. As part of this exchange, MeF will only accommodate one type of user credentials for authentication and validation of A2A transmitters; username and X.509 digital security certificate. Users must have a valid X.509 digital security certificate obtained from an IRS authorized Certificate Authority (CA), such as like VeriSign or IdenTrust, then have their certificates stored in the IRS directory using an Automated Enrollment process.</p>
<p>The entire platform is accredited by the Executive Level Business Owner, who is responsible for the operation of the MeF system, with guidance provided by the National Institute of Standards (NIST). The IRS MITS Cyber Security organization and the business system owner are jointly responsible and actively involved in completing the IRS C&amp;A Process for MeF, ensuring complete security of all transmissions with MeF over the public Internet.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy"></a>A Blueprint For Public &amp; Private Sector Partnerships In A 21st Century Digital Economy</h3>
<p>The IRS MeF platform provides a technological blueprint that other federal agencies can look to when exposing valuable data and resources to other agencies as well as the private sector. Web services, XML, and proper authentication can open up access and interactions between trusted partners and the public in ways that were never possible prior to the Internet age.</p>
<p>While this web services approach is unique within the federal government, it is a common way to conduct business operations in the private sector -- something widely known as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), an approach that is central to a healthy enterprise architecture. A services oriented approach allows organizations to decouple resources and data and open up very wide or granular levels of access to trusted partners. The SOA approach makes it possible to submit forms, data, and other digital assets to government, using XML as a way to communicate and validate information in a way that supports proper business rules, wider governance, and the federal law.</p>
<p>SOA provides three essential ingredients for public and private sector partnership:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology - Secure usage of modern approaches to using compute, storage and Internet networking technology in a distributed manner</li>
<li>Business - Adherence to government lines of business, while also acknowledging the business needs and interest of 3rd party private sector partners</li>
<li>Politics - A flexible understanding and execution of activities involved in establishing a distributed ecosystem of partners, and maintaining an overall healthy balance of operation</li>
</ul>
<p>The IRS MeF platform employs this balance at a scale that is unmatched in federal government currently. MeF provides a working blueprint can be applied across federal government, in areas ranging from the veterans claims process to the financial regulatory process.</p>
<p>The United States federal government faces numerous budgetary challenges and must find new ways to share the load with other federal and state agencies as well as the private sector. A SOA approach like MeF allows the federal government to better interact with existing contractors, as well as future contractors, in a way that provides better governance, while also allowing for partnership with the private sector in ways that goes beyond simply contracting. The IRS MeF platform encourages federal investment in a self-service platform that enable trusted and proven private sector partners to access IRS resources in predefined ways -- all of which support the IRS mission, but provide enough incentive that 3rd party companies will invest their own money and time into building software solutions that can be fairly sold to US citizens.</p>
<p>When an agency builds an SOA platform, it is planting the seeds for a new type of public / private partnership whereby government and companies can work together to deliver software solutions that meet a federal agency's mission and the market needs of companies. This also delivers value and critical services to US citizens, all the while reducing the size of government operations, increasing efficiencies, and saving the government and taxpayers money.</p>
<p>The IRS MeF platform represents 27 years of the laying of a digital foundation, building the trust of companies and individual citizens, and properly adjusting the agency's strategy to work with private sector partners. It has done so by employing the best of breed enterprise practices from the private sector. MeF is a blueprint that cannot be ignored and deserves more study, modeling, and evangelism across the federal government. This could greatly help other agencies understand how they too can employ an SOA strategy, one that will help them better serve their constituents.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://nordicapis.com/events/stockholm-sep-2013/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/nordic-apis/nordic-apis-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have a panel this week at <a href="http://nordicapis.com/events/stockholm-sep-2013/" target="_blank">Nordic APIs</a> called Business Models in an Internet of Things, with Ellen Sundh (<a href="https://twitter.com/ellensundh">@ellensundh</a>) of <a href="http://codacollective.com/">Coda Collective</a>, David Henricson Briggs of <a href="http://www.playbackenergy.se/">Playback Energy</a>, Bradford Stephens of <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> and Ronnie Mitra(<a href="https://twitter.com/mitraman">@mitraman/a&gt;) of </a><a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 Technologies</a>. My current abstract for the panel is:</p>
<blockquote><em>As we just begin getting a hold on monetization strategies and business models for APIs delivering data and resources for mobile development. How will we begin to understand how to apply what we have learned for the Internet of Things across our homes, vehicles, sensors and other Internet enabled objects that are being integrating with our lives.</em></blockquote>
<p>In preparation for the event I am working through my thoughts around potential monetization strategies and business models that will emerge in this fascinating adn scary new world where everything can be connected to the Internet---creating an Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p><strong>Where Is The Value In The IoT?</strong><br /> When it comes to monetizing APIs of any type, there first has to be value. When it comes IoT where is the value for end-users? Is it the device themselves, is it the ecosystem of applications built around a device or will it be about the insight derived from the data exhaust generated from these Internet connected devices?</p>
<p><strong>Evolving From What We Know</strong><br /> After almost 10 years of operating web APIs, we are getting a handle on some of the best approaches to monetization and building business models in this new API economy.  How much of this existing knowledge will transfer directly to the IoT? Freemium, tiered plans, paid API access and advertising--which of these existing models will work, and which won't.</p>
<p>Another existing model to borrow from when it comes to IoT is the telco space. The world of cellphone and smart phones are the seeds of IoT and one of the biggest drivers of the API economy. How will existing telco business models be applied to the world of IoT? Device subsidies, contracts, data plans, message volumes are all possible things that could be borrowed from the existing telco world, but we have to ask ourselves, what will work and what won't?</p>
<p><strong>Will Developers Carry the Burden?</strong><br /> When it comes to API access, developers often pay for access and the privilege of building applications on top of API driven platforms. Will this be the case in the IoT? Will the monetization of IoT platforms involve charging developers for API usage, number of users and features? Is this a primary channel for IoT device makers to make money off their products? In the beginning this may not be the case, with providers needing to incentivize developers to build apps and crunch data, but it is likely that eventually developers will have to carry at least some of the burden.</p>
<p><strong>Micro-Payment Opportunities</strong><br /> The payment industry is booming in the API Economy, but micro-payments are still getting their footing, doing better in some areas than others. Certain areas of IoT may lend itself to applying micro-payment approaches to monetization.  When you pass through toll booths or parking, there are clear opportunities for micro-payments to engage with Internet connected automobiles. Beyond the obvious, think of the opportunities for traffic prioritization--do you want intelligence on where you should drive to avoid traffic or possibly pay per mile to be in a preferred lane? Another area is in entertainment, in generating revenue from delivering music, audiobooks and other entertainment to drivers or passengers in IoT vehicles and public transportation.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-internet-of-things.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Will IoT Be All About The Data</strong><br /> As we sit at the beginning of the era of big data, driven from mobile, social and the cloud, what will big data look like in the IoT era. Will the money be all about the data exhaust that comes from a world of Internet connected device, not just at the individual device and the insight delivered to users, but at the aggregate level and understand parking patterns for entire cities or the electricity consumption for a region.</p>
<p><strong>Security Will Be Of High Value In IoT</strong><br /> We are already beginning to see the importance of security in the IoT world, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/13/the-perils-of-api-transport-over-the-public-internet/">missteps by Tesla</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/05/building-internet-of-things-products-you-better-secure-it-says-the-ftc/">camera maker <span>TRENDnet</span></a>. Will security around IoT be a monetization opportunity in itself?  Device manufacturers will be focused on doing what they do best, and often times will overlook security, leaving open huge opportunities for companies to step up and deliver b2b and b2c security options and layers for IoT. How much will we value security? Will we pay extra to ensure the devices in our lives are truly secure?</p>
<p><strong>I Will Pay For My Privacy In An IoT World</strong><br /> When all devices in my life are connected to the Internet, but also the world around me is filled with cameras, sensors and tracking mechanisms, how will privacy change? Will we have the opportunity to buy privacy in an IoT world? Will the wealthy be able to pay for the privilege of being lost in a sea of devices, not showing up on cameras, passed by when sensors are logging data? Privacy may not be a right in an IoT world it by be purely something you get if you can afford it. Will companies establish IoT business models and drive monetization through privacy layers and opportunities?</p>
<p><strong>A IoT Las Vegas for Venture Capital</strong><br /> With IoT centered around costly physical devices, and potentially large platforms and networks, will anything in the IoT space be able to be bootstrapped like the web 2.0 and mobile space was? Or will all IoT companies require venture capital? At first glance IoT looks like a huge opportunity for VC firms, allowing them to specialize for the win, or gamble on the space like they would in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Will We Plan For Monetization Early On In IoT?</strong><br /> When it comes to IoT, it is easy to focus on the monetization the physical device, either leaving money on the table with new an innovative ways of generating revenue, or possibly having monetization strategies that are behind the scenes and not obvious to users--something that could be damaging to security, privacy and overall trust in the IoT space.</p>
<p>We learned a lot from mistakes made in early social, cloud and mobile API monetization. We need to make sure and have open conversation around healthy IoT business models and monetization strategies. Generating revenue from IoT needs to be a 3-legged endeavor that includes not just IoT platform providers, but sensibly includes ecosystem developers as well as end-users.</p>
<p>The world of IoT is just getting going, but is picking up momentum very quickly. We are seeing IoT devices enter our homes, cars, clothing, bodies and will become ubiquitous in the world around us, embedded in signs, doorways, roadways, products in rural and metropolitan areas.  It is clear there is huge opportunities to make money in this new Internet connected world, but let's make sure and have open conversations about how this can be done in sensible ways to make sure the IoT space grows in a healthy and vibrat way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apps.npr.org/playgrounds/#playground-help" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/npr/accessible-playgrounds/ramps-to-play-components-600.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was impressed with some of the data journalism behind the recent NPR story, <a href="http://apps.npr.org/playgrounds/#playground-help" target="_blank">Playgrounds For Everyone, a community-edited guide to accessible playgrounds</a>.</p>
<p>The story is definitely an important one, but it is the data behind it I think is significant to highlight. You can download the data of the 1700 playgrounds in 20 different cities in a CSV and JSON format. Something I think is ripe for an API, by the way.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect is they are asking for submissions from the public, and they even provide a template Google spreadsheet, providing a framework for how the public should gather and organize data into a standard way, that NPR can import.</p>
<p>While I think this project could go further, I think it is an excellent example of using data journalism in public reporting.  The only suggestions I have is making the project a Github repository so the story, JSON and CSV can be versioned, forked and downloaded much more easily.</p>
<p>I think Google Spreadsheets and Excel templates are a perfectly acceptable way to gather data from the public and 3rd party sources. It allows you to solicit data from others in a format that they understand, while still making sure it is structured enough to easily merge with a master database.</p>
<p>Additionaly, it would be pretty easy to add the ability for users to email their spreadsheets to a central email address, and programmatically convert to JSON, and CSV, then commit to the Github repository that contains the master JSON and CSV files.  This way the repository administrator could accept or deny submissions as a pull request.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying seeing these scrappy spreadsheet, CSV and JSON solutions to data storytelling. Even if they aren't perfect I like seeing people play with different approaches, in hopes of finding an approach that works for them.</p>
<p>Lots to learn from. Nice work NPR.</p>

<p>George Reese has a very interesting post from last week over at O'Reilly. It is about an earlier post he did on the unpublished <a href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/08/tesla-model-s-rest-api-authentication-flaws.html">Tesla REST API</a>.&nbsp;I'll let you read the post, "T<a href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/09/the-myth-of-the-private-api.html">he Myth of the Private API</a>"--I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Reese talks about the mistakes made by Tesla, Phillips and other Internet of Things companies, when they take advantage of the power of web APIs, intending them to be private, but do not put any thought into what happens when you deploy APIs using the public without securing your API endpoints from unintended use.</p>
<p>I find a particular statement he made, fascinating:</p>
<blockquote><em>I sincerely believe that ultimately there is no such thing as a private API for consumption over the public Internet.</em></blockquote>
<p>After reading his post, I have to agree. I think many technology companies are just considering the Internet to be some sort of constant, magic transport layer for anything we want to use it for. I think this can be true to a point, but as the Intenret matures, we have slow down a bit and consider deeply the impact of our actions, and the way we use Internet enabled technology.</p>
<p>I wrote about a piece last week, which was about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/05/building-internet-of-things-products-you-better-secure-it-says-the-ftc/">first FTC case against an Internet of Things manufactuer</a>, camera maker TrendNet--where much like Tesla, they took no considerations for the fact they were using the open Internet to drive their technology, and more importantly no thought regarding the privacy of their consumers.</p>
<p>The world of APIs fascinates me. It reminds me of the bug zappers, where we are attracted by the openness and power of web APIs, but as you get closer and closer to the API light, you can easily get burned or zapped by the very thing that drew you in.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in the power of web APIs, but I think there will be a lot of unintended consequences from opening up data, resources and the devices that surround us, over the public Internet.  Make sure you are being thoughtful, and seriously considering security, privacy and the other potential repercussions of web APis before jumping in.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2013</span>

<p>In government there is a fear of exposing public data via APIs--rightfully so. This is not just a government concern, it exists in all industries within each an every business and organization.  We all possess private data, and when opening up API driven resources, we need to make sure none of this is exposed in un-desired ways.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe, that after almost 10 years of public APIs, there isn't a reasonable solution to masking, scrubbing and anonymizing data that is made available via APIs.  I wrote about r<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/13/an-api-that-scrubs-personally-identifiable-information-from-other-apis/">esearch into finding a solution at UC Berkeley</a> a while back, but to date I have not seen any real solutions to this problem yet.</p>
<p>I was talking with another Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) the other day about possible solutions for making sure Personally Identifiable Information (PII) doesn't get exposed via government APIs. Afterwards, I got to thinking about possible API options, and I don't think it would be that difficult to get started with a basic solution.</p>
<p>My thoughts are, that you could provide a simple API proxy, that would terminate requests from any <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> defined APIs and easily iterate through each value and apply a series of regular expressions against it to look for common PII or other data that shouldn't be exposed.  The proxy could automatically replace with template values like John or Jane Doe for names, 1234 Street for addresses, etc.</p>
<p>API providers could set a list of areas they are concerned about exposing with the API proxy configuration, and it would enforce all filtering required. The proxy could also look for other common patterns, and make recommendations of other areas that could be masked, scrubbed or anonymized that the API provider didn't consider.</p>
<p>Technically it sounds like a pretty simple solution, that could get smarter and faster over time at identifying sensitive information, to better serve API providers.  This type of proxy could be default in healthcare, education and in other sensitive environments and be default in development environments, or in production environments that are accessible to non-trusted consumers.</p>
<p>Of course this is something I'd love to explore, but I just don't have the time to build it. This is something that wouldn't be too hard to build and evolve, and could have potentially huge impacts across many important industries, and go far to protect all of our sensitive data from potential privacy violations.</p>
<p>As with all of my ideas, I just want to share it publicly, in hopes someone will build it.</p>

<p>The more I immerse myself in government, I'm reminded of the central role that the spreadsheet plays in our business and government operations--primarily Microsoft Excel, but also in some circles, the Google Docs Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>While it is government that is bringing the spreadsheet front and center for me again, I'm reminded of days while working on SAP events and working on budgets, sessions and registrations lists that were past around in complex series of spreadsheets. After this I go further back in time, to the early 2000s when I worked in the non-profit sector, where database management was completely done in a myriad of group and individual spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Beyond the spreadsheet being the <a href="http://www.breakingviews.com/is-microsoft-the-quiet-villain-of-global-finance?/21081118.article">central villain in global operations</a>, I'm seeing it emerge as a character across the API landscape with <a href="http://octopart.com/blog/archives/2013/7/octopart-in-excel">Octobpart Electronics providing bill of materials management in Microsoft Excel that is driven from their API</a>, <a href="http://info.crunchbase.com/2013/06/06/crunchbase-excel-update/">CrunchBase adding 13,689 Companies and 1,462 venture rounds as an Excel download</a>, and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2013/08/twilio-from-excel-and-access.html">Twilio allowing users to make calls and send SMSs from spreadsheets</a>.</p>
<p>As much as us API geeks would love for people to deploy clean, sensibly designed APIs, that meet our visions of the future of APIs--the reality is that much of the worlds data is managed via the spreadsheet.  If we are truly going to deliver on the API economy, we have to consider the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>This spreadsheet bridge is not just about allowing users to publish data via APIs from spreadsheets, but also enabling every day users to cosume valuable API driven data and resources from their native spreadsheet. It has to be a two way street.</p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet will continue to play a central role in the API space, and represents the future of acessing valuable corporate, non-profit and government resources for everyone.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Building off a similar topic this week, I was asked to dumb down or explain what I meant by "Loosely Coupled Services", alongside a "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/07/library-of-modular-services/">Library of Modular Services</a>". In this case, loosely couple means independent technical and data services, in the same way you would access services that people are familar with in the mainstream business world.</p>
<p>Think of the services you would access and put to use around your home. Common household services like electrician, plumber, tile layer and sheet rocker. These each represent independent services you would access to tackle a home improvement project. While there is some overlap in these services, generally each service technician specializes in one area, doing one thing and doing it well. The slight overlap between an electrician and plumber would be considered the "loosely coupled" part, where there are dependencies between each specialized service, ie. the plumber needs an electrician to wire the dishwasher after he /she plumbs it.</p>
<p>The concept of loosely coupled services works well when it comes to APIs. The goal is to define APIs to do one thing and do it well, establishing a library of modular services that can be used across a company and organization, its partners as well as provide public access to the most commonly requested resources.  A simple example might be product catalog. You can deliver a web service that allows for accessing, searching and pulling details of products a company offers. All the web service knows how to do is find, list and provide info on products, nothing else. This product catalog will have loosely coupled dependencies with other inventory, shopping cart and coupon services, but in the end its very specialized.</p>
<p>Any organization or company will have a wide variety of potential services that can be defined. It is best to define these in as granular of a way as possible, keeping them entirely independent of other services, except for slightly coupling that allow them to consider certain interactions and facilitate interoperability. A loosely coupled services approach will allow you to mix and match different services for different project, minimizing dependencies and introducing complexity that down the road can be very hard to untangle.</p>

<p>I'm always looking for simpler and more concise language to describe API, while writing stories and white papers for my audience. I recently used the phrase "library of modular web services", in a presentation outline at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This white paper was intended for a non-technical, state government audience, and my collaborator on the presentation asked if I could dumb this phrase down a little for the audience, providing a simpler explanation.</p>
<p>In this case, I think certain phrases get co-opted by the developer and IT crowd, borrowing from the physical world, resulting in them having a perceived technical meaning, but when in reality they are still very rooted in their past, and can be easily explained by taking users back to their previous meanings. One perfect example of this is the phrase, a "Library of Modular Services".</p>
<p>Think of each book, in a physical library as an analogy of a single API service. Much like when building an application on top of API services, when you are developing a research paper in a library, you need a multitude of resources to bring your paper together. When you visit the library to conduct your research you can browse the library directory, find a wide variety of books you will need. Early on you will be testing out many of these books, then setting aside the books that do not deliver the value and information you are looking for.</p>
<p>When you find the specific resources you need, this is when the modular approach comes into play. For example, if you need a book on a specific artist from history, you aren't required to check-out the entire art history section, or even check-out all impressionists artists, you can go for a very specific artist like Monet or pick and choose from the impressionist resources you need.</p>
<p>Using this library analogy for API services works very well. As a company or organization, instead of just going to IT to get technical services, you can visit your library of modular services to find exactly the resources you need for your project.  Maybe your project is just creating a quarterly report, or maybe you want to create a visualization of product sales, all the way to launching a new mobile application.</p>
<p>To support employess in their work, each company should have a library where anyone in the can visit, browse, search and discovery the resources they will need for any project. This library can then be extended to have more marketplace features allowing external partners or even the public to come and browse the library of modular resources, just like they would the public library--allowing them to find just the services they need.</p>

<p>I work with some seriously smart people on a day to day basis, virtually across the web, and in person on some of the projects I'm working on in federal government. Much like APIs, Github is fast becoming a ubiquitous technology that people are using to manage their community, code, documents and much more.</p>
<p>Several times each week I encounter situations where Github is referenced as a potential platform for managing a new project, or cited wen talking about how to solicit feedback, engagement and participation across existing projects. I'm always amazed that in about 75% of these Github conversations, someone chimes in about how Github wouldn't be appropriate because of the barrier to entry for many users.</p>
<p>I find this barrier to entry perspective very interesting. Many of the uses of Github require no knowledge of, or the need to touch code. One meeting in particular, was about providing feedback on the next steps of <a href="http://data.gov">data.gov</a>, when a participant referenced that for users who weren't technical, but wanted to provide feedback, they should use a separate forum to submit feedback.</p>
<p>To understand this I pulled up the data.gov site, clicked on link to Github repository behind the project, clicked on issues tab, then submit new issue. A text box came up much like it would on Facebook or the proposed forum. In reality there are no technical hurdles for these users, except their own perception that Github is a social coding site for programming.</p>
<p>This type of perception is a holdover from the last 30 years of IT and developers making sure they were keepers of the knowledge and instilling fear in users, that treading in this realm is only for the brave, often male world of developers, database and IT folk. In the world of software as a service (SaaS) and APIs, this is no longer a reality, but the perception is still there.</p>
<p>As I work hard to evangelize API tools and resource, in which Github is a huge part of, one of my primary directives is to educate everyday business users about how easy it is to use some of these tools. You don't need to be a developer to use Github. You can sign up for an account, create repositories of HTML, markdown, text, PDF, images and other documents, and even participate, and contribute to other people's projects--without touching code.</p>
<p>In the last year I've seen numerous, very tech savvy users, who are exposed to Github managed projects daily, who have made their first commit, submit their first issue and realize how easily all of this is. I'm always amazed at how little people truly understand about Github, when in reality with a little education, it is a very powerful platform that anyone can use--no coding knowledge required.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2013/09/trendnet.shtm">Federal Trade Commission(FTC) just settled a case with web-enabled camera maker TRENDnet</a>, signaling the government agency's first action against an Internet of Thing's company.</p>
<p>The FTC's complaint alleges that <a href="http://www.trendnet.com/?todo=home">TRENDnet</a> was labeling their cameras as secure, when in reality the camera had faulty software that left them open to online viewing and audio access to anyone who had the Internet address of the camera.</p>
<p>The FTC / TRENDnet case is the first, in what I predict is a future filled with security and privacy violations by Internet of Things products and companies.  As we blindly race forward with the exciting Internet of Things, many companies will disregard the security of their hardware and software, just like TRENDnet did.</p>
<p>Hopefully as an industry we can help make sure this doesn't get out of hand, and don't require the federal government to police the situation. As technology providers, we need to make sure the software, hardware and APIs that drive the Internet of Things is properly secured, protecting our customers and the industry.</p>

<p>I was working on series of API endpoints this week, each of them had a basic search parameter, allowing you pass a keyword to filter your API request.  Pretty standard stuff.</p>
<p>After deploying the APIs I wanted to make sure I tracked what people were searching for, so I could use in reporting and other tools. Then I got to thinking, that it would make sense to go ahead and launch an API of API search queries, allowing other users to be able to discover and benefit from insights derived from other API users searches.</p>
<p>Just a random thought as I'm playing around more with APIs in government. I definitely like the stimulation I get from designing, deploying and evolving APIs at my new gig, in addition to my existing monitoring of the API space.</p>

<p>There is a growing number of API conferences going on this year in the US, but the hunger for API knowledge isn't just something going on in this country, we are seeing a demand for API information and conversation growing internationally.</p>
<p>One place that is exploding is in Europe and specifically in the Scandinavian region, and there is one must-go-to event that is driving the API conversation--the <a href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank">Nordic API Conference</a>, September 18th and 19th in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>I will be heading out for the conference and giving a talk I'm calling "The Politics of APIs is the Future", my current abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><em>We have found the right balance of technology for APIs, using simple lightweight protocols, built on HTTP. The business of APIs around good documentation, marketing and support to developers and monetization strategies are being proven. The next challenge we face in the API space will be around terms of use, privacy, deprecation and security.</em></blockquote>
<p>In addition to my talk, I will be moderating a panel on the Internet of Things, but specifically on business models, with Ronnie Mitra, Bradford Stephens, David Henricson Briggs and Ellen Sundh:</p>
<p><a href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/nordic-apis/stockholm-image.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>As we just begin getting a hold on monetization strategies and business models for APIs delivering data and resources for mobile development.  How will we begin to understand how to apply what we have learned for the Internet of Things across our homes, vehicles, sensors and other Internet enabled objects that are being integrating with our lives.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Nordic APIs is exactly two weeks away, so its not too late to buy a plane ticket and engage in API conversations with global thought leaders fromt the space, in beautiful Stockholm. I've never been to Sweden and looking forward to going.  I get really pumped by the passion and energy for APIs, interoperability and opening up government businesses outside the United States.</p>
<p>If you can make time, and afford the trip, I look forward to seeing you in Stockholm and having a conversation about the business and politics of the fast unfolding API driven world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, people respond to stories about real world examples, even more than solid technological implementations. If you can demonstrate how APIs are actually providing a solution, you can reach more people than just talking about the technological nuts and bolts. With this in mind I'm working through telling stories around how the IRS leveraged web services to incentivize private sector to develop applications that would provide tax solutions for the every day tax payer.</p>
<p>In my short year and half working for government I've heard the example of "TurboTax" used to describe an example of how the federal government can leverage technology to deliver partner driven solutions, and better serve the public. Obviously this is an example that resonates with leaders in government, but one that I think needs a lot more work to actually flush out the model more deeply, while keeping it as something that anyone can understand and is able to repeat in their own circles.</p>
<p>The story of the IRS e-File program for developers is a important blueprint for how a forms driven federal government system, can deploy APIs and share the burden of delivering important civic services with the private sector. Describing this as a "Turbo Tax Solution", is an extremely simplified analogy, whereTurbo Tax is just one application within an ecosystem of private sector, trusted IRS partners.</p>
<p>As with every other federal agency, the IRS faced the problem of modernizing its systems to keep up with current technologies, while also continuing to improve the US tax process, so that it would better serve americans, and make the massive federal agency more efficient, which resulted in the design of an e-File system, where tax professionals could submit electronic tax form filings via IRS systems. While a web-based approach to modernizing the IRS tax process is a large part of the evolution of the US tax process, it wasn't enough. The IRS isn't in the business of being a software developer, and needed more help when building the next generation of tax solutions--setting the stage for development of web services.</p>
<p>Web services, also widely called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), provide the ability to submit traditional IRS forms over the Internet, directly from existing or new software platforms that are developed by 3rd party, public and private sector partners. These web services don't just speak in terms of IRS forms, they also understand the myriad of business rules that surround the submission of these forms, adhering to not just the legacy IRS forms process, but allow developers to follow the IRS tax code without fully understanding the intricacies of the complex tax system.</p>
<p><a href="/admin/blog/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/irs-efile-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This new set of APIs provides the foundation for what is known as the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4164.pdf" target="_blank">modernized e-File system for software developers and transmitters</a>. By employing APIs, the IRS is securely opening up access to the digital filing of IRS tax forms and supporting business rules, to trusted 3rd party partners from the public and private sector.  This API driven approach allows the IRS to stick with what they do best, and not worry about being the sole developer of online, desktop and mobile applications that interface with the US tax process--giving birth to not just TurboTax, but a whole ecosystem of API driven technology solutions from the prviate sector.</p>
<p>The IRS Modernized e-File (MeF) system provides a blueprint for how the federal government can leverage APIs to establish and evolve a public / private sector partnerships that allows government to more intelligently deliver services. This API driven approach is not purely a technical solution, it is one that acknowledges there are business drivers needed that provide incentives for 3rd party organizations and companies to participate. There are also political considerations in the form of terms of services, privacy policy and security, as well as adhering to the nuances and forward motion of the federal lawmaking process.</p>
<p>This post is just the first in a series of stories and white papers working to better clarify the API driven approach the IRS has taken to better collaborate with trusted private and public sector partners. My goal is to eventually provide a working blueprint that other government agencies can follow when embarking on their own API initiatives, and better serve their constituents.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/09/02/baseline-for-federal-government-open-data-and-api-portals/">Baseline for Federal Government Open Data and API Portals</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-portal.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have a whole list of projects around open data and APIs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Additionally I have numerous other open data and API projects I'd like to tackle across other federal agencies. As I do with other areas of my work, I needed a standardized way to stabilize the datasets and APis I will need for my projects, in the same way any open data and API provider should do for their consumers.</p>
<p>To help support my work, and hopefully the work of others I wanted to create a baseline portal that I could use at the VA, for showing what is possible when hanging open datasets and APIs, in a full featured portal. The success of any open data and / or API portal starts with the technical building blocks, like data and APIs, but have a set of business and political building blocks that are essential to their adoption and growth.</p>
<p>I've spent the last three years studying the business and politics of APIs. During these three years I've looked at almost 10,000 API developer portals, and I've established a <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">base set of what I consider the building blocks</a> of successful API portals, with a handful in which I consider essential to success. I've always wanted a simple API portal template that would reflect this research, and my new <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/">Developer @ VA</a>&nbsp;portal&nbsp;is the first step towards achieving this.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/">Developer @ VA</a> is an early stage prototype, whcih I've built to satisfy this need of mine, specifically for my VA projects. I will be polishing this portal and replicating it as a single template that can be used for any API and / or open data portal. This portal exists purely as a <a href="https://github.com/">Github repository</a> and runs on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, using a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll for managing its pages and blog</a>.  Everything else is HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSON, allowing it to be able to run on any server, including other cloud services like Dropbox or Amazon S3.</p>
<p>To start with I've included 20 of what I consider essential API building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Landing Page</li>
<li>Getting Started</li>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Interactive Docs</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Gallery</li>
<li>Support  
<ul>
<li>Self-Service  
<ul>
<li>Stack Exchange</li>
<li>Quora</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Direct Support  
<ul>
<li>Issue Management</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Google+</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roadmap</li>
<li>Changelog</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Terms of Use</li>
<li>Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Branding Guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond this project running using open formats and standards, and being deployable in common cloud environments like Github, Dropbox and Amazon S3, everything is machine readable by default. The portal starts with a <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/sitemap.json">sitemap.json</a>, which links &nbsp;to other building blocks that make up the open data and API portal, including a data.json and api.json which provide programmatic access to all resources included in the site:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/api.json">data.json</a> - Machine readable JSON file of all data assets using common core metadata for easy access to all data stored in the portal</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/data.json">api.json</a> - Machine readable JSON, using the Swagger format describing all API resources available within the portal</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I wanted all essential building blocks of the portal to also be machine readable by default:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/code/code.json">Code</a> - JSON library of all code available for use when integrating with datasets and APIs</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/gallery/gallery.json">Gallery</a> - A JSON gallery of web, mobile apps and visualizations, widgets, excel and other integrations on data and APis</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/support/support.json">Support</a>&nbsp;- A JSON listing of self-service and direct support channels for the portal</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/roadmap/roadmap.json">Roadmap</a> - JSON listings of both the future with a roadmap, providing transparency into portal operations</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/roadmap/changelog.json">Changelog</a> - A JSON listing documenting the past with all changes made to the portal</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/legal/legal.json">Legal</a> - A directory of the legal building blocks of the portal with links to terms of use, privacy and branding guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is the product of 3 years of research, and 3 days worth of work. So it is rough. I was able to capture my initial vision in 3 days, but still a lot of work to do. I need to let it simmer a little bit, and round off some of the rough edges and apply some polish. Then the next step is to generate a generic template from it, that will become the baseline for any other portal I derive from this work.</p>
<p>If there is anything you'd like to see in the future, go ahead and use any of the <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/support/">support channels available </a>on the site. Once I get the base template set up, I will use that as a top level project to guide the future of this baseline for open data and API portals.</p>

<p>One important thing I've learned while running API Evangelist, is the importance of picking your head up from your work on a regular basis, and tuning into the world around me.  When you are running your API initiative it can be also be easy to go heads down coding, addressing technical issues, managing support channels and dealing with the general day-to-day, internal activity of running a company.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm big on going radio silent, closing the Gmail tab, shutting down TweetDeck, LinkedIn, Facebook, Google+, Skype and my other communication channels. Since I stopped using Google Reader to monitor feeds, and setup my own internal curation, I can easily tune out my API industry monitoring and curation for days sometimes. This is all intended to get shit done and reduce distractions.</p>
<p>Even with my regular tuning out of the world and focusing on work, I make sure and pick my head up, turn on communication channels, read and curate blog posts and generally take a good look at the world around me.  I've worked too hard, building up momentum with my content creation, search engine optimization and social media presence to let it all slide. I can coast for days, or even weeks, but if I drop the ball for too long, I will not only stop any forward motion and growth--I risk losing traction and quickly becoming irrelevant.</p>
<p>My number one mission with the <a title="API Evangelist Network" href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist Network</a> is to educate myself, then secondarily educate the masses about the API space. If I don't pick my head up regularly, tune into the API space and understand the latest trends, technologies and players--I'm doing myself a disservice, as well as the greater interest of the API industry, and whoever I work for.</p>
<p>When running your company, make sure you find time to go heads down, focusing on your work, but make sure you pick your head up regularly and tune into your community, your audience and the wider industry you exist within. Without this engagement you will never achieve your goals.</p>

<p>I used to think that the API space is resistant to defining standards around REST, data formats, webhooks, hypermedia, api definitions and other key areas of the space, because after the top down, strict structure of SOA, the community just wanted to let the space organically define the best approaches.</p>
<p>The API world just seemed like a wild west of strong minded individuals, who had a sort of "markets will work it out" approach, and the best approach will win in the end. You know, kind of like the Amazon cloud API battle?</p>
<p>By 2013, the only thing we've come to agreement on is around oAuth, and by many accounts that was a failure. I used to think that many of the bitter battles by the RESTafarians about API design, RESTfulness and Hypermedia were because these were very smart, stubborn folks trying to craft the best approach possible.</p>
<p>After many years of advocating for open source tooling, open events in the space and sharing of common API design patterns, I don't think there is much goodwill for any of it, because companies are more interested in their intellectual property(IP), seeming competitive and ultimately making the most money and pleasing their VCs.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, there are some very fine companies, do good in the space. I'm not saying the entire sector has lots its way. However the majority of the vibe from major players is, we don't want to share design patterns, open tooling, work together to support industry events and gatherings, we will just do it all ourselves, keeping the IP and value for themselves.</p>
<p>I understand I'm less interested in the whole business and VC aspect of this than many of you are, but I think APIs got their start in openness, collaboration and sharing in the spirit of transparency and interoperability. It seems like like after 10 years and finally getting some traction in the space, we are starting to lose our way.</p>

<p>When it comes to API discovery, as an industry we haven't been able to find a satisfactory technological solution yet. While I often feel the right approach hasn't emerged yet, I think we are just overlooking "good enough" solutions, because we are waiting for the holy grail of API discovery.</p>
<p>I can't imagine that indexing, search and discovery of the myriad of web APIs out there is that much harder than indexing, search and discovery of the billions of HTML documents available online.  Sure, when you are talking about programmatic interfaces, you need a little more precision, but I think us technologists are caught up our own beliefs that APIs should be perfect.</p>
<p>It would make sense that we adopt some evolution of the common <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">sitemaps format</a>, retrofit it to be JSON, accommodate open data catalogs, and allow for various API definitions in <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">I/O Docs</a> or even <a title="API Blueprint" href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a>.  Sure these formats won't have the precision of an evolution of the precious WSDL, or some actually agreed upon standard, but it will get us over the hump we are in.</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> is 8 years old now, and in 2013, we still don't have any next step, let lone an actual usable solution for API discovery? I just have a hard time believing this is a technological problem, that it is more the stubbornness of the leaders in the space to just take any meaningful step towards API discovery, and lead.</p>
<p>There isn't going to be any money in API discovery, so this isn't something a single startup can emerge to solve. It is something we will all have to discuss and play with until we can find something will get us to the next step, together.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oauth/OAuth2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>With APIs beginning to enter the mainstream consciousness, it is time to spend more time educating the masses about OAuth. We've had plenty of conversations between two of the OAuth legs, provider and developer, but we now need to <a title="3 legged conversations" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/26/which-of-the-three-oauth-legs-is-the-most-important/">bring the third leg into the conversation</a>--the user.</p>
<p>First, what is OAuth? - An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, OAuth has become the industry standard for accessing resources, being served up via APIs, that are being consumed through desktop, web and the fast growing mobile space.</p>
<p><strong>OAuth Platforms &amp; Data Providers</strong><br /> If you are an online platform, OAuth is something you need to understand. At a minimum, if you require users to establish an account, you need to consider allowing users to create their accounts and login in the future using other popular OAuth providers like Facebook, Twitter and Google. Next if you want to provide access to your platform user's data via an API, you need to take a deeper dive into OAuth, and consider establishing yourself as an OAuth provider.</p>
<p><strong>OAuth for Desktop, Web and Mobile Developers</strong><br /> In 2013, if you are a developer, you are probably using APIs. OAuth has been very intimidating for developers for quite some time, but with the increased availability of quality OAuth clients, better implementations and educational materials from API providers, and standardized approaches by startups like <a title="OAuth.io" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/13/simplifying-oauth-with-oauthio/">OAuth.io</a>--OAuth is something you shouldn't fear anymore. You need OAuth as a default tool in your developer toolbox.</p>
<p><strong>Everyday Online User</strong><br /> Like the term API, OAuth is something that should be added to the vocabulary of every tech savvy user. You should understand that OAuth exists, and that it gives you the ability to create accounts and login to your favorite platforms without filling out endless new forms and sharing your passwords unnecessarily. The platforms you use daily, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google all are OAuth providers, and you should leverage these providers to manage your online presence. The control is in your hands to securely manage your online persona using OAuth, and with a little education and maintenance you can ensure you profile(s) are secure, and only the providers you trust have access to your important data.</p>
<p>This is a first post in series of OAuth related information that is looking to educate the masses about the importance of OAuth. Hopefully increasing the number of quality OAuth providers, knowledgeable developers and OAuth aware online users--making OAuth something that is ubiquitous across the web, and enabling meaningful 3 legged conversations that make data accessible, incentivizes developers while protecting end-user's privacy.</p>
<p>I will be deploying an entirely new research project dedicated to OAuth, where I will work on stories about OAuth that hopefully resonate with the masses. As with my other research, it will take me a while to dial in. As I work to do this, I will curate the best stories and tools in the OAuth space, eventually trying to create a polished repository of OAuth resources that providers, developers and users will find valuable.</p>

<p>I've been doing API Evangelist for three years now, a world where selling APIs to existing companies outside of Silicon Valley, and often venture capital firms is a serious challenge. While APis have been around for a while in many different forms, this new, more open and collaborative approach to APis seems very foreign, new and scary for some companies and investors--resulting in them often very resistant to it.</p>
<p>As part of my storytelling process, I'm always looking for ways to dovetail API tools and services into existing business needs and operations, making them much more palatable to companies across many business sectors.  Once part of the API space I'm just getting a handle on is the area&nbsp;<a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a>, which includes testing, monitoring, debugging, scheduling, authentication and other key challenges developers face when building applications that depend on APIs.</p>
<p>I was having a great conversation with Roger Guess of <a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://therightapi.com">TheRightAPI</a> the other day, which I try to do regularly. We are always brainstorming ideas on where the space is going and the best way to tell stories around API integration, that will resonate with existing companies. Roger was talking about the success they are finding dovetailing their testing, monitoring and other web API integration services with a company's existing QA process--something that I can see will resonate with many companies.</p>
<p>Hopefully your company already has a full developed QA cycle for your development team(s), including, but not limited to, automated, unit and regression testing--something where API tests, monitoring, scheduling and other emerging API integration building blocks will fit in nicely. This new breed of APi integration tools don't have to be some entirely new approach to development, chances are you are already using APIs in your development and API testing and monitoring can just be added to your existing QA toolbox.</p>
<p>I will spend more time looking for stories that help relate some of these new approaches to your existing QA processes, hopefully finding news ways you can put tools and services like TheRightAPI to use, helping you better manage the API integration aspect of your web and mobile application development.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2013</span>

<p>I thoroughly enjoy the assortment of emails, LinkedIn messages and phone calls I get from people in the SMB and enterprise, letting me know the role my blog plays in them starting, cultivating and evolving their own API initiatives.</p>
<p>I received once such call this week, from an unnamed individual, at an unnamed company, letting me know the role API Evangelist played in providing the information they needed to find success. Like many other companies who reach out to me, their efforts aren't to the point where they feel comfortable telling stories publicly, so I'm happy to keep anonymous, until they are ready.</p>
<p>The stories that come out of these companies are all very similar.  The API initiatives were started by single person, or small group of passionate individuals who start small, find safe and sensible wins, while keeping risk and failures to a minimum.  They start with data and resources that are not mission critical, but still offer value to either internal, partner or public developers.</p>
<p>These innovators usually start with a handful of trusted partners, keeping the experimentation very controlled in a safe environment, before opening up to a wider base of partners, and then when ready, to a self-service public audience.  This approach allows API innovators to find small successes and report these wins to business leaders and stakeholders, before moving forward with other efforts.</p>
<p>Taking this approach in small, iterative cycles, providing decision makers with the necessary reporting and education, allows for you to slowly change internal culture. API change does not happen overnight, and it is easy to fail if you try to go big in companies who aren't quite ready.</p>
<p>I can't get enough of these stories, I can't wait until these program mature, where I can tell them publicly on the blog. Until then, remember that when you are starting with a brand new API initiative within your company, start small, find success, minimize risk, repeat and tell stories of your efforts to everyone you can. You will be surprised what can happen in six months to a year, with the right environment you can find your culture changing and becoming much more open to API experimentation.</p>

<p>Github is really doing some cool stuff to help open data folks manage and share their data.</p>
<p>They just launched the ability to <a href="https://github.com/blog/1601-see-your-csvs" target="_blank">render data from .csv (comma-separated) and .tsv (tab-separated) files as an interactive table</a>, including headers and row numbering.  They even let you link to a specific row for sharing specific data from the file.</p>
<p>As I'm working on opening up government data, I'm pushing for agencies to use Github when publishing and sharing CSV, TSV, XML and JSON files. These kind of features really go a long way in helping me achieve my goals.</p>
<p>Make sure and also check out what Github has done around <a href="https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing">3D models</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">geographic data</a>, pretty cool stuff.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/audrey-kin-paris.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've had the joy of watching a lot of you bash on my girlfriend, from the misogynistic douche bags telling her to get back in the kitchen because she questions their technology startup, to the recent <a href="https://twitter.com/FakeAudryWattrs">@FakeAudreyWatters</a> Twitter account spending a good portion of their day mocking her.</p>
<p>Audrey and I are very different personalities when it comes to expressing ourselves in an online environment, but we share one common thing--a passion for helping encourage meaningful dialogue about where we are going with this whole technology roller coaster.</p>
<p>Audrey is extremely passionate about education and where we are going with the education of our kids, and how we are applying technology in the classroom.  If she is critical of your startup, idea or otherwise, you may not like it, but there might actually be a reason behind it--why don't you engage her in dialogue about it?</p>
<p>She spends at least 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, researching, writing and stressing over her work(unpaid). I spend every moment with her and I see how much thought she puts into all of this. She is a very positive person, and extremely intellectually stimulating to be around, which is why I'm with her. Together, as a team we have achieved some amazing things in the last three years.</p>
<p>I strongly believe Audrey and I have positively impacted the online world by helping folks think critically about education, and across numerous other industries through analysis of APis. I depend on Audrey to bounce ideas off, ranging from oAuth to API terms of use. API Evangelist <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would not exist</span> without her.</p>
<p>When I was first with Audrey she often frustrated me with her confrontational approach, but over the course of four years, I have found it to be essential to what I do. She battles me on ideas, sometimes to the point where we both stomp off, but in every case, I've been able to apply her critical feedback and make my work more polished as a result.</p>
<p>What I hope is, that you can learn to do the same. If she says something that bothers you, have a dialogue with her and either change her mind, or I bet she'll change yours. If you don't like what she is saying, come to DC and sit with us and talk it out over a couple pints or bottle of wine.</p>
<p>If not, I think secretly you have more problems than just Audrey. You are probably insecure, greedy, sad sack o shit like the creator @FakeAudreyWatters. Someone who could be spending their time actually contributing to the education space, but they are actually working hard to suck value from their space, just like the company you work at. Something that is just unacceptable, c'mon these are our kids asshole, get a fuck'n life.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.census.gov/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/census.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote a piece about <a title="providing a full download vs. API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">providing a full download vs. API</a> last month, where I used the <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/" target="_blank">Census Bureau API</a> as an example. The post got the attention of the folks at the Census, and they invited me out for a discussion yesterday about their API strategy.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau API team asked me what I thought of their <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/" target="_blank">API developer area</a>, and while I have lots of suggestions of where they could do, I first focused on what they have already delivered.</p>
<p>I don't know if you understand the size of the census, but it is a massive undertaking, resulting in data at a scope that we are only seeing matched in the last few years, with the Google's and Twitters of the world--the only difference is the census has been going on since 1790. it gives you an ideas of the serious big data potential behind the Census Bureau API.</p>
<p>Faced with data at this scope, I understand that delivering a simple, web API is not easy. I was impressed with the teams efforts before I came to D.C., but now I'm really impressed that such a simple, web API could be delivered out of such a large government entity. Many other agencies are still trying to even learn what an API is, and even if they do attempt at delivering APIs, the result is often the much more technical cousin of web APIs, SOAP web services.</p>
<p>I totally respect the simple start to the Census Bureau API. The current API landing gives you brief introduction to the API, shows you how to access the data via the URL endpoints, gives you example responses, error codes and addresses what you need to use the APIs in JavaScript.  They also give you quick access to getting API keys, a developer forum, application gallery and of course you still get full access to Census downloads.</p>
<p>What a great start. So simple. Giving developers exactly what they need to get going.</p>
<p>Then before I gave my feedback on where they could go next with the APis, the Census team gave me a quick overview of the API road-map, to make sure I wasn't going to suggest anything they were already working on.</p>
<p>I was pleased to hear the Census Bureau API road-map centered around making sure all the public survey data at the Census was accessible via the API for developers. After that, the focus was on making it easier for developers to access, filter and work with all data via the APIs. One of the biggest challenges is that there are hundreds of thousands of fields developers can use when querying the API, and potentially millions of fields when all of it is made available. Opening up the question, how do you educate users that these fields exist, let alone put these fields to use.</p>
<p>I think the Census Bureau API road-map reflects the mission of the Census Bureau, with a focus on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Complete Data Downloads</li>
<li>Simple API Interfaces</li>
<li>Access to All Public Data</li>
<li>Usability for Developers</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach totally satisfies my number one requirement for all APIs--deliver value. If you focus on delivering value, the rest will work out. Developers will come, and build on that value.  The Census team is on the right track with their road-map, dovetailing with any feedback I had brought with me to the meeting:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Value</strong> - Keep focusing on providing value to developers. Make the data they desire available, make it as easy to access as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - The key to success will be to keep building on the simple interfaces you've created. Complexity will slow API adoption for developers.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong> - Look at Swagger, I/O Docs and API Blueprint for approaches to make learning about Census APIs interactive, exploratory and hands-on for developers.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - Keep up the good work on providing JavaScript resources for integrating with the developers, this will help encourage embeddable tools, single page apps and meaningful visualizations.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - Consider providing spreadsheet integration resources for using Census APIs in Excel and Google Spreadsheets, allowing spreadsheet packages complete with built in graphs, charts and other visualizations. This is a growing trend in the API space and will meet the needs of non-developer users, which will mean massive new adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Landing Page -</strong> Keep the home page simple, but consider surfacing other valuable resources, making everything a developer needs to get started is one click away.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not want to overload the Census team with too many ideas, I want to keep my feedback as simple as their initial approach to their API. I had feedback loop on my list before arriving, but the team walked me through their existing feedback loop of partners, advisory groups, conferences, forums, list serves and Twitter. Add me coming by the office regularly, I think they have the feedback loop covered! :-)</p>
<p>In 2013, we are all excited about the potential of big data. I'm excited to see the OG Big Data provider, stepping up to the plate in such a meaningful way. There are some seriously smart people at the Census, and I'm really excited to see what they have coming down the pipeline, and I'm honored that they respect my opinions enough to have me out to the office.</p>

<p>As I immerse myself in the federal government, I have left my private sector world where web APIs have become commonplace. Sure I still worked hard to get outside of Silicon Valley and reach out further into land of "normals", helping spread the API gospel, but in Washington D.C. I seriously have my work cut out for me.</p>
<p>I have a great support system within the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) at the White House</a>, but as I go deeper within specific agencies I see fewer web APIs, and fewer people who understand them. When I do come across a web service, it makes me hopeful, but still these SOAP driven services may get the job done for programmers, but lack the simplicity needed to get wider adoption.</p>
<p>This is only my second week in DC, I'm spending a lot of time going through websites, getting to know the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies, and recognize there is a lot of web talent, even though much is probably contracted, within the Federal Government.  I can't help but think how CMS platforms like Wordpress, Drupal and others have helped our government publish valuable information and resources via the web, but we still are lacking a complimentary web API movement.</p>
<p>The value of websites has been accepted across federal government, what can we do to get web APIs to the same level? Web services are embraced, but they are still a very black box, developer centric tool, something out of reach of the common gov worker. But web APIs aren't much different than the websites being produced, they just trade their HTML output for data formats like XML and JSON--I'm looking to change this.</p>
<p>In 2013 and 2014 I want to pose the question in within government, why aren't open data and API skills part of the federal government's web developer toolbox, alongside the skills you already posses. You can increase the productivity of government 10x with this little change. Every time you publish web content via HTML, simultaneously publish an XML and JSON version of the same information. This little change will transform how our federal government works, much like it did when website development was adopted in the 90's.</p>

<p>As I spend time in Washington DC, I get a lot of questions regarding API design, deployment and management. It is quite likely my writing will evolve here at API Evangelist during the next year. You will see me quickly scrub answers that I'm giving to questions that I receive from any number of federal agencies.</p>
<p>One question I received today was a classic one: what are some good examples of API docs? But in this particular case it wasn't just for an API, there is also a full download of data available as well.</p>
<p>First, regardless of whether or not it is data download (CSV, XML, JSON) or API you need to provide a wrapper area, or portal, that will onboard users and helps them understand what you are delivering, enabling them to go from 0-60 with as little friction as possible.</p>
<p>This is what I have studied for the last 3 years. After looking at thousands of APIs areas, you start to see patterns. You will find&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my research in the form of "building blocks" on a section of my site</a>. Even though most of my research is focused on APIs, these patterns can apply universally to data download or API delivery.</p>
<p>But specifically to question of what API documentation I like? I also recommend looking at:</p>

<p>When looking through these make sure and take notice of how&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">Dwolla separates their intro page, between non-devs and devs</a>. This is a very significant concept for delivering onboarding materials for users where not everyone will be a developer.</p>
<p>Beyond those suggestions for API docs, here are&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">Thirty APIs To Look At When Planning Your AP</a>I, if you are looking for more examples of quality API areas + documentation.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when actually deploying specifically an API, is making your API documentation "interactive". There are several solutions for doing this right now, but the leading solution (in my opinion) is called&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>. This is a evolution from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a>, but has come a long ways since just describing a web API in XML.</p>
<p>Swagger is developed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, and you can view the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html">documentation in action on their developer site</a>. In my examples above, Full Contact uses swagger to deliver their documentation in a very elegant way. Why Swagger is important, is the fact that it doesn't just deliver elegant documentation, it makes it interactive and learning about an API a hands on experience, which increases the potential for adoption. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of Swagger only begin with interactive documentation, it will also&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">generate code samples in Java, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby</a>&nbsp;automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just some thoughts. I hope it helps. Remember, open data and APIs only start with the download or interface. The success of your implementation really depends on the richness of the area around your data download and API.</p>

<p>This is from a question I answered on the <a title="API Craft Forum" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-craft">API Craft Forum</a> tonight titled: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/api-craft/IgPZ5mWAsVE">SOA vs API</a>?</p>
<p><em>I happened to look at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/apigee/apis-inside-enterprise-soa-displacement">slide and also related video</a> but unfortunately still do not have&nbsp;&nbsp;a crystal clear view.</em><br /><br /><em>Is my understanding correct?</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>SOA and API are complementary paradigms/technologies. APIs are a facade to SOA to expose them to the outside world?</em></li>
<li><em>SOA was aimed to provide an integration mechanism/guidelines for enterprise while APIs are generally aimed to make the backend systems public? Also, APIs can be internal to the organization.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>My response:</p>
<p><span>Your understanding is in the ballpark.&nbsp;&nbsp;APIs were one tool in the SOA toolbox. Except you are seeing APIs as just technology.</span><br /> <br /> <span>APIs have jumped out of the enterprise toolbox, and found success in the richer oxygen environment of the Internet, escaping from the claustrophobic environment of the restrictive enterprise network in which strict governance was imposed, and technologists decided everything.</span><br /> <br /> <span>After going outside the firewall, APIs became about the simplicity of REST + JSON over HTTP, putting these resources closer to actual problem owners--flipping the governance of SOA on its head, making APIs more about partnering, collaboration, transparency and openness, and not just about control. After escaping the governance and the bottleneck of traditional IT, this new breed of APIs allowed for new types of innovation, business models and opportunities amongst not just open developers, but actual business owners. A new world emerged that the governance overlords of SOA could never achieve or even see.</span><br /> <br /> <span>Allowing the&nbsp;</span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">humans to win over the machines</span></span><span>!&nbsp;&nbsp;Making for a new formula for success that can be applied in public, partner or internal environments.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Public Media Platform" href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/public-media-platform/public-media-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are just a handful of API platforms that I feel have greatly impacted the world of APIs and were significant in leading the space in important ways. These platforms include, but are not limited to Amazon Web Services, EBay, Salesforce, Google Maps and Twitter. All of these companies have changed the way we build applications and conduct business, by using APIs.</p>
<p>In 2013, as we watch 50-100 public APIs launch each week, it can be difficult to see any sign of meaningful impementations in each wave of new API deployments. Just as I'm getting completely depressed about this lack of true API innovation, I was introduced to a new <a title="Public Media Platform" href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/">Public Media Platform</a> that is pushing forward the tech, business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>The Public Media Platform (PMP) is a non-profit organization formed by public media's leading organizations, APM, NPR, PBS, PRI and PRX, to establish digital content repository and distribution system that will enable users to easily discover and interact with the news, information, cultural and educational content that is produced across the public media landscape.</p>
<p>PMP has come together to develop a completely API driven platform, that will empower producers of public media to store and share text, digital video, audio, images and related meta data. This approach to media delivery will increase the distribution and reach, lower operating costs, while also handling the business rules, rights management necessary for media delivery in an online and mobile world.</p>
<p>By lowering these barriers of entry, and simplifying operations and distribution, PMP will open up opportunities for these leading players to get their work in front of the large public media audience. However, this isn't just about benefiting these existing players, who are investing in the platform, once deployed, the platform will be opened up to any media producer. With this newly developed ecosystem, any developer will be able to build tools and applications that will help public media stations and producers deliver content in new ways that will serve a growing audience--opening up entirely new opportunities for collaboration, distribution and innovation.</p>
<p>PMP is an important project, something that doesn't occur in the commercial space. With this approach to building an API platform, you have what could be perceived as competitors, who are working together to define a common API and data standards, while also defining best practices, then leveraging open source tools and approaches to establish a shared platform that is not just beneficial to these founding partners, but ultimately other independent, lesser known producers--establishing the groundwork for a true API ecosystem.</p>
<p>You just don't see this happening in the commercial space. You might see API providers like Twilio and SendGrid who work together, but trust me, as someone who has organized an <a title="API industry conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php">API industry conference</a>, where I work hard to bring API providers and service providers together--it can be like herding cats to even get them all in the same room, let alone collaborate on a common platform or standards. Something that seems counter to the underlying philosophy of the API space, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The PMP team is heads down in the build phase of the project, and will be launching pilot deployments in the fall, with full deployment planned for the beginning of 2014. I've been fortunate to have a chance to look at the technology behind the platform, and I'm seriously impressed with the PMP team's forward leaning approach to the platform's design.</p>
<p>I have crafted a 15 story series based upon the PMP platform, which I will be releasing in tune with the PMP roadmap, so make sure and tune in over the next six months. With the lack of commercial constraints, the PMP team is going to lead in not just the public media space, but deliver a platform model, API design definition and suite of open source tools that can be applied across numerous industries, and show many commercial API platforms a whole new world of API possibilities.</p>

<p>Securely accessing API with oAuth can be one of the bigger pains in the ass for developers. Poor understanding of how oAuth works and often lack of good client libraries, can make API authentication a hurdle developers can't jump over.</p>
<p>Now developers don't have to stress out over oAuth. The tech savvy team over at <a title="Webshell.io" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell.io</a> has created a dead simple oAuth solution that allows you to integrate with over 70 of the common API providers, with just three lines of JavaScript, called <a href="https://oauth.io/" target="_blank">oAuth.io</a>.</p>
<p>What I like about oAuth.io the most, is that it is a true client side oAuth solution. With as many pure client-side, JavaScript, <a title="Single Page Apps" href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">Single Page Apps</a> I'm building, this type of oAuth solution just rocks!</p>
<p>I really enjoy dead simple solutions like oAuth.io, that take powerful, but complex things and abstracts away the complexity, making it something anyone can use. I recommend taking a look at oAuth.io and saving yourself the overhead of API integration using oAuth.</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough, It gets even better. They have also open sourced the oAuth.io core under the name&nbsp;<a href="https://oauth.io/#/docs/oauthd">oAuthd</a>.</p>
<p>Nice work Webshell.io team!</p>

<p>In this computer driven business world its easy to end up with a mess of documents across a company's network.  No matter how much you try to organize, name and add metadata to documents, providing a quality search mechanism can be tough. Let alone one that you can use in web portals, web sites and even mobile and tablet applications.</p>
<p>One common way to to solve this problem historically has been using the Lucene Java Search Library, but in the age of web and mobile having an added API for integrating across all the place you will need search, is even better.  One of the quickest ways to deploy a document search API is using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Apache Solr</a> which is built on top of the Lucene Java Search Library.</p>
<p>Apache Solr delivers a full-text search server that provides a REST-like API, where you put documents in it via XML, JSON or CSV, and then you can query it via API and receive XML, JSON, CSV results, which enables you to deliver a quick, cost effective, open source API driven search for your documents.</p>
<p>There are many types of APIs, from data to programmatic resources--when it comes to document search APIs for knowledge bases, catalogs and other document stores, Apache Solr is a solid option.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, will be my first official day in Washington D.C. as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/round-2-fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>. I'm super excited, yet also very calm about what is happening.  It seems like it is so meant to be, that I don't have any questions or reservations, I just want to get to work.</p>
<p>I was not in the realm, where I would take a job from anyone.  I was doing very well, educating the masses about APIs as THE API Evangelist.  However when the I got the call to be a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I did not hesitate.  Yes.  Of course I would take the role.</p>
<p>As a Presidential Innovation Fellow I will be assigned to the "VA Modernization Team", along with two other very talented individuals, Molly Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>) and Ben Willman (<a href="/admin/blog/benwillman">@benwillman)</a>. While we are working together as a team, I will be specifically assigned to the Digits-2-Digits (D2D) project which is:</p>
<blockquote><em>An enterprise Digits-to-Digits Electronic Claims Submission Service that will provide a common access point to standardize, centralize, and integrate the universal collection of Benefits Claim Forms and supporting evidence data to produce a streamlined, paperless Veteran/Service member-centric claims process.</em></blockquote>

<p>I couldn't think of a more meaningful project to be part of. I've gone through the project and begun to acquaint myself with its inner workings, and I'm impressed with the amount of work and detail that has gone on so far, in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>I'm really thankful for this opportunity, to really put APIs, and my experience to use for such a meaningful cause. I'm looking forward to the talented folks I will be working with over the next year, and the amount that I will learn on this new adventure in my life and career.</p>

<p>In closing wanted to give a quick shout out to my father Jim Bignall (top photo) who I never got to know, and my step-father John Ronald Kehoe (bottom photo) who impacted my life in so many ways. Both have passed on now, but both were Vietnam Veterans and left significant marks on who I am, and contributed so much to prepare me for the next year of service.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2013</span>
        <h1>Overview of API Integration</h1>
<p>Integrating with a single API can be tough, let alone multiple APIs. I see integration being about on-boarding, exploration, education, authentication, code samples, testing and sand-boxing of APIs--pretty much everything between the discovery of APIs and going into production.</p>
<p>The goal is to identify building blocks, tools, services and other knowledge that will help developers integrate APIs into their web, mobile and internet of things applications. API Evangelist as always been about the business of APIs from the API provider perspective, but now I'm looking to evolve it, and include the business of API consumption.</p>
<p>Some of the companies included in this research span other areas like API discovery or management, but they are also providing valuable tools and services that help ensure developers will be successful. Once I get, what I feel are the key areas of both deploying and consuming APIs up, I will work on the overlaps, and interoperability between these areas.</p>
<p>API integration tools and services are proving to be a very critical area to the space, one that will help stabilize the world of APIs and balance out much of the inconsistency that developers face when building apps that span multiple API providers or even depend on aggregate APis.</p>
<p>This area of API evangelist is brand new and will be evolving as I continue my research. &nbsp;If you have tools or approaches to development of apps using APIs, please let me know. I'd love to hear more about how you approach integration. As with all of my projects, this is a continuous work in progress, so stay tuned.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Runscope" href="http://runscope.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/runscope/runscope-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The word "open" gets thrown around a lot in the API space. So much in fact, the term has lost just about any meaning. We don't say "open API" anymore, we identify an API as public, partner or private, evolving to a time where open APIs have merged with open source, and success means building community.</p>
<p>In 2013, successful application development centers around community, which includes not just a healthy selection of valuable, stable API resources, but also a strong assortment of open source tools and cloud services that are community driven, and benefit all.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/02/the-continuing-netflix-api-story/">strong example of this evolution can be seen in the Netflix ecosystem</a>, where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">a "public" API has been largely considered a failure</a>, but a strong API driven community of device vendors has flourished, as well as the release of a suite of open source API and cloud tooling from the online movie and TV streaming platform.</p>
<p>Another examples can be seen from the new <a title="Runscope" href="http://runscope.com/" target="_blank">API testing and integration provider Runscope</a>.  In addition to providing a suite of services for developers to use when developing API driven applications, Runscope also actively maintains four separate community projects:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Digest" href="http://apidigest.com">API Digest (apidigest.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="API Jobs" href="http://api-jobs.com">API Jobs (api-jobs.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="API Changelog" href="http://apichangelog.com">API Changelog (apichangelog.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="RequestBin" href="http://requestb.in">RequestBin (requestb.in)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>API Digest and API Jobs were pet projects of Runscope founder John Sheehan, prior to starting the company, but he has continued the same approach in a more formal manner, in which Sheehan calls the Runscope 'Community Projects' model, and adding API Changelog and most recently acquiring RequestBin.</p>
<p>All of these Runscope projects are "free-forever open to the community sites that I hope are valuable resources related to what we're doing", according to Sheehan. "our overriding philosophy for all this is this: the more tools the better. We obviously benefit from the links, etc. but the bigger picture is we're working in a nascent area of dev tools and we benefit more from general exposure to the ideas we're working on than trying to capture all the attention directly. Whatever we need to do to encourage devs to keep trying new ways to solve these problems, we're going to do it."</p>
<p>In addition to these core community projects at Runscope, they also sponsor four other open source software (OSS) projects, including <a title="LocalTunnel" href="http://localtunnel.com">localtunnel.com</a>, <a title="httpbin.org" href="http://httpbin.org">httpbin.org</a>, <a title="foauth.org" href="http://foauth.org">foauth.org</a>, and <a title="mocky.io" href="http://mocky.io">mocky.io</a>.  Sheehan says that, "some of these 'compete' with us, but we're more concerned with keeping them available".</p>
<p>Runscope's 'Community Project' model makes me happy. This approach is not just about providing paid services for developers who are building applications that use APIs, but truly providing the news, tools and other resources the space needs to be healthy.</p>
<p>Companies that are looking to provide APIs or API related services need to follow Runscope's lead, and evolve beyond just the concept of 'open API' or just 'open source', and adopt a community driven model where you acknowledge its not just about selling your services, but aso helping contribute the resources that will ensure the entire space is healthy and vibrant--a world where we all win!</p>

<p>Sentiment analysis and social media analytics API provider <a href="https://www.repustate.com/" target="_blank">Repustate</a> is providing a <a href="http://blog.repustate.com/provisioning-virtual-appliances-with-vagrant/2013/08/03/">virtualized, portable, on-premise version of its API</a>--adding a new twist to the concept of API deployment.</p>
<p>Using this new approach, Repustate is targeting the 5% of their user base who do not wish to transmit their data across the Internet, possibly because of legal or security concerns, and providing them with an on-premise version of their API, configured as a portable virtual appliance.</p>
<p>While the concept of on-premise vs cloud is nothing new, packaging up your API as a virtual appliance that can run anywhere is not that common.

<p>During my monitoring of the API space this week, I came across an interesting blog post from data platform <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/08/06/a-developers-smorgasbord/">showcasing the tools they provide for developers</a> who are putting their real-time data platform to use.</p>
<p>Splunk has an amazing smorgasbord of developer tools, but there are a handful that I feel need highlighting, so that other data API providers can consider as part of their own offerings:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI) -</strong> Monitor, configure and search Splunk via a terminal/shell interface or wrapping the commands in a shell script</li>
<li><strong>REST API -</strong> Most of the functionality in Splunk exposed as a suite of REST endpoints Software Development Kits (SDK) - Development kits for accelerating integration with the Splunk API in six different languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, C#</li>
<li><strong>Apps and Add-ons -</strong> Packaging up of the various configurations, searches, knowledge objects, UI components and customizations, inputs, role definitions, field extractions etc. that you might typically create via Splunk on the web</li>
<li>Scripted inputs - Out of the box, Splunk has simple generic input options available for getting data from a file or receiving data over TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Modular Inputs -</strong> Modular Inputs build upon Scripted Inputs by elevating the creation of custom input add-ons to first class citizen status in Splunk</li>
Custom search commands - Splunk&rsquo;s Search language is incredibly powerful and extensive for deriving a wide range of analytical insights from your indexed data
<li><strong>Custom alert scripts -</strong> Splunk alerting channels provided by defaults are Email and RSS. But let&rsquo;s say for example that you wanted to send alerts via SMS, to a Messaging Queue, as an SNMP or directly to a trouble ticket system</li>
<li><strong>Custom REST endpoints -</strong> Splunk&rsquo;s REST API is very thorough, but this can also be extended with your own custom REST endpoints that you could then integrate with programmatically</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously Splunk is a big data platform, so the idea of custom search and other building blocks, may not work for all API providers. Regardless this list provides some thought provoking implementations that other data API providers should look as part of their own roadmap.</p>
<p>Make sure and head over to the <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/08/06/a-developers-smorgasbord/">blog post that sparked this story,</a> they have other goodies like App Frameworks, and specific connectors for Apache, Spring, Flurry and a long-tail of API integration building blocks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-umbrella.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the smart people in Washington D.C. have decided to <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">roll their own API management solution</a>, providing their own open source solution to many of the common problems faced by API providers like issuing API keys, rate limit and provide analytics.</p>
<p>Available at <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">api.data.gov/about</a>, but powered by an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a>, the project aims to be a free and open API management option for federal agencies.</p>
<p>API Umbrella provides some of the most common aspects of API management:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>API Keys</li>
<li>Rate Limiting</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>The roadmap for API Umbrella is also interesting, looking to deliver:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Self-service web admin</li>
<li>Interactive documentation</li>
<li>User management</li>
<li>Granular permissions and rate limits</li>
</ul>
<p>While creating, yet another API management solution may not seem like the best idea at first, I can see why federal agencies would do it. Because of terms of use, costs and vendor lock-in with proprietary solutions, they are just seeking a simpler, cost effective alternative to solutions available in the private sector.</p>
<p>I'd love to see a blueprint established for the features available in API Umbrella, the current implementation for the gatekeeper is in Node.js and the web interface is in Ruby--it would be nice to have an open blueprint which would allow for others to contribute PHP, Python and other iterations of the same model. Providing a way for organizations to choose an option that fits with the resources they have available, while still providing interoperability.</p>
<p>It would also be great to see other city, county and state organizations adopt, deploy and evolve API Umbrella, providing a solution for other types of government organizations. I'm not intimate with the various needs of different types of government, but I'm sure there are some nuances that might make a difference.</p>
<p>As I ramp up my time working in DC this year I will spend more time getting intimate with <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a>, as well as other open data portal solutions like <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, and hopefully provide more resources on putting these solutions to use in the real world.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/08/02/securing-your-api-101/">Securing Your API 101</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-padlock.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a lot of questions from folks about the why, when and how of securing an API. And in keeping in sync with my audience, I wanted to provide a plain english story of securing your API, avoiding &nbsp;the often enterprise, service oriented architecture (SOA) jargon, which can confuse the situation for many who are just getting their feet wet.</p>
<p>So, you have created a basic API from your data or other resource, that returns XML or JSON for users--now you want to secure it. The reasons for securing your API will vary on a case by case basis. Your might be releasing data that you only want a handful of select people to access, or you might be looking to reduce the amount of server and bandwidth resources it takes to support an API, or you might just want to intimately understand who accesses an API and why and how they are using it. Or D) All The Above!</p>
<p>There are a handful of approaches to providing access to your API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Open</strong> - Just keeping your API wide open, accessible to anyone who has the URL. Obviously this isn't secured, but provides contrast for other options</li>
<li><strong>BasicAuth</strong> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic authentication</a> is a native part of HTTP and the Internet, which employs a username / password combination that is passed when accessing an API, which the server then authenticates allowing or denying access</li>
<li><strong>Key</strong> - Requiring an application or user key which is usually a combination of alpha and numeric characters, which is obtained by each developers through a API registration process, providing a unique access key for each consumer</li>
<li><strong>oAuth</strong> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oAuth</a> is an open authorization standard, that is usually employed when there is more sensitive, user specific data available via an API. oAuth is considered to be standard approach to securing API access, but increases the technical learning curve for API users</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also investigating <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/2013/07/29/an-alternative-to-required-api-keys">another approach that is an alternative to API keys</a>, which addresses the concerns around server and bandwidth overhead of open API access. Once I have more understanding, I will include as part of my educational materials.</p>
<p>If you are looking to just make sure you have some level of control over who accesses your API, a simple API key approach is recommended.  An API key limits who has access, while also giving you a way to track the ways each user is interacting with your API.  There are currently around <a title="20 API management providers" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">20 API management providers</a> who specialize in providing API key solutions for API providers, as well as oAuth and Basic Authentication options. If you are looking for more help on securing your API, reach out to these providers.</p>
<p>If you are deploying an API for the federal government in the United States, <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">there is also a new option from Data.gov,</a> which provides you with a solution to the most common needs of API providers including API keys, rate limiting and analytics. I'm still working on adding this solution to my API management resources, and will have more analysis in the future.</p>
<p>This post is meant to be a very simple, non-technical overview of securing your API. If you are looking to do this on a tight budget, I recommend looking at <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. They have a self-service, easy to implement process for getting going, but can also provide the support needed for scaling and evolving your solution.</p>
<p>When securing your API, make sure and remember that securing is not just about preventing unwanted access and abuse, but also provide you with insight into who and how developers and other users are accessing and using your data. This type of insight is critical to evolving your API strategy, so make sure you are not just securing, but also measuring and analyzing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://octopart.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/octoparts/octopart-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been an advocate for non-developers being one of the most important audiences for your API, since I started API Evangelist. I know us developers love to believe we are the primary force behind the success of APIs like Twitter--it is partially true, we are. But we also had the assistance of the power Twitter user in getting the good word out. Tech savvy journalists, marketing and other folks who get the platform, API, and value that lies within, while also possessing a large or very influential audience.</p>
<p>Another example of this dynamic I'm seeing unfold in slow motion is from web APIs that are driving the Excel spreadsheet. I've posted before about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/11/twitter-api-is-not-just-for-developers/">using Google Spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs</a>, and I just saw a another <a href="http://octopart.com/blog/archives/2013/7/octopart-in-excel">great example of using Microsoft Excel from the electronics parts provider Octoparts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://octopart.com/blog/archives/2013/7/octopart-in-excel"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/octoparts/octopart-excel.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Octoparts walks us through an API to Microsoft Excel solution, that has some pretty obvioius potential, by providing a direct connection between their product catalog to customers and partners via their API and an Excel spreadsheet.  The particular approach requires the usage of <a href="https://datanitro.com/">DataNitro</a>, a plugin for Excel that allow you to run Python functions within your spreadsheets. Once installed, you can import products using the Ocotoparts APIs, complete with functions for filtering by manufacture, SKU, price and other key catalog fields.</p>
<p>This is a pretty significant example of how APIs can be used by non-developers, and specifically power Excel users. I don't know about your experience, but pretty much every industry I've worked in, is being run by Excel wielding business and marketing power users. This isn't some small group of niche developers, this group of users represents the engine of business in our everyday world.</p>
<p>Think of the potential, when we educate these everyday users about APIs, then provide them with simple API usage examples, allowing them to access the valuable resources they need within an organization or externally from partners, government and other public sources of information.</p>
<p>Much like mobile has emerged as a focus area for API providers, I predict Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet connectors will become commonplace in API ecosystems. So make sure your products and other valuable corporate resources are accessible via API for the power spreadsheet users in your supply chain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2013</span>
        <p>This is my first blog post, following a very nice week, offline in Maine. I have purposely setup the API Evangelist network to be a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">mesh network of API research project nodes</a>, allowing anyone to to start from ground zero and work their way through the different aspects of the API universe.  The dirty little secret, is I set this up to benefit me first, then you, the reader.  After I get back to the world from time off, I'm very disoriented and I need a way to start over and work my way back through all of my projects.</p>
<p>Each time I pick my research up, I need to work my way through it, refresh my memory, and hopefully constantly realign my view of the universe, not just after vacations, but on a week to week basis. So this morning I started with the 100K view of providing APIs.</p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist, I acknowledged that the technology of APIs was being worked out, and the business of APIs was something that needed researching. Now in 2013, I'm seeing the same theme emerge around the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>This venn diagram is a rough, 100K view of what I consider to reflect a healthy strategy for an API provider. Depending on each company's goals, they may give more attention to any of these building blocks.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/technology-business-politics-apis.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>If you are coming from the enterprise you will see much of this as SOA governance, which I have spoken about in the past being the legacy inverse of API management, and will continue to articulate in future stories as I can.</p>
<p>Now that I'm warmed up with the 100K view of the API space, I'm ready to finish work on my API management, discovery and integration white papers I was working on before I left, as well as my weekly API monitoring and analysis.</p>

<p>Since 2010 I have had a page on this site dedicated to "API Management". In 2013 the API universe expanded, and I've broken my work in this area into three separate, open source API research projects.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Design</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Deployment</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Management</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm grouping these projects under a single umbrella, I'm now calling "<a title="providing APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/provide/">providing APIs</a>".  If you are a company or organization looking to provide API driven resources to partners, the public or even use them for internal operations, this section is for you.</p>
<p>I will be adding several other API research areas in the near future, including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Monetization</li>
<li>Evangelism</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Embeddable</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the projects you will find building blocks, companies, tools, news and analysis. All projects stick to my new <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, making sure my research is open, distributable and machine readable.</p>
