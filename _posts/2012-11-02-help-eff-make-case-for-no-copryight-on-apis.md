The [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) needs our help][1] to explain to the Federal Circuit Court on why there should **NOT** be copyrights on APIs. As EFF published today:

> _Earlier this year, we applauded District Court Judge Alsup for getting it right and holding that, as a matter of law, one could not copyright APIs. The case, Oracle v. Google, is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a three-judge panel is going to revisit Judge Alsup’s ruling._

The EFF is soliciting the our assistance in how to help build the case, asking for feedback on two example areas:

  1. Software reimplementing someone else’s API, calling someone else’s API, or any other uses of third-party APIs for interoperability, competition, or innovation.
  2. Reimplementation of an API, where the resulting software benefitted the original API creator, perhaps by increasing the creator’s user base or otherwise benefitted the developer community

I think we are in the infancy of API deployment, so it’s going to be tough to find many solid examples.  But I think the two areas we can demonstrate the importance of no copyright on APIs, is within two business sectors that evolved on the web, using APIs and are critical to business and government today:

  * **Cloud** \- As EFF said, Eucalyptus reimplemented the Amazon API to offer a competing cloud storage service. You also saw the same with [first implementation of Google Developer Storage][2] and up to
