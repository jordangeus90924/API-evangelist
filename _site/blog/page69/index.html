        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/google-docs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />Google Docs is a free, Web-based word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, form, and data storage service from Google. It allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating in real-time with other users.<p></p>
Google provides a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/documents/">RESTful document list API</a> that uses either AuthSub or oAuth authentication.  The API provides read/write methods for adding documents and folders and allows the management of ACL, revisions, and Meta data.  Google provides 5 language software development kits including Java, .NET, and PHP.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/10/12/google-apps-supports-oauth/">Google Apps Supports OAuth</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2010</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/OAuth.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> recently began supporting OAuth authorization when connecting to the <a href="http://code.google.com/googleapps">Google Apps API</a>.<p></p>
OAuth will make integration with the Google Apps platform much more secure by not requiring administrators to share their username and password with third party applications.<p></p>
The advantages to using OAuth are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>OAuth is more secure: OAuth tokens can be scoped and set to expire by a certain date, making them more secure than using the ClientLogin mechanism.</li>
	<li>OAuth is customizable: Using OAuth, you can create tokens that scripts may only use to access data of a particular scope when calling Google Apps APIs. For instance, a token set to call the Email Migration API would not be able to use your login credentials to access the Google Apps Provisioning API.</li>
	<li>OAuth is an open standard: OAuth is an open source standard, making it a familiar choice for developers to work with.</li>
</ul>
The Google Apps API services that support OAuth are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Provisioning API</li>
	<li>Email Migration API</li>
	<li>Admin Settings API</li>
	<li>Calendar Resource API</li>
	<li>Email Settings API</li>
	<li>Audit API</li>
</ul>
OAuth for authentication is more accepted by developers, and it makes many IT administrators much more comfortable with allowing third party integration with their Google Apps Premier, Education and Government editions.<p></p>
To learn more about the OAuth standard, visit <a href="http://oauth.net">http://oauth.net</a>.

        <span class="post-date">09 Oct 2010</span>
        There are a lot of things I weigh when deciding to write about a company:  is the product interesting, is the technology innovative, is the company's story compelling.  Some days, it's "news" when a very small feature change occurs at a very big company.  And some days, it's "news" when very big things are afoot at very small companies.<p></p>
Most days, it's not quite so clear cut as that, and I have to wade through hundreds of email pitches in order to decide which stories to tell.  And as I do my research and conduct my product reviews and my phone briefings, one of the things I look for is an API.<p></p>
Although yes, I want to hear that your product has traction.  I want to see that customers and investors like you.  I want to hear about the problem your company addresses, the technology you've developed, your business model, your background, your domain expertise.<p></p>
But I also want to hear about your API.  Why?
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>An API demonstrates you recognize your product does not exist in a vacuum.  You are not simply concerned with how you interact with your customer, but how your product interacts with others your customer utilizes</li>
	<li>Having an API points to a business development strategy that relies not just on marketing to these customers but on cultivating business partnerships.  Having an API is, as <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> co-founder Caterina Fake argues, "<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a>."</li>
	<li>A quick look via the link on your website to your API (you do have a link to your API, right?) can give a sense of the strength of your developer community.  Do you make it easy and desirable for other developers and companies to use your API?</li>
</ol>
I don't expect every company, particularly startups, to have a robust API upon launch.  But I will often ask what the company's plans for an API entail.  It's a question that gives me a glimpse into potential partnerships, data portability, mobile strategies, and platform and ecosystem development, for example.  And it's a question that can reveal a company's vision -- or lack thereof -- about where it sees itself, its services, its partners, and its developers.

        <span class="post-date">09 Oct 2010</span>
        The ability to explain your API to developers and potential developers critical to the success of your API.  While it's important to be able to explain to potential business partners and customers about the problems your API solves, at the end of the day it is crucial that you be able to provide them with the tools -- and the documentation -- to actually do it.<p></p>
The importance of documentation -- samples, training materials, guides, docs -- can't be understated.  Quality <a href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php" target="_blank">documentation and reference material for your Application Programming Interface</a> (API) can be the difference between a developer adopting your API or moving on to another vendor.  And yet these can be difficult documents to collect and/or to write.<p></p>
<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="SDK Bridge" src="http://sdkbridge.com/images/ui/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php" target="_blank">SDK Bridge</a> is a company that specializes in explaining technology through documentation and software development kits.  It provides a variety of API-related services including:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Documentation</li>
	<li>Sample code and tutorials</li>
	<li>Highly technical copywriting</li>
	<li>Training sessions on how to use software platforms</li>
	<li>Technology classes for youth</li>
</ul>
These services can be a critical piece of delivering your API.  SDK Bridge says that it is a <strong><em>bridge between people and technology</em></strong>.  So very true.<p></p>
<a href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php" target="_blank">SDK Bridge</a> provides a set of services that any business looking to deliver an API should evaluate.  Even though you many be able to generate your own marketing materials, SDK and other supporting API documents, you may find more value bring in an outside perspective to make sure you explain how your API solves problems, adds value, and can be successfully integrated to customers systems.

        <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2010</span>
        Salesforce is gearing up for the <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2010/10/rest-api-programmableweb-and-curl.html">upcoming release of their REST API</a> on October 26, with a <a href="https://www.developerforce.com/events/rest_developer_preview/registration.php?d=70130000000FV4U">REST API Developer Preview Webinar</a>.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://www.developerforce.com/assets/developerforcesite/developerforce_home/images/developerforce_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
The release of the a RESTful API for the <a href="http://developer.force.com/">developerforce platform</a> is a major sign of upcoming growth for the cloud computing platform.<p></p>
REST APIs enjoy lmuch larger acceptance in the developer community compared to SOAP APIs.  SOAP is a favorite amongst the enterprise and hard-core development communities, but REST is easier to understand and have lower barriers of entry for more web 2.0 oriented programmers.<p></p>
As cloud computing is gaining acceptance with the masses, and the smoke is clearing around how to actually make the cloud work,  SalesForce is making a major move to woo more businesses and developers to their platform.<p></p>
I think this is just a first of many moves by the proven cloud platform to not only defend their position as the leader in Platform as a Service, but grow significantly in the next couple of years.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/boxnet-review/">Box.net Review</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2010</span>
        </div>
Online storage and collaboration tool <a href="http://www.box.net&gt;Box.net&gt;/a&gt; offers a robust API for file management, as well as an &lt;a href=">OpenBox Developer</a> area for those working with the API.<p></p>
The developer area offers the following pieces:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Introduction to OpenBox Actions</li>
	<li>Getting Started Guide for API</li>
	<li>Easy Signup</li>
	<li>Project Setup Page</li>
</ul>
And Box.net provides several flavors to its API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li> REST</li>
	<li> SOAP</li>
	<li> XML-RPC</li>
</ul>
It also provide ssome some great code samples and libraries in all the top programming languages.<p></p>
There is a list of of all the API functions on the left hand menu, broken down into categories:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Authentication</li>
	<li>File and Folder Operations</li>
	<li>Sharing</li>
	<li>Tagging</li>
	<li>Commenting</li>
	<li>Download and Upload</li>
</ul>
Box.net supports its API with a developer blog and also provides an email address to contact Box.net directly.<p></p>
There is also a mobile API offering.<p></p>
While I think Box.net offers a solid API, the API developer community or ecosystem is lacking.  Its pretty evident the API came solely out of the Box.net development team.<p></p>
The API community lacks consistency and seems to be spread between developers.box.net and box.net/developers.  The overall approach lacks community and even has some broken links.<p></p>
Box.net talks about some partners and API implementations on its blog, but doesn't showcase its developers or partners.   In some ways this makes the API look like an after thought, and could give people pause before integrating it as they might fear they won't get much attention as part of the community..<p></p>
Without actual experience in integration of course, this is all speculation.  Although I think this reflects a common approach to delivering an API.  Companies come out with a strong product, but without a solid business, marketing and management approach it can prompt people to explore other API solutions.

        <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2010</span>
        Several years ago, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase "<a href="http://caterina.net/archive/000996.html">Biz Dev 2.0</a>" in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached FLickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to "feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API."<p></p>
"Biz Dev 2.0," she called it.<p></p>
Fake describes the traditional sorts of business development processes -- "spending a lot of money on dry cleaning, animating your powerpoint, drinking stale coffee in windowless conference rooms and scouring the thesaurus looking for synonyms for "synergy". Not to mention trying to get hopelessly overbooked people to return your email. And then after the deal was done, squabbling over who dealt with the customer service."<p></p>
While a Web 1.0 world made partnerships and integration challenging, a Web 2.0 world has the advantage of the API, something that removes many of the bureaucratic, legal, and technical obstacles.<p></p>
So by developing and marketing your API, your company can take advantage of new technologies and new business development practices.

        One of the keys to YouTube's success as a video sharing platform is its successful API that allows developers and site owners to embed, share and distribute YouTube content across the Intertubes.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Youtube-Google-Code-Screenshot.PNG" alt="" width="375" align="right" />
As with many of its other products, Google starts with the essential API ecosystem building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Dashboard</li>
	<li>Quickstart</li>
	<li>Docs</li>
	<li>Sample Code</li>
	<li>Forum</li>
	<li>Articles</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
</ul>
In addition, YouTube really support its partner and developers with:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Partners Showcase</li>
	<li>App Gallery</li>
	<li>Widgets</li>
	<li>White Label Player</li>
</ul>
Google also enforces brand integrity with a few tools:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Branding Guidelines</li>
	<li>Compatibility</li>
	<li>Terms</li>
</ul>
Google definitely has a solid formula for replicating its API ecosystems in its different products, and the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html">YouTube developer area</a> is an excellent example of this formula being applied to a media API.<p></p>
Like Google's other projects, YouTube utilizes <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> as the repository for its API community and code.

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2010</span>
        Change happens.  With technology, change seems to be accelerating, or at least the waves of change seem to come more frequently.<p></p>
I feel I've developed a certain rhythm for riding these waves.   Part of this rhythm is a regular evaluation of where I stand, a sort of agile career methodology.  I'm in one of those evaluation periods right now.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/waves.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="right" />
What wave is next?<p></p>
In January 2007 I found myself jumping on the social media wave, in which I still ride to some degree.<p></p>
In Spring of 2008 I found myself jumping on the cloud computing wave, in which I'm still totally drowning in.<p></p>
What wave is next?  Mobile?  Big Data?  Semantics?<p></p>
There are many things I consider when evaluating what I will focus my attention on.  I want to make sure I will be investing in learning that will benefit my professional development.<p></p>
One thing I look for are constants within all the waves I ride.  One constant I've seen between Social media and Cloud Computing are APIs.  If you take a deeper look:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Social Media</strong> - YouTube API and Flickr API are at the heart of the social media movement.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Networking </strong>- Facebook API Platform and the Twitter API play a big part in the growth and adoption of social networking.</li>
	<li><strong>Cloud Computing</strong> - The two undisputed kings of cloud computing,  Amazon Web Services and Google both depend on API to deliver their services</li>
</ul>
APIs are playing a monumental role in delivering the Internet today.  What is next?
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - APIs make mobile applications possible and help drive innovation in the mobile space.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Data</strong> - APIs allow data to be gathered, shared, and available for visualizations and mashups.</li>
	<li><strong>Semantics</strong> - APIs will drive discovery and meaning around links, documents, and other objects.</li>
</ul>
Pick most any area of business today and you can see APIs either driving or emerging as a major player within that industry.<p></p>
Change is upon me again, whatever the next wave is, I feel I'm secure in focusing on APIs.<p></p>
I am leaving a position as a Director of Technology with a focus on cloud computing to a position as an API Evangelist and with a focus on the business of APIs.<p></p>
This is where I feel future of cloud computing is, as well as many other sectors of our society, throughout business, education, government and much more.<p></p>
Change is exciting.  More to come.

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2010</span>
        As a journalist, I get a lot of pitches from startups trying to convince me to write about their product or service.  And I also attend a lot of pitch events, where entrepreneurs try to convince a panel of judges (typically investors) to write them a check.  Often there are a lot of missing pieces in these pitches -- no compelling technology, no compelling market, no compelling story, and most damning, no actual product.<p></p>
Sure. You can have slides.  You can boast about how awesome your product will be.  You can talk, talk, talk.<p></p>
Or, you can actually show it off, show how it works.  And I do mean, literally, how it works, by coding your way through a demo.<p></p>
And this is what John Britton, <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>'s developer evangelist, does in this video, taken at a NY Tech Meetup.  In it, he not only makes the case for the Twilio product -- the Twilio API integrates phone and message actions into your app.  But by coding the demo live onstage, Britton also makes the case for and to the developer community, which is particularly important for having a vibrant and robust API.<p></p>

        The <a href="http://code.flickr.com&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; for the online photo and video sharing service &lt;a href=">Flickr</a> provides a way for new tools to be built and for Flickr content to be uploaded or shared.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Flickr-Code-Screenshot.PNG" alt="" width="375" align="right" />
Flickr offers a solid API with very traditional building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Overview</li>
	<li>Account Manager</li>
	<li>App Manager</li>
	<li>API / SDK Kits</li>
	<li>Email Listserve</li>
</ul>
Recently Flickr evolved its API area (App Garden) and took a more ecosystem approach by creating <a href="code.flickr.com">code.flickr.com</a> by bringing together several old and new building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Dashboard</li>
	<li>Forums (3 separate forums: API Forum, Hacking Uploadr, and Yahoo Forum)</li>
	<li>Developer Feature</li>
	<li>Developer Blog</li>
Jobs Listing (For Flickr, not for ecoystem)</ul>
Flickr's API is a solid example of a simple, yet successful RESTful approach to an API.  A very early mover in building an API, Flickr's offerings may be missing many of the more sophisticated API building blocks we are seeing with the new generation of APIs.    Nevertheless, you can't argue with success.   I believe Flickr's dead simple approach to solving one problem -- photo sharing -- has helped the company deliver a successful API even without a robust API ecosystem.
