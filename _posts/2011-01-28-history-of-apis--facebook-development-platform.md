On August 15th 2006, [Facebook launched its long-awaited development platform][1] and API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Developer.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Version 1.0 of the [Facebook Development Platform][2] allowed developers access to Facebook friends, photos, events, and profile information for [Facebook][3].

The [API][4] used a [Restful][5] protocol and responses were in an [XML][6] format.

Almost immediately, developers began to build social applications, games, and mashups with the new development tools.

The Facebook Development Platform gave Facebook an edge over then popular competitor [MySpace][7], and established itself as the top social gaming platform with games like [Farmville][8].
