<p>One of the <a href="http://api.report/2014/10/07/hacker-news-launches-official-api/">API news story of the day was the release of the Hacker News API</a>. I&rsquo;m only lightly interested in the fact that HN now has an API because, honestly I don't feel like an API at this point in the evolution of tech curation site is something to applaud, but their approach to making their API real-time I think does subtly reflect other currents in the API space.
<p>HN partnered with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> to make sure the tech news curation site doesn't just have an API, it has a real-time API. Meaning you can now get HN links in machine readable way, so that you can build the popular flow of tech information into other web, and mobile applications&mdash;in real-time! HN launching an API&hellip;yawn! HN launch an API with Firebase bkked in, reflects a growing trend from influential APIs. For me this is more about real-time and Firebase, than it is about HN.
<p>You see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">other API providers like Nest from Google baking in real-time frameworks into their APIs</a>. Real-time isn&rsquo;t something every type of API should be considering as a default feature, but there are definitely areas where the real-time flow of data is not just a nice to have, it is essential to demonstrating the value of APIs. In my experience, I would say that there are several sectors like news, financial, Internet of Things where I'm seeing real-time being present as a fundamental ingredient for the API platform--something I will be keeping an eye on.
<p>As I said before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">some of the trends I&rsquo;m tracking on are quickly moving from trend to being baked into APIs</a>, going beyond just the release of web APis, and adding additional layers that developers are demanding to deliver the features their end-users are demanding.

<p>I've been a big proponent of APIs in the federal government, and it makes me really happy to see <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> using <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/api.json">APIs.json to provide an inventory of APIs available at the federal agency</a> dedicated to strengthening "the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements".
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, it is the open format that <a href="https://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist are working on to help make APIs discoverable. You can see APIs.json in action at the <a href="http://apis.io">open source API search engine APIs.io</a>, where the <a href="https://trade.gov/">International Trade Administration (ITA)</a> has submitted their APIs.json file for inclusion. ITA is the first of many federal agencies I will get to adopt the APIs.json format, and help make their valuable API resources much more discoverable, and ultimately more consumable.
<p>Can you imagine a future where <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all global trade</span> is machine readable by default, and there are millions of simple, discoverable APIs available to help stimulate, as well as regulate industry? A future where the Department of Commerce and other relevant agencies are at the center, with the highest quality APIs you can imagine, and the healthiest outreach to not just industry, but also individual business owners.
<p>Trade.gov&rsquo;s impressive entry into the world of APIs with <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.gov</a>, their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">quick responses to feedback</a>, and the publishing of an APIs.json file for the agency, makes me optimistic for this vision of the API economy. If our federal government can do it, then I think industries can follow the lead, ensure that the future of trade and commerce is more real-time, transparent, and accessible to everyone.

<p>title: ‘I Updated My APIs To Use Swagger 2.0’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I spent some time this weekend updating a handful of my APIs to the new <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0 API definition format</a>. I was already using an older version of Swagger, so the migration wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. I have about five new APIs I want to roll out over the next couple weeks, and I wanted them to up to date, using the latest version, so moving forward my knowledge using my existing APIs was the best way to prepare.
<p>I moved forward the five "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>", as I call them, analysis, APIs, building blocks, curated, and tools, to all use Swagger 2.0. These APIs provide access to my monitoring system I use to keep track of the space. I also migrated two of my "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a>", i<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">mage manipulation</a>, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture</a>, which are designed to be general purpose, utility APIs &nbsp;I use across my platform.
<p>To support the migration I wrote a Swagger manager for my API monitoring system, which I use to track on 2794 APIs, from 3215 companies, which API Evangelist is one of these companies. Using this new tool I imported my old Swagger 1.2 versions, and after a little touching up in my new editor, I published brand spank&rsquo;n new Swagger 2.0 definitions for all seven my APIs.
<p>The process reminded me of how API definitions really can help you describe, see, understand and ultimately communicate the API surface area you posses. I&rsquo;m going to take this and apply it to a couple of business sectors I&rsquo;m tracking on as part of my API Stack, and see what the process does for me there. After that I&rsquo;m going to get to work on the next five APIs I&rsquo;m designing, and see how Swagger 2.0 contributes to my design of brand new APIs, as well as later on in the life cycle.
<p>I'm using my Swagger API definitions as a central truth for driving server side code, and my documentation. I&rsquo;m eager to continue exploring how it can further generate my client side code libraries, as well as SDKs, and help me better test, and monitor my APIs. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll perfectly automate every step in the API life cycle with Swagger, but it damn sure is making some of the steps much less painful, and following a central design truth, that in this case is a simple Swagger JSON file that I keep in a library, pushing forward my catalog of API resources, at the same time I push forward my own understand of what is possible.

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/HP-large.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/business/hewlett-packard-announces-breakup-plan.html?_r=0"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/HP-large.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>As I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/business/hewlett-packard-announces-breakup-plan.html?_r=0">hear stories of the HP separation today</a>, I'm reminded of how companies of all shapes and sizes interact, both historically, and in this potentially new API driven business landscape we find ourselves in. I&rsquo;m not an expert in running any size company, but this won&rsquo;t stop me from being a pundit on the subject! ;-)
<p>The HP story brought me back to a conversation I was having the other day with a VC, regarding what is next for Apigee, and when I said IPO, the VC asked me if maybe SAP would buy them. I know that SAP and Apigee are partnering, but honestly I don't know jack about Apigee&rsquo;s business model, or even SAP, so I really don't have a clue what is next, I can only guess.
<p>The conversation did prompt me to create this Evernote (birth of any API Evangelist blog post), helping me flush out some of my thoughts on how companies could potentially work together in an API driven business environment. I know that one way that big companies get the talent and market share they need is through the acquisition of smaller companies, something that has worked well for some time. However, another aspect to this history that only rarely gets discussed, is how many people, and brands just disappear into these acquisitions&mdash;never to be seen or heard from again (until their next start-up of course).
<p>I&rsquo;m not inferring that big companies shouldn't acquire little companies. The point I'd like to make, is that maybe larger companies should consider how they could be a little more interoperable, and achieve numerous loosely couple relationships, versus always just acquiring a company. You never know, you maybe get all of the benefits of a relationship, without the negative of bringing a start-up in house only to see it chewed up by your internal bureaucracy&mdash;you know it happens!
<p>I see plenty of large multinational corporations working through subsidiaries, shell companies, and other incarnations to move money around and avoid tax burden, you'd think it would make sense from an efficiency, agility, and cost saving standpoint as well. I know many companies are being built, exclusively for acquisition, but when they are going something very well in the space, generating value &ldquo;as a start-up&rdquo;, why do you want to throw a wet blanket on that? There are other ways to invest, and engage with these start-ups to benefit from the exhaust they generate.
<p>Anyways, I guess I made my point. I just personally feel that the way we work as individuals is forever changing because of the Internet, and I can't help but think the era of bigcos will begin to fade, and the companies that succeed will learn to be leaner, and develop the loosely couple partnerships they need from companies, to be successful, and yes sometimes this requires investment, but doesn&rsquo;t have to involve full blow acquisitions.
<p>Who knows, I could be high on my own farts here, but I think divorces, mergers, and acquisitions will look very different in the API economy.

<p>title: ‘Taking A Fresh Look At What Open Source API Management Architecture Is Available’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-open.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">outspoken advocate for more open source API management tooling</a>, for some time now. I'm sensitive to the fact that startups have to make money in the API space, but in my opinion a certain layer of the API space needs to remain open and interoperable for this all to work, and I feel that open source tools are an important variable in this equation. When I last checked into what was available in the space, there really wasn't much, so in 2014 I figured I'd take another look.
<p>Originally there is just one player on the space who was completely open source, and that is WSO2:
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://wso2.com/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/wso2-logo-white-800X360.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>
<td>API management is just one tool in the massive open source catalog that WSO2 brings to the table. The company provides a number of open source tools including identity &amp; authentication, ESB, data  and <a href="http://wso2.com/">API management solutions</a>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>WSO2 is the shining open source example in the space currently, and <a href="http://www.liljeholmensstadshotell.se/">I was very happy to see them emerge on the landscape</a>. I feel WSO2 plays a strong role in the API space, but their approach to open source is the enterprise version, where the open gets rid of software licensing cost (yay), but is targeted specifically at an enterprise audience. I&rsquo;m not the enterprise, so to compliment what they bring to the table, I&rsquo;m also looking for a different version of &ldquo;community&rdquo;, and eager to see smaller players step up as well.
<p>After WSO2 I got a taste of open source from Alcatel Lucent, with their release of API Grove, which was a whole other definition of open source:
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://apigrove.net/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/alcatel-lucent/apigrove/apigrove-logo.png" alt="" width="75" align="center" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apigrove.net/">API Grove</a> was open sourced late in 2012 by Alcatel Lucent, holding some promise that another strong enterprise open source player would step up, but within months it would be clear that it was not a live open source offering, but Alcatel abandoning their API program, and publishing as open source to get the press release.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I&rsquo;d call API Grove, enterprise fire sale open source, and while the code is out there (I think), there is nobody home, not an enterprise, or other community to be seen. This type of open source releases just make me sad.
<p>After WSO2 and API Grove, the only other player that saw emerg on the scene was ApiAxle:
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://apiaxle.com/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/api-axle-logo-3.png" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apiaxle.com/">ApiAxle is an proxy</a> that sits on your network, in front of API(s)and and provides common API management features like rate limiting, authentication and caching. ApiAxle was recently purchase by application platform infrastructure provider Exicon.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>ApiAxle has been on my list for a couple years now, and was recently purchased by <a href="http://www.exiconglobal.com/">Exicon</a>. The site is pretty good looking, but I can't tell if there is any activity in the community recently. The blog is silent, but the site was updated a few days ago, and the Github repo for the project was last updated July 31st&mdash;it can be hard to tell sometimes, just how active an open source project is.
<p>Beyond ApiAxle, there are two API management pioneers who been hard at work releasing open source tooling:
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">

<td>3Scale is one of the original API infrastructure providers, and has developed an <a href="https://www.3scale.net/api-management/api-proxy-for-api-traffic-management-by-3scale/">open source API proxy using the NGINX Web Server</a>, designed to work independently, but also be able to take advantage of freemium 3Scale API analytics, billing, etc.</td>

<p>It can be hard to envision exactly how open source fits into 3Scale or Apigee&rsquo;s business model, but as the core features of API management become more commoditized, I can't help but think that open source tooling will increasingly be a reality on the front-line for these API infrastructure providers.
<p>After these projects from leading API management providers, I hadn't see any other open source API management tooling until I started to look closer at APIs in the public sector:
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">

<td><a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> has been providing API and open data management tools to government of all shapes and sizes for some time now, and along the way is open sourcing many of its tools including an <a href="http://www.socrata.com/products/open-data-portal/">open source developer portal</a> that anyone can use to management their API.</td>

<td><a href="https://nrel.github.io/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a> was born out of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to manage their own APIs, but then has evolved to be used by other agences, as well as being adopted by central data.gov efforts within the federal government.&nbsp;<span>API Umbrella is a proxy that sits in front of your APIs. It can seamlessly add common functionality like api keys, rate limiting, and analytics to any API.</span></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think what is happening in the public sector API space, reflects what the private sector is needing as well, in regards to open, interoperability, and the room to play, experiment and figure things out before you have to start putting to much cash on the line.  I just think the government is in more of a position to mandate this, where in the public sector freemium solutions from 3Scale have been a buffer for this demand, but as the space expands I think open source tooling will begin to evolve to provide further relief valves.
<p>In doing this research, what has really caught my attention, is the number of new players that are picking up momentum in 2014:
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">

</table>
<p>Overall I think these new players reflect the maturation of the space, but beyond that I'm not sure what it means for the API world, it will take some time for me to work through what features are being offered, and what business models exist around these open tools. In my experience, the motivations behind open source mean everything, and the relationship a open source project has to their parent company can make or break the momentum any open source project will possess--setting the tone for any community, enteprise or otherwise.
<p>Eventually I'll bring together the open source tools I've found in the API management layer, with the open source design tooling I'm seeing from Apiary and Swagger, and other <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API design providers</a>, as well as the wealth of tooling I'm seeing for <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a>&mdash;still playing catch up on the roundup here. When I squint my eyes, and think about the space, I can't help but feel that we are getting closer to my earlier vision of open source in the API space, but we still have a lot of work to do.
<p>What else am I msising from the pool of open source API management tooling? I depend on my audience letting me know what they are using.
<p><em>P.S. I know I'm going to get an email from Mulesoft on the piece, I&rsquo;m sure you guys fit in here somewhere, but honestly I spent about 2 hours looking through your stuff, and I can&rsquo;t figure out just exactly what version of open source you guys are. I understand the <a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/">Mule ESB is open source</a>, which isn't squarely in my API management category, and after that I really can't tell with the other open tooling you guys have&mdash;feel free to post a blog post response, helping me, and the community understand better.</em>

<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com/index.html">home page of API Evangelist</a> has always been my API 101 page, where any new visitor can land, not know a thing about APIs, read the page, and walk away understanding at least what an API is, and hopefully also a greater understanding of how it impacts their world. From the beginning the API Evangelist home page always had a lean toward API providers, and over time I've added information about consuming APIs, as well as trends in the API space I'm seeing.
<p>In my opinion my 101 content has become too lengthy, and not properly onboarding people to the multiple areas of APIs like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/provide/">providing APIs</a> vs <a href="http://apievangelist.com/consume/">consuming APIs</a>. I think it is time to overhaul my 101 section, and produce some newer, more relevant API 101 content for 2014. To support this, I'm working on a series of 15 API 101 segments, with each one having a story version, as well as a slideshow edition, complete with audio.&nbsp;
<p>I finished the first one, which is my 100K view, API 101 introduction. I'm still working on the slideshow version. Once I'm done I"ll move on to providing APIs, and as I finish each one I'll hang on the homepage, as well as publish out via the blog, and Twitterz.

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elastic-path-logo-2014.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving my <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/">hypermedia API research</a> a little love today, and as part of this I was reviewing examples of hypermedia in the wild like with the <a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/hypermedia-api">Elastic Path Cortex API</a>. Elastic Path was the first company to introduce me to the possibilities around hypermedia way back in 2011, so I enjoy checking in regularly to see what they are up to with their APIs.
<p>As of January 2014 <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">I&rsquo;ve committed more time to doing research on hypermedia APIs</a>, as well as work to tell stories about how hypermedia is being applied by companies, in a way that anyone can understand. This last summer at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/28/video-from-the-hypermedia-panel-at-apicraft-in-detroit-last-month/">API-Craft in Detroit, the hypermedia community acknowledged</a> that they have an image problem, and had some significant work ahead of them when it comes to storytelling, specifically around speaking to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;.
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t 100% speak hypermedia-eze, but I know with some practice I can get better at translating. I also know that some of the hypermedia folks aren&rsquo;t so good at speaking plain english to normal people, but with some practice I htink they will also get better. To help me in my jouney I figured I&rsquo;d translate what Elastic Path has written on their Cortex API page, but first I want to acknowledge the image they have--which is the first sophisticated hypermedia visual I&rsquo;ve seen, and I want to work on creating more like it.
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/hypermedia-api"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elastic-path-developer-cortex-diagram-2.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get on with the translation from hypermedia-eze to plain english. Elastic Path starts with:
<blockquote><em>Cortex is a mediation layer that uses patent-pending dynamic linking technology to discover and assemble resources from multiple business platforms into one consistent interface. Data and services from enterprise applications like Commerce Engine, Adobe&reg; Experience Manager, OpenText&reg; CEM, and others are mapped to Cortex using a lightweight schema. Once abstracted, these resources &mdash; from any source &mdash; are linked together to generate Cortex Business APIs that securely project your unified services to the world.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation: </strong>Cortex brings together all your information, no matter where it resides, into a single, consistent API that you can then securely share with anyone you desire.
<blockquote><em>Cortex mediation completely decouples client applications from business platforms, yet enhances their ability to securely retrieve data and perform transactions. This breakthrough hyper media approach gives designers, developers, and API consumers the unprecedented freedom they need to create unique digital experiences &mdash; from mobile apps to Internet Retailer&reg; Top 500 websites &mdash; that engage customers and create business value.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Cortex understands that you are delivering information to a wide assortment of web, mobile and tablet devices in 2014, and Cortex handles the heavy load, abstracting away the complexity for API developers, allowing them deliver more meaningful experiences for end-users, agnostic of any platform they use.
<blockquote><em>A hypermedia API means self-serve e-commerce.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> A hypermedia API means self-serve e-commerce.
<blockquote><em>Unified services from your application portfolio are exposed via Cortex Business APIs, a set of highly scalable REST interfaces that conform rigorously to the HATEOAS constraint and Level 3 of the Richardson Maturity Model. This means that client applications can securely access enterprise data and perform authorized operations using only the hypermedia controls generated by the mediation layer. No deeper knowledge of your business platforms is required &mdash; so the tyranny of constant integration work ends with Cortex. It's simply the best API for ecommerce platforms.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation: </strong>Similar to understanding all of the devices you will be delivering information to, Cortex understand which users are accessing your information, and securely delivers only the information they have access to, and enables them to only take the actions they have afforded to them, again abstracting away the complexity of business operations for developers.
<p>My translations may not be perfect, but in short, because the they employ hypermedia design patterns, the Cortex API can more intelligently consider which internal, or external systems your information is being pulled from, while also understanding the context of the end-user who will be accessing this information, both who they are, and what device(s) they are using, potentially handling all of this logic for developers, leaving them to do what they do best.
<p>You see, APIs have been abstracting away the complexity of back-end system for a while now, but hypermedia has the potential to abstract away a couple more of the key  layers for developers--who the user is, and what device (channel) they are engaging upon. When done right, this has the potential to make the delivery of digital resources via APIs, to any number of online channels much more streamlined and efficient for everyone involved.
<p>Of course, even though all of this is a reality with Elastic Path right now, we have huge hurdles to jump in helping resource owners, and application developers understand the benefits hypermedia can bring to their operations, and this is why I'm honing my hypermedia translation and storytelling skills so I can help be a conduit in these ongoing discussions.

<p>As the popularity of APIs rapidly increases, I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets play a growing role in both providing APIs, as well as consuming APIs. On the road to #APIStrat Chicago I came across a company who has a pretty dead-simple approach to using spreadsheets to drive data via APIs, called <a href="https://www.dataeverywhere.com/">Data Everywhere</a>.
<p>Data Everywhere describes their service:
<blockquote><em>Select the cells in your existing spreadsheet and click publish. Your data will be instantly available in other spreadsheets. Our REST API makes your data available in databases, phones, websites, and other applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>Whether we want to admit it or not, most of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and providing dead simple tools to liberate this data via APIs are a very logical solution. We aren't just talking about taking an entire spreadsheet and turning it into an API with <a href="https://www.dataeverywhere.com/">Data Everywhere</a>, we are seamlessly making data available from spreadsheets via API, leaving the existing workflow in tact.
<p>Educating the &ldquo;every day &ldquo; spreadsheet user of the importance of APIs in making their work interoperable, and accessible in web and mobile is definitely a priority for me in the coming years. I feel like this education process will continue to be an important layer to my evangelism work for many years to come.
<p><strong>P.S. </strong>Thank you to Data Everywhere for helping moderate the data session at @APIStrat!

<p>I spend many of my days talking to startups, SMB, SME, larger enterprise, institutions, and federal government folk about APIs&mdash;if you haven&rsquo;t heard, its what I do. I&rsquo;ve become the sort of counselor for the world of APIs, sometimes just listening, but often times giving advice, and sharing random thoughts with a wide variety of characters, who are looking to understand the world of APIs.
<p>One pattern I've been consistently seeing across many of these API sessions, is that questions around internal API strategy are trumping any external or public API questions. These usually discussions start with questions of API design, deployment and management, but then often times move to strategies around internal evangelism, and incentivizing the usage of APIs in general, not just consuming your own internal APIs. Many are recognizing that the path towards being a healthy API provider, involves also being a healthy API consumer&mdash;a sort of yin yang of APIs.
<p>I&rsquo;m realizing that for many of these folks that I speak with, the challenge of selling the concept of APIs internally is often a bigger, and more daunting challenge than designing, developing, managing, and evangelizing an API to partners, or even the public. I think we are underestimating the challenge our friends at larger organizations are facing when they try to get the resources they need to be successful within their own work, let alone also contribute to the overall success of their company, agency, or organization.
<p>I&rsquo;m finding that many of these conversations only occur because I do not have anything to sell them. Many of the people I talk to are starved for an educated, outside perspective, even before any desire to understand, and learning about the larger API space. If you are an API service provider in the space, this is a layer of the API economy you need to help me with. How do we onboard these folks as they come into the space, and equip them with the tools, information, and yes the services they will need to be successful&mdash;yet also understanding that they are just starting on a journey that will take some time, and we all should think critically about when we push our warez on them, or just sit, listen, and provide some valuable advice.

<p>I was doing some research on travel and transportation APIs over the last couple of weeks, and one of the developer portals I was looking at was one of the enterprise leaders in the space, the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/">Sabre Dev Network</a>. I really like the overall implementation from Sabre, except for one thing...
<p>There is no pricing page for the Sabre Dev Network. ;-( The only place you find a mention of pricing is in the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/resources/FAQ">FAQ page</a>, where it says:
<blockquote><em>"We have a number of different pricing options for our services. Whether you are a company just starting out or an established travel provider, we have pricing options that will fit your business needs.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>I understand you are a little apprehensive about sharing your pricing, or maybe you haven&rsquo;t really thought it through all the way, and just want to shake the trees and see what falls out. Whatever the reason, when it comes to APIs you should be a little more transparent about what is going on.
<p>Additionally, as far along as you are with some of the other parts of your developer program, you should have a pretty robust service composition page, and a partner and certification framework for developers to work towards.
<p>Other than the lack of information about what everything costs, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/">Sabre Dev Network</a>, as a platform. I have two other stories to do around their approach, but wanted to start with the constructive criticism before I move into the praise. ;-)

<p>I&rsquo;m working through my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design stories</a>, and was working through some research on the origins of <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and as I'm writing a paragraph on <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, I became distracted around how Swagger was born out of this "word" startup. You see, Wordnik presents themselves as "a new way to discover meaning", and out of this work, Swagger, "a new way to discover meaning" from APIs was born.
<p>Words are an important building block in communication, and I see APIs as a similar, more structured way to approach online communication on the open Internet. Swagger has given us a new vocabulary, providing a new way to describe, and communicate around APIs. You can programmatically pull a a Swagger specification for an API, and within a few seconds you have an idea of what the API resources means, and has to offer.
<p>There really isn't any major point to this story, other than the fact that I find it interesting that a company who is striving to discover meaning among words, would also be looking to help us discovery meaning of APIs. I think this essence is why so many are adopting Swagger to define their valuable API resources, because it comes from a purer place, than just trying to sell you API tooling, and is actually working to help you find and communicate the meaning amongst APIs.

<p>As the API lifecycle continues to expand and comes into focus, new services are emerging to help both API providers, and consumers, better manage API operations from start to finish. New API integration services like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> have emerged to better understand how APIs are actually being consumed, and services like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a>&nbsp;are born out of the need to produce better quality SDKs for developers--it only seems natural that eventually these services would start working together.
<p>APIMatic will now generate SDKs in 7 languages that are designed, and enabled to inspect/debug all of the requests and response data between their API, and the applications that depend on them.  This will provide both API provider, and consumer with vital details on the integration in real-time, that can help ensure applications integrations are all optimized.
<p>All of this is made possible because <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/overview">Runscope has APIs</a>, and APIMatic was savvy enough to weave in integration, monitoring and testing capabilities directly into the SDKs of any API. APIMatic will import API definitions in WADL, Swagger, I/O Docs, API BluePrint, or Google Discovery, then generate SDKs for you in Android, Windows, iOS, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, complete with Runscope integration, monitoring and testing! Something made possible because you have a machine readable API definition for all of your APIs.
<p>This latest expansion of the API lifecycle I feel was kicked off by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a>, introducing the ability to generate interactive docs, server and client code for your APIs. This was then expanded upon by <a href="https://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a> by allowing you to mockup APIs using <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and now APIMatic and Runscope are expanding the lifecycle to include SDKs and API monitoring. It makes me happy to see the API definition continue to play such an important role, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/">as the central truth in the API lifecycle</a>, enabling all of these API services along the way.
<p>Someday I'll create a cool little lifecycle visualization that shows each step in an APIs life, and what is enabled by using a central, machine readable API definition for all of your APIs, and underlying data models, but we all know graphics isn&rsquo;t one of my strengths, so we'll see..<p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>title: ‘Where Do We Start With APIs At The University of Oklahoma?’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-university-of-oklahoma.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.ou.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-university-of-oklahoma.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m dedicating more time lately to research how APIs are being used at universities, and a couple months back I published my first <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/white-paper.html">white paper on using APIs in higher educatio</a>n. As I do with other sectors, I would like to shed light on how APIs are being used at universities, and potentially share best practices, and stories between higher educational institutions, amplifying the positive effects of APIs.
<p>My efforts are beginning to pay off, and I was recently contacted by two friends, Mark Morvant (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMorvant">@MarkMorvant</a>) and Adam Croom (<a href="https://twitter.com/acroom">@acroom</a>), at the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/">University of Oklahoma</a>. They had seen my&nbsp;<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">University research</a>, and read my white paper, but what really lit their fire was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/nyregion/students-inventing-programs-to-streamline-their-colleges-data.html?_r=3">piece in the NY Times about student-built apps teaching colleges a thing or two</a>&mdash;after reading that, they decided to give me a call to discuss APIs more.
<p>I started with the two approaches to using APIs that I am seeing at <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/universities.html">universities</a>:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Access To Institutional Resources - </strong>APIs being deployed to provide better access to data, content, and other digital resources across campus, allowing integration with internal or external systems, and across campus web and mobile applications.</li>
<li><strong>Using Public APIs On Campus - </strong>Putting APIs from the public space, like Twitter and Google Maps to use in classrooms, and even in administrative operations, allowing for the better access to information, and seamless integration with existing campus workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I discussed the different approaches to introducing APis on campus that I've come across so far:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Top-down IT Lead APIs -</strong> School executives take the initiative to make APIs a mandate across all campus operations, acknowledging the benefits APIs can deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Middle-in Faculty Lead APIs -</strong> API efforts led by teachers and other faculty, taking advantage of APIs in their daily work, and hopefully also in the classroom.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom-up Student Lead APIs - </strong>The kids today get online technology, and encouraging them to use APIs in all aspect of their learning will only increase overall digital literacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, we talked about what the best way might be to kick off an actual API platform at OU. There wasn&rsquo;t a clear top-down mandate at OU, so I figured the best place to start was middle-in, as well as bottom-up. We had the middle-in started, with Mark and Adam wanting to see APIs at their institution, but how could we plant the seeds for a bottom-up, student led movement, something that would ultimately get us to where we could demonstrate the value of APIs to campus leaders.
<p>Without any clear place to start, I&rsquo;m exploring the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/">ou.edu website</a> looking for any spreadsheets, CSV files, or obvious tables that could contain some easy data or content that I could easily turn into APIs--pulling ideas from my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">university API building blocks list</a> in my research. Once I have a few targets established, I will then setup a basic developer portal to house all of the early API efforts.
<p>Once I have a basic developer portal, and a couple of data or content APIs, I can then make a plan for what is next. My goal is to just get going, and tell the story about APIs at OU. I&rsquo;d say this is definitely the most basic API effort I&rsquo;ve ever kicked off. We are truly starting at ground zero here, and even though we have the initial desire to have APIs, we don&rsquo;t know exactly the how or what of APIs at OU, but we have to start somewhere.
<p>This is what I love about APIs. Where do I start? What will make the difference? There are no perfect answers, and there is so much work to do, but we have to start somewhere. Hopefully I can find some easy targets for generating the initial APIs, and publish a basic developer portal using Github Pages, and jumpstart the API conversation at OU. Once I do that I will connect back with Mark and Adam, and I&rsquo;m sure by then I will have more ideas of what we can do next when it comes to APIs at the University of Oklahoma.

<p>title: ‘What I Would Look For When Hiring a Modern API Developer?’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-people.JPG</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-people.JPG" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>I get asked about hiring developer advocates, and API developers quite often during the week, but this specific question in my inbox from <a href="http://augmate.com/">Augmate</a>, I found more interesting. I thought their usage of a &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; was a little different, which gave me a reason to provide some fresh thought on the subject.
<p>After reading the question, my first response was going to be: API developer for consuming APIs or providing API?  A thought which I immediately nullified, because any &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; is both. You should never just consume APIs, or just develop APIs, you should always do both&mdash;something that will give you the healthy perspective that I would be looking for when hiring.
<p>Next, there is the matter of which programming language they should be fluent in. I'll leave it to you to test for skills and knowledge that is relevant to your technology stack. Having been a director of IT, and development team manager, the requirements are always different in each environment I've worked in&mdash;I won't pretend there is one HR process to rule them all. You know your environment and needs, and you should develop a line of interview questions that reflects your objectives.
<p>In addition to your regular line of questioning, I would suggest that you also want someone who is language curious, and has played around with many of the popular languages, and not just stuck in one discipline like enterprise (C# &amp; Java), web (PHP, Python, Ruby, JS), mobile (Obj-C), and even someone who plays around with leading edge approaches using Node.js, Scala, and Go. You want to make sure they are proficient in the languages and technologies that speak to your core operations,  but someone who is also aware of what is going elsewhere in the landscape&mdash;making for much more of a pragmatic developer, and reducing dogma to healthier levels.
<p>Beyond the code I&rsquo;m also looking for signs that a developer is well read, and communicative, and the best ways to identify this in 2014 via their blog, Twitter, Stack Exchange and Github accounts. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of scenarios where you want a developer who is better coder than communicator, but when it comes to API design and development, I want someone who is a rabid consumer of other blogs, active communicator, and isn't afraid to publish code in the public sphere. Your API is about communicating with external systems and applications, and if your developer isn't a communicator, will they be able to do this?
<p>To be a modern API developer, you should be fluent in multiple languages, active across relevant communities, via Twitter, and Github, and have an active blog demonstrating your passion for your craft. I know this isn&rsquo;t the perfect formula for you to follow when embarking on your API developer hiring process, but hopefully it gives you some important tools you can use to help find what you are looking for. Additionally, each of the tools I&rsquo;ve referenced have APIs themselves, and maybe its time that our hiring processes moved online, become more interoperable, playing both a synchronous, and asynchronous role in hiring developers, while also keeping pace with where the API space is headed?

<p>Those of us who live and breathe the API space, throw around a phrase, &ldquo;The API Economy&rdquo;, quite a lot. Referring to the increased usage of APIs across vital industries to drive web and mobile applications, but we as we do often, the phrase is used to describe the future of things, rather than where things actually are. While we are seeing APIs begin to affect global economies, we really don't have much hard evidence that "The API Economy" is a thing beyond our own techno fascination.
<p>With the release of a new report from the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), called <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/usitc/pub4485.pdf">Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies</a>, us API geeks are getting the first actual evidence of "The API Economy", with a section in the report called "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces".
<p>The USITC reached out to me several months back, and interviewed me as part of the work on the report, and this week I finally got to see the resulting work. The report is the second of two compiled by committee, with the first report, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/usitc/pub4415.pdf">Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 1</a> published last year. The earlier report laid the groundwork for the second report by providing an overview of trends in U.S. digital trade, describing the ways digital trade facilitates trade in other sectors, and approaches for estimating the economic impact of digital trade on the U.S. economy.
<p>Now with Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 2 the commission is focusing on the value of U.S. digital trade and the potential growth of this trade, providing insight into the broader linkages and contributions of digital trade to the U.S. economy (aka API economy). The report that includes a survey of U.S. firms in industries particularly involved in digital trade, also examines the effects of notable barriers and impediments to digital trade, and presents case studies that examine the importance of digital trade to selected U.S. industries, including the case study: "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces&rdquo;.
<p>It makes me happy to see APIs reflected alongside other aspects of our increasingly digital economy, and not just the good represented, but also many of the challenges we will face. It is my mission to make sure everyone understand that APIs are not good, bad or neutral, and that they are just the digital pipes that are making up the underbelly of this new economic landscape. My goal in using the word &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;, is to highlight best practices around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, not to just get everyone hyped with yet another meaningless tech phrase.
<p>After four years of hard work in the industry, it is good to see things beginning to mature, and go from just something just us alpha API geeks are paying attention to, to something government and industry leaders are taking notice of.

<p>We just wrapped up the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">4th edition of @APIStrat in Chicago</a> last week, and once again I&rsquo;m very happy with the way things went, as 400+ folks gathered to discuss APIs. The event had the right tone, and I got the usual flood of comments from attendees, speakers, and sponsors about what a great experience the event was.
<p>I would love to take credit, but all of the responsibility goes to <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> for making it happen. 3Scale takes all the risk, and their rockstar team makes the event a reality&mdash;I just help get folks to the conference, contribute ideas to the schedule, present, and MC as much of the event as I possibly can.
<p>@APIStrat has been helping move forward the conversation in the API space for two years now, starting with <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/">New York</a> and <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/">San Francisco</a> in 2013, and now <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">Chicago</a> in 2014, all made possible because of 3Scale's investment.

<p>The number one priority for 3Scale, when it comes to @APIStrat, is to move the conversation forward, while investing in the API community. This is why the event is a success, setting the tone for the conversation amongst sponsors, speakers, and attendees. I&rsquo;m thankful for being able to to take part in @APIStrat, and look forward to digesting all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">videos from Chicago, which are already on YouTube</a>.
<p>We&rsquo;ve already announced that the next @APIStrat will be in Berlin, spring 2015, and we are <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/2014/09/24/as-apistrat-chicago-kicks-off-apistrat-europe-and-us-for-2015-are-in-the-works--we-want-your-input/">accepting input on where it should for the fall of 2015</a>. Let me know if there are any topics you&rsquo;d like to see discussed at @APIStrat 2015, and we'll see about getting your ideas into the lineup.

<p>I curate a lot of interesting stories across the API space from my RSS feeds, the Twittersphere, and my overactive email inbox each day. Only a small percentage of these stories ever make it to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">business of API analysis site apievangelist.com</a>, or my <a href="http://apivoice.com">politics of APIs analysis at apivoice.com</a>.
<p>Over the summer, this got me thinking, and while wandering around Detroit after <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft Detroit</a> this last July, Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I were talking about the rapidly expanding API space, and both felt there was a gap in the news reporting for the API sector. <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>&nbsp;(PW)&nbsp;does a good job of providing API news and analysis for the space, but because of my monitoring of the space, I know there is a lot more news that never sees the light of day.
<p>Steve and I both aggreed that PW is the tip of the API news iceberg, and while API Evangelist, and API Voice provide some added analysis, there was no straight news site that showcased all of the news across the thousands of companies doing interesting things in 2014. Beyone PW,&nbsp;<a href="http://apiscene.com/">APIScene</a> and <a href="https://apicodex.3scale.net/content/Welcome">API Codex</a> are aggregating stories from across the blogosphere, providing access to the best stories across the blogosphere, but still do not reflect the wealth of stories I see being published by both API providers, and consumers.
<p><a href="http://api.report/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-report/api-report-news.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>Out of this conversation, the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a> was born. The API.Report is a Github Pages hosted API news site, that anyone can post short, concise blog posts that are no more than 500 words, with supporting links to additional sources of information. There are two ways you can post:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Fork and Post to Github -</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-report">entire site runs on Github</a>, and if you understand how Jekyll works you can easily publish your own story to the _posts folder, and submit a pull request to have added to the daily stream of stories. </li>
<li><strong>Email Your Story - </strong>If you don't want to use Github, you can easily email a story, and supporting image to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#335a5d555c7352435a5645525d54565f5a40471d505c5e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d0b9beb6bf90b1a0b9b5a6b1beb7b5bcb9a3a4feb3bfbd">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and I will post the story for you. Stories on Github will get priority, but emails will be processed as I have time.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will take a couple of weeks before the site will get up to a regular pace, as I'm the only one writing for the blog at the moment, but as more writers step up, the number of stories should increase. I&rsquo;m going to play around with a couple of other features, like a list of all companies who are referenced in news stories each week, and rolling out a custom advertising network for the news site, allowing people to purchase monthly advertising slots.
<p>If you want to become an author, or would like to advertise on the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a>, feel free to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7d14131b123d1c0d14180b1c131a1811140e09531e1210">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">tweet</a> at me, and I'll get you plugged in. If you have any feedback, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-report/issues">issue management for the site</a>, and I&rsquo;ll work to incorporate your ideas into the site.  While the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a> is part of the API Evangelist network, I consider it a community site, and would like for you become part of the storytelling for the API space.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on a growing number of video, and voice enabled APIs lately, and one that is continually popping up to the top of my API monitoring list is <a href="https://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a>.
<p>The <a href="https://developer.clarify.io/docs/">description Clarify provides on their docs page</a> is pretty concise:
<blockquote><em>The Clarify API provides a RESTful API to extract knowledge from audio and video content</em></blockquote>
<p>Why is Clarify popping up on my list lately? There are a number of things that will cause an API related company to show up on my radar, but Clarify has several things going for it lately:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Shift -</strong> Recently they migrated from being Op3nVoice, which I didn&rsquo;t think wasn't that hard to spell, but I know that many people would have trouble with, to being Clarify&mdash;which is a cleaner brand.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Clarify is an extremely well designed API which employs <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL, and hypermedia JSON format</a> for al API responses.</li>
<li><strong>SDK Writing Guide -</strong> They provide an <a href="https://developer.clarify.io/docs/#sdk-writing-guide">SDK writing guide</a> for anyone looking to develop SDKs for Clarify, making sure they are consistent from language to language.</li>
<li><strong>Story on Helper Libraries -</strong> Clarify produced a great blog post called "<a href="http://clarify.io/blog/spoil-your-users-with-great-helper-libraries-2/">SPOIL your Users with Great Helper Libraries</a>", which I added to my curation, and stories around API management.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">15 separate APIs as part of my voice API research</a>, and <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=video-stack">18 as part of my video API research</a>. These are fast growing spaces, and the problem of delivering indexable meta data alongside audio video is only going to increase, something startups like Clarify is looking to provide an API driven solution for.
<p>Now that <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> is over, I'm going to take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">video from the conference</a>, and run through <a href="https://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a>, to get a feel for how the API works, and see first-hand the value it adds to my existing audio and video content.
<p>Clarify is a well designed API, and now that they've found their footing with their new brand, I predict Clarify will be one of those high value APIs like Twilio and SendGrid, that we are all talking about, and showcasing when it comes to how to do API right.
<p>Look for more stories on <a href="https://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a> as I get time to process the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat</a> content.

<p>title: ‘My API 101 Workshop At @APIStrat In Chicago Next Week’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-101.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/workshops.php"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-101.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on the details of my <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/workshops.php">API 101 workshop</a> with Kirsten Hunter (<a href="https://twitter.com/synedra">@synedra</a>) next week. She is delivering most of the content for the 2 hour workshop, as she has evolved a pretty sophisticated set of API 101 materials. My contribution will be from my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a>, and my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">API trends</a> material, helping people understand the how we got here, and some thoughts on where we are going.
<p><strong>History of APIs</strong><br /> As I continue to make sense of the API space, I'm evolving my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs story</a>, adding and consolidating areas that I think have significantly contributed to the overall growth of the API space. While <a href="http://theapistack.com/">I track on 100+ categories, or business sectors, in which I think APIs are being applied in some interesting ways</a>, I feel these seven areas are the cornerstones of the app, and its underlying API economy.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Commerce</strong> - Beginning with API pioneers like Salesforce, eBay, and Amazon to payment leaders like Stripe, and Paypal.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Teach us how to share, interact in collaborate with Deliciious, Facebook, and Twitter, to more recently Google+.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon forever chagned how we will use APIs</a>, enabling us to go beyond hobby, and actually deploy global infrastructure using web APis.</li>
<li><strong>Geo</strong> - Google Maps brought the resources web and mobile developers would need, and Census, MapBox, and others are pushing forward a valulable stack of geo API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Flickr brought the businesses of APis into the mainstream consciousness, and Instgram, YouTube, and others stream rich media into our worlds via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - Twilio, Sendgrid, and other messaging APIs provide valuable resources for developers, and also show the rest of us API providers how to manage and evangelize your APIs right.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are definitely other valuable API resources that are contributing to the success of the space, these six areas represent the bedrock of the app, and API economy. You can find these areas playing a role in two major channels for delivering applications.
<p><strong>Channels</strong><br /> I do not think we can adequately talk about the history of APIs without discussion the motivations for deploying, and consuming APIs in the categories listed above. Historically there as been two main areas motivating companies to put APIs to work:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web</strong> - Delivering valuable data and content byeond just a single website, and allowing distribution to hundreds, or thousands of websites using APIs is of growing importance in a globally distributed Internet fueled economy.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Mobile is outpacing web, as the number of reason for deploying, and consuming APIs. Simple web APIs are well suited for deliverin gthe resources need to develop mobile applications.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are definitely other motivations for deploying APIs, but when we start labeling something as a definite part of history, I think these areas dominate. In 2014 I think mobile has definitely overtook web as a driving force, but distributed data, content, and other compute resources web still plays an important role.
<p><strong>Trends</strong><br /> At the same moment I&rsquo;m trying to understand the past, I&rsquo;m also working hard to understand where we are going, based upon what companies are up to in the API space. I also track on six other interesting areas, that I&rsquo;m closely watching, adding new players, trying to understand what their bringing to the table, and putting them into buckets I&rsquo;m calling API trends.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">Aggregation</a></strong> - Bringing together several APIs into a single, aggregate endpoint. Example could be bringing together image APIs from Flickr, Instagram, and Facebook into a single resource.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a></strong> - The forward motion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">extract, transform, and load (ETL)</a> into a more cloud-centric environment. IFTTT and Zapier are leading in this new world of moving valuable resources, around the globe, using the open Internet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">Realtime</a></strong> - Some APis require more than just a basic request / response approach, resulting in a variety of real-time technologies from prototcols like XMPP or Web Sockets, to frameworks like Firebase, and Fanout.io.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">Voice / Speech</a> </strong>- Apple's Siri embodies this latest wave of voice enabled APis, providing the sources you need to bridge the physical world of speech to a vast array of digital resources made available via APis.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com">Single Page Apps (SPA)</a> </strong>- Moving forward the web channel, and delivering simple, single page applications using common frameworks, and API resources to deliver data, content, and other digital resources needed for these SPAs.</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) </strong>- Using simple web APIs to deliver and consume information from physical objects, in our homes, businesses, and spread across public and private spaces.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these trends are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">beginning to get baked directly into some SaaS, PaaS, and API platforms I&rsquo;m tracking on</a>. Each of these trends are delivering value in different ways depending on which industry your looking at, such as real-time might be more important to financial APIs over regular business listing APIs. Areas like IoT are already expanding beyond just label into wearables, automobile, and other fast moving, but currently niche areas.
<p><strong>Maturing</strong><br /> Even with the innovation in all of these areas by a handful of tech giants, and the long tail of tech startups, the space is slowly maturing in two key areas, which in the future will become bedrock cornerstones for the entire app and API economies. These areas are slowly maturing, and not moving as fast as some of the other areas I&rsquo;m tracking on, but will be critical to the future of the API economy.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">Government</a></strong> - Federal, state, and city governments are opening up data, and APIs at an increasing pace, making some very valuable resources available to developers. Government APIs will be fuel to the app, and its underlying API economy, in coming years.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">Enterprise</a></strong> - The largest companies in the world are slowly beginning to see the potential of evolving their SOA approach to include an API-centric approach to delivering products and services It will take the enterprise to truly scale the API economy into the next decade.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-strategy-practice-chicago/api-strategy-practice-chicago-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that we are only 2-4 years into these layers tot he API economy, and there is a ton of work to do. We need leaders in these space to step up and help evangelize a sensible approach to APIs in their industry, but we also need the rest of the API space to be patient, and also contribute to helping guide government of all sizes, large enterprises, and institutions in understanding the tech, business, and politics of APIs.
<p>Maybe I'm biased, because I've been tracking on the API space for a while now, but I&rsquo;m pretty happy to see things maturing, and after 14 years of playing around with web services, and more recently APIs, I feel good that we are moving past the wild west, and beginning to stabilize things a little bit, while still also experimenting with API trends in some pretty exciting (and scary) ways.

<p>title: ‘Some Advice For The Enterprise When Beginning Your API Journey’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-hiking.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-hiking.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I'm seeing the enterprise wake up to the potential of an API centric approach to doing business, slowly evolving beyond a Service Oriented Architectural (SOA) approach, and trying to understand why APIs are superior for delivering resources to the web, mobile, and Internet of thing (Iot) apps they are delivering, and increasingly depending on. Even though we are clearly in an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">enterprise phase of the API evolution</a>, I&rsquo;m watching many leading enterprise entities struggle with their early API efforts, producing some pretty weak solutions, that developers are not finding useful, and hurting their efforts right out of the gate.
<p>I know that many enterprise API architects will dismiss my advice, because they know better than I do, but I feel compelled to share my thoughts, in hopes that even a handful will be more successful with their API efforts, which I think will also help the overall space as well. When embarking on your API journey, you are going to be handicapped right out of the gate, because as a large enterprise organization, you do not have many of the essential characteristics necessary in your DNA to be successful with APIs, but this is why it will require an API journey, to reprogram your DNA, and better operate on the open Internet.
<p>Before you start planning your APIs, and the supporting developer area, you need to play with other public APIs, to better understand what makes APIs different. I am always amazed at how many enterprise API architects that I engage with, when I ask them what public APIs they have used, admit that they have never used one. They just have heard of many of the common APIs out there, so to prime the API pump, let&rsquo;s hack on a couple of the most popular API solutions out there:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter</a></strong> - Hacking on the Twitter API provides some very important lessons when it comes to API design, as well as developer support.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Github</a></strong> - Github is an essential tool in an API providers toolbox on so may levels, but using their API for managing code is an important experience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a></strong> - Twilio is a god when it comes to API providers, and we all look up to them, so if you aren&rsquo;t familiar make sure and hack together a simple API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not skip this section, you may think you understand how these APIs operate, by visiting their developer areas, and I know you come to the table with a wealth of experience, and this is your handicap. You have a serious amount of technical experience, way more than I do, but what you are missing is an understanding of many of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">business and political building blocks that are making all of this work</a>, ares that you have very little experience within the enterprise.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Simple, Simple, Simple</li>
<li>Begin With API Definition</li>
<li>Interactive Documentation</li>
<li>Self-Service Registration</li>
<li>Play With Service Composition</li>
<li>Telling Meaningful Stories </li>
<li>Showcase  Your Developers</li>
<li>Establish Feedback Loops</li>
<li>Flexible Terms of Service</li>
<li>Invest In Your Developers</li>
<li>Internal Evangelism</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology is part of all of these suggestions, but ultimately APIs represent a new way of doing business that you just aren't used to, and you will have to learn it&mdash;something that will take time. Even once you launch your API, you won&rsquo;t be ready, you will have to learn over time, and this is what the API journey is all about, in addition to the core proposition of making vital company resources available to the public, partners, and internally across the enterprise.
<p>Your biggest challenge, beyond the ones listed above will be what you face internally. Getting developers to use your API resources is tough, getting them to deeply integrate them into applications is even harder, but changing culture at your company and getting the support and resources you will need will be a massive undertaking!
<p><strong>Bottom Up  Change</strong><br /> Your senior leadership will most likely not be on board with an API way of operating, and will need a lot of convincing, and most likely ask you for more &nbsp;evidence of why this will work, before they will give you any resources to embark on your journey. They will want the type of ROI that can kill any API effort before it even gets going, so you will have start small, produce results, and demonstrate the value an API delivers in small, bit-size chunks, week by week. This is not field of dreams, nobody will come once you build it, but this is why you start small, iterate, tell stories, showcase what has been done, and evangelize heavily internally to change senior leaderships view, and win hearts and minds with every integration.
<p><strong>Top Down Change</strong><br /> Even if you have the luxury of having the buy-in of senior leadership, which is extremely unusual, this doesn't mean that your API effort will be a gravy train. Chances are you will hit obstacles, and resistance all along the way. All the advice listed above is meant for your public, and partner audience, but also needs to target your senior, and mid-level management. If you don't have the buy in of the people in the trenches, your API efforts will stumble, and probably fail. The growing number of reasons API fail, are not technical. APIs fail because they do not deliver the value developers actually need, and fail to get the internal change needed to maintain the resources you will need to be successful.
<p><strong>The Enterprise In Age Of Internet</strong><br /> APIs are not just about the enterprise exposing technical endpoints that provide access to your vital resources, and giving you the control you need to govern the usage of these resources. APIs are about the enterprise learning to operate in the age of the Internet, a world that is much more open, global, and distributed, requiring a different approach to business that is about investing in innovation, and less about governance and control. The reason you are probably looking at APIs, is the desire to be more agile, nimble, and deliver web, mobile, and Iot applications faster, better, and cheaper than your competitor&mdash;something that takes a shift from your legacy approaches, and slowly shift your culture to reflect the Internet.
<p>You will not be able to master plan your API strategy, and ensure success. You will need to open up a simple, useful API developer area, with a handful of valuable API resources that can be applied internal, bring value to your partners, and quite possibly the public, and get the wheels of change rolling forward. Only then will then will you start to understand the world of APIs, and if you neglect the simplicity, storytelling, showcasing, and other critical elements needed to develop the feedback loops that are necessary to keep the wheels rolling, you will doom your efforts. APIs don&rsquo;t fail because they are public, or not what is relevant, they fail because you don't see the elements that make them successful, and lack the culture necessary to be an API driven company&mdash;get started making the change that will give your organization the tools it needs to not just be competitive, but lead in the Internet age.

<p>title: ‘Machine Readable API Definition Format Swagger Matures to 2.0’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-20.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-20.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>The <a href="http://swagger.io/">machine readable API definition format Swagger</a>, just rolled over to version 2.0. I use Swagger to describe all of my APIs, and I largely associate the creator of Swagger, <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a> for kicking off this latest renaissance in defining APIs in a way that provides us with a machine readable vocabulary to talk about all of these valuable resoures that we are exposing via APIs.
<p>There are other formats out there, older ones like WADL, and more recent ones like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, but Swagger was the one that revived this movement, helping us create ways for generating important elements throughout the API lifecycle, from mock interfaces in the design process, to testing and monitoring of product APIs.
<p>Honestly, I don't much of the details of what has changed from version 1.0 to 2.0, except that with version 2.0 you can use YAML to describe your API, just like competitor RAML, or markdown as with API Blueprint. The common assumption is that by using YAML and Markdown, even non-programmers will be able to communicate around APIs without having to navigate JSON&mdash;something I'm not entirely sold on, but will keeping looking for signs of in the wild
<p>When it comes to the rubber meeting the road, I think Swagger has an advantage because of the amount of adoption, and the tooling available in the community. Swagger has a pretty significant lead when it comes to language libraries, both server and client side, as well as converters, and other integration tooling you will need. There are some areas like an API design editor, where Swagger has been playing catch-up, but overall the community has a pretty significant lead from my vantage point.
<p>I&rsquo;m working to convert all of my Swagger files from version 1.3 to 2.0, then I'm sure I will have more thoughts about the latest version, once I get down into the weeds, but for now I&rsquo;m just happy to see the focus Wordnik is giving <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and that it is continuing to mature in the way that it has, providing us with a much needed way to describe and communicate around APIs.

<p>title: ‘How Do We Continue Moving Green Button Data And APIs Forward?’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I'm preparing for a talk at the <a href="http://sgip.org/2014-SGIP-Fall-Conference">The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel Second Annual Conference</a>, in Nashville Tennessee, specifically participating on a panel titled "Using Power Grid Open Data Initiatives". I accepted the request to go speak as part of my wider work on the Green Button iniative out of The White House, DOE, NIST, and the GSA. I was asked to provide some thoughts on how to help move the Green Button efforts forward earlier this winter, and again in the spring, and just haven't had the bandwidth to give any energy, so I saw this as a great opportunity to make some time as part of this panel.
<p>In May, The White House, 18F, some Presidential Innovation Fellows, and myself were asked to move the Green Button ball forward, resulting in a new website, and developer area that is all hosted on Github. I'm bummed I wasn't able to make time to participate, but now I have been able to go through the new site, and developer area, and gather my thoughts on where we could go next with the effort.
<p>Before we get started, lets start with the basics, what is Green Button? Nick Sinai (<a href="https://twitter.com/NickSinai">@NickSinai</a>), Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States, puts it this way:
<blockquote><em>
<p>Green Button is a policy idea.  It's the notion that customers &ndash; residential, commercial, industrial, and yes, government customers of energy &ndash; ought to get access to their own energy data, in a standard digital format.  The Administration has articulated this several times, in a number of Administration energy, climate, and smart grid policy documents.  The government is a big customer of energy, and we deserve our own energy usage and price data.
<p>Green Button is also a public-private initiative, in response to a 2011 White House call to action.  The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA have been collaborating with the utility and tech industries on this growing effort for a few years now.  The White House has been convening industry and celebrating its progress. NIST has been supporting industry on development of the standard, DOE has been working with utilities, and GSA has been an early adopter.
<p>Finally, Green Button is an actual data standard, for formatting and transferring energy usage and price data.  This standard can be implemented in both utility and non-utility contexts.  Customers can manually download or upload a file formatted in the standard, and IT systems can automatically transfer data between them using the standard.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<p>The White House, 18F, and fellow PIFs, have done a great job organizing everything under a single, Github pages site, at <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. The site is a big improvement over what was there before, and moves us closer to solving the fragmentation in the Green Button effort, which I believe is the fundamental issue that is holding it back from being fully realized. Green Button is a big vision, and it is going to take some serious effort to bring together all of the industry, and 3rd party efforts, and most importantly getting individual consumers on-board with taking control over their own energy data.
<p>To help organize my thoughts on how we can move Green Button forward, something I will be discussing on stage in Nashville, I wanted to walk through the site, and take a snapshot of where we are at, then work on a strategy for what is needed to keep the momentum we already have moving forward. Green Button is an extremely critical effort in not just   empowering individuals and institutions to take control over their energy data, but also for the overall health of the energy sector, and whether the utility companies can see it or not, open data and APIs will be central to their continued success. So as I do with other areas, let's walk through where we are at currently with Green Button, to help prime the discussion about where we should go.
<p><strong>First Impressions</strong><br /> When you land on the <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> site, it looks like a modern, clean website effort, with a simple tagline and meaningful image to help you understand what Green Button is all about. The first description is "Helping You Find and Use Your Energy Data", and then when you scroll down you see an answer to the question What is Green Button? -- "Green Button is a secure way to get your energy usage information electronically. I like the concise messaging, but it is solely focused on the consumer, and leaves out the commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations listed on the "use" page. I know this all revolves around energy data, but when you land on site, you should have the site speak to you, no matter who you are.
<p>I think the "use" page does a great job in breaking down who the target audience is, but the first impression doesn't reflect this, and I don't think there is any path for these users to follow, once you do find yourself on <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. As a data custodian, or 3rd party developer, I think the build or developer page will quickly speak to you, but as a consumer, you are quickly dropped from the focus of the site and will be completely lost in the rich information that is available. To on-board each user properly, we will need to begin to carve out paths for each user, one that start with a meaningful first impression off of the home page, then puts them on a path that leads them twoard action and the relevant resources they will need, depending on their role.
<p><strong>Learn About Green Button</strong><br /> I really like the learn page for Green Button. It is clean, simple, informative, and not overwhelming for me to learn about what Green Button is, from any perspectives. My only suggestions for next steps is that we begin massaging some of the rich content available under "library", and link to specific learning opportunities from this page. Each summary should provide users with links to follow, taking them to the detail they will need to fully understand each aspect of Green Button as it pertains to their position. However, with that said it is critical to keep this page a simple overview of Green Button, and make it an easy doorway to the world of energy data.
<p><strong>Using Green Button</strong><br /> As I said above, the "use" section provides a nice overview of who should be using Green Button, with sections focusing on commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations, as well residential consumers. What is needed for each of these sections, is a clear call to action, taking you to another page that is a "getting started" specifically targeting your role in the Green Button movement. I don't think the lack of this, is a deficiency of what is currently there, it is just the next logical step for evolving this page to better onboard users, now that these roles are better defined.
<p><strong>The Green Button Community</strong><br /> This is the first time I've seen the Green Button community reflected on a single page like this, and is exactly what is needed to help reduce the fragmentation currently present across the community. Presenting the four groups in this way, complete with links to their sites, and relevant contact information to get involved, is very important for bringing together the community. My only critique is that the page could use a little more layout love, formatting, logos, and some polish to keep it looking as good as the rest of the site&mdash;nothing major.  Eventually it would also be nice to have some sort of stream of activity across all of these efforts, aggregated here. I'm not sure how this would occur, as the groups are all using different ways to keep members informed, but something should be considered, further bringing together the community.
<p><strong>Build With Green Button</strong><br /> The developers section probably needs the most help right now, and I'm not 100% sure of how to make more coherent. It is a little redundant and circular, and its called "build" on home page, and "developers" in the top navigation, something that should be consistent. The RESTful APIs is represented twice, and i see glimpses of trying to provide separate information for data stewards, and 3rd party developers. Along with the development of specific paths for different target users, this needs to be reworked, and woven into those efforts, but I do like the focus on the open source nature of Green Button. The first time I landed on Green Button, I didn't fully grasp that it was an open source API that anyone can deploy, and that the sandbox version that is in operation is just a demo, something that I think we need to make fully clear to users of all types.
<p>We have a big challenge ahead when it comes to helping data custodians understand what is possible, and hopefully we can help spur 3rd party developers in not just build around existing Green Button code, but also work to develop new versions in other languages, as well as specific cloud offerings on maybe Amazon or Heroku. The sky is the limit when it comes to developing, and building Green Button solutions, both server and client side, and we need to make the separation as clear as possible. It will take some serious architectural vision to help bridge what code is currently available for Green Button, and stimulate commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations in understanding what is possible, and incentivize them to deliver solutions that are quickly deployable across the cloud landscape.
<p><strong>Green Button Library</strong><br /> As with the "learn" and "use" sections of the site, the current library section was a great step forward in bringing together the wealth of current resources available to support Green Button efforts. What is needed now is just the refinement of what is there, making it easier to access, and learn from, while also making sure that resources are appropriately grouped into buckets targeting each of the Green Button user groups. As I'm working through the the library of materials, I can see there are some seriously rich resource available, but there is a lot of disconnect between them because they are designed, developed and deployed to support different goals, by different authors&mdash;we need to establish some consistency between them.
<p>Right now the library is very much a list of resources, and it would be nice to make sure it truly is a library that is organized, indexable, and is easy to navigate. Having all of these resources in a single location is an excellent start, but how do we start refining them, and making them much more usable by all users? Documents should have a consistent document formats, videos should have single Youtube (or other) channel, and much more. All of this would make it much more likely that these resources would be explored, an consumed by a wider audience, beyond just the alpha geek crowd.
<p><strong>Green Button Testing Tools</strong><br /> I'm happy to see the Green Button testing tool here, but ultimately it feels like one tool, that should be in a toolbox. Right now it is its own top level navigation item, and I don't think a single tool should be elevated to this level. I would change this to tools, and make the testing tool the one item in the toolbox right now, and I'm sure there are others we can quickly add to the toolbox as well. As with other areas, we should break down the toolbox by user group, making sure consumers easily find what they need, as well as utility providers, 3rd party developers and the other user groups.
<p><strong>Getting Started With Green Button</strong><br /> I was excited to see the Getting Started button, until I realized it was just an email address. ;-(  That isn't getting started, it is sending an email. Getting started should be prominent, and truly provide users with easy paths to well...get started. If you are data custodian, utility, or energy provider, you should have a simple page that explains how to get started, in a self-service way&mdash;no email needed. Separately, there should be contact information for Green Button, something that hopefully includes much more than just an email address, with no face and personality behind it.
<p><strong>Acknowledging Where We Are</strong><br /> That is a quick walkthrough of where things are at with <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>, and in my opinion, things have come a long ways from what I was seeing spread across the Green Button landscape this last winter. Most importantly it is aggregating the community, developer, and the wealth of other resources into a library, which is a very critical step to continue moving Green Button forward. In my opinion the v1 tech of Green Button tech is in place, it is just lacking all the refinement, storytelling, and relationship building that is necessary to move Green Button into the consciousness of utility companies, 3rd party developers, and the average, everyday energy consumer&mdash;so how do we do this?
<p><strong>Green Button Needs A Champion</strong><br /> First, before we get into any of the nuts and bolts of what we can do to keep <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> rolling forward, the project is going to need a champion. I think The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA are doing an amazing job of making sure things move forward, but <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> needs someone who is super passionate about energy data, APIs, understands the energy industry, and wants to put in the hours necessary to refine the information currently available, build relationships, and generate new content that will bring in new players. This role isn't some cushy job that you will get a regular paycheck for, but for the right person, I think it could be pretty lucrative, if you get creative in piecing together sponsorship and support from industry players, organizations, and worked hard on the grant writing front. Essentially you need The API Evangelist, for energy data and APIs.
<p><strong>Who's offering Green Button?</strong><br /> I think the first place to start is visible right on the home page, and looking at who is already putting Green Button data to work. I see 50+ entities who are already putting Green Button to work, so who are these people, and how can we showcase what they are up to.  There are some meaningful implementations here, and I know there is some great material here to demonstrate the power, and importance of Green Button, and help spark the imagination of new visitors.  Green Button has traction, the problem is not enough people know about it, or have the imagination to understand how it is being used. Let's take the time to showcase this, and create some really great content that will make the site more educational. This is something that can be led by the Green Button evangelist I talk about above, but is also something I think the community should also contribute to. I'm going to carve out some time to reach out to some of the providers listed, and see if i can showcase how they are putting Green Button to work, and generate more detail, and content that can be contributed to <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. Do you want to help?
<p><strong>Showcase Of How Green Button Is Used</strong><br /> Building on the work above, we need a place to showcase how Green Button is being put to use. I'm not sure this should be a top level navigation item, but if we group each entry in the showcase, by the type of user, I think we can make it one stop of the path each user takes, as they learn about Green Button. As each commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations, and individual energy users is learning about Green Button, they should also be exposed to examples of other similar individuals or companies like them that are already putting Green Button to work. This will go a long way in helping people see the potential of Green Button, and begin the journey of putting it to work across the energy industry landscape in new ways.
<p><strong>Blog For Bringing Green Button To Life</strong><br /> The <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> site needs a blog. This is something that will be difficult without a champion to keep alive, but a blog is going to be essential in bringing the site to life, helping share stories about the value Green Button is bringing to companies, organizations, institutions, and most importantly the average consumer. Without a blog, any developer community will not have a soul, or a personality, and it will be difficult to convince anyone that someone is home, and that they should trust and care about Green Button. I think a blog could easily be crowdsourced, allowing passionate folks like myself to post, as well as other organizations, companies, and key stakeholders to post relevant stories, that will give the site a heartbeat. A blog will be central to any of the suggestions I will have to help move things forward, and give <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> a personality that will go a long way in building trust amongst users, and across the industry.
<p><strong>Giving Some Coherence To The Developers Section</strong><br /> The developer section of <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> will be essential to scaling the effort, and right now the page is a little all over the place, and will take some significant effort to simplify, make usable, and bring the wealth of developer resources into focus. This will take some serious work, by someone who is a developer, architect, and can make actually organize everything into something that easily on-boards data custodians, and 3rd party developers with as little friction as possible. You have to walk them through the wealth of tooling that is already available, show them what is possible, and then give them the downloads they need to get things working in their world.
<p>There is also a need for some other additional tooling, some of the current solutions are very enterprise oriented, and I think with some encouragement, providers could replicate Green Button tooling in other languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, and other platforms that will encourage rapid adoption by other providers. There also needs to be some ways to help people quickly bring Green Button to life using cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, Google, Azure and other platforms that companies and individuals are already depending on.
<p>The developer section is something that will take some deep thinking, hacking, and architectural magic from the champion, and Green Button evangelist. They will have to look at it through the eyes of each of the data custodians, and 3rd party developers who are already putting Green Button to use, and try to deliver things in a way that will speak to this, as well as potentially other new users. This type of work is not easy, and takes some serious effort, something you can't expect to happen overnight. However, if it is done right this can really help scale the number of Green Button implementations in the wild, and take things to the next level much quicker.
<p><strong>Turning The Library Into A Consistent Resource</strong><br /> I am happy to see all of the rich Green Button resources brought into a single location, but I wouldn't call it quite a library yet. It is a listing of valuable resources, that aren't really organized in a way that speaks to the different Green Button users, and are not consistent in form because they come from different sources. Even with this said, their is a wealth of resources available there, and with some work you could build a really nice, interactive library that can help educate users on how to put Green Button to work. Similar to the showcase, once the library is organized, and grouped by target user, I think the library can be a stop on the path that each user takes, showing them exactly the resources they need in the library to help onboard them properly.
<p><strong>Establishing Paths For Green Button Users</strong><br /> As I discussed above, each user needs a path they can take from the "use" page to begin their journey. Right now the "use" page is a dead end, where it should actually be a call to action, providing each visitor the chance to take a path through the site that speaks to them, without forcing them to have to wade through the wealth of resources that are currently there. From the "use" page, each user can be taken to a showcase of other implementations from similar users, then depending on their role, could be walk through other sections of the site, landing in the library, presenting with exactly what they need to get going. I'm not exactly sure what the user experience will be on these new paths, but I think once we profile the existing uses of Green Button, and unwind the developer and library resources, a pretty orderly route can be established for each user group. These paths will go a long way to onboard users in a fraction of the time, and maximize the potential reach, and scale of the platform&mdash;adding more implementations to the Green Button platform, and scaling the audience with each new user.
<p><strong>Taking Green Button From Site to Community</strong><br /> I will stop here. I think this is all that should be focused on for now, when it comes to moving Green Button forward. It is important to not bite off too much, and make sure we can be successful in moving things forward, and not make things more complex. The goal is to simplify what we have, now that we have everything organized into a single site, and begin the process of bringing <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> to life. With someone at the helm, an active blog, and a more coherent focus on each user group, I think that things will start picking up steam, and with more outreach, and involvement with existing Green Button implementations, and the existing Green Button community, we can move <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> from being just a site, and put it on its way to becoming a community.
<p>It is important that Green Button evolves to become a community. It cannot remain just a government initiative. Green Button has to be a vibrant community that commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, energy efficiency organizations, and individual energy users are all part of, otherwise it will always remain just something being pushed from the top down. Green Button has to be also owned by the individual energy users, and institutions, providing essential bottom up momentum to match the energy given from the top by the federal government partners&mdash;without this the energy industry will never buy in.
<p>Profiling the existing Green Button implementations, and making the site speak to each of the user groups will be important for taking things to the next step. This process will help communicate to a next generation of implementations what is possible, and through regular showcasing and storytelling we can move Green Button beyond just a policy idea, and initiative from government, or just a technical data standard, and transform it into something that is a default part of the energy industry. In this new world, energy users will be used to having control over their data, and entirely new markets will be established delivering services to energy consumers, within this new space.
<p>All the parts and pieces are there, and much like last round of work on the <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>&nbsp;site brought all these resources together, we need to figure out how to bring the energy industry together and show them the potential of Green Button data and APIs. We need to make sure energy consumers, both individual and institutional, understand the importance of having control over their energy data, and show data custodians that this is the future of doing business in the energy space. Once we can achieve this, Green Button will take on a life of its own, driven not just by the government, or even the utility providers, but by the energy of 3rd party companies who are delivering meaningful solutions for institutional, organizational, and individual energy consumers.

<p>title: ‘Beyond Public APIs In Government: Internal Access to Resources’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>The conversation around open data and APIs in government is dominated by talk of making resources available to the public, which is a good thing, but is only 1/3 of the discussion that should be occurring amongst gov-focused techies, as well as the project owners, and data stewards who are managing these vital public resources across federal agencies.
<p>APIs are not just deployed to support public access to resources, this has just been the trend that is getting all the headlines, and there is still lot of value to be realized when putting APIs to work within an agency, opening up access to data, content, and other digital resources, increasing efficiency agency-wide using Internet technology. The best example of this in action is out of the private sector from Amazon, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">story of the important role internal APIs have played in the company's success</a>, across internal operations, but also in the public as a commerce, and a cloud computing leader.
<p>To help you relate to the idea of an internal API, think of all the times you've had to ask IT for access to something from a database, like a list of facility locations, government programs, or maybe an employee directory. You have to find out where the source of these resources are, track down the right contact information, then put in a request to get a copy of the data or content you are looking for. Often times even once you get the data dump, it could be the wrong information, or missing what you are needing, requiring you to go back, yet again, to get what you are looking for--not very efficient, and also extremely frustrating.
<p><strong>Access To The Resources You Need</strong><br /> When you open up data or content via an API, despite common belief, you aren't necessarily making the information available to anyone on the open Internet, you are just using Internet technology to make it accessible. In some cases, you may publish the fact that the information is available in a public location, but can require that only internal staff has access to it. Regardless of exactly how you approach, the information, and registration for access of an API should always be available in a self-service way, allowing anyone to discover, and gain access without requesting permission from IT, or having to hunt down the source. In a perfect API world every agency will have a central API area where anyone can find all the resources available across the agency, eliminating many of the bottlenecks that commonly exist across government.
<p><strong>APIs Are Not Just For Developers</strong><br /> Developers would like to think APIs are just for them, but this is a reflection of the historic power and control IT has wielded when controlling access to databases, file stores, and other digital resources that are used across government agencies. Sure, APIs require knowing how to access the resource, and potentially the ability to write code that will pull, parse, and publish information to where it is needed, but APIs can just as easily be connected to spreadsheets, documents, and have ready to go HTML listings, details, and other fully functional widgets. This approach to API consumption has been pioneered by private sector technology companies, allowing tech savvy users to reverse engineer API access or put to use as is&mdash;no development experience necessary.
<p><strong>Data And Content Kept Up To Date In Realtime</strong><br /> Without APIs, when you finally do get the list of facilities, programs or contacts from IT, it might already be out of date. If you are requiring IT to provide a dump of data in XML, CSV, spreadsheet or other format, it is just that&mdash;a dump. Any changes made in the central database will not be reflected in your dump, rendering your work obsolete, and potentially turning it from information, to misinformation. APIs allow you to keep a connection between the information source, and your web and mobile application, spreadsheet or other system, up to date in realtime. Even if updating your project is manual, at least you have a realtime connection to the original source that you can use to update as you dictate, not based on only when you can get &nbsp;the IT resources to help.
<p><strong>Analytics For Data And Content Owners On Who Is Using</strong><br /> APIs are not just about getting users access to the data and content they need in their projects, it goes both ways, and can provide a wealth of valuable information to the database administrator, content owner, and data steward who is in charge of the vital government resource. With everyone accessing your resources via an API, you have a realtime pulse on who has access to your resources and rich details on how they are using it. Do you know who is consuming your digital resources today? It is likely you do not, and this new approach using web APIs come with built in tools for truly understanding who has access, while also allowing for access in realtime without demanding extra time and attention, but when you are ready you can audit and understand how these resources are actually being put to use across an agency.
<p><strong>Thinking Beyond Public APIs At Your Agency</strong><br /> Understanding that APIs are much more than just making data available to public developers is extremely important, and can transform how your agency works. Amazon managed to internalize APIs in such a way that changed not just how they do business when it came to online commerce on Amazon.com, but transformed the way we all do business on the Internet. Imagine if a federal agency could see APIs the same, and allow the accessing of internal resources in a similar way, it could entirely change how government services are delivered.
<p>If all digital resources at an agency could be made available via APIs, it has the potential dramatically shift how agencies operate. Right now most agencies already have a wealth of internal web services that somewhat resemble modern web APis, the problem is they are designed by, and deployed for IT and developer stakeholders, not everyone else in the organization. The significant difference between web service and APIs is that APIs use Internet technologies to make data and content available in a very simple way, that if bundled with the right building blocks can make vital resources accessible to anyone across the agency.
<p>IT and developers are fine with just publishing an API and calling it good, as they know how to access these APis without assistance. With just a little more thought, and work, connectors, widgets, and spreadsheet tools can make resources much more widely available across an organization, department and even agency-wide. Undoubtedly it will take a lot of work to shift how IT makes resources available, but there are also tools to help content owners, and data stewards to deploy and consume their own APIs. There are wealth of database, and <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">spreadsheet to API solutions</a> available, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">content management system (CMS) to API solutions for common platforms like Drupal and Wordpress</a>. Ideally IT gets on board with an API centric vision, but it isn't a requirement in 2014, where waves of web APIs are emerging providing access to the resource you need to solve the problems you face in your everyday world, with or without IT being involved.

<p>title: ‘Can You Show Me The ROI On All Of This API Stuff Before We Commit’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-investment.png</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-investment.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I am working on a white paper for a big enterprise provider who is looking to deliver solutions in the API space. At their request I&rsquo;ve gone through six industries and looked for companies who have over 5k employees and are doing interesting things with APIs--a request that produced some great research for the white paper, as well as for stories here on API Evangelist.
<p>It can be hard to find large enterprise organizations who are doing full blown "API", because honestly many of them just do not get it yet. Sure I can find many that are doing web services, and dabbling with APIs, but it can be downright difficult to find examples of companies that I would showcase as a healthy API patterns.
<p>Doing this research I was looking more for examples of anything &ldquo;API&rdquo; happening, any bare-bones, positive signals that could be emulated, and try and demonstrate what huge opportunities there are in these industries, for anyone who could do it right. I got my first draft ready, and submitted for review, and jumped on a call to discuss.
<p>Everything looked great in the paper, except senior leadership said there was a lack of detail demonstrating how developers were building applications on these enterprise public APIs, They would need more hard examples of how these large company APIs were being used, how this benefited the API provider, and some hard numbers of usage, revenue, showing how business models, products and services were being developed.
<p>After smiling, I told them I could guarantee that most of these providers themselves don't have that detail, and are still working to figure this out. Your request is exactly why we do APIs, and begin to establish an external R&amp;D lab for providing answers, in realtime. Even if some of the more mature providers have this information, I can guarantee they aren't going to share it publicly. Maybe if they were a startup, this type of sharing might be in their DNA, but not the enterprise, sorry.
<p>These types of questions are what I got from government agencies (and still get) two years ago after President Obama mandated that all federal agencies go machine readable by default. They wanted to see the ROI from other agencies doing APIs, before they'd do it too. I wish I had all the answers to make risk averse government agencies, institutions, and enterprise feel warm and fuzzy about APIs, but just like it has taken all of us over two years to get any results in the federal government, and four years for me in the wider API space. It is going to take a lot of hard work before you will see those numbers, and if you require these before you get your feet wet, I can guarantee the numbers will be generated by your competitors before you do.
<p>You have to be a little adventurous, agile, and nimble to operate in this realm. If you aren&rsquo;t, I recommend starting with some of the low hanging, safer fruit in your company, and just get started, because then you can hopefully learn from the API process. Once you begin your journey you start to see cultural benefits of an API-centric focus&mdash;otherwise you can sit back and watch a new wave of startups and your existing competition do it for you.

<p>I used to work hard to write blog posts on API Evangelist that would have broad appeal with the Hacker News community, and at first I didn't have any luck, after trying to engage with readers on posts, I found myself blacklisted, where nothing I submitted showed up. I lived in some kind parallel universe, all because I argued with a couple influential HN users, who didn't like what I had to offer.
<p>I started a new account for API Evangelist, and began playing the game with a little different approach. I didn't engage with users, and wrote posts with titles that would bring in readers, kept things short and superficial, and had some front-page exposure, which would result in thousands of pageviews, and then would dissipate. This type of storytelling ever really turned into meaningful traffic, an engaged audience, conversations, or brought any value to my overall mission.
<p>Early last year I stopped posting to HN, only occasionally posted a story, but never really used it in the same way that I had before. I was worried my traffic would be hurt, but I went back to work, trying to write meaningful posts, that brought value to my target audience, and supported my mission. In the last year and a half, I've seen my sustained monthly traffic go from 500 page views a day to almost 2000 a day, all by just my sticking to my mission.
<p>The audience that does visit my blog, for the most part engages with me, shares posts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other channels, and I see much of what I write echoed on other blogs, and in conversations I see on social media, and in person at events. This approach to building my audience, and ultimately traffic to my site has been very healthy in helping me obtain my objectives. My goal is not pageviews for advertising sake, it is to build an awareness in the average business person, and the everyday individual, about the importance of APIs.
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post because see echoes of HN in another blog DZone, which I don&rsquo;t actually syndicate to, but because of the history behind my kin lane.com blog, some of my posts still get hand selected by the DZone staff, and syndicated to the blog. Many of these blog posts get some pretty good comment activity, and the other week a blog post I wrote on Google&rsquo;s hiring process, which got quite a bit of comments, including some pretty trollish ones.
<p>I made the mistake of feeding the trolls, something I don't usually do, but I can&rsquo;t help myself occasionally, and it made me think of this same illness that many advertising driven technology sites possess. I&rsquo;m so happy to have my blog, something I know that reaches a wide range of people, not just because of the page views, but also because of the online and in-person feedback I get. The alpha geek crowd is not my audience, and I don't care what they think about what I&rsquo;m saying, but the trollish comments still get to me sometimes. i quickly shrug them off, but writing about these emotions is one way I do that&mdash;resulting in this post.
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to have a mission driven blog, that goes beyond monetization through advertising. My audience may be small compared to DZone or Hacker News, and what I do may not matter to a lot of their users, but at least I have purpose that involves helping educate people, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to tell people how stupid they are, and that what they do is worthless. I can&rsquo;t imagine being so lost, that doing that makes you feel better. It makes me sad, but then I get back to work, and move on, keeping on with my mission.

<p>In 2014 we are making significant progress in deploying APIs in support of city operations, but we still have so much more work ahead of us when it comes to making public resources available. You can find a dedicated developer area full of data sets, and APIs, in most major US cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and many more, but what else can we do to really pick up the momentum and quality?
<p><strong>Standardizing API Design Practices</strong><br /> APIs are not that difficult to design with the right education, and experience. Developers who work on city contracts, or are employed by the city should all be taught common web API design practices, and be exposed to modern API design tooling like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiary.io">Apiary</a>. Even with this type of education, there will still be many differences between city deployments based upon needs, and tactics, but a little training could go a long way to make city operations more streamlined.
<p><strong>Open Solutions For API Deployment</strong><br />There are a lot of common approaches to delivering city services, which means there should also a be a number of ways to provide standardized, open solutions for deploying APIs that support city operations. There should be a wealth of open source, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/22/wordpress-style-api-modules-for-government/">Wordpress like solutions for deploying APIs in support of government operations.</a> Sometimes connecting to legacy systems is just to much work, and deploying a simple, standalone solution, then syncing using data dumps or directly with backbend system might be more fruitful.
<p><strong>Common API Management Vision</strong><br />I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the standard approach to deploying city developer areas, and delivering data sets, and APIs, but in reality this is the result of the hard work of <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, one of the API management providers dedicated to the government space. I think Socrata, and the other vendors out there are definitely one piece of the puzzle for managing APIs for city operations, but I also think we need other competing, open solutions similar to <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a> which is being used across the federal government.
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling Across Cities</strong><br />When it comes to helping cities better serve their citizens, and save money along the way, I can&rsquo;t think of a better place to start than by providing common, open source tools for delivering web, and mobile applications on top of city data and APIs. We have to stop re-inventing the wheel for each city when it comes to developing common apps, city needs are going to be very similar across cities--just take a look at solutions like <a href="http://www.open311.org/">Open311</a>, and the let&rsquo;s get to work on delivering similiar solutions for every part of city operations.
<p>There is no reason each city should have to go at it alone when it comes to designing, deploying, managing, evangelizing, and putting APIs to work across city operations. We should have standard data models, API definitions, and a wealth of open source tools for cities to put to work.
<p>I don't see APIs as the solution for all cities problems, but I do think that APIs should be common practice for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> cities. Every city should be publishing all of their data and content in machine readable way, without causing employees any extra work&mdash;it should just be part of normal operations.
<p>In the future, all cities will have standard APIs across all cities, and common open source solutions that can be put to work serving citizens in all aspects of city operations. This is how we are going to empower our cities to more with less, and make governing a more inclusive for everyone.<p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I saw another story about whether or not public APIs are going away, which is another story in a fairly long line of stories I&rsquo;m seeing lately from enterprise outlets about whether or not the demise of Netflix, ESPN, and now Aetna means public APIs are a bad idea, unsustainable and now will be going away&mdash;proving enterprise API architects right that an SOA is the way to go.
<p>If you are looking at the bigger API picture, the answer to this question is clearly no. Amazon, Salesforce, Twilio, and many other public APIs with straightforward business models are doing just fine. Just because a handful of companies who never quite had a business model, and never really gave their API efforts &nbsp;the resources they needed to be successful, doesn't mean that public APIs are a bad idea.
<p>Looking through my list of 2500+ APIs I track on, I can point to numerous other APIs that are about to shutter, which has nothing to do with the fact that they are public, and everything to do with not having the right business and political building blocks for their API. I&rsquo;m sorry if you are just in the game to exploit developers and get them to build things for your company, you can&rsquo;t be exploitative in this game and last, developers smell that shit a mile away--you have to give, just as much as receive.
<p>To be successful when it comes to APIs, you can't just launch an API, spend 100K on a popular API management solution, hire one guy (you know it, you hired a guy), and expect miracles within a couple months. It just doesn't work that way. APIs take a lot more grassroots building of an evangelist team, investment in a lot of projects, telling of many meaningful stories, and going to many conferences, Meetups, and events before anyone will know you exist, let alone building anything on your APIs.
<p>Public APIs being a failure is something the enterprise wants you to believe so they can sell you their SOA solutions disguised as API ones, Public APIs disappearing is more about the business and politics of APIs, and less about the technology and whether something is publicly available or not. If you don't have the company culture to invest in transparency, outreach, and providing meaningful resources that developers will need to be successful, you will fail in the public API game, so give up now.

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about how the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">open source API search engine APIs.io</a> can be deployed as an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/an-apisjson-collection-of-api-resources-across-your-public-partner-or-internal-resources/">internal API search engine</a>, as well as for public API discovery in the past. One aspect of this approach that I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, is that the search engine doesn&rsquo;t just return APIs in the search results, it can <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/">provide access to supporting building blocks</a> as well.
<p>The <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a> doesn't just provide a machine readable way to describe, and index your APIs, it also provides a way to describe the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that support your APIs like code samples, SDKs</a>, and other things API consumers will need when putting APIs to work for them.
<p>The indexing of these API support elements really starts to benefit company operations when you also bundle tools for non-developers alongside internal APIs, like spreadsheet connectors, <a href="http://d3.js">d3.js visualizations</a> built on top of APIs, and other elements that any user can reverse engineer, or just put to work immediately--no configuration necessary.
<p>Imagine if your internal staff could access any digital resources across the company, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">similar to what Amazon has done internally</a>, and not just find the API driven resources they need, but also the tools they need to apply them in their jobs. This is where APIs started getting really powerful, allowing anyone at your company to put APIs to work and get their jobs done in a self-service way, with a limited amount of IT resources required.

<p>I get a lot of folks who engage me about the API space, most of them are API providers, many are focused on API consumption, with only just a small few are looking the evangelism and analyst side of things. As far as I know I&rsquo;m the only individual out there looking at all industries, across all of these areas, working hard to understand how APIs are being applied across the board.
<p>I&rsquo;m always keeping an eye out for talent that is also working to expand their knowledge in the same way, but as the API universe expands I think this is going to be increasingly difficult, and I think we are going to start needing more analysts who focus within specific domains, and business sectors.
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching Mark Silverberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/skram">@skram</a>) over at <a href="http://SocialHealthInsights.com">SocialHealthInsights.com</a>, and is what I&rsquo;d considered to be an API expert when it comes to the convergence of healthcare and APIs.
<p>Mark is always hacking on interesting things related to healthcare, and pushing the envelope when it comes to healthcare APIs, by not just hacking on healthcare APIs, but also developing apps for Google Glass. Mark has developed his expertise in a similar way as I do, by hacking, telling stories, and consulting--which I think is the best way to develop yourself as an API expert.
<p>Earlier this spring the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">FDA was preparing their new developer area</a>, including the release of a handful of APIs like the drug labeling and adverse effects APis, and a handful of us with DC connections that were on the backchannel, providing feedback for the FDA during this beta period. Unfortunately I was too busy traveling to participate, but Mark was front and center providing some serious feedback on the API, resulting data, and the overall approach by the FDA.
<p>It has taken me four long years to develop my eye for not just the technical, but the business and political approach to delivering APIs, and it is something I&rsquo;ve only lightly touched on when it comes to the healthcare sector. I would say that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark is this</span>, cultivating a pretty critical eye for what is important when it comes to APIs in the healthcare space. If you are needing any guidance when it comes to planning, designing, deploying, and managing your healthcare APIs I recommend you connect with Mark, he can help you out like nobody else I know&mdash;make sure and tell him I sent you his way.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-key.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>One question I get pretty frequently from my readers, is about how they should explain APIs to their senior leaders, specifically the non-tech savvy executives. In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones, not just for a single company, but potentially an entire industry. To help support this effort, I&rsquo;m working through several stories that anyone can put to work when trying to convince their senior leaders that APIs are a thing--this week is about access to resources.
<p>APIs are all about making vital company resources available in a self-service, and secure way over the open Internet. Despite popular belief, most APIs are not publicly available, just the overview, documentation, code samples, and other building blocks are publicly available. If a developer actually wants to use an API they have to register, and be given access to API endpoints, before they can do anything with them. There are some pretty&nbsp;<a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">proven approaches to API management</a>&nbsp;out there, which include a centrally located developer center, simple API registration form, and potentially multiple service levels, that all help manage how APIs are accessed and put to use.
<p>API resources can be anything from a company directory, to details of specific projects, or possible access to company compute, storage and other common IT resources. Anything you do on your computer at work, or have published via your website, can be made available via APIs, and easily accessed through a public or private portal, in a 24/7, self-service manner--all without needing to make a request for IT resources. This type of efficiency is what every company needs to be competitive in coming years, ensuring that every employee has access to the resources they need to get their job done.
<p>Access to corporate or organization resources via APIs doesn&rsquo;t have to be something just for programmers. It is pretty likely that you already have web services at your company, but these APIs have been designed just for IT and geeks, where modern APIs come with supporting building blocks like widgets, spreadsheet connectors, and other tools that make API resources accessible and usable by anyone. This is an important distinction, one that is democratizing vital resources, and putting them into the  hands of people who can benefit the most, and not restricted by classic IT bottlenecks.
<p>IT, and developers will often say APIs aren&rsquo;t for the average business person, and many business folks are used to this type of rhetoric and have been trained to avoid anything API related, feeling this isn&rsquo;t for them&mdash;something tech folks like, because it keeps them in control, feeding into classic IT power structures. However, for the last 14 years, web APIs have been making vital resources available to internal and external developers who are building web and mobile applications, as well as the internal power user, and are something every company should consider, when looking to help everyone in a company do their job better.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>When I think about the concept "API mashup", It conjures up visions of clever hacks using Twitter and Google Maps from 2008 or 2009, where savvy developers would find innovative ways to mashup two or more APIs, and deliver some sort of web, and eventually mobile application on top of a couple of common APIs.
<p>In 2014 I think the concept of a mashup has evolved, and while the term has fallen out of popularity with some people, I think the topic is still extremely relevant, and is something I want to discuss more at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> at the end of this month. To continue this discussion we've asked four leaders from the world of APIs to join me on stage for a panel discussion we are calling &ldquo;The Next Generation API Stack&rdquo;:
<ul>
<li>Issac Roth (<a href="https://twitter.com/ijroth">@ijroth</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://strongloop.com/">StrongLoop</a></li>
<li>Kyle Wild (<a href="https://twitter.com/dorkitude">@dorkitude</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://keen.io/">Keen.io</a></li>
<li>Antony Falco (<a href="https://twitter.com/antonyfalco">@antonyfalco</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="http://orchestrate.io/">Orchestrate.io</a></li>
<li>Mehdi Medjaoui (<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/OAuth_io">oAuth.io</a></li>
<li>Justin Karneges (<a href="https://twitter.com/jkarneges">@jkarneges</a>) of <a href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout.io</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to discuss the concept of &ldquo;mashup&rdquo; which I think historically has represented what we do in the world of APIs, but is a term that has significantly moved on for experienced API developers.  I&rsquo;m looking to discuss this from a client side perspective, but also from the API provider, API aggregator, and analystics perspective as well. When you look at what innovators like StrongLoop, Keen.io, Orchestrate, and Webshell are doing, it is much more than just mashing up two APIs and building a web app.
<p>Today's tools allow you to quickly mashup multiple APIs into new API stacks, bringing together your own resources, as well as those of other API providers, and deliver an intelligent stack of resources that any web, mobile, or Itnernet of things developer can use to build apps. Another thing that has evolved is the number of APIs being used, based only upon my own usage, my apps have gone using 2-3 APIs in 2009, to using potentially 20-30 APIs in a single app&mdash;dramatically upping the stakes.
<p>I&rsquo;m still pulling together the topics and questions I&rsquo;ll be bringing up with Issac, Kyle, Antony, and Mehdi during The Next Generation API Stack panel at APIStrat, so if there is any topic you&rsquo;d like to discuss, please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll consider adding to the list. I&rsquo;ll see you in Chicago in a couple of weeks--<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/register.php">make sure and get registered ASAP</a>!

<p>There was a very interesting piece from venture capitalist Albert Wenger (<a href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger">@albertwenger</a>) of <a href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a> over the labor day weekend, called <a href="http://continuations.com/post/96355016855/labor-day-right-to-an-api-key-algorithmic-organizing">Labor Day: Right to an API Key (Algorithmic Organizing)</a>,&nbsp;that I&rsquo;ve had open ever since and wanted to take a moment to add my thoughts to. First let me say, I agree 100% with Albert&rsquo;s post, but I felt that the piece left out some very critical elements, which I think Albert simply left out because he was just trying to get a short thought published over a holiday weekend, but I feel pretty strongly these points are critical to his argument, and should be put out there.
<p>You can read the <a href="http://continuations.com/post/96355016855/labor-day-right-to-an-api-key-algorithmic-organizing">full post over on Albert's blog</a>, but I think this statement sums it up nicely:
<blockquote><em>There is a simple and universal regulatory change that would dramatically shift the bargaining power: an individual right to an API Key. By this I mean a key that would give an enduser *full* read/write access to the system including every action or screen the enduser can take or see on the web site or application. Alternatively one could think of this as an individual right to be represented by an algorithm.</em></blockquote>
<p>Shortly after Albert published his post, his partner Fred Wilson (<a href="https://twitter.com/fredwilson">@fredwilson</a>) chimed in with his own post, called <a href="http://avc.com/2014/09/algorithmic-organizing/">Algorithmic Organizing</a>,&nbsp;and again I took just single paragraph that I think sums it up:
<blockquote><em>I believe that in the long run these platforms may/will be replaced by blockchain based networks of labor where there is no platform middleman and there would be no need for a legal right to an API because all the data would be public by default.</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree with what both Albert and Fred are saying, and it makes me happy to see such prominent VC firms seeing the future in this way. What I wish to add to this conversation is some critical thought around the the business and political building blocks that often times don't get discussed in these conversations, but are actually the real reason this vision can work, but at the same time are why this vision could also become more dangerous than the one we currently have.
<p>The dangerous part I refer to, is the blind faith that the algorithm can represent us, providing some neutral, pure extension of ourselves, free of the power structures that perpetuate much of the divide between the haves and have nots that we see in the physical world. I believe that APIs have all the potential to deliver a better future, but the API, and the keys, are just two variables in the algorithm in which they Albert and Fred speak of, when in reality there are numerous other variables at play that need to be discussed as well, or we will find ourselves in the same situations we currently are, but a potentially more dangerous world where the algorithm obfuscates any exploitation that is happening, and protects the perpetrator.
<p><strong>Passive Aggressive API Rate Limiting</strong> <br />The easiest way to limit the power any developer or end-user that is given by an API, is rate limiting. Rate limits can be established to restrict what you can access by the second, minute, hour, day, or any other configuration, making it pretty near impossible to realize any power or control you may think you have been given by a service. Most API providers are transparent with their rate limiting, and publish simple explanations of what they limit, and why, acknowledging the real world need to reduce overhead in API operations, and provide a certain quality of service for everyone. The problem with rate limiting comes in when platforms are not clear about their motivations for rate limiting, what the limitations are, and the actual rate limits to do reflect what is published publicly.
<p><strong>Hiding Motives Behind API Error Handling </strong><br />Error handling on API requests are great way to limit actual access to any API resource, allowing the API provider to hide behind errors in the system, when in reality they are purposefully working to limit what you can actually do with the API. Errors can be generated per user, application or for entire groups, making it almost impossible to hold platforms accountable when it comes to making resources truly accessible. I&rsquo;m not saying this is a common practice for  API providers, I&rsquo;m just saying that it is technically feasible, and I am pretty damn sure I&rsquo;ve seen it in the wild, making it a real concern for me. Even if it occurs due to incompetency, it is still preventing you from being truly accessing any resources, and making the truly algorithm represent you.
<p><strong>Service Stability Can Bring Down Any Vision </strong><br />Building on the API error handling described above, overall service stability is a common way that API driven resources can be also rendered useless. Sure a company has an API, and you have an API key to access resources made available via that API, but if you can&rsquo;t actually connect to the API in a reliable way, what does it matter? There are a number of reasons service stability can be unreliable, it can be due a lack or resources, incompetence, or it can be intentional&mdash;as a recovering IT director, I can guarantee I&rsquo;ve seen this in action. I don&rsquo;t care how open your API is, if it isn't reliable it will not provide any value to anyone.
<p><strong>Security Needs To Be Priority </strong><br />An open, publicly available API might be great for you to gain access to your online resources, and the assets of any company, organization, or government agency, but the same can instantly be used against you if security is not given top priority. Security is not a reason to avoid APIs, just like websites, and other systems, APIs can be secured, but if it is not done right, and systems are not properly monitored, any API can be breached, going from APIs being a good thing, to APIs being the worst thing on earth&mdash;demonstrating pretty clearly this is more than just about the technology of APIs.
<p><strong>Terms of Service Rule Everything </strong><br />The Terms of Service (TOS) provide a legal framework for developers, and end-users to operate within, set forth by a platform. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API, and ultimately how end-users can make a system work for them. If the TOS are out of balance, no amount of API access will matter if you are legally compromised in what you can actually do with resources.
<p><strong>Transparency in Partner Tiers Of Access</strong><br />One of the benefits of modern approaches to APIs is the ability to compose different sets of services, and multiple access levels for different partners. Partner access is a great way to incentivize development on top of any platform, and give higher levels of access to those who contribute to the value of a platform.  Where this model begins to break down is when there is a lack of transparency, and platforms do not share information about what levels of access actually exist, which basically brings us back to the good ol boy networks we currently see across virtually any industry.
<p><strong>Paying Attention To Privacy </strong><br />Privacy policies also protect the interests of partners, developers and platform users, while also protecting the API owner from damaging activity on their platform. Like an API terms of service, privacy policies need to strike a balance that protects everyone involved, while also allowing for innovation and commercial activity. APIs can very technically sound, but if the privacy of end-users are not respected, an API can become a liability for everyone involved. Privacy is another area that we will see increasingly become a problem in the future, preventing many from seeing APIs as a good thing, but if done right we can make sure APIs reflect the vision Albert and Fred speak of.
<p><strong>Who Owns The Information I Pull Via An API </strong><br />Content and data ownership is an extremely contentious topic right now, with platforms claiming they own content that is generated using their services, and end-users rightfully feeling they have a stake in ownership of the content, data, media, and other information they generate on the platform. What good is API access, if I have no ownership of the content we generate via the platform? Sure I can access valuable resources, but if I can&rsquo;t legally do anything with it, what value is created by the API and its underlying algorithm?
<p><strong>The Deprecation Of Any API Led Vision </strong><br />An API deprecation policy sets expectations with API consumers about when and how API resources will be shut down. These policies help build trust with API developers and end-users, giving them an idea of how long they can depend on an API resource, and what they can expect when an API reaches the end of life. You may have access to data and content that a platform contains, complete with API access, but if that service can go away at any point after an acquisition, or due to lack or resources or leadership, and you do not have any sort of heads up, an API is immediately rendered meaningless in this wider discussion.
<p><strong>The Power of Industry Influence </strong><br />As I watch the enterprise and government take notice of the API space, I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty clear examples of industry influence over the value brought to the table by APIs. I do not care how open, transparent, and technically sound your API is, and you can follow every bit of my advice, but if the 1000 lb gorilla in any industry is not happy with a service, an API will be no defense against acquisition, shutdown, or their legal attack. If a large corporate or government entity doesn't like your platform, they can shut you down, even if it is just through a sustained legal attack. This is one of my biggest concerns about VC investment in seemingly open, and altruistic APIs driven platforms, is that your investors always provide a doorway for industry influence to change the course of your API, no matter what you might believe as the platform owner.
<p><strong>The Smoke And Mirrors Of "Open"<br /></strong>One of the most used terms in the world of APIs is &ldquo;open", and at the same time is also one of the most abused terms I know of. All of the reasons listed above can affect how truly open any API, platform and company is, preventing Albert and Fred&rsquo;s vision from ever becoming a reality. I could list another 50 ways that API providers prevent &nbsp;access to content and resources via APIs, ranging from lack of communication to complex pricing. My goal with this post is to show that there are some very real ways in which APIs can be used against the average worker and citizen, and that APIs are not good, bad, nor neutral&mdash;just like algorithms. They just reflect the intentions of their creators, and while I think there are many opportunities to make sure they reflect us, the end-user, citizen and worker, I think more often than not, they reflect the desires of their owners.
<p><strong>Twitter As The Perpetual Poster Child </strong><br />I really love Twitter, and I think the platform is amazing. The company has made some very serious effot to improve problems on their API platform, but they still are the best example I can use to demonstrate how every one of these variables listed can be used against the access and freedom an API could provides, without you even knowing it. When it comes to demonstrating the power that APIs bring to the table, and the democratization of our digital resources, Twitter is a shining example. When it comes to demonstrating how an API can be leveraged against its users, and algorithmic organizing can just as easily be used against us, Twitter is a shining example. Search across the API Evangelist network and you will see I&rsquo;m both a lover and critic of Twitter, and I do not believe Dick Costolo is Mr. Smithers plotting and scheming how Twitter can screw us all over, but I do think at scale, after you&rsquo;ve taken a certain amount of funding, and you become interesting to the powers that be&mdash;things change, and an API, and the algorithms behind can be used in very harmful ways.
<p><strong>Algorithmic Transparency </strong><br />It is easy to get excited about the potential around APIs and algorithms. I don't have a problem with this, more power to you (pun intended), however I personally feel algorithmic solutionism, and API solutionism for that matter, is not healthy. The way forward involves transparency, and communication around some of the very difficult areas I&rsquo;ve listed. Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) wrote a great post at TechRepublic earlier this year, called <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-driven-policy-and-commerce-requires-algorithmic-transparency/">data-driven policy and commerce requires algorithmic transparency</a>, which I think sums up this concept very nicely. For all of this to work, there has to be enough sunlight to keep things disinfected or we are going to see many of the same problem we see in the physical world, as well as a whole bunch of new problem we&rsquo;ve never anticipated.
<p><strong>Algorithmic Accountability </strong><br />Additionally, I don&rsquo;t feel that even algorithmic transparency will be enough, we have to make sure companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and individuals are held accountable for their actions. If there is no way to hold companies accountable for their violations in the ways discussed above, what does an open, transparent API or algorithm even matter? It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, and it doesn&rsquo;t give us any balance, it just transfers the same power structures we&rsquo;ve known in the physical world to the virtual world, but now things are even more difficult to understand or hold any individual or company accountable for their malicious activity.
<p>As I said earlier, I totally agree with Albert Wenger and Fred Wilson on their labor day API thoughts. I feel that every company, organization, institution, government agency, and even many individuals should have APIs, and that they are the key to a better future. However I think many of these entities will also omit very important detail from API discussions, similar to each of Albert and Fred&rsquo;s posts. I do not believe they did it intentionally, or have any ill intent, but I think in our obsession with technology, algorithms, and APIs, we can miss a lot, and this is what many companies will count on, and use to their advantage.
<p>If we do not pay attention to how the technological, business, and political building blocks are being used for exploitation, and manipulation, we are creating an even more dangerous divide between the haves and have nots, while opening up serious opportunities for abuse by the ruling merchant class, and further erode the rights we enjoy as workers, not moving them in a more positive direction. The real scary part for me, is that you probably won&rsquo;t ever even notice that any of this exploitation is evn occurring, and it will be very difficult to hold anyone accountable, all because of the magic of the algorithm and APIs.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-knowledge-transfer.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>One question I get pretty frequently from my readers, is how should they explain APIs to senior leaders, specifically the executives who aren't tech savvy. In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones for not just a specific company, but potentially an entire industry&mdash;so I wanted to provide some material you can use in your own conversations.
<p>First APIs are just like websites, but instead of being for humans they are meant for other desktop, web, server, and mobile applications. When you go to twitter.com you get an HTML listing of tweets, and when you go to api.twitter.com you get back JSON which is meant for other application to read, where the HTML is meant to make visible for the human API--that is it, that is the difference.
<p>I use Twitter in this example, but APIs can be used to deliver any data, content, or even programmatic resource like say an image resize or convert a Word document to a PDF file. APIs act just like web or mobile applications, and let you read, update, add, or delete any of these resources that have been made available via an API.
<p>When having this conversation, make sure and remind your leadership of the years between 1995 and 2000, when we were trying to convince our leadership that we should have websites. Remember all that selling we had to do to convince leadership that our company should have a website? Is there any question about whether or not your company should have a website in 2014? NO! This is the same thing that is going on with APIs between 2010 and 2015, and by 2015 to 2020, if your company doesn't have an API you will be at a serioius disadvantage.
<p>To get started, any data or content that you have on your website should be available via an API. This helps you easily make things like company directory, product and service listings, and a blog accessible to be on any mobile application, website, or any server or desktop application. APIs are not about the next crazy software trend, it uses the same technology as delivering your website, but instead of launching a single site, your valuable resources are now instantly available for integration with any website and mobile application.
<p>I have about ten separate examples like this to help you have conversation with your leadership about APIs. My goal is to try and keep them short, concise and something you can easily use to help convince your company that an API centric approach is right for your business. If you have specific scenarios you&rsquo;d like to address, feel free to ping me and let me know.

<p><a href="https://familysearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/250px-FamilySearch_logo.svg.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>In my work everyday as the API Evangelist, I get to have some very interesting conversations, with a wide variety of folks, about how they are using APIs, as well as brainstorming other ways they can approach their API strategy allowing them to be more effective. One of the things that keep me going in this space is this diversity. One day I&rsquo;m looking at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/swagger-apisjson-and-review-for-the-new-developertradegov/">Developer.Trade.Gov for the Department of Commerce</a>, the next talking to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">WordPress about APIs for 60 million websites</a>, and then I&rsquo;m talking with the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the Family Search API, which is actively gathering, preserving, and sharing genealogical records from around the world.
<p>I&rsquo;m so lucky I get to speak with all of these folks about the benefits, and perils of APIs, helping them think through their approach to opening up their valuable resources using APIs. The process is nourishing for me because I get to speak to such a diverse number of implementations, push my understanding of what is possible with APIs, while also sharpening my critical eye, understanding of where APIs can help, or where they can possibly go wrong. Personally, I find a couple of things very intriguing about the Family Search API story:
<ol>
<li>Mapping the worlds genealogical history using a publicly available API &mdash; Going Big!!</li>
<li>Potential from participation by not just big partners, but the long tail of genealogical geeks</li>
<li>Transparency, openness, and collaboration shining through as the solution beyond just the technology</li>
<li>The mission driven focus of the API overlapping with my obsession for API evangelism intrigues and scares me</li>
<li>Have existing developer area, APIs, and seemingly necessary building blocks but failed to achieve a platform level</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to talking with anyone about their startup, SMB, enterprise, organizational, institutional, or government API, always leaving open a 15 minute slot to hear a good story, which turned into more than an hour of discussion with the Family Search team. See, Family Search already has an API, they have the technology in order, and they even have many of the essential business building blocks as well, but where they are falling short is when it comes to dialing in both the business and politics of their developer ecosystem to discover the right balance that will help them truly become a platform&mdash;which is my specialty. ;-)
<p>This brings us to the million dollar question: <em><strong>How does one become a platform?</strong></em>
<p>All of this makes Family Search an interesting API story. The scope of the API, and to take something this big to the next level, Family Search has to become a platform, and not a superficial &ldquo;platform&rdquo; where they are just catering to three partners, but nourishing a vibrant long tail ecosystem of website, web application, single page application, mobile applications, and widget developers. Family Search is at an important reflection point, they have all the parts and pieces of a platform, they just have to figure out exactly what changes need to be made to open up, and take things to the next level.
<p>First, let&rsquo;s quantify the company, what is FamilySearch? &ldquo; For over 100 years, FamilySearch has been actively gathering, preserving, and sharing genealogical records worldwide&rdquo;, believing that &ldquo;learning about our ancestors helps us better understand who we are&mdash;creating a family bond, linking the present to the past, and building a bridge to the future&rdquo;.
<p>FamilySearch is 1.2 billion total records, with 108 million completed in 2014 so far, with 24 million awaiting, as well as 386 active genealogical projects going on. Family Search provides the ability to manage photos, stories, documents, people, and albums&mdash;allowing people to be organized into a tree, knowing the branch everyone belongs to in the global family tree.
<p>FamilySearch, started out as the Genealogical Society of Utah, which was founded in 1894, and dedicate preserving the records of the family of mankind, looking to "help people connect with their ancestors through easy access to historical records&rdquo;. FamilySearch is a mission-driven, non-profit organization, ran by the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All of this comes together to define an entity, that possesses an image that will appeal to some, while leave concern for others&mdash;making for a pretty unique formula for an API driven platform, that doesn&rsquo;t quite have a model anywhere else.
<p>FamilySearch consider what they deliver as as a set of record custodian services:
<ul>
<li><strong>Image Capture -</strong> Obtaining a preservation quality image is often the most costly and time-consuming step for records custodians. Microfilm has been the standard, but digital is emerging. Whether you opt to do it yourself or use one of our worldwide camera teams, we can help.</li>
<li><strong>Online Indexing -</strong> Once an image is digitized, key data needs to be transcribed in order to produce a searchable index that patrons around the world can access. Our online indexing application harnesses volunteers from around the world to quickly and accurately create indexes.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Conversion -</strong> For those records custodians who already have a substantial collection of microfilm, we can help digitize those images and even provide digital image storage.</li>
<li><strong>Online Access -</strong> Whether your goal is to make your records freely available to the public or to help supplement your budget needs, we can help you get your records online. To minimize your costs and increase access for your users, we can host your indexes and records on <a href="http://familysearch.org/">FamilySearch.org</a>, or we can provide tools and expertise that enable you to create your own hosted access.</li>
<li><strong>Preservation -</strong> Preservation copies of microfilm, microfiche, and digital records from over 100 countries and spanning hundreds of years are safely stored in the Granite Mountain Records Vault&mdash;a long-term storage facility designed for preservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>FamilySearch provides a proven set of services that users can take advantage of via a web applications, as well as iPhone and Android mobile apps, resulting in the online community they have built today. FamilySearch also goes beyond their basic web and mobile application services, and is elevated to software as a service (SaaS) level by having a pretty robust developer center and API stack.
<p><strong>Developer Center<br /></strong>FamilySearch provides the required first impression when you land in the <a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/">FamilySearch developer center</a>, quickly explaining what you can do with the API, "FamilySearch offers developers a way to integrate web, desktop, and mobile apps with its collaborative Family Tree and vast digital archive of records&rdquo;, and immediately provides you with a getting started guide, and other supporting tutorials.
<p>FamilySearch provides access to over 100 API resources in the twenty separate groups: Authorities, Change History, Discovery, Discussions, Memories, Notes, Ordinances, Parents and Children, Pedigree, Person, Places, Records, Search and Match, Source Box, Sources, Spouses, User, Utilities, Vocabularies, connecting you to the core FamilySearch  genealogical engine.
<p>The FamilySearch developer area provides all the common, and even some forward leaning technical building blocks:
<ul>
<li>oAuth 2.0</li>
<li>simple, consistent web API design</li>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/guides/hypermedia">hypermedia</a></li>

<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/partnering">Partner Tier</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is even an application gallery showcasing what web, mac &amp; windows desktop, and mobile applications developers have built. FamilySearch even encourages developers to &ldquo;donate your software skills by participating in community projects and collaborating through the FamilySearch Developer Network&rdquo;.
<p>Many of the ingredients of a platform exist within the current FamilySearch developer hub, at least the technical elements, and some of the common business, and political building blocks of a platform, but what is missing? This is what makes FamilySearch a compelling story, because it emphasizes one of the core elements of API Evangelist&mdash;that all of this API stuff only works when the right blend of technical, business, and politics exists.
<p><strong>Establishing A Rich Partnership Environment </strong>
<p>FamilySearch has some strong partnerships, that have helped establish FamilySearch as the genealogy service it is today. FamilySearch knows they wouldn&rsquo;t exist without the partnerships they&rsquo;ve established, but how do you take it to the next and grow to a much larger, organic API driven ecosystem where a long tail of genealogy businesses, professionals, and enthusiasts can build on, and contribute to, the FamilySearch platform.
<p>FamilySearch knows the time has come to make a shift to being an open platform, but is not entirely sure what needs to happen to actually stimulate not just the core FamilySearch partners, but also establish a vibrant long tail of developers. A developer portal is not just a place where geeky coders come to find what they need, it is a hub where business development occurs at all levels, in both synchronous, and asynchronous ways, in a 24/7 global environment.
<p>FamilySearch acknowledge they have some issues when it comes investing in API driven partnerships:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Platform&rdquo; means their core set of large partners</li>
<li>Not treating all partners like first class citizens</li>
<li>Competing with some of their partners</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use their own API, creating a gap in perspective</li>
</ul>
<p>FamilySearch knows if they can work out the right configuration, they can evolve FamilySearch from a digital genealogical web and mobile service to a genealogical platform. If they do this they can scale beyond what they&rsquo;ve been able to do with a core set of partners, and crowdsource the mapping of the global family tree, allowing individuals to map their own family trees, while also contributing to the larger global tree. With a proper API driven platform this process doesn&rsquo;t have to occur via the FamiliySearch website and mobile app, it can happen in any web, desktop, or mobile application anywhere.
<p>FamilySearch already has a pretty solid development team taking care of the tech of the FamilySearch API, and they have 20 people working internally to support partners. They have a handle on the tech of their API, they just need to get a handle on the business and politics of their API, and invest in the resources that needed to help scale the FamilySearch API being just a developer area, to being a growing genealogical developer community, to a full blow ecosystem that span not just the FamilySearch developer portal, but thousands of other sites and applications around the globe.
<p><strong>A Good Dose Of API Evangelism To Shift Culture A Bit</strong>
<p>A healthy API evangelism strategy brings together a mix of business, marketing, sales and technology disciplines into a new approach to doing business for FamilySearch, something that if done right, can open up FamilySearch to outside ideas, and with the right framework manage to allow the platform to move beyond just certification, and partnering to also investment, and acquisition of data, content, talent, applications, and partners via the FamilySearch developer platform.
<p>Think of evangelism as the grease in the gears of the platform allowing it to grow, expand, and handle a larger volume, of outreach, and support. API evangelism works to lubricate all aspects of platform operation.
<p>First, lets kick off with setting some <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">objectives</span></strong> for why we are doing this, what are we trying to accomplish:
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase Number of Records - </strong>Increase the number of overall records in the FamilySearch database, contributing the larger goals of mapping the global family tree.</li>
<li><strong>Growth in New Users -</strong> Growing the number of new users who are building on the FamilySearch API, increase the overall headcount fro the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Growth In Active Apps -</strong> Increase not just new users but the number of actual apps being built and used, not just counting people kicking the tires.</li>
<li><strong>Growth in Existing User API Usage -</strong> Increase how existing users are putting the FamilySearch APIs. Educate about new features, increase adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -</strong> One of the top reasons for designing, deploying and managing an active APIs is increase awareness of the FamilySearch brand.</li>
<li>What else?</li>
</ul>
<p>What does <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>developer engagement</strong></span> look like for the FamilySearch platform?
<ul>
<li><strong>Active User Engagement - </strong>How do we reach out to existing, active users and find out what they need, and how do we profile them and continue to understand who they are and what they need. Is there a direct line to the CRM?</li>
<li><strong>Fresh Engagement - </strong>How is FamilySearch contacting new developers who have registered weekly to see what their immediate needs are, while their registration is fresh in their minds.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Engagement -</strong> How are historical active and / or inactive developers being engaged to better understand what their needs are and would make them active or increase activity.</li>
<li><strong>Social Engagement -</strong> Is FamilySearch profiling the  URL, Twitter, Facebook LinkedIn, and Github profiles, and then actively engage via these active channels?</li>
</ul>
<p>Establish a Developer Focused <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blog For Storytelling</span></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects - </strong>There are over 390 active projects on the FamilySearch platform, plus any number of active web, desktop, and mobile applications. All of this activity should be regularly profiled as part of platform evangelism. An editorial assembly line of technical projects that can feed blog stories, how-tos, samples and Github code libraries should be taking place, establishing a large volume of exhaust via the FamlySearch platform.</li>
<li><strong>Stories -</strong> FamilySearch is great at writing public, and partner facing content, but there is a need to be writing, editing and posting of stories derived from the technically focused projects, with SEO and API support by design.</li>
<li><strong>Syndication -</strong> Syndication to Tumblr, Blogger, Medium and other relevant blogging sites on regular basis with the best of the content.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Essential <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Internal Evangelism</strong></span> Activities
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling - </strong>Telling stories of an API isn&rsquo;t just something you do externally, what stories need to be told internally to make sure an API initiative is successful.</li>
<li><strong>Conversations - </strong>Incite internal conversations about the FamilySearch platform. Hold brown bag lunches if you need to, or internal hackathons to get them involved.</li>
<li><strong>Participation -</strong> It is very healthy to include other people from across the company in API operations. How can we include people from other teams in API evangelism efforts.  Bring them to events, conferences and potentially expose them to local, platform focused events.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting -</strong> Sometimes providing regular numbers and reports to key players internally can help keep operations running smooth. What reports can we produce? Make them meaningful.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this evangelism starts with a very external focus, which is a hallmark of API and developer evangelism efforts, but if you notice by the end we are bringing it home to the most important aspect of platform evangelism, the internal outreach. This is the number one reason APIs fail, is due to a lack of internal evangelism, educating top and mid-level management, as well as lower level staff, getting buy-in and direct hands-on involvement with the platform, and failing to justify budget costs for the resources needed to make a platform successful.
<p><strong>Top-Down Change At FamilySearch</strong>
<p>The change FamilySearch is looking for already has top level management buy-in, the problem is that the vision is not in lock step sync with actual platform operations. When regular projects developed via the FamilySearch platform are regularly showcased to top level executives, and stories consistent with platform operations are told, management will echo what is actually happening via the FamilySearch. This will provide a much more ongoing, deeper message for the rest of the company, and partners around what the priorities of the platform are, making it not just a meaningless top down mandate.
<p>An example of this in action is with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">recent mandate from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">President Obama</span>, that all federal agencies should go &ldquo;machine readable by default&rdquo;</a>, which includes using APIs and open data outputs like JSON, instead of document formats like PDF. This top down mandate makes for a good PR soundbite, but in reality has little affect on the ground at federal agencies. In reality it has taken two years of hard work on the ground, at each agency, between agencies, and with the public to even begin to make this mandate a truth at over 20 of the federal government agencies.
<p>Top down change is a piece of the overall platform evolution at FamilySearch, but is only a piece. Without proper bottom-up, and outside-in change, FamilySearch will never evolve beyond just being a genealogical software as a service with an interesting API. It takes much more than leadership to make a platform.
<p><strong>Bottom-Up Change At FamilySearch</strong>
<p>One of the most influential aspects of APIs I have seen at companies, institutions, and agencies is the change of culture brought when APIs move beyond just a technical IT effort, and become about making resources available across an organization, and enabling people to do their job better. Without an awareness, buy-in, and in some cases evangelist conversion, a large organization will not be able to move from a service orientation to a platform way of thinking.
<p>If a company as a whole is unaware of APIs, either at the company or organization, as well as out in the larger world with popular platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and others&mdash;it is extremely unlikely they will endorse, let alone participate in moving from being a digital service to platform. Employees need to see the benefits of a platform to their everyday job, and their involvement cannot require what they would perceive as extra work to accomplish platform related duties. FamilySearch employees need to see the benefits the platform brings to the overall mission, and play a role in this happening&mdash;even if it originates from a top-down mandate.
<p>Top bookseller <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amazon</span> was already on the path to being a platform with their set of commerce APIs, when after a top down mandate from CEO Jeff Bezos, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon internalized APIs in such a way, that the entire company interacted, and exchange resources using web APIs</a>, resulting in one of the most successful API platforms&mdash;Amazon Web Services (AWS). Bezos mandated that if an Amazon department needed to procure a resource from another department, like server or storage space from IT, it need to happen via APIs. This wasn&rsquo;t a meaningless top-down mandate, it made employees life easier, and ultimately made the entire company more nimble, and agile, while also saving time and money. Without buy-in, and execution from Amazon employees, what we know as the cloud would never have occurred.
<p>Change at large enterprises, organizations, institutions and agencies, can be expedited with the right top-down leadership, but without the right platform evangelism strategy, that includes internal stakeholders as not just targets of outreach efforts, but also inclusion in operations, it can result in sweeping, transformational changes. This type of change at a single organization can effect how an entire industry operates, similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen from the ultimate API platform pioneer, Amazon.
<p><strong>Outside-In Change At FamilySearch</strong>
<p>The final layer of change that needs to occur to bring FamilySearch from being just a service to a true platform, is opening up the channels to outside influence when it comes not just to platform operations, but organizational operations as well. The bar is high at FamilySearch. The quality of services, and expectation of the process, and adherence to the mission is strong, but if you are truly dedicated to providing a database of all mankind, you are going to have to let mankind in a little bit.
<p>FamilySearch is still the keeper of knowledge, but to become a platform you have to let in the possibility that outside ideas, process, and applications can bring value to the organization, as well as to the wider genealogical community. You have to evolve beyond notions that the best ideas from inside the organization, and just from the leading partners in the space. There are opportunities for innovation and transformation in the long-tail stream, but you have to have a platform setup to encourage, participate in, and be able to identify value in the long-tail stream of an API platform.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Twitter</span> is one of the best examples of how any platform will have to let in outside ideas, applications, companies, and individuals. Much of what we consider as Twitter today was built in the platform ecosystem from the iPhone and Android apps, to the desktop app TweetDeck, to terminology like the #hashtag. Over the last 5 years, Twitter has worked hard to find the optimal platform balance, regarding how they educate, communicate, invest, acquire, and incentives their platform ecosystem. Listening to outside ideas goes well beyond the fact that Twitter is a publicly available social platform, it is about having such a large platform of API developers, and it is impossible to let in all ideas, but through a sophisticated evangelism strategy of in-person, and online channels, in 2014 Twitter has managed to find a balance that is working well.
<p>Having a public facing platform doesn&rsquo;t mean the flood gates are open for ideas, and thoughts to just flow in, this is where service composition, and the certification and partner framework for FamilySearch will come in. Through clear, transparent partners tiers, open and transparent operations and communications, an optimal flow of outside ideas, applications, companies and individuals can be established&mdash;enabling a healthy, sustainable amount of change from the outside world.
<p><strong>Knowing All Of Your Platform Partners</strong>
<p>The hallmark of any mature online platform is a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/03/taking-a-quick-look-at-the-leading-api-partner-programs/">well established partner ecosystem</a>.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve made the transition from service to platform, you&rsquo;ve established a pretty robust approach to not just certifying, and on boarding your partners, you also have stepped it up in knowing and understanding who they are, what their needs are, and investing in them throughout the lifecycle.
<p>First off, profile everyone who comes through the front door of the platform. If they sign up for a public API key, who are they, and where do they potentially fit into your overall strategy. Don&rsquo;t be pushy, but understanding who they are and what they might be looking for, and make sure you have a track for this type of user well defined.
<p>Next, quality, and certify as you have been doing. Make sure the process is well documented, but also transparent, allowing companies and individuals to quickly understand what it will take to certified, what the benefits are, and examples of other partners who have achieved this status. As a developer, building a genealogical mobile app, I need to know what I can expect, and have some incentive for investing in the certification process.
<p>Keep your friends close, and your competition closer. Open the door wide for your competition to become a platform user, and potentially partner. 100+ year old technology company <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/">Johnson Controls&nbsp;(JCI)</a> was concerned about what the competition might do it they <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix-developer-center)">opened up their building efficient data resources to the public via the Panoptix API platform</a>, when after it was launched, they realized their competition were now their customer, and a partner in this new approach to doing business online for JCI.
<p>When Department of Energy decides what data and other resource it makes available via Data.gov or the agencies developer program it has to deeply consider how this could affect U.S. industries. The resources the federal agency possesses can be pretty high value, and huge benefits for the private sector, but in some cases how might opening up APIs, or limiting access to APIs help or hurt the larger economy, as well as the Department of Energy developer ecosystem&mdash;there are lots of considerations when opening up API resources, that vary from industry to industry.
<p>There are no silver bullets when it comes to API design, deployment, management, and evangelism. It takes a lot of hard work, communication, and iterating before you strike the right balance of operations, and every business sector will be different. Without knowing who your platform users are, and being able to establish a clear and transparent road for them to follow to achieve partner status, FamilySearch will never elevate to a true platform. How can you scale the trusted layers of your platform, if your partner framework isn&rsquo;t well documented, open, transparent, and well executed? It just can&rsquo;t be done.
<p><strong>Meaningful Monetization For Platform</strong>
<p>All of this will take money to make happen. Designing, and executing on the technical, and the evangelism aspects I&rsquo;m laying out will cost a lot of money, and on the consumers side, it will take money to design, develop, and manage desktop, web, and mobile applications build around the FamilySearch platform. How will both the FamilySearch platform, and its participants make ends meet?
<p>This conversation is a hard one for startups, and established businesses, let alone when you are a non-profit, mission driven organization. Internal developers cost money, server and bandwidth are getting cheaper but still are a significant platform cost--sustaining a sale, bizdev, and evangelism also will not be cheap. It takes money to properly deliver resources via APIs, and even if the lowest tiers of access are free, at some point consumers are going to have to pay for access, resources, and advanced features.
<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">conversation around how do you monetize API driven resources is going on across government, from cities up to the federal government</a>. Where the thought of charging for access to public data is unheard of. These are public assets, and they should be freely available. While this is true, think of the same situation, but when it comes to physical public assets that are owned by the government, like parks. You can freely enjoy many city, county, and federal parks, there are sometimes small fees for usage, but if you want to actually sell something in a public park, you will need to buy permits, and often share revenue with the managing agency.  We have to think critically about how we fund the publishing, and refinement of publicly owned digital assets, as with physical assets there will be much debate in coming years, around what is acceptable, and what is not.
<p>Woven into the tiers of partner access, there should always be provisions for applying costs, overhead, and even generation of a little revenue to be applied in other ways. With great power, comes great responsibility, and along with great access for FamilySearch partners, many will also be required to cover costs of compute capacity, storage costs, and other hard facts of delivering a scalable platform around any valuable digital assets, whether its privately or publicly held.
<p>Platform monetization doesn&rsquo;t end with covering the costs of platform operation. Consumers of FamilySearch APIs will need assistance in identify the best ways to cover their own costs as well. Running a successful desktop, web or mobile application will take discipline, structure, and the ability to manage overhead costs, while also being able to generate some revenue through a clear business model. As a platform, FamilySearch will have to bring to the table some monetization opportunities for consumers, providing guidance as part of the certification process regarding what are best practices for monetization, and even some direct opportunities for advertising, in-app purchases and other common approaches to application monetization and sustainment.
<p>Without revenue greasing the gears, no service can achieve platform status. As with all other aspects of platform operations the conversation around monetization cannot be on-sided, and just about the needs of the platform providers. Pro-active steps need to be taken to ensure both the platform provider, and its consumers are being monetized in the healthiest way possible, bringing as much benefit to the overall platform community as possible.
<p><strong>Open &amp; Transparent Operations &amp; Communications</strong>
<p>How does all of this talk of platform and evangelism actually happen? It takes a whole lot of open, transparent communication across the board. Right now the only active part of the platform is the FamilySearch Developer Google Group, beyond that you don&rsquo;t see any activity that is platform specific. There are active Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and mainstream and affiliate focused blogs, but nothing that serves the platform, contributed to the feedback loop that will be necessary to take the service to the next level.
<p>On a public platform, communications cannot all be private emails, phone calls, or face to face meetings. One of the things that allows an online service to expand to become a platform, then scale and grow into robust, vibrant, and active community is a stream of public communications, which include blogs, forums, social streams, images, and video content.  These communication channels cannot all be one way, meaning they need to include forum and social conversations, as well as showcase platform activity by API consumers.
<p>Platform communications isn&rsquo;t just about getting direct messages answered, it is about public conversation so everyone shares in the answer, and public storytelling to help guide and lead the platform, that together with support via multiple channels, establishes a feedback loop, that when done right will keep growing, expanding and driving healthy growth. The transparent nature of platform feedback loops are essential to providing everything the consumers will need, while also bringing a fresh flow of ideas, and insight within the FamilySearch firewall.
<p><strong>Truly Shifting FamilySearch The Culture</strong>
<p>Top-down, bottom-up, outside-in, with constantly flow of oxygen via vibrant, flowing feedback loop, and the nourishing, and sanitizing sunlight of platform transparency, where week by week, month by month someone change can occur. It won&rsquo;t all be good, there are plenty of problems that arise in ecosystem operations, but all of this has the potential to slowly shift culture when done right.
<p>One thing that shows me the team over at FamilySearch has what it takes, is when I asked if I could write this up a story, rather than just a proposal I email them, they said yes. This is a true test of whether or not an organization might have what it takes. If you are unwilling to be transparent about the problems you have currently, and the work that goes into your strategy, it is unlikely you will have what it takes to establish the amount of transparency required for a platform to be successful.
<p>When internal staff, large external partners, and long tail genealogical app developers and enthusiasts are in sync via a FamilySearch platform driven ecosystem, I think we can consider a shift to platform has occurred for FamilySearch. The real question is how do we get there?
<p><strong>Executing On Evangelism</strong>
<p>This is not a definitive proposal for executing on an API evangelism strategy, merely a blueprint for the seed that can be used to start a slow, seismic shift in how FamilySearch engages its API area, in a way that will slowly evolve it into a community, one that includes internal, partner, and public developers, and some day, with the right set of circumstances, FamilySearch could grow into robust, social, genealogical ecosystem where everyone comes to access, and participate in the mapping of mankind.

<p>There is nothing easy about this. It takes time, and resources, and there are only so many elements you can automate when it comes to API evangelism. For something that is very programmatic, it takes more of the human variable to make the API driven platform algorithm work. With that said it is possible to scale some aspects, and increase the awareness, presence, and effectiveness of FamilySearch platform efforts, which is really what is currently missing.
<p>While as the API Evangelist, I cannot personally execute on every aspect of an API evangelism strategy for FamilySearch, I can provide essential planning expertise for the overall FamilySearch API strategy, as well as provide regular checkin with the team on how things are going, and help plan the roadmap. The two things I can bring to the table that are reflected in this proposal, is the understanding of where the FamilySearch API effort currently is, and what is missing to help get FamilySearch to the next stage of its platform evolution.
<p>When operating within the corporate or organizational silo, it can be very easy to lose site of how other organizations, and companies, are approach their API strategy, and miss important pieces of how you need to shift your strategy. This is one of the biggest inhibitors of API efforts at large organizations, and is one of the biggest imperatives for companies to invest in their API strategy, and begin the process of breaking operations out of their silo.
<p>What FamilySearch is facing demonstrates that APIs are much more than the technical endpoint that most believe, it takes many other business, and political building blocks to truly go from API to platform.

<p>I get quite a few nice comments about my blog(s) behind the scenes. Many are from the enterprise or insttutions, where I know I could never get away with publishing publicly. As the APi space has heated up in 2014, more people are trying to make sense of this API mayhem, and ultimately they come across my blog, and find &nbsp;valuable information that really helps them in their journey.
<p>I have been considering adding a page, listing some of the kind words I get from folks--maybe I will someday, but today I received a nice email, one I couldn't help but ask if I could repost--so here is a nice message from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saswatanand">Saswat Anand</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>Hi
<p>I have been reading your blogs and following you on Twitter for a couple of weeks now. I am a researcher in the Stanford&nbsp;University. By following your blogs and twits, I have been trying to understand the problems and opportunities in the API space.
<p>I just wanted to drop a quick note to thank you for being a true evangelist for API's. I find your blogs very interesting both because of valuable information and your writing style.
<p>Thanks,
<p>Saswat
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<p>I can't lie, the number one reason I do API Evangelist is for me, but the number two reason is to help folks like Saswat make sense of the space. I don't care whether you are a researcher in higher education, startup founder, or work at a government agency, I want you to understand APIs.
<p>I couldn't be more stoked in my career right now, and be happier with what I'm doing. I was a little concerned if I had made the right decision to start API Evangelist back in 2010 and 2011, but in 2014, it has turned into some pretty meaningful work for me.
<p>Thanks Saswat! Glad you find it valuable.

<p style="text-align: left;">I never properly wrapped up my experience at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft</a> last month, where I moderated a pretty important panel discussion on hypermedia with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://bit.ly/1mtrwki">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://bit.ly/1hBxi4m">@mikekelly85</a>) Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://bit.ly/1wv9KVR">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://bit.ly/1oC7Udw">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>).&nbsp;
<p>The discussion was pretty amazing, I will let you watch for yourself. The action actually starts right at about 30:00 minute mark, so there is a lot of dead space until then.&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/50652146?v=3&amp;wmode=direct" width="480" height="302"> </iframe> <br /><a style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; font-weight: normal; text-align: left;" href="http://www.ustream.tv" target="_blank">Broadcast live streaming video on Ustream</a>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Careful it is 3 hours of some pretty geeky talk, you might experience some hypermedia side effects. Seriously though, this is a pretty important video discussion about a very relevant, and often misunderstood part of API evolution. I highly recommend watching.
<p>I'm just getting back down to this time period in my Evernote stack, so look for some more stories out of API Craft and hypermedia after rewatching this talk. Also stay tuned for upcoming stories from <a href="http://iloveapis2014.com/">I Love APIs in San Francisco</a>, <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/">#API360 Summit in Washington DC</a>, and of course <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> at the end of September.

<p>I am making another pass through <a href="http://theapistack.com/">821 companies doing interesting things with APIs</a>, and flagging a handful of them as inactive. I will then attempt to contact each of the companies to see if anyone is home. All signs point to a handful of them being dormant projects, with silent blogs, twitter accounts, and other common streams you normally see flowing from API platforms.
<p>If any of them are indeed shutting down, I&rsquo;m going to urge them to consider open sourcing as much of their API platform as they can, from server side, and client side code to API definitions. At the very least I would like to capture a snapshot of the API, the title, description, image, and a machine readable Swagger spec of the interface, to help record the pattern for future consideration.
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some of these APIs will have investors they will have to consult before they can do something like open sourcing their API, and I&rsquo;m sure many of them won&rsquo;t even respond&mdash;I know how difficult it is after you have to put your startup down. Regardless I will at least flag them, make an attempt to contact, and if they don&rsquo;t respond I&rsquo;ll queue them up for profiling, and build an archive of abandoned API.
<p>In forty years I&rsquo;ll be that old crazy guy in the neighborhood who has piles and piles of old APIs laying around his yard. ;-)  These damn things will be worth a fortune some day!!
<p>Seriously, if you have an API that you are planning to deprecate, please reach out, I'd be happy to help archive it for the history books.

<p>title: ‘Explaining My Work Around APIs In Higher Education To Institutions’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m needing to quantify the work i do around APIs in higher education for a university in the U.K., so I figured I&rsquo;d craft into a story that I can share with my readers, and potentially other schools who would ask what it is that I do.
<p>I am interested in APIs in higher education because I feel strongly that our institutions are a fertile environment for ensuring that the next generation of our society possess the digital literacy they will need to navigate and find success in our increasingly digital world.
<p>When I mention that higher education institutions should be incorporating APIs into daily operations, most folks immediately think of a very technical, IT directed effort, which is one layer to the discussion that should be considered, but ultimately it is about developing an awareness, and engagement by administration, faculty, and the students with the increasingly public APIs that surround us, as well as internal institutional APIs.
<p>Our personal, and business lives are moving into the cloud. We are increasingly dependent on web-based and mobile applications in many aspects of our lives, and a growing number of these software services have APIs, and API-enabled actions that can be taken by anyone, even non-developers.
<p>My mission as the API Evangelist is to help everyone be aware that APIs exist, and that they are there to assist you in your personal and business life. Which brings me back to higher education institutions being an important place to expose students, and faculty to the benefits of APIs&mdash;in preparation for the increasingly API driven world unfolding around us.
<p>While I pay attention to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">over a 100 categories of APIs</a>, let&rsquo;s take one area, <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=images-stack">photos and images</a>, and use as a backdrop for what I do. I pay attention to over <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=images-stack">25 photo and image APIs</a> that provide image related services for developers, as well as direct access to the popular photo and image platforms we often depend on like Flickr and Instagram.
<p>As the API Evangelist I seek to pay attention to three key layers of the API space.
<p><strong>Technology of APIs - </strong>The geeky detail of how APIs work.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How do I authenticate?</li>
<li>Where do I read data from?</li>
<li>How do I write data?</li>
<li>Where are their code samples in my language?</li>
<li>Where is the WordPress plugin?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business of APIs - </strong>The business profile behind any online service.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How much does the service cost?</li>
<li>What are the limitations of what I can read or write?</li>
<li>What kind of support is available to me?</li>
<li>What are the long term plans of company?</li>
<li>Is the platform and tools well documented?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Politics of APIs -</strong> The often complex politics behind the curtain.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Do I own my data? Do I own my photos?</li>
<li>Can I specify the license for my photos?</li>
<li>What are the security practices?</li>
<li>Do I have control over who access my data (aka oAuth)?</li>
<li>Are code libraries, tools, and other code open sourced?</li>
<li>Are the terms of service easy to understand? Fair?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are much more than just technology and when you compare platforms like Flickr and Instagram which both act as photo sharing platforms, but have widely different approaches to the technology, business, and politics of each of their APIs. Sometimes it is just small details that can make the difference in whether or not a platform is the right choice or not for any individual or business.
<p>Beyond the technology, business, and politics I also pay attention to a handful of important trends that are growing out of the API space, to support API consumers.
<p><strong><a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">Realtime</a> -</strong> What options are there to interact in realtime.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How do I send / receive push notifications?</li>
<li>How do I use webhooks to receive updates?</li>
<li>Does this API have a streaming API?</li>
<li>What frameworks are available for real-time delivery?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">Aggregation</a> -</strong> Details on API data and information aggregation.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Can I get all of my images from Flickr, Instagram in a single feed?</li>
<li>Can I publish to one place, and have it syndicate out?</li>
<li>What options do I have for POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a> </strong>- Approaches to moving data from one system to another.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Can I migrate all of my flickr images to dropbox?</li>
<li>Can I keep all of my flick, instagram, and other photo sites in sync?</li>
<li>Where is the best place to store my photos?</li>
<li>Can I transform images when moving from location to location?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just about watching, and monitoring what is going on in the API space, my mission demands that I take what I learn and produce content that everyone else can benefit from. To fulfill this, I take all of my curation, analysis and awareness, and I work to create rich content that is designed for the widest distribution possible:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Short Form -</strong> Blog posts on my primary blogs (apievangelist.com, apivoice.com, api.report, theapistack.com, ipaevangelist.com, and kin lane.com)</li>
<li><strong>Long Form -</strong> White papers and ebooks that get published either public, or in some cases privately for internal organizational distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Presentations -</strong> Walkthroughs, talk presentations, and other interactive content that introduce people to the world of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Videos - </strong>Generating video content, around my research and presentations for publishing to YouTube and other video distribution sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly feel that it isn&rsquo;t enough that I'm doing all of this work online, I&rsquo;m also invested in stimulating in-person conversations in the following formats:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Conversations -</strong> In person, small group conversations with team members about APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Classrooms -</strong> Teaching large, or small classrooms at institutions around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Meetups -</strong> Supporting the creation of, and guest speaking of API focused meetup groups around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Conferences -</strong> I support up to 10 API conferences, while also putting on my global conference on APIs called @APIStrat</li>
</ul>
<p>API evangelism for me is not just about educating developers that APIs exist, it is about bringing awareness to the masses that APIs exist, and they are just the next evolutionary layer of the web that has penetrated almost all aspects of our lives. I focus on bringing an awareness of APIs to:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Individuals -</strong> Every citizen. API literacy is like financial literacy, you don&rsquo;t need to understand the entire banking system, but you will need some basic financial literacy to manage your bank account, and credit cards&mdash;the same applies in the API space, you don&rsquo;t need to understand everything about oAuth, but you should know who has access to your bank account, Facebook, and YouTube accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Business -</strong> More business activity is occurring online, and APIs are rapidly making business data and information available to the average business user for use in spreadsheets, mobile and web applications. Basic API literacy is fast becoming a requirement for many business sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Institutions -</strong> Over the last 15 years, many institutions have moved online, establishing a web presence, and connecting with partners, and constituents via the web. Large organizations need to understand how to use APIs to become more resilient, agile, and nimble in an age where much is changing when it comes to how the institutions of yesterday are perceived and stay relevant in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Government - </strong>Our government is required to do more with less, and APIs are the way we are slowly shifting government of all sizes, operate and engage constituents. Federal, state, and local governments are opening up data, making resources available via APis, and shifting the burden of governance to private sector partners, and even the public using APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Helping everyone understand the API undercurrents that are occurring right now all around us, is my mission as the API Evangelist. Everyone needs to understand that APIs exist, and have a basic understanding of how they can put them to use in their personal and business world. This isn&rsquo;t some grand, techno vision being sold from Silicon Valley that I'm looking to sell to universities, this is about what is already happening around us on the web, via our personal mobile devices, our homes, businesses, cars, and much much more. API Evangelist is about helping regular folks see what is happening, understand as much of it sa they can, allowing them to take meaningful action with the context of their lives.
<p>Continuing to bring this higher education API venn diagram tighter, is additional work I&rsquo;m doing with in two very quiet, but extremely important initiatives.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://umw.domains/">Domain of One&rsquo;s Own</a> -</strong> A program occurring at a handful of higher education institutions, where students get their own domain upon entering school, which can be used for their projects throughout their academic career, and even beyond if they choose&mdash;giving each student the gift of web literacy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a> - </strong>A secondary project spun out of Domain of One&rsquo;s Own which is about providing education materials, tools, and other resources for students, and any other individual to map out their online domain, and put together a strategy for reclaiming parts of their digital identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do my work I use my own custom developed internal system, where I aggregate information about over 2500 APIs, 1500 RSS feeds, 2500 Twitter accounts, and 750 Github accounts. From there, all of my short form and long form content, as well as presentations, and other supporting research gets published to <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">75 individual open source research projects managed using Github</a>. My intent is to make sure all of my research, and resulting data is publicly available in open formats, allowing anyone to fork, extend, and expand on what I do.
<p>How can my research help your institution better understand, internalize, and apply APIs?

<p>When it comes to APIs, the quickest way to get an API for your company, organization or government agency is to choose to only use online services that have APIs. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Github, Instagram, Flickr, and many other popular services you already use, all have APIs.
<p>As I&rsquo;m expanding on my tracking of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment tools</a>, to include deploying APIs via Google Spreadsheets, and to scraping data from websites, I can&rsquo;t help but step back and consider truly what is the easiest way to deploy an API, which really is about choosing to use online services that already have an API--no connecting to your backend systems necessary!
<p>We talk about APIs in the context of developers, using APIs to build applications for end-users, and provide system integrations. What if we talked about it in context of the users, and helping individual users aggregate their APIs into a single, personal API stack?
<p>As Joe or Jane user, I could have my own personal API hub, with code samples, and other resources to understand how to access my APIs. I&rsquo;m not sure how oAuth would be triggered in this scenario (needs more thought), if a developer wanted access to my Facebook or other private data, but if I ran WordPress, and included my Flickr photos in my API stack, API access could be pretty straightforward.
<p>Thinking of this in the context of enabling personal API hubs is a pretty far out there concept, but understanding that you can have an isntant API just by using common services that have APIs, is pretty powerful. In reality, the average person will rarely ever need a personal developer hub with a stack of APIs, but if we teach people that they need an API with all the service they use, so they can use services like Zapier, and the other API-enabled tools, we might just be able to keep SaaS providers honest, ensuring they always public APIs, transparency and data portability for end-users.

<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-excel-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the usage of spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs for several years now. Spreadsheets are everywhere, they are the number one data management tool in the world, and whether API developers like or not, spreadsheets will continue to collide with the API space, as both API providers, and consumers try to get things done using APIs.
<p>APIs are all about getting access to the resources you need, and spreadsheets are being used by both API providers and consumers to accomplish these goals. It makes complete sense to me that business users would be looking for solutions via spreadsheets, as they are one potential doorway to hacking for the average person&mdash;writing macros, calculations, and other dynamic features people execute within the spreadsheet.
<p>I know IT would like to think their central SQL, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and other database are where the valuable data and content assets are stored at a company, but in reality the most valuable data resources are often stored in spreadsheets across an organization. When it comes time to deploying APIs, this is the first place you should look for your datasources, resulting in Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet to API solutions like we&rsquo;ve seen from <a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>.
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets used by companies to deploy APIs in some of the following ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Microsoft Excel - </strong>Turning Microsoft Excel spreadsheets directly into APIs. by taking a spreadsheet, and generating an API is the fastest way to go from closed data resource to an API for anyone to access, even without programming experience.</li>
<li><strong>Google Spreadsheet -</strong> Mounting public and private Google Spreadsheets is an increasingly popular way to publish smaller datasets as APIs. Since Google Spreadsheets is web-based, it becomes very easy to use the Google Spreadsheet API to access any Spreadsheet in a Google account, then generate a web API interface that can allow for reading or writing to a spreadsheet data source via a public, or privately secured API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond deploying APIs I&rsquo;m seeing API providers provide some innovative ways for users to connect spreadsheets to their APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Client -</strong> Electronic parts search API Octopart has been providing a bill of materials (BOM) solution via <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">Microsoft Excel</a>, and now <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/25/ocotoparts-open-source-google-spreadsheet/">Google Spreadsheets</a>&nbsp;for their customers--providing a distributed parts catalog in a spreadsheet, that is kept up to date via public API.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Cache -</strong> I&rsquo;ve talked with U.S. Census and other data providers about how they provide Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet caches of API driven data, allowing users to browse, search and establish some sort of subset of data, then save as a spreadsheet cache for offline use. </li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Catch-All -</strong> Spreadsheets aren&rsquo;t always being used just about data, you can see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio storing SMS</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/13/using-excel-for-crowdsourced-data-gathering-and-reporting/">NPR using as crowdsourced engine</a>, making spreadsheets into a nice bucket for catching just about anything an API can input or output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving out of the realm of what API providers can do for their API consumers with spreadsheets, and into the world of what API consumers can do for themselves, you start to see endless opportunities for API integration with spreadsheets using reciprocity providers:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> - </strong>There are five pages of recipes on the popular API reciprocity provider Zapier that allow you to work with Google Docs, and 57 pages that are dealing directly with Google Drive, providing a wealth of tools that non-developers (or developers) can use when connecting common APIs up to Google Spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough movement in the area of Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets being used with APIs to warrant closer monitoring. To support this I've started publishing most of my research to an <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist spreadsheet research site</a>, which will allow me to better track, curate, tag, and tell stories around spreadsheets and APIs.
<p>As I do with my <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ API research projects</a>, I will update this site when I have time, publishing anything I've read, written, and companies I think are doing interesting things spreadsheets and APIs. I'm pretty convinced that spreadsheets will be another one of those bridge tools we use to connect where we are going with APIs, with the reality of where the everyday person is, just trying to get their job done.

<p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/">Enterprise social API Jive Software</a> wins for the best developer landing page. Normally I tell folks, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">like I did with Trade.gov last week</a>, that your landing page should have a short, precise description of what you API does&mdash;this is some seriously valuable real estate, and you have one chance to make an impression.
<p>I would put Jive Software into the category of more making a first impression, than providing a short description of what the API does:
<p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/jive-software/brew-up-something-awesome.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this approach for every API provider, but if you can do it right, and make a solid first impression&mdash;run with it! As an <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and <a href="http://ipaevangelist.com">IPA Evangelist</a>, I can seriously get behind a message like &ldquo;brew up something awesome&rdquo;. +1
<p>I like how they have apps, docs, APIs, and IPAs as taps, and the taps even work when you mouseover!  Seriously, all of this API shit is hard to make entertaining (trust me I know), and when you can provide this human touches while inciting innovation, they can go a long way in breaking the ice with consumers.
<p>Right above the taps Jive Software provides the essential getting started, and register links for their APIs, which signals that beyond the fun facade, they mean business, and want to help you onboard with using their APIs. I haven&rsquo;t dug deep into the Jive Software API to see what else is going on, but after this first impression it is likely I will be looking around more, now that they made a good first impression.

<p><a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">Containers</a> are a fast growing trend when it comes to delivering compute resources online. Reflecting the world of API design, I feel containers are about deploying exactly the cloud resources you will need to complete a specific compute objective, then putting everything into a single virtualized container definition, that can be forked, clone, scaled, and evolved indpendently of any other resources. Each individual container posesses everything it will need from the operating system, file system, database, necessary libraries, and APIs to accomplish its given objective.
<p>Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I would consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are often sold B2B, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use anywhere in the API economy.
<p>My goal is to understand how APIs and containers work together, and as I do with all of my research <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo</a> for tracking every piece of container news I read that I feel is relevant, each company doing interesting things containers, tools for working with containers, and ultimately my analysis. Cloud computing will continue to be the lead driver of innovation in the API space, and I feel the introduction of cloud computing in 2006&ndash;2008 gave legitimacy to web APIs&mdash;you could now deploy global infrastructure using web APIs, game on. I think containerization will take API design, deployment, management and integration to the next phase, and closer the early visions of a programmable web we all started envisioning around 2005.
<p>I will be taking each of my API designs, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">developing an Amazon Machine Image, Heroku App version, as well as a docker container definition</a>. I want every one of my open source API designs to have the option to be deployed in any cloud environment, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/23/push-button-api-deployment-with-the-heroku-button/">preferable with the click of a button, as with Heroku</a>. In the future it won&rsquo;t about knowing about all the APIs, it will be about having the right stack of APIs, that you can deploy anywhere, anytime.
<p>I will be talking on this subject at <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat in Chicago this September</a>, and also at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag in Colorado this November</a>, let me know if you want to connect around the subject.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-market-graph.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I have been doing a lot of research into the world of financial APIs, specifically looking at some of the larger companies providing APIs that deliver market news, data, corporate profiles, and other data that make markets go round.
<p>As I consider some of the common building blocks that are common across many financial API--real-time data frameworks, and visualization tools are two of the top items that I think will be part of every financial API stack in the future. Almost every API I looked at had some sort of real-time stream, promising data faster, as well as a way to extract meaning from these streams using template, or custom visualizations.
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time API services</a> and tools, and i&rsquo;ve been seeing some of these frameworks, like Firebase <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">getting baked in by default to some API platforms</a>. I am also tracking on visualization tools, I just don&rsquo;t have the research published as a Github repository yet, like I do with my real-time research.
<p>I will keep tracking on API providers who are doing interesting things with real-time or visualizations, and hopefully be able to publish more examples. I can&rsquo;t help but think there are some pretty interesting opportunities for open frameworks, and white label solutions for API providers when it comes to real-time, and visualization layers on top of their existing APIs.

<p>I was keeping an eye out for interesting API stories on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a> the other day and came across an cool notification startup that lives in the Stripe API ecosystem, called <a href="https://hooked.io/">Hooked</a>.
<p>Hooked allows users to set up notifications for any events related to a Stripe account. Hooked uses the Stripe API to disocver events, and then employs webhooks to send notifications.
<p>As I'm writing this story, I realize this is very similar to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/26/realtime-and-visualizations-will-be-key-in-financial-api-deployments/">previous story today about real-time and visualization layers for APIs</a>, and that notifications could easily be provided as a white label solution for API providers, giving them a ready to go notification layer to their APIs.
<p>Right now I lump notifications in my research under <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, but I think I will be pulling it out into its own research area. Notifications are real-time, but they are more messaging than just a real-time feature, but they are kind of more real-time than just a message too. Does that make sense?
<p>We'll see. That is the fun of my API Evangelist research network, is that all of it is pretty liquid&mdash;allowing me to keep moving things around until they make sense in my head.

<p>My friend Mark Silverberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/skram">@skram</a>), pointed out a very cool API the other day, that geolocates zip codes, and appropriately named&nbsp;<a href="http://ziplocate.us/">ZipLocate</a>. What I really like about ZipLocate is that they do one thing, and they do it well. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love me some AWS and Twilio, who have industrial grade APIs, but I also have a love for simple, lightweight APIs that focus on one thing.
<p>Another interesting thing about ZipLocate is that it is always free, and never rate limited. He says that it is relatively cheap to host the API, because bandwidth usage is light, with all API calls are heavily cached. I like this type of micro service design--I want thousands more just like it.
<p>What I also dig about ZipLocate is that if you <em>&ldquo;...don't trust the API to be around tomorrow? Host it yourself. Source code and data import scripts available on Github&rdquo;</em>. This is possible because the ZipLocate API is open source, and the data comes from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html">Census Bureau</a>. This approach to developing dead simple APIs on top of government data is really important, and I personally feel that <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/25/6482-datasets-available-across-22-federal-agencies-in-datajson-files/">all 6,482 data sets across 22 federal agencies who have published their data.json file</a>, should have APIs just like ZipLocate.
<p>It looks like ZipLocate is a project developed by Nathan Cahill (<a href="https://twitter.com/nathancahill">@nathancahill</a>). I like his style, and think his approach is simple, elegant, yet extremely powerful, and provides a blueprint that others can follow when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/23/models-for-api-driven-startups-built-around-public-data-/">designing, developing and deploying APIs built on top of public data</a>.

<p>I have been slowly producing my own stack of APIs, which I'm putting under <a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a> brand. My goal with each of these APIs is to do one thing, and do it well, then package up the server side code, API definition, and publish as its own standalone Github repository.&nbsp;
<p>I have an Evernote full of ideas for APIs, and I'm seeing plenty of great API designs that I could easily emulate from the rest of The API Stack. As I have time, I will deploy each of my API designs as an API Stack API, eventually looking to build a robust stack of utility APIs.
<p>To support this I've separate out my APIs here into two separate pages, my <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>, which will provide access to content across the API Evangelist network, and my <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a> which will all be the modular, API Stack designs.&nbsp;
<p>When I'm done deploying any new design, and I feel it is ready for primetime, I will list here for every to check out and play with.

<p>I was looking around the Google Developer area as part of some regular work, and I noticed an interesting page Google has under their mapping session, that <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/api-picker">help users decide which API they need</a>&nbsp;based upon their goals.
<p>As the page says: "<em>The API picker lists the most common things you may want to do on a map or with location-based data, and suggests the API that most suits your needs. For details about each API, follow the links to the related documentation.</em>"
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/api-picker"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/google/which-api-do-i-need.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>I don't think that the table layout Google uses is a particularly good one, resulting in a pretty busy looking matrix. I don't think it is a perfect solution, but I like the idea of providing developers with some sort of assistance in understand which API to use, based upon their goals.
<p>This is something that a larger API provider would probably do, but a simple little needs calculator that could help users translate what they are looking for into what the API does, is an interesting concept to play with for some API providers.

<p>As I&rsquo;m riding the build up for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">APIStrat in Chicago</a>, and preparing for <a href="http://iloveapis2014.com/">I Love APIs in San Francisco</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/">API 360 Summit in DC</a>, I can&rsquo;t help but think about how busy the API event scene is getting&mdash;in 2014 there are 14 separate conferences focused on the world of APIs.
<p>In the beginning there was just <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiconference.com/">Business of APIs</a>, then 3Scale and API Evangelist got together and started planning for @APIStrat, then immediately <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> happened, <a href="http://nordicapis.com/">Nordic APIs</a> came on the scene, <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft</a>a&nbsp; grew beyond just Meetup, and before you know we have 14 separate events.
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be biased here, because @APIStrat is my baby, and I&rsquo;ve been involved in supporting API Days since day, so these two events will always have a special place in my heart. Even with this I believe in interoperability in the community and I am working to support all of the events equally, so if you are organizing make sure and reach out.
<p>You can find me at I Love APIs in a couple weeks in San Francisco, as well as at API 360 in Washington DC the same week, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September, and Nordic APIs in October. Unfortunately we messed up in planning @APIStrat, and made it at the same time as REST Fest, which seriously pissed me off&mdash;so I won&rsquo;t be attending REST Fest yet again this year. :-( This is part of the reason I'm putting together this research, so I don't make this mistake again.
<p>As with the rest of my work, <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo, and website to give me a single place to aggregate information on API events</a>. I will do my best keep up to date, for my own education, but I am also looking to help you understand each of the events, the organizers, sponsors, speakers, and also who is attending. As I have time I will aso add a section for API Meetups, so we can keep tabs on the smaller API gatherings that are going on in various cities around the globe.
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to participate in one of the conferences listed as a speaker or sponsor let me know, I&rsquo;ll hook you up with the organizer. If you&rsquo;d like to organize a meet up in your town, or you would like to bring in guest speakers from the outside API community, let me know as well&mdash;no guarantees, but I will see what I can do.
<p>As with the rest of the space, I will do my best to keep my <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">API events research</a> up to date, and as with the rest of my research, feel free <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-events">fork and contribute</a> where you can&mdash;I need all the help I can get!

<p><a href="https://octopart.com/">Electronic search engine APIs Octopart</a> developed a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">pretty slick Microsoft Excel plugin for their API a while  back</a>, and have now taken it to the next level, with a <a href="https://octopart.com/blog/archives/2014/8/google-apps-add%252Don%253A-paulo%2527s-open-source-project">Google Spreadsheet connector for their API</a>. You can find a simple video on on their site, and the <a href="https://github.com/curtacircuitos/octopart-google-app">code on Github</a>.
<p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/curtacircuitos/octopart-google-app">open source Google Spreadsheet API connector</a>, you can connect to the latest electronic parts pricing and availability in your Google Docs, kept up-to-date using the <a href="https://octopart.com/api/home">Octopart API</a>&mdash;providing a pretty interesting way to maintain a bill of materials (BOM), across multiple providers.
<p>Octopart's approach to using both Microsoft Excel, and Google Spreadsheets as an interface for the average business person is pretty interesting, not because it is the perfect technological solution, but because it brings the value of APIs closer to the actual business problem owners.
<p>Octopart <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">helped increase my awareness of spreadsheets being in conjunction with APIs</a>, but after seeing other providers like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio using Google Spreadsheet for storing SMS</a>, and the increased usage of <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers like Zapier</a>, making me think spreadsheets have quite a future in the API space.
<p>What innovative uses of Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets are you seeing in conjunction with common, or even unique APIs?

<p>I am super stoked to announce that we have Andrew Nacin (<a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a>), the lead developer from WordPress keynoting <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago</a> next month. We are looking to continue the conversation around an official WordPress API, scheduled for inclusion in the WordPress 4.1 release.
<p>While an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">API for WordPress may not seem like anything that big</a>, when you think about it being baked into WordPress by default, it means that over 60 million websites will potentially get an API, and 22% of the top 10 million websites run WordPress&mdash;a pretty significant shift.
<p>WordPress is still taking feedback on their upcoming API release, and you can <a href="http://wp-api.org/">visit their website and participate there</a>, and now you can also come to Chicago the end of September, and hear Andrew talk about his work at WordPress, and participate in the convversation around the WordPress API afterwards in the halls.
<p>Make sure and <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/register.php">get registered soon</a>, you only have 4 weeks left before we all come together for @APIStrat in Chicago.

<p>The new <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button">Heroku Button</a> gets us one step closer to a new age of API deployment, where anyone can deploy the APIs they need without any developer or IT resources. As I&rsquo;m working on packaging up API designs for my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation API</a>, this type of approach is what I&rsquo;m envisioning for all of my APIs in the future&mdash;push button API deployment.
<p>You shouldn't have to wait to deploy the API you need. Just as we are beginning to deploy pre-packaged application stacks like Wordpress, and Drupal, we should be able to deploy common API deployments for images, blogs, videos, and much, much more, with a single click of a button. Once any new API is launched it can be configured, and connected to other systems using the API, allowing it to operate as part of larger stack, or stay as completely independent node &nbsp;that just checks in with the mother ship from time to time.
<p>While there will remain a handful of API leaders like Twilio and SendGrid who will have a big presence, many of the APIs in this next wave of API deployment will be smaller, and more transient in nature, taking advantage of current cloud trends around PaaS, and containerization.  This new type of APis will possess a self contained blueprint for the OS, database, server-side code, API definition, and even configuration, integration, and automation tooling for the API.
<p>I&rsquo;m working on Docker definitions for <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">creen capture</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation AP</a>, as well as other APIs I develop in the future, but first I think any API I deisn shouldl run as a Heroku app, that anyone can deploy in their own account with a single click of a button. It won't take much work to make this happen for any API I deploy, and since <a title="3Scale API Infrastructure" href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, which I use to secure my APIs, already <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/deploying-apis-using-heroku-and-3scale-addon/">runs on Heroku</a>--making securing, and managing my Heroku deployed APis seamless.

<p>The other night I was <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/18/all-government-should-have-a-social-media-directory-api/">writing about the need for a social media directory API</a>, like the one <a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/">the GSA has launched for the federal government</a>, but specifically for the City of Chicago. I was trying to get a list of each of the City of Chicago Twitter accounts, and while I&rsquo;m glad there is a <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/narr/misc/social_media.html">central social media account list</a>, I always want an API so I can eliminate the need for data entry.
<p>After I posted my story, Oliver Seiler (<a href="https://twitter.com/0seiler">@0seiler</a>) emailed me the <a href="https://www.govt.nz/api/v1">API endpoint for the New Zealand Government Directory API</a>, which doesn't include the social media information that our <a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">federal government social media directory API</a> delivers, but offers another look at what one possible pattern for government directory APIs is.
<p>This is one of the by-products of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">my profiling of federal government APIs</a>, that I will begin to see API patterns that ALL government possess, things like a directory API. There should be a WordPress of the government directory API, a open source PHP Web API, possessing a common API definition, allowing any government agency, of any level, to be able to quickly download and deploy a directory API for their branch of government.
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping when I&rsquo;m done with my profiling of 120 federal government APIs, I'll have better suggestions of which APIs patterns government agencies should be offering by default. I will also have API definitions for all of these government API patterns, which I can probably pretty quickly crank out server side API code to support&mdash;who knows maybe <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">Wordpress 4.1 will be available by then and I can use Wordpress as an API deployment framework</a>.
<p>Until then I will just start tracking on all the common patterns for government API deployment, and publish as stories her on API Evangelist, and on my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">federal government research site</a>. I'm thinking other things I'm tracking on, like API deployment using containers, and deployment via PaaS platforms like Heroku, will contribute to this type of API deployment across government as well, making it a very interesting time to be in tech.

<p><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">I stumbled across a cool resource out of Heroku today, their </a><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">HTTP API design guide</a>, which intends to direct practices for API design on the Heroku API platform.
<p>Heroku&rsquo;s goals around APIs design are, "consistency and focusing on business logic while avoiding design bikeshedding&rdquo;.  They put out the guide to drive consistent aPI design practices at Heroku, but are also interested in sharing with the wider API community.
<p>I think API design best practices are something every API provider should have, and publish publicly (on Github). I think it is ok to even fork, and modify existing guides like Heroku&rsquo;s or maybe <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">from 18F out of federal government</a>. This most important thing is that you have a guide that can guide your team, or other teams within your organization.
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m seeing more of these, I will start flagging, and aggregating them so we can browse and continue learn the API design practices from the leading API providers out there.

<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-bread.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" />
<p>In my monitoring of the API space, when I started seeing a large number of blog posts, tweets, companies, and other elements I track on get tagged with the same tag over and over, I take notice. My blogging, CRM, and news curation system all have their own <a href="http://theapistack.com/">tag cloud interface</a> for the week, showing which tags have been applied--so if a tag gets heavy usage, I know it.
<p>Over the last couple of years, I've spun up new research into other areas within the world of APIs, beyond my core <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, and <a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> research. I created separate buckets beyond just provide and consume to track on these new areas, called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">trends</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/opportunities/">opportunities</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/priorities/">priorities</a>.
<p>In 2014 it is beginning to seem like each of my trend research areas are getting baked directly into API platforms, ranging from real-time features with Firebase, to reciprocity by default using Zapier. API providers are learning that having a real-time layer, or a reciprocity layer baked into their platform is a good thing, and why reinvent the wheel when you have kick ass solutions like <a title="Firebase" href="https://bit.ly/1w9oJSq">Firebase</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/SzPnEh">Zapier</a>.
<p>It makes sense that API providers would be looking externally to deliver&nbsp;<a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a>, <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and even <a title="Voice APIs" href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a> layers for their API platforms--this stuff is hard, and why spread yourself too thin. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">Intuit just bought reciprocity provider itDuzzit</a>, and I think we will more providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">integrating Zapier into their platforms by default like Nimble did</a>. We'll also see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">more API platforms bring in Firebase as a real-time layer like Nest did for their Internet of Things (Iot) thermostat API platform</a>.
<p>Overall it seems like a white label solution that any API provider could put to use when considering solutions for aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice or even data solutions including spreadsheet connectors, analysis, and visualization, would do well in the space. At the very least, any company looking to step up and provide solutions in these areas, should definitely have a strong partner program like Zapier and Firebase have brought to the table.
<p>I will have to start considering how to migrate aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice out of the trends bucket and into either the provide or consume buckets, or maybe both. It would seem that both API providers and consumers need to be educated in these areas, and made aware of what solutions are available.
<p>I&rsquo;m not that worried about the overall structure of API Evangelist at the moment. That is one of the beautiful aspects of how I architected the site(s), is that each research area lives as its own node on the network, so I can move around, shift as I need to find the right formula&mdash;something that helps me in a very fast moving space, where my understanding is constantly shifting and evolving with the swift currents of the APi space.

<p>title: ‘FDA Finding Their API Mojo With A New Drug Label API’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I first wrote about <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">openFDA</a> back in June, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">showcasing the launch of their new developer area</a>, and I'm happy to see they aren't missing a beat when it comes to launching new APIs. I recently saw that openFDA just launch a new endpoint, called the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/label/">Drug Label API</a>, which allows you to query over 60K prescriptions and over-the-counter drug labels.
<p>It is satisfying to see such a large government agency find their API mojo. The original spark at the FDA was lit by Presidential Innovate Fellow Sean Herron (<a href="https://twitter.com/seanherron">@seanherron)</a>, but most recently Sean has handed off the iniative to an internal team who will keep they platform moving forward using the same formula.
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/Drug_facts_label_gl01.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>Beyond just the API, openFDA is also seriously putting the "open" in openFDA with:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fda/openfda">Public Repo on GitHub&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">Extensive Community Q&amp;A on StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open.fda.gov/terms/">Progress Terms of Service for Government</a></li>

<p>Everything the openFDA is doing provides a great blueprint for other agencies to follow, from their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">creative evolution of the interactive API documentation</a>, to encouraging other federal agencies to fork, and use the openFDA TOS in their own platforms.
<p>The work coming out of the FDA makes me happy, because it sets a strong example that other agencies can follow, provides the rest of us with something positive that we can highlight when working to change public opinion, but also because it is such extremely vital data, and should be available in full download, and API format so that it can stimulate web and mobile app development, and system integration across the private sector.

<p>I&rsquo;m adding <a href="https://platform.pokitdok.com">PokitDok</a>, a simple API for healthcare to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, and my overall <a href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com/">APIs in healthcare research</a>. Well I didn't exactly add them, PokitDok added themselves to my healthcare research by forking the Github repository, and adding themselves to the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/healthcare/blob/gh-pages/data/companies.json">JSON data source</a>&mdash;once I received the pull request, I accepted, and they were published on the site.
<p>Usually once a week I spend time to manually adding new companies I've come across in my monitoring of the API space, but being a one man show I can&rsquo;t find everything across this massively expanding space. This is why I depend on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> to help me curate the best from across the space. Not everyone knows that the entire API Evangelist network of <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ research projects</a> all runs on Github, which allows anyone to help write posts, curate industry news, and maintain the lists of API providers.
<p>As soon as I accepted the pull request for PokitDok, I also tagged them as &ldquo;API Stack&rdquo;, which immediately adds PokitDok to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, listed under healthcare. No matter which doorway a company enters, I will make sure they get published to all appropriate research areas across the API Evangelist network, using my tagging system.
<p>Thanks PokitDok for adding yourself, and I look forward to paying attention to the good things coming our of your API platform via your <a href="https://pokitdok.com/blog/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokitDok">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pokitdok">Github</a> profiles.

<p>I depend on a <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/14/details-about-the-52-online-services-i-depend-on/">number of cloud services to make my personal and business world go round</a>. Even as a programmer, who can hand code just about any script to integrate, automate, and orchestrate my world, I find myself using more reciprocity services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>.
<p><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity providers</a> are one of the most important evolutions of the API space, because they make the whole world of APis accessible to the normals, and not just to the geek crowd. My time is valuable, and personally I'd rather being using existing tools and services, rather than re-inventing the wheel, and when it comes to orchestrating my online life, I need all the help I can, which is why I am looking IFTTT and Zapier for help.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using both platforms in 2014, but as I do with any other software I&rsquo;ve been dating for any sustained period, I start looking at getting a little more serious. This is where I have to part ways with IFTTT, and other other platforms that don&rsquo;t have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">clear relief valves for their free tier</a>, allowing me to start paying monthly or annually for my use of their service, and sensibly scale up as my needs grow.
<p>Zapier has a pretty straightforward <a href="https://zapier.com/app/pricing">pricing framework</a>, giving you just enough room to get hooked, then you can pay for more usage as needed. Having a free tier for any cloud service is essential, but having a tiered business model, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">clear monetization strategy</a>, so I know that you will be around in the future, is a requirement.
<p>I will keep my IFTT account to play with, but when it comes operating my business, continuing to integrate Zapier into my workflow makes sense as they have a clear business model that fits my needs. Plus <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">Zapier has an API</a>. Ummmm&hellip;hello? An API for your automation and integration layer across all the services you depend on, via their APIs--how cool is that!
<p>When launching your own APIs, make sure it has a clear, visible, intuitive and ascendable service framework--it is something that will go a long way in helping companies decide if they will use your APIs, or not.

<p>title: ‘Who Is Going To Build The Uber API Platform For The Sharing Economy?’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/uber-logo.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://developer.uber.com/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/uber-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>The sharing economy is booming, and with the release of the <a href="https://developer.uber.com/">Uber API</a>, the attention on this space will only increase. Personally I&rsquo;m only  interested in the surface area of the API that Uber has released, and what it tells about the opportunity for API designers in the sharing economy.
<p>I think the surface area of the Uber API is pretty minimal, but very significant when you look at it as a glimpse of what is to come, as the sharing economy gets a direct pipeline to the API economy, and the resulting app economy. Oh yeah, I went there&mdash;I used all the economy buzzwords in once sentence. Seriously, I think the five endpoints that Uber launched with, are very telling:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/products</li>
<li>/estimates/price</li>
<li>/estimates/time</li>
<li>/history</li>
<li>/me</li>
</ul>
<p>These API endpoints represent the beginning of the shared economy API surface area, and while there will be many additions, augmentations, and different takes on what APIs look like in the sharing economy, I predict many other providers will often emulate Uber in their own design.
<p>I&rsquo;m not really equipped to make a judgement on the value or importance of the Uber API. What I can do is keep an eye on Uber, and other sharing economy startup and their APIs, and look for patterns across each of the implementations. Hopefully the space can remain true to their roots, and make sure the API definitions are shareable, and reusable across the flourishing sharing app sapce.
<p>Uber is focused specifically in the transportation portion of the sharing economy, and this makes me consider the bigger picture, and who will step up to serve the larger sharing economy, with an Uber API platform for the sharing economy. I think much like the wider API space, as the sharing API space matures out there will lots of opportunities for aggregation, real-time, automation, messaging, payments, and other API essentials that are in service of the sharing economy.

<p>I tag a lot of interesting companies that show up during my weekly API monitoring. When I see a tag go from 1 or 2, to over 5 companies--I take a closer look to see what is going on. An increase in the number of companies focusing in a specific area could be a trend, or it could be nothing.
<p>The tag "API Agency" ticked over to 6 today, when I added&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aquevix.com/">Aquevix</a>, an indian company that is focusing on API development. As of August 2014 I now have six separate agency style companies that I've found who have a focus on API design and development:

<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking with a very nice recruiter over at Google over the last couple weeks, and she has been so kind in keeping me updated about opportunities for evangelism at Google. This is the 3rd round of talks I've had with Google while being the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, talks that historically go nowhere because of their programming test, which is a super silly aspect of their HR process.
<p>I was straight up with the Google recruiter a couple of weeks ago when she first emailed me, and again when we talked on the phone last week&mdash;I do not take programming tests to open up doors for employment conversations, sorry. ;-( It is a waste of my time, and yours, and doesn&rsquo;t measure shit. I understand that you have to qualify large number of folks, at your very algorithmic-centric company, but when it comes to measuring what I do, a programming test isn&rsquo;t a thing.
<p>If programming a tic-tac-toe game on a live screen share is what you need to open up a conversation with professionals around evangelizing your platform, you need to look elsewhere. Nowhere in my role as the API Evangelist do I have to code under time pressure with someone else watching, sorry. I would even say, having hacker skills, trumps programming skills in a public facing evangelism role, and speed, quality of code go out the window. This is about making connections through hacker storytelling, something that doesn't always pencil out to producing best code, and is more about helping people understand what is possible using a platform, in the most meaningful way&mdash;requiring more focus on the person and their problems, not the code or algorthm.
<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to have man very meaningful conversations with other tech giants like Intel, IBM, large institutions like UC Berkeley, BYU, and establish fruitful relationships with partners like 3Scale and API Spark, and across federal agencies like Department of Education, Energy, NASA, and the White House around APIs--all without taking programming tests. I talk to startups, SMBs, SMEs, organizations, institutions, and government agencies a lll the time, and never have to code under pressure, in front of an audience.
<p>I&rsquo;m not under the influence that I will change your hiring practices Google&mdash;you are a very smart, and successful company. All I&rsquo;m saying is you are probably filtering out some pretty talented folks, who are extremely passionate and knowledgeable in what they do, and connected in their space, and when you won&rsquo;t engage in meaningful conversations without a programming test, your missing out.
<p>I actually prefer working with organizations from the outside in, I think it better reflects the essence of API Evangelism. The companies who have trouble working with outside entities, without tradition HR processes, are probably not going to lead when it comes developing an API driven ecosystem.
<p>If your company doesn't have the time to research me, and understand what I bring to the API space, and what my skills are, we probably aren't a fit. Everything about me is available online at <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">Github</a>--you just have to look. If you are only looking at <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/kin-lane-resume/Resume-Kin-Lane-API-Evangelist-Summary.pdf">resumes</a>, and making people take tests, you will probably get what you are looking for!

<p>If you follow <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog">Twilio blog</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/twilio">Twitter account</a> you can always find a good API story from the API leader. It also makes me happy to see trends I&rsquo;m seeing from other provider re-enforced by the API heavyweight. This time is providing spreadsheet integration with common API resources, like Twilio SMS.
<p>Twilio has a pretty slick tool they call <a href="http://twiliosheet.azurewebsites.net/">TwilioSheet</a> that allows you to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet, and created a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/connecting-twilio-sms-to-google-spreadsheet.html">pretty nice walkthrough of the entire setup</a>. Providing this type of functionality helps, as Twilio says, "make it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet&rdquo;&mdash;<strong>emphasis on the non-developers.</strong>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet is the #1 database solution in the world, and provide a huge opportunity when it comes to bridging the world of APIs with the wider business landscape. This is something that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers like Zapier</a> have bridging for a while now, and something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">API providers like Intuit are looking to bank into their API platforms</a>.
<p>When you see Twilio doing something like providing providing spreadsheet integration for their API platform, you have to stop and consider whether or not it is something that might work for your own API platform. Spreadsheet integration by default with API your driven resources is a great way to expand the reach of any API, bringing these valuable resources within reach of the actual, everyday problem owners.

<p>It can be hard to keep up with what the latest geek trends are--where all of the latest digital watering holes are&nbsp;(especially when your old), that allow you to find the latest info, conversations, and links to everything cool and hip. I depend on my network of API peeps for tips, and last week I was introduced to a new place that I wanted to pass on to you, called <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>.
<p>Product Hunt does a good job of describing what they do:
<blockquote><em>Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the site open for the last five days, scanning for cool tech creations that grab my attention, and when I opened the tab today, I noticed that APIs dominated the top of the list.
<p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/product-hunt/product-hunt-api.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>You see the Uber API (of course), and Zapier both jockeying for top slots, as well as Product Hunts API too. Product Hunt allows you to post product name, tagline, and url for any web, mobile or single page app&mdash;a format that is perfect for publishing and sharing your individual API resource creations.
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be adding Product Hunt as an <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelism building block</a>, publishing my own API creations, as well as encouraging my API readers to do the same. The platform seems like a great way to show off your API, and generate buzz (or not) around each API resource we bring to the table.

<p><a href="https://developer.intuit.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/intuit/intuitbig.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2014/08/13/intuit-acquires-itduzzit-syncing-data-between-cloud-apps-gets-easier">itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit</a>.  Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">reciprocity providers</a>.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been seeing more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs</a>. I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers.
<p>The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers have the potential to reach beyond a core developer audience by:

<p>The world of accounting seems like a great place to start when providing interoperability, automation, and reciprocity tools that are not just developers, but also empower end-users to use API. If you are as advanced as Zapier, <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">even your reciprocity layer will have an API that developers</a>&nbsp;can&nbsp;put to use when taking advantage of the cross platform API integration and automation possibilities.
<p>I will keep an eye on the <a href="https://developer.intuit.com">Intuit partner Platform</a>, and see what they end up doing with itDuzzit.  According to the press release, "<em>The Intuit and itDuzzit teams are already collaborating to fold the technology into the Intuit Partner Platform&rdquo;</em>, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see some interesting API reciprocity patterns that I can highlight here on API Evangelist, and other API providers can follow when considering their own reciprocity layer for their own platform

<p>The Bing Developer Center team <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/bingdevcenter/archive/2014/08/18/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-focuses-on-improving-productivity-within-the-experience.aspx">has released a pretty interesting pluginthat assist developers who use Visual Studio</a> when building web or mobile applications using APIs.
<p>In an effort to make developers lives easier, the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1166718-a2d9-4a48-a5fd-504ff4ad1b65">Bing Developer Assistant</a> now comes with integrated API code search that, <em>&ldquo;while coding, a relevant code snippet related to your current API will be automatically displayed in the IntelliSense window which is powered by Bing Code Search"</em>.
<p><em>"Code snippets are short piece of code that you can easily learn and copy"</em>, and you can <em>"copy the code, or click the source URL to view where the code snippet comes from, or click "Search More" to find more code samples related to the API"</em>.  Which seems like it could easily be extended to other aspects of the API, using <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/">APIs.json url type</a>, allowing for the discovery of videos, how-to, and other supporting API resources.
<p>The approach by the Bing Developer Center team&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-within-the-developers-ide/">reflects what I&rsquo;m seeing from Salesforce, Google, and other API IDE integrations</a>. I&rsquo;m interested in continuing to explore what role API definitions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML</a> will play when it comes to API discovery via popular IDEs like Visual Studio.
<p><a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-ide-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I also envision <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> also taking a lead role when it comes to discovering new APIs, or pulling from a curated list of existing APIs, while programming within any IDE. There will also be an opportunity for IT, and development support staff to discovery API resources using <a href="http://apis.io">API search engines like APIs.io</a>, and then create their own internal APIs.json collection of sanctioned API resources from across public, partner and internal sources.
<p>IDE API integration isn't something that will just be for the big players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google. As more API providers publish machine readable API definitions, complete with APIs.json indexes of these resources--we&rsquo;ll begin to see more niche IDE developers who are curating meaningful stacks of API resources from a variety of sources into a single, rich API development experience.
<p>In my opinion, this is one of the benefits of where we are currently headed with <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>.&nbsp;API providers can focus on making machine readable API definitions, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> collections. Then others can innovate in the deployment of tooling like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and IDE plugins like the Bing Developer Assistant for Microsoft Visual Studio, that make sure API resources are disocvered and put to use in everyday development environments.

<p>I had someone ask me the other day if I had any numbers on how many APIs are used in a modern web or mobile applications--great question! I often refer to the growth in the number of APIs we use, but this is really just anecdotal, and not based on any real facts.
<p>In August, as part of the&nbsp;lead up to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a>&nbsp;I am spending more time reaching out to dev shops in Chicago, with the most recent talks with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Bryson Pouw at Blaze Portfolio</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">Dave Devitt at SYDCON</a>. In future conversation I will make sure and ask the dev shops how many APIs they use in the average app they deliver.
<p>If you have any data on the average number of APIs used in web or mobile apps at your agency, or know of research or stories that talk about this, please let me know.  Until now, many of the numbers being reported in the API space are coming from providers, I think we need to start gathering, tracking on, and reporting on API usage from the API consumption side of the coin.

<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> was designed to be a versatile API discovery format, not just a format for public API discovery via search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. An APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable index of APIs within a single developer hub, providing information on the API endpoints as well as any other supporting resources--there is no reason that all of this can&rsquo;t also be applied in a private setting.
<p>APIs.json can easily be placed within a domain, subdomain, or at any network address, and be used to describe an internal collection of API resources, as well as bring in outside APIs. APIs.jsonbui excels at aggregating multiple, potentially disparate APIs, into a single coherent collection for use in development.
<p>Using internal APIs.json files, a company, organization or governent agency can deploy an instance of an open source API search engine like APIs.io, or develop a custom API search tool that can aggregate the different APIs.json from each location, into a company wide API search and discovery destination.
<p>An APIs.json provides a framework for referencing each APIs machine readable definition in Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML format, as well as other resources that internal developers will need to be successful, such as authentication info, SDKs, terms of service, and the multitude of other <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a>.
<p>If you have public APIs, it will be a no brainer for you to generate machine readable API definitions for your APIs, and add them to a single, or potentially multiple <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> files for indexing. Even if you don&rsquo;t have public APis, you can put APIs.json to work improving your internal API discovery, while also opening up your API resources to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">other benefits of having machine readable API definitions</a>.<p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I used to publish out a list of curated stories each week, and a listing of the top 25 APIs I was paying attention to during my regular monitoring of the API space to a site I called <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. When i went to Washington DC last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I suspended that weekly ritual, and never picked up after my world got back to normal.
<p>I&rsquo;m still monitoring about 1000 companies, with over 2000 total APIs, and curating the stories--I just don&rsquo;t take the time each week to publish them to The API Stack. In an effort to try and reboot the project, provide value to the API Evangelist network, as well as to you my loayal reader, I've republished a new reflection of my work at the Github project. Right now it just lists 819 of the companies who are doing interesting things with APis in 114 categories.
<p>Over the next couple weeks I will be reviewing each of these 819 companies APIs, and as I validate them, I will publish more detail. You can search for General Services Administration (GSA), under the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=federal-stack">Federal Stack</a> to see an example of this work in action. I link to each of the GSA APIs, across multiple domains, and include a machine readable API definition as well as interactive documentation generated from the definition.
<p>The API Stack will continue to be a window into my API targeting and monitoring, and I will update regularly as I have time. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that going forward, the API space needs to focus on the quality of APIs, and not just the number of APIs available, and <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a> reflects this way of thinking, playing out in my own work.

<p>I recently talked with Bryson Pouw (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpouw">@bpouw</a>), Founder / CEO at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com">Blaze Portfolio Systems</a> in Chicago about how his portfolio management and trading technology company sees the world of APIs. Last week <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">I had talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON, a web development shop</a>, and this week I was very interested to hear Bryson&rsquo;s view on APIs, because his company is a little more niche, focusing specifically on the needs of the investment professional.
<p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/features/model-rebalancing">Atom Align</a>, the Blaze Portfolio Systems flagship product is looking to help investment professionals better manage their portfolios, and a big enabler of this is the <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/atom-align-api">Atom Align API</a>,&nbsp;which provides programmatic access to:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Queries</strong> &ndash; Obtain the list of portfolios, orders, brokers, and securities</li>
<li><strong>Trade Orders</strong> &ndash; Place, execute, cancel, and allocate trade orders</li>
<li><strong>Manage Trade Extracts </strong>&ndash; Create and download trade extract file</li>
</ul>
<p>The Atom Align API is only made available to trusted Blaze Portfolio partners and clients upon request, while also being used internally to drive system integrations. This approach to API design, as the core for specialty, or even widely available web and mobile applications, <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-market-graph.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>is the signature of a software development shop that has evolved and realized that a core API stack is essential for internal, as well as external integrations&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for public consumption when it comes to todays dev shop operations.
<p>Beyond their own internal Atom Align API, Blaze Portfolio also uses several other financial related APIs as part of their core operations. APIs are core to the Atom Align secret sauce, aggregating, refining, and making sense of markets by pulling data and content from multiple API sources, most notably <a href="ttp://www.xignite.com/">financial data from Xignite</a>.  You can&rsquo;t be an investment professional in 2014 without having the right technology in your toolbox, and Blaze Portfolio has done well aggregating financial data from public API sources, into tje tool the pros are needing.
<p>Blaze Portfolio Systems designing, deploying, and managing their own internal APIs, as well as consuming multiple publicly available APIs, provides an interesting blueprint that other software development shops can follow. There is money to be made in managing your own API infrastructure, using the best of breed, publicly available data and API sources--then craft it all into your own API driven software solution that can deliver web, mobile, or even device based solutions for niche or mainstream customers.

<p>I spend a lot of time looking for good quality logos to represent the companies I track on and write stories about. I have a certain vision in my head about how I want company listings and detail pages to look across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>&mdash;something that takes a lot of work.
<p>To support this vision, I spend a lot of time looking for logos. Sometimes you can find them in the header of a website, but often times they are poor quality, not configured to be standalone, or difficult to get at for any number of other reasons--making my work a lot tougher.
<p>I published a new list of 819 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs that I call&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. After publishing the project, <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>, one of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=travel-stack">travel API providers</a>&nbsp;listed, tweeted at me asking if I could replace their logo with a better quality one from their <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/logos">official logo page</a>--I did so very quickly!
<p>I sure love me a good logo and branding page for an API. It makes my life easier, by giving me a single place to go get high quality logos, without having to open up my image editor. I wish that more API platforms would have a well designed logo page like <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>.

<p>I wrote about&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/what-is-an-api-first-strategy-adding-some-dimensions-to-this-new-question/">What Is An API First Strategy? Adding Some Dimensions To This New Question</a> the other day after talking with <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. One of the commonets on the post was&nbsp;from my friend Logan Powell (<a href="https://twitter.com/logantpowell">@logantpowell</a>), and I think it was so good, that it deserves its own post. I will let Logan do the talking:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To supplement the pool of meaning here, I would like to add that an API-first strategy is one where the API serves as both a pattern of an enterprises IT architecture as well as catalyst for engagement.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In a nutshell, an API-first strategy is a systems paradigm shift</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- from a centralized, engineered mechanical system made up of subordinate parts serving as means to deliberately designed ends</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- to a decentralized, organic and evolving ecosystem where the individual actors can be spontaneously enfranchised or co-opted by any other actor / set of actors to serve new purposes.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>This allows the system to be more flexible, respond more quickly and behave more dynamically to suit unforeseen purposes. I believe the API-first paradigm is thereby more scalable by nature.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Prudent separation of information from presentation through APIs should be the first and next step for most organizations with large IT infrastructures. To be more specific, this provides a number of efficiency benefits. To just name a few: by modulating infrastructure with solid APIs, stakeholders can create / hack together production-ready applications faster, more securely and more reliably.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This approach warrants a new form of IT team protocol wherein the curation of APIs is front-and-center to their role. When designing a new product / service, the design of it's API should be commensurate. As the product or service makes it's way to production, making sure the API is well documented, easy to use / as conventional as possible, hooked up with analytics, secure and prepared to scale should be a given (these are frequently included in any self-respecting API management solution). In so doing, not only might the enterprise benefit from the speedier and more rewarding 'dog-fooding' of these services / resources, if they ever decide to commercialize or publicize / open them up to users outside their organization (the decision to flip the switch itself being informed by the aforementioned analytics), it's just an invite / key request away.</em>
<p>Logan works in the federal government, on some pretty high value open data and API projects, and he is on the frontline for how APIs can be a catalyst for change within enterprise IT, but also connect externally in some meaningful ways--in short he knows his stuff, and is helping internalize APIs across the federal government.
<p>What Logan describes IS why I believe so paassionately in APIs. In my mind It is the culural change, with an eye towards exernal interactions and conversations that make APIs work, and while the tech of APIs is critical, it is the cultural, organizational, and ultimately the human aspects of APIs that make the biggest impact.&nbsp;

<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/swagger-apisjson-and-review-for-the-new-developertradegov/">coordinating with the development team for Developer.Trade.Gov today</a>, providing them with a review of their new developer area, and some suggestions on how to make their APIs, and developer more usable.
<p>The <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> is published as a <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal">Github repository</a>, using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to actually deliver the website. The feedback I&rsquo;ve been giving to the team, has been done through the <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues">Github issue management for the repository</a>.
<p>One piece of feedback I left was:
<blockquote>
<p><em>I love that when I land on your home page, I get a brief description of what developer.trade.gov delivers, the probem is that the description is below the fold on some monitors, leaving just the 3 links available to see.</em>
<p><em>I'd switch the description and links, putting description at the top....and the first thing your eyes are drawn to. You'd be surprised how valuable this can be. Simple, but important.</em>
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<p>I submitted&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues/20#issue-40274346">the suggestion 5 hours ago</a>, and I just received an update that the issue was closed, and my suggestions were incorporated. When you go to the <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> website now, you will see the text, with links to the right&mdash;creating a much more clean, informative, and usable way to deliver the most valuable real estate you have in your developer hub. It was a small, but quick and meaningful change to a government website.
<p>Imagine if we could help other agencies see the benefit of publishing small, simple websites, developer hubs, single page apps, and other projects to Github, and manage their feedback loops via Github issues. What types of improvements in delivering government services would we see? What cost savings could be realized across government?

<hr />

<p><a href="https://developer.trade.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/trade-gov/developer-trade-gov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I got a gentle ping today, as I often do when there is a new developer hub or API launched in the federal government. This time it was located within the Department of Commerce, for the International Trade Administration, and was a new developer area, with five APIs at <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a>.
<p>I quickly went through the new developer area, which I consider passing the test for a minimum viable developer area, possessing all the essential building blocks an API developer hub needs. The only places I feel it fell short is in the feedback loop, and providing machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs.
<p>I submitted my feedback as Github issues, on the repository for the developer hub, but when it comes to machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs, I know how easy this is, so rather than just submit issues, I figured I'd get to work generating the machine readable API definitions for Developer.Trade.Gov, and demonstrate what was possible. As I do with all of my work, I setup a <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/">subdomain, and Github repository</a>, to store all of my work, and got to work on each of the five APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://developer.trade.gov/market-research-library.html">Market Research Library</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/market-research-library.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.trade.gov/ita-office-locations.html">ITA Offices &amp; Centers</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/ita-offices-and-centers.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li>Trade Events</li>
<li>Trade Leads</li>
<li>Trade News &amp; Articles</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/1w9oKpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>I chose to use <a href="https://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger</a> for creating my machine readable API definitions, and while I was waiting for the Github commit to take for the Market Research Library API Swagger definition + Swagger UI, I got to work on the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API. As I was finishing up, I reloaded the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/market-research-library-api.html">interactive docs for the Market Research Library API</a>, and got the dreaded CORS warning:
<blockquote><em>Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://api.trade.gov/market_research_library/search?keyword=travel. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.</em></blockquote>
<p>That is where the fun ends for me. I can keep creating Swagger specs for the other three APIs, but I won&rsquo;t be able to play with them until I create a proxy to make calls through, and open up CORS on my end. I will make time to do this over the weekend, but until then the fun stops. I am hoping they will also open up CORS, but I'm sure it will take a while.
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>To wrap up my work, I also generated an <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json file for the Developer.Trade.Gov domain</a>, listing the details for both the Market Research Library API, and the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API--opening up the APIs to discovery by API search engines like APIs.io. When Developer.Trade.Gov publishes the APIs.json + Swagger specs under their domain, it will become more authoratative and given prominence in search engine results.
<p>In about 2 hours, I was able to review a new developer area, and five APIs, generate two swagger specs, 1 APIs.json, publish to a Github repository where I launched interactive documentation for each of the two APIs, and wrap up with this story of my work. As with all of my work, you can find all of this <a href="https://github.com/commerce-data/developer.trade.gov">work at the Github repository,</a> and the best part is, when I pick the work back up, it is all in one location, <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/blog/">with complete notes about what I did</a>&mdash;helping me understand where I left off, in addition to allowing anyone else to step in and learn from the process.

<p>I spoke with Phil Windley (<a href="https://twitter.com/windley">@windley</a>) over at <a href="https://byu.edu">Brigham Young University (BYU)</a> about their API strategy this morning. BYU is bringing together API providers and consumers, to establish a coordinated strategy for delivering designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs across campus--an effort being led by <a href="http://cio.byu.edu/">CIO Kelly Flannagan</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelflanagan">@kelflanagan</a>).
<p>As part of their latest API effort, BYU is focusing in on the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to campus resources:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Students</li>
<li>Instructors</li>
<li>Classrooms</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The API team is still struggling with a handful of technical details like how to deal with unique identifiers, and relationship between resources, but overall they are on a healthy path when it comes to getting their API designed, and deployed for use at the institution. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how fast they progress with a top down approach to APIs, vs the bottom up efforts I&rsquo;m seeing at institutions like <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>.
<p>I will be talking their team regularly, about their design, deployment, management, and integration strategy. I want to make sure and document the process all along the way, and share real-time updates that other universities can follow along, or possibly collaborate with us when it comes to establishing some common API patterns we can share and re-use across higher educational institutions.
<p>Look for any stories out of BYU, here on API Evangelist, or over at my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university API research site</a>, and if you are doing any API work at your school, I'd love to know more about it.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/digital-strategy/logos/va.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.
<p>I just wrote a piece on r<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/13/replacing-legacy-systems-with-apis-at-the-department-of-veteran-affairs/">eplacing legacy systems at the VA using APIs</a>, where one of the systemic constraints in place that restricts the modernizzation VA systems using API is purely about money, and more specifically the color of money. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the detail of the topic, but in short the color of money is: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_procurement_in_the_United_States">Money appropriated for one purpose cannot be used for a different purpose, according to the Purpose Act (31 U.S.C. &sect; 1301)</a>.
<p>In short, if $50M was given to sustain an existing legacy system, and that money cannot be re-appropriated, and applied to the newer system, what incentive is there to ever get rid of legacy VA systems, or modernize any government system for that matter? Whether it is usng APIs, or anything else. Newer approaches to using technology are difficult to accept when you are working hard to accomplished your job each day, but if you already have $50M in budget to a specific job, and that job won&rsquo;t go away, unless you choose to make it go away, guess what happens? Nothing changes&hellip;hmmm?
<p>As I said before, I don&rsquo;t give a shit if you deploy APIs from the ground up, or excite via a presidential mandates from the top down, if you have incentives in place for employees to do the opposite, based upon how money is allocated, you won&rsquo;t be changing any behavior or culture&mdash;you are wasting your energy. I don&rsquo;t care how excited I get any one individual, team or department about the potential of APIs bundled with new systems, if it means their job is going away&mdash;too bad, nobody will give a shit.
<p>Think about this scenario, then consider that <a href="https://www.voa.va.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DocumentID=1942">$1,810M of the 3,323M overall VA budget (54%) is sustainment</a>. Granted this isn't all IT system sustainment, but still over half of the budget is allocated to keep shit the same as it is. Imagine what environment this creates for the acceptance of modernization efforts at VA.
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.

<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.
<p>One of the jobs I was tasked with at the VA as a PIF, was taking inventory of the web services within the agency. When asking folks where these web services were, I was directed to various IT Leads on different groups, each giving one or two more locations I could look for word, excel, or other PDFs talking about web services used in projects and known systems. Most of the time these were redundant lists, pointing me to the same 5 web services, and omitting 20-30 that were actually in use for a project.
<p>At one point I was given the contact information for a lady who had been working for two years on a centralized web registry project, that would be the holy grail of web service discovery at the VA. This was it! It was what I was looking for, until I sat in on the weekly call where this project got a 10 minute update, demonstrating that the registry was still about defining the how and what of the registry, and never has actually moved to cataloging actual web services in the wild at the VA. ;-(
<p>Then one day I was introduced to a gentlemen, that was in a back office, in an unmarked cubicle, who seemed to know where most of the web services were, the one difference with this person was that they were a contractor, and not an employee. One thing you hear about, but do not experience fully until you work in government is the line between government employee and contractor&mdash;in meetings, and conversations you know who is who (it is pretty clar), but when it comes to finding APIs, I&rsquo;m sorry the contractors know where everything is at. This contractor had some pretty interesting lists of what web services were in operation, where they were, and which groups at VA owned them, including up to date contact info. These contractors also had their finger on the pulse of any project that was potentially moving the web services converations forward, including the global registry.
<p>Overall I was surprised at how IT groups knew of their own web services, could care less about the web services of other groups, but contractors new where all the web service were across the groups. I was closing in on 500 web services on my list before <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/15/why-i-exited-my-presidential-innovation-fellowship/">I left during the shutdown</a>, and I wonder how many else I would have found if I kept up the good fight. This mission had nothing do with API, except that web services are often compared to APis, I was purely taking inventory of what was already in place, a process that went far beyond just technical inventory, and shed light on some serious business and political flaws within operations at the VA.
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.

<p>title: ‘Taking A Look At The API Licensing Stack’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-onion.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-onion.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>One of the byproducts of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Oracle vs Google API copyright case</a>, was a realization that many API providers and consumer do not understand the layers of the API stack, let alone the potential licensing considerations for each layer of the API onion. I wouldn't just blame API providers, and consumers, I&rsquo;m still getting a grasp on all of this, which is why I'm blogging about the subject.
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick crack at defining the layers to the potential API licensing onion:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data</strong> - What is the licensing for the actual data returned and collected by an API? I&rsquo;m still learning about the ways to license your data, and the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/">Open Data Commons provides some guidance in this area</a>, while others feel that your data can just as be easily licensed using <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensing.</li>
<li><strong>Data Model </strong>- The separation between data and its data model can be hard to see, where in reality end-users may own their data, but the order and structure of it can be owned by the originating application. If this layer is a concern, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, or other copyright options should be considered. </li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Server side API code is the core of any API operations, and should be licensed accordingly using <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">common open source software licens</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">es</span>&nbsp;when appropriate. However I would add that this is the one layer in the API stack where a proprietary licensing could make sense, but the rest of the stack should always be licensed as open as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Interface</strong> - The separation between the API and its surface area is important, and is something that is just becoming relevant with the Oracle v Google copyright case. Understanding the importance of an openly licensed surface area, is essential to the health of any API stack, and should be kep as open as possible, even when associated with a proprietary API backend. This is why we started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API commons</a>, to help API providers take a stance on the license of the surface area of the API stack.</li>
<li><strong>Clients</strong> - As with server side code, you should apply<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses"> common open source software licensing</a>&nbsp;to client code when appropriate, but your client code samples, libraries and SDKs should never be licensed in a proprietary way, encouraging implementation for any commercial integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario we are talking about a purely data API, if you are serving up some sort of programmatic resource, things might be different. My goal is to just try and understand the separation between the API layers, and apply some thoughts on how licenses can be applied to open, or possibly close access and constraint an APIs operation.
<p>Much like other political building blocks of the API ecosystem, licensing in the aPI stack can be good, bad, or neutral. In the end, regardless of your stance I think it is important to have an open conversation about how our API stack is licensed, so that your consumers can better understand what they are in for.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/digital-strategy/logos/va.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, slowly bringing them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.
<p>On deck are my thoughts on <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">replacing legacy systems with APIs</span></em>, at the Department of Veteran Affairs. In the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, one of the motivations for deploying APIs, is to assist in the evolution, and replacement of legacy systems. The theory is, you have older system that needs to be replaced, and you can wrap in a modern web API, and slowly switch any desktop, web, mobile or other client system to use the new API&mdash;then you build out newer backend system, and make the switch in the API layer from the legacy to the newer backend system, leaving everything operating as expected. API magic!
<p>I'm used to hostile environments to this way of thinking, but most times in the private sector there are other business objectives that can be leveraged to get legacy system owners to get on board with a shift towards API deployment&mdash;I saw no incentive for this practice in the VA environment, where in reality there are incentives for IT, and business owners, as well as 3rd party contractors to keep legacy systems in place, not replace them. There are a variety of motivation for existing VA workers to keep existing systems in place, ranging from not understanding how the system works, to budgetary restrictions on how money flows in support of this pro-sustainment culture.
<p>Here is an example. There is old database for storing of a specific type of document, a database that X amount of existing desktop, server, web, or even mobile systems depend on. If I move in and create an API, that allows for reading and writing of data into this database, then work with all X of the legacy systems to use the API instead of a direct database connection&mdash;in theory I can now work to dismantle the legacy database, and replace with a newer, modern backend database. In most IT operations, this approach will then allow me to replace, modernize and evolve upon an existing legacy system. This is a common view of technologists who are purely looking through a technical lens, and ignoring the existing business and political constraints that exist in some companies, organizations, insitutions and government agencies.&nbsp;
<p>In the real world, you have staff, budgets, workflows, and decision making processes that are already in place. Let&rsquo;s say this legacy database had $50M a year allocated in budget for its operation, and I replace with a newer database, plus API, which operates for $10M a year&mdash;you&rsquo;d think I get to reallocate the staff, budget, and other resources to developing newer mobile apps, and other system with my newly liberated $40M. Right? Nope&hellip;that money goes away, and those people have no interest in moving from supporting a COBOL system, to supporting a new MongoDB + Node.js API that is driving a Swift iPhone app. ;-(
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large companies, organizations, institutions and government agencies operate, that are in conflict with what an API philosphy can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin to weave my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/digital-strategy/logos/va.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.
<p>I was given three projects when I started work at the VA: 1) Inventory data assets 2) Inventory web services 3) Move forward D2D, a forms web service that would allow VA hospitals and Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to submit forms through the claims process on behalf of  veteran.
<p>The most prevalent illness I witnessed across these three efforts was a unwillingness to trust outside groups (even VSOs and hospitals), and a lack of desire to share data and resources to anyone outside of the VA (ironically except contractors), to the point where groups seem to take defensive positions around what they did on behalf of our veterans. This culture makes for some pretty toxic environments, I personally feel contributing to much of the problems we&rsquo;ve seen bubble up into the public media space of late.
<p>While work at the VA you constantly hear about the VA claims backlog, and how we need to optimize, but when you bring up sharing data, or resources to other federal agencies, trusted external partners like hospitals, and VSO&rsquo;s you get pushback with concerns of security, personally identifiable information (PII), etc. All which are valid claims, but there are proven ways to mitigate these risks through Identify and Access Management (IAM), which is another whole post in itself. You start feeling crazy when you get pushback for arguing that a doctor should be able to submit disability questionnaires via an iPad application, that uses an existing VA API, in a way that securely authenticates the doctor.
<p>As a result of other system, cultural issues, and mistakes made in the past, VA employees and contractors are extremely adverse to opening up to the outside world, even if it can help. I kept <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/vatheft/">hearing references to the 2006 data breach</a> as a reason to keep systems locked down, where an employee brought a laptop home, affecting 26M individuals. This horror story, plus a variety of other cultural issues are keeping VA staff from accepting any new way of thinking, even if it could help reduce their workload, improve the claims process, and better serve the veterans and their families.
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.

<p>I get regular requests to add APIs to my website via email, Twitter, and carrier pigeon. I have an Evernote that I put these requests into, and as I have time, I review, then possibly add to the appropriate API Evangelist network project.
<p>To support this process, I've crafted a new response email to requests I get, that I thought I would share with everyone:
<blockquote><em>
<p>Sure thing. It could take me a day or two, or maybe up to a week.
<p>You are also welcome to fork any of the 60+ API Evangelist network projects, and add to the JSON list that is driving the listing, they are all under the /data folder. Otherwise I'll add as I have time in the next week.
<p>Once you submit your pull request, if your company listing is relevant to the research I&rsquo;m doing, I will accept your addition. No guarantees, so make sure it will provide value to not just my research, but to the API community.
<p>Thanks for sharing information about your API!
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<p>It is a little known fact that all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ plus of my research projects</a> run as Github repositories, using Github and Jekyll to drive the overall website and blog. With this approach, everyone can fork any of my projects, add a company to a listing, post to the blog, or correct a spelling or grammar error.
<p>Just remember, when you are looking to get the word out about your API, or new feature, you can help curate and publish on the API Evangelist network.

<p>title: ‘Adding Google To List Of API Deployment Companies’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I was taking another look at the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a> yesterday, and stumbled across <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/?_ga=1.186468064.812314948.1407779892">Google Cloud Endpoints</a>. It was something I saw come across my feeds, but really didn&rsquo;t give it the time it needed to see what it was all about.  With the new Google Cloud Endpoints, Google is making a strong push to be not just an API deployment provider, but their approach also reflects what I&rsquo;d consider to be an evolution of backend as a service (BaaS) deployment.
<p>I think Google describes their service better than I can do it justice:
<blockquote><em>Google Cloud Endpoints consists of tools, libraries and capabilities that allow you to generate APIs and client libraries from an App Engine application, referred to as an API backend, to simplify client access to data from other applications. Endpoints makes it easier to create a web backend for web clients and mobile clients such as Android or Apple's iOS.</em></blockquote>
<p>While much of the Google Cloud Platform offering looks a lot like the cloud offering over at Amazon Web Services, AWS definitely does not have API deployment as a service, baked into their cloud stack, like Google does with Google Cloud Endpoints.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-endpoints-architecture.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>Google puts an emphasis on API endpoint deployment for mobile purposes, but leaves it open to be used in JavaScript as well&mdash;which seems a little limiting, since you could call same endpoints in any language. Oh well, I&rsquo;m not writing their marketing.
<blockquote><em>..the API backend is an App Engine app that performs business logic and other functions for Android and iOS clients, as well as JavaScript web clients. The functionality of the backend is made available to clients through Endpoints, which exposes an API that clients can call.</em></blockquote>
<p>Google provides SDKs for Android, iOS, and JavaScript, as well as a very Java heavy development process using <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend/create_project">Maven</a>, combined with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/cloud_endpoints">Google Plugin for Eclipse</a>, which&nbsp;is used to design, develop, and deploy your APIs to <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.
<p>All Google has to do now, is open up the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Console</a>&nbsp;as a Google Cloud Endpoints management console, giving developers on the Google Cloud Platform the ability to design, deploy, and manage their APIs. Then if Google baked in <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">Google Discovery</a> services for all Google Cloud Endpoints, developers would have a pretty slick discovery layer on top of their cloud API stacks. Hell, all you need then is to allow generation of <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> for each collection, and boom you have a pretty complete API design, deployment, management, and discovery platform in the clouds.
<p>Now that Google is added to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a>, I will be keeping a closer eye on what they are doing in respects to being a cloud API platform.

<p>title: ‘What Is An API First Strategy? Adding Some Dimensions To This New Question’</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-first.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I hear this phrase used more and more lately, &ldquo;An API First Strategy&rdquo;. It is something you hear from startups like <a href="https://www.lob.com/blog/api-first-development-makes-lob-more-productive">printing API LOB</a>, to <a href="https://developer.pearson.com/blog/creating-a-single-platform-for-all-pearson-apis/">established players like Pearson</a>, all the way up to <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F at the GSA in Washington DC</a>, but what is API first? Much like APIs in general, an API first strategy is something that will mean something different to each company, organization, government agency, or individual.
<p>From my view, the most common interpretation of API first will be:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Develop an API First</strong> - Before you build your website, web, mobile or single page application you develop an API first, then you get to work on defining the channels you will be making the API resources available on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had an interesting conversation today with the 18F team in Washington DC, and they illuminated some other possible dimensions to the API first conversation for me, that I wanted to explore a little:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Design Your API First</strong> - Using tools like <a href="https://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, and API definition formats like <a href="https://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a>, you kick off discussion with customers, generate user stories, and mockup your API, and even your web or mobile app interfaces, using your mock API.</li>
<li><strong>API First In Open Source Software -</strong> Encouraging the development and use of open source software solutions similar to Wordpress, that have API by default, so when agencies deploy them, they always have an API as part of their first steps for making access and integration decision&mdash;something that can drastically shift what is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to help small business, non-profit organizations, and government of all shapes and sizes understand the benefits of an API first strategy, so having conversation with API leaders like 18F, and getting their view on what API first means is essential to my storytelling process. How do you view API first at your company? How has your development lifecycle evolved since embracing APIs? Let me know, I&rsquo;m curious to hear other views on the phrase.
<p>All three of the dimensions laid out above are very appealing to me. I am big advocate for "API first being" about API design, open source software architectural patterns, or just a way of life before you consider connecting any web, mobile, or single page app to a back-end system. To me, API is more about conversation, collaboration, and access to ideas and resources, before we even get to any technical definition of what an API can be&mdash;making API first strategies more about philosophy and methodology, rather than what technical component you develop first.

<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/08/next-stable-version-of-apisjson--apisio-is-ready--are-your-apis-discoverable/">published the story last night on finalizing the most recent version of the API discovery format APIs.json</a>, and the support for it in the open source API search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Steve and I are done messing with the format for a while, and want to encourage API providers to begin describing their APIs using the open format.
<p>After publishing the story last night, I also had an interesting comment on Google+ from <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JonasHellstr%C3%B6m/posts">Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m</a>:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apis-json-timeline.png" alt="" width="450" />
<p>The question got me thinking about how APIs.json rolled out. As with <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, APIs.json started as a conversation between Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I. Around the beginning of April we combined our notes on what each of us envisioned when it came to API discovery, establishing the first APIs.json definition with the timeline going roughly like this:
<ul>
<li><strong>April 2014&nbsp;</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Steve and I established version .11 of APIs.json</li>
<li>We emailed a handful of smart folks that we trusted for feedback</li>
<li>Crafted version .12 of APIs.json</li>
<li>Developed <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>May 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>We <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/05/20/announcing-apisjson-at-gluecon-2014/">launched API.json at Gluecon</a> in Broomfield, CO</li>
<li>Encouraged discussion via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson">APIs.json Google Group</a></li>
<li>Encouraged feedback via the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">Github issue management</a> on APIs.json repo</li>
<li>Cotinued email Conversations</li>
<li>Established a Twitter presence for <a href="https://twitter.com/apisjson">@apisjson</a></li>
<li>Presented as part of session at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days in Barcelona, Spain</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>June 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Establish version 0.13 of APIs.json</li>
<li>Continued discussion on Google Group</li>
<li>Continued feedback on Github issue management</li>
<li>Continued email conversations&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>July 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Conducted a session on API discovery, including APIs.json at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">APICraft</a> in Detroit</li>
<li>Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) for the work on the JSON schema (thank you Tony!)</li>
<li>Established version <a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.14.txt">0.14 of APIs.json</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>August 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Updated APIs.json for API Evangelist network to version 0.14</li>
<li>Updated APIs.io to support version 0.14 of APIs.json</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an interesting five months. I like to record things like this while they are fresh in my mind, because as time moves on, the details fade into the past. I feel like if I do not capture the moment, it will be forgotten and it will be like it never happened.
<p>I think we got the feedback from the community we needed to get to the first stable version, and I want to thank&nbsp;@fehguy, @mamund, @darrel_miller, @OriPekelman, @xmlgrrl, @johnmusser, and the attendees at Gluecon, APIDays, and APICraft for listening, and providing feedback. Also thanks to&nbsp;Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m for your great question!
<p>It will be interesting to see what <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> looks like in 2015--it is a very exciting time!

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.sydcon.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/chicago/sydcon/sydcon-web-development.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I just talked with Dave Devitt (<a href="https://twitter.com/sydcon">@sydcon</a>), President at <a title="SYDCON web development inc. in Chicago" href="http://www.sydcon.com/">SYDCON Web Development, Inc. in Chicago</a> about how his web and mobile development shop sees the world APIs. I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for stories about how the everyday person on the ground at startups, all the way up to the federal government, actually see the world of APIs, and I was pleased that Dave could make some time to share his view of APIs with me.
<p>First, Dave said something I found very interesting when we first started our conversation. He said they were a &ldquo;web development shop&rdquo;, not in the the sense that they build websites, but that they develop applications that use the web for their operations.  I think this is an important distinction when we start putting developers  into buckets, and it isn&rsquo;t always as straightforward as building websites, web applications, mobile, single page or Internet of Things apps&mdash;we are now building software that uses the Internet for communication, something that will inevitably use all of these channels (and more).
<p>When it comes to API usage at SYDCON, they primarily use what we all call public APIs for driving commerce. Whether it is B2B or B2C, Dave&rsquo;s team is using APIs to sell products, integrate with payment systems like Authorize.net and PayPal, activating and validating of gift cards. Whether it is the nature of development or just a reflection on the type of customers SYDCON has, commerce is a pretty clear motivator for public API integration. The modern web API movement was started by commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Paypal, and 14 years in it makes sense that commerce is a major driver of development at smaller develop shops.
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sydcon"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/chicago/sydcon/dave-nevitt-sydcon.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>Beyond commerce, the main usage of APIs at SYDCON is about opening up access to internal resources that exist within their client systems, and making them available to buid apps on top of. Dave provided an example of a oil &amp; gas worker who uses one of the mobile applications they&rsquo;ve developed to scan the barcode of a 4 inch PVC pipe, and using an API the mobile application is then able to access the company&rsquo;s internal product database and return information to the worker looking to get their job done, with the assistance of the mobile app they've developed. APIs are how they deliver the resources they need for the mobile applications they develop for their customers. Period. It can be products in a database, or media across servers, APIs are how these reousrces are delivered to the web enabled applications SYDCON delivers.
<p>It was good to hear the stories from Dave at <a title="SYDCON web development inc. in Chicago" href="http://www.sydcon.com/">SYDCON</a>, and understand what API usage looks like on the ground at a Chicago area application dev shop. I think we can easily get blind to what the mainstream developers are needing when it comes to APIs, being so close to the Silicon Valley echo chamber, as well as playing a part in some of the bleeding edge aspects of the API sector. Talking with people like Dave who actually are making a living developing APIs, and web enabled applications, whether it is a web or mobile, is extremely valuable to me when I am working to better understand the realities of the API space.
<p>Thanks for your time today Dave. I have calls scheduled with other web and mobile development shops, as well as some IT and analytics firms, as I lead up to the API conversations we will be having at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago</a>. The event is titled &ldquo;APIs Go Mainstream&rdquo;, so I think that conversations with small and medium sized development shops about how APIs are impacting their day to day worlds are super relevant, and something the larger API industry should tune into.

<p>title: ‘An API Case Study Format From Google Cloud Platform’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I was browsing through <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google&rsquo;s Cloud Platform</a>, in the 15 minute lead up to a preliminary discussion with Google about being an evangelist for the platform (another story), and I saw a useful pattern from the "customers" section for publishing API customer case studies--something I wanted to share with you.
<p>This pattern was evident in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/redbus/">Travel Agency Masters Big Data with Google BigQuery case study</a>. I think the format for the case study provides a simple format that other API providers might consider following:
<ul>
<li>A catchy summary title&nbsp;</li>
<li>Challenge the company faced&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solution to the problem&nbsp;</li>
<li>A quote from company&nbsp;</li>
<li>Results from the solution</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/redbus/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/google-cloud-platform/logo-redbus.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>
<p>Additionally, Google provides an "At a Glance" summary in the left hand bar, for those busy folks who don't have the time to read case studies, providing a quick summary of the case study:
<ul>
<li>What they wanted to do&nbsp;</li>
<li>What they did&nbsp;</li>
<li>What they accomplished&nbsp;</li>
<li>About API service used</li>
</ul>
<p>The outline for the case study, as well as the summary version is a nice, simple format that any API provider could use to when crafting their own API case study experience. The format allows for easy scanning by visitors, which allows for us busy folks to read, or quickly scan multiple case studies--giving more context to the potential value an API will deliver.

<p>title: ‘Next Stable Version of APIs.json + APIs.io Is Ready - Are Your APIs Discoverable?’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>Steve (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), Nicolas (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), and I have been working hard to gather all the feedback from some very smart folks on the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">API.json format</a>. Now we are stoked to finally announce that we have the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">0.14 version</a> ready for prime time. Our goal with the first version of APIs.json, was to just get the idea out there to get feedback from the community, and after four iterations, we feel like the format is now something the community can really build on.
<p>First, lets recap, what is APIs.json? APIs.json is a machine readable JSON file that lives in the root of your domain, and describes your APIs and its supporting API program.
<p>Think of APIs.json as a <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap.xml</a> from Google, but instead of describing all the pages of your website, an APIs.json describes your developer portal, all available APIs, and the supporting building blocks of your API program--allowing you to describe your API efforts whether it is a public, or private affair. The goal is simply to provide a machine readable description, that any search engine can crawl, and make sense of your overall API program, and each individual API resource.
<p>The real power of APIs.json lies in the properties that you can apply to your APIs. We wanted to start with providing basic links meant for humans, like a link to the API signup page, or documentation, but then quickly provide machine readable elements like a <a href="https://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger specification</a>, or <a href="https://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a> manifest. However we don&rsquo;t want to define and control all of the properties you use to describe your APIs, and while we have a <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues/44">short list of additional properties</a> that we are adding in on the next version, you can use any property you like just by adding x- to your own type label.
<p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>Along with the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json 0.14</a> release, the API search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> also supports the latest APIs.json format. You can now validate your APIs.json 0.14, and submit your API.json for indexing using the APIs.io interface or API (mind blown). Your APIs.json will be your gateway to API discovery in the future, and since <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> is an open source API search engine, it will just be the first of a wave of new API search engines to emerge, built on the APIs.json format.
<p>While we will be making slight changes in coming versions of APIs.json, we feel like the format is now ready for prime time, and we encourage the entire API community to begin participating in the next generation of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, where your API, and the details of your API program are machine readable, and discoverable, in a single, known location at your company, organization, or agencies &nbsp;public or private domain.

<p>title: ‘Expanding API Gateway Connectors Into A World of API Deployment Startups’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-connector.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-connector.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing an increase in the number of API deployment services this year, such as startups like <a href="https://bit.ly/1jLr1Pf">StrongLoop</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>. These companies are looking to help all of us deploy APIs from common systems, often without the need for IT or programming resources.
<p>The providers I&rsquo;m seeing emerge are catering to some of the lowest hanging fruit for deploying APIs. The commonly used, and easiest to access systems, that contain the valuable content, data, and media we need to make accessible via APIs.
<p>The common source for many of these API deploy solutions are:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Excel Spreadsheet&nbsp;with</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://sheetlabs.com">SheetLabs</a></li>
<li><strong>Google Spreadsheet&nbsp;from</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a></li>
<li><strong>Database&nbsp;At The</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/">Dream Factory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These common information sources, represent the places where the average person in any size company, organization or government agency will be storing their valuable resources.  It makes sense that this new wave of API deployment startups would target these services.
<p>If you consider every system integration option that classic API gateways have delivered, it provides a good reference for finding opportunities for building independent API deployment solutions, that if done right, could be a startup all by itself.
<p>Not all companies can afford a full API gateway solution, and their needs are too small for a gateway. There is an emerging opportunity to help people quickly deploy APIs from common sources like spreadsheet, database, file stores, as well as more unique sources like specialty CMS and CRM systems.
<p>Sometimes I like to look at the expanding API universe as a result of the SOA big bang, where all the tools that were in your SOA toolbox, being liberated, and available as independent services that you can get from an increasing number of new API deployment startups.

<p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago, September 24-26th</a>, I did a little research on where the good beers, and specifically the kick-ass IPAs can be found.

<p>While in Chicago we want to be able to have the tasiest beer possible at the conference, while also having the best options for finding good beer and food after the event to network and socialize with the 600+ folks that will be at #APIStrat. To prepare for #APIStrat I found 32 local Chicago breweries:

<p>A blog is such a simple thing, but when it comes to the world of APIs, it can be one of the most important signals for whether or not an API is worthy of integration, or you should just move on and continue looking for another API to use. I know many folks will dismiss that a blog is so relevant, especially if they are coming from IT or developer disciplines--I respectfully decline.
<p>In reality, a blog not only provides a great way to keep API consumers up to date, it also provides the essential human face to any API operation. An API&rsquo;s blog provides a regular flow of information that show there is someone behind the curtain, who is not just working on the API, but actively is contributing ideas to the API community, and is there to support.
<p>A blog is the number one signal for me when evaluating the quality of an API. I track on whether an API has a blog, how of the blog is updated, and how long since the last post. Using these signals, it is pretty easy to tell when a public API is getting the resources it needs, and when the support for a public API is losing steam within a company.
<p>Here is an example of this in action&mdash;back in April I commented on the ESPN API:
<div class="twitterBlock">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>It is sad that the last ESPN "API-focused musings and ramblings" was 1 year ago ;-( <a href="https://t.co/sMWDoFtacJ">http://t.co/sMWDoFtacJ</a> &gt;&gt; I prefer them more often
&mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/statuses/456313516891193346">April 16, 2014</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Sure enough, four short months later, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/08/public-apis-are-tough-when-you-are-in-a-tightly-controlled-industry/">ESPN announces they are shutting down their public APIs</a>. The existence of a blog for your API shows that you care about with your API community, regular blog posts show that you are thinking about your API community regularly and want to share stories with them, and when your blog goes silent, it speaks volumes about what is going on behind the curtain--run for the hills!
<p>What does your blog say about your API? Storytelling via a blog can be one of the most powerful tools in your <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> toolbox, but be careful an inactive API blog can quickly become the canary in the coal mine when it comes to imminent demise of a public API.

<p>title: ‘Share Your API News With Me On The API Report’</p>

<p>image:</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve launched a new API news site, designed to provide short news updates from across the world of APIs. The API Report is the newest part of the API Evangelist network of sites, with apievangelist.com as the analysis on the business of APIs, apivoice.com as the analysis on the politics of APIs, and the the API Report as the industry news heartbeat.
<p>The API Report is built on Github, as a public repository, using Github Pages, and Jekyll. This approach to blogging opens up the news site to a new form of collaborative publishing, allowing anyone to fork, author their own API news story, and make a pull request for publishing to the site. Every commit will be reviewed for quality, and either rejected, or published to the live API Report website. Each post should follow a simple format, allowing for easy scanning of the days API news by consumers. The API Report has an RSS feed, as well as a Twitter account, for reader and social syndication.
<p>Soon, the API Report will also have its own advertising network, which will allow anyone to purchase any of the advertising slots available in the header, right hand sidebar, and in the body of all blog posts. Advertising will be priced very low at first, but as pageviews grow, and demand increases, and weekly market rate will be set--allowing for weekly turnover of advertising opportunities.
<p>If you are an API provider of any shape or size, or an API enthusiast, I recommend you help craft stories for the API Report, fork the site, and make a pull request, anytime you have a new piece you want share. Once the API Report advertising is up and running, and being monetized, I will be setting aside 50% of revenue and sharing with all contributors based upon pageviews.
<p>The API Report is brand new, and looking to be the place where the community can publish their own stories about providing, consuming, or delivering services to the API space, and provide a regular news heartbeat for the API community, by the API community.
<p>Get involved as early as you can, I'd love your feedback.

<p>title: ‘Public APIs Are Tough When You Are In A Tightly Controlled Industry’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/espn/espn-api-black_200.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://developer.espn.com/branding"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/espn/espn-api-black_200.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>ESPN just <a href="http://developer.espn.com/blog/read/publicretirement">announced that they will no longer be accepting registrations for public API keys</a>, and discontinuing all of their public APIs. I saw a few enraged comments on the Twitterz when I originally tweeted out the story, and also saw a couple of people compare it to the recent <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">Netflix API deprecation</a>.
<p>In reality I don't think the shuttering of the public ESPN API, or the Netflix API is a reflection on the viability of APIs, steering clear of the usual API FUD <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">that APIs are forever, wait no&hellip;they can go away at any time</a>! I think the decision to shutter the ESPN API is due to lack of vision, outreach, and the establishment of the vital developer feedback loops that are necessary to make APIs successful, but most importantly they failed to understand the challenges faced when deploying APIs in a tightly controlled industry.
<p>Doing public APIs in tightly controlled spaces like the movie and sports industry has to be tough. Both to these spaces have built their empires on tightly controlling the content, messaging, distribution, branding, and other elements&mdash;which are all things that work against the ethos of a successful public API strategy.  In my mind it shows that APIs aren&rsquo;t really the thing we all claim they are, it is everything that comes bundled the API, and a company's willingness to evolve.
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we'll see waves of other companies, who come from legacy industries like movies, sports, publishing, television, and other similar sectors, try APIs, thinking they will be a technological silver bullet, in coming years who also neglect to pay attention to the business and politics of APIs that will provide essential building blocks that support the technology.
<p>There are plenty of lessons to be learned from both ESPN and Netflix, but two that stand out for me, is the importance of understanding the entire lifecycle of the resources you are making available, and the value of having a robust API service composition and API access tiers, that sensibly serve internal, partner, and in some(not all) cases public API consumers.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>I went through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">77 federal government API developer portals</a> a couple of weeks ago, as part of some <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> work I&rsquo;m doing with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. I ended up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">targeting 120 APIs</a> that I will be generating of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a> definitions, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">API.json</a> for their umbrella domain, or subdomain over the next couple months.
<p>As I made my way through each of these developer areas, I began to realize that I would have to sign up for API keys at each of these developer areas. I&rsquo;m sure some of the APIs will not require a key, but it is still potentially 77 separate API keys (I will let you know the final count when I know), that I will have to register for&mdash;the federal government needs a common, yet distributed API management strategy.
<p>To augment this common, yet distribution API management strategy, I would like to be able to just use Github oAuth to ping an API provider, request my application keys, and using the Github API to then store them in a repository of my choosing. I store all of my API keys for my applications, in a central location that my apps can securely put to use, and in many cases these apps are already using a private Github repository as a centralized configuration location.
<p>I shouldn't have to go through 77 separate API registration flows to get the API keys I need. I should be able to get API access in a programmatic way, using my existing Github account, and put Github oAuth to use in an authentication flow, getting the API keys I need in real time, in the location that I need them.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-key.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>This API access workflow would allow me to quickly gain access to resources I need for my apps, and store all my API keys in a single, or across multiple Github repositories&mdash;potentially giving me a simple, but powerful way to manage all of my API keys, via Github.&nbsp;
<p>Could someone please build this, so that government, and even the private sector APIs can install on their server, and provide me machine readable access to generate an API account, the API keys I need, and store them in one of my chosen Github repositories. I think it would make both API providers, and API consumers lives much easier. We could even develop some sort of trust layer in there based upon Github profiles, allowing API providers to assess new registrations, and provide didn&rsquo;t levels of access, based upon their trust of a Github profile.
<p>We are moving beyond the world where we use one or two APIs, we are now using 10 or 20 different APIs, or more, from multiple providers, and there needs to be a better solution for us to manage API key access. I really appreciate you building this, I just don't have the time ;-)<p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I was learning more about the <a href="http://timrogers.uk/2014/07/12/discovering-private-apis-with-charles-app/">discovery of private APIs with the Charles App</a>, and was fascinated by its potential to visualize, and map the darkest regions of the API realm. There is a lot of speculation about the number of APIs out there, with the 10K+ public APIs that are currently available being the &ldquo;tip of the iceberg&rdquo;, and the number of private APIs rpresenting the rest of the surface area below the dark surface--making the approach that Tim Rogers (and others) employ a tantalizing option for mapping these dark waters of the rapidly expanding API space.
<p><a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">HTTP proxing and monitoring solutions like Charles</a> are nothing new, and there are a wealth of next generation&nbsp;<a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">API integration</a> tools like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> and <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> available, but what is interesting about this, is the routing all of your app traffic for your laptop, tablet or smartphone through a proxy, and record not just the traffic between you and the private APIs your apps depend on, but the mapping out the API interface, request, response, and underlying data models.
<p>Before I continue with this story, I have to admit this is a little on the dark side of APIs, and is something I don't recommend doing, because you are going to piss off a whole bunch of API providers&mdash;regardless, I think it is an interesting idea, that is worth sharing and discussing.
<p>What if someone packaged up an HTTP proxy, monitoring, and provided a recording layer for the interface, requests, responses, and data models, scrubbed out PII, and allowed individuals to opt in and publish the resulting definitions to a shared, public registry?
<p>Of course you would not publish your own transmissions, and underlying data, you would only publish the interface, requests, responses, and data models for the private APIs that are driving your public mobile and tablet applications. This centralized location would then aggregate, and shed light on this dark region, providing a single directory to discover what goes into all of the private APIs we depend on in our everyday lives.
<p>Something like this would pretty quickly map the world of private APIs, but at first glance I think the negative backlash would far outweigh the benefits. Mobile app providers would recoil, and probably look for ways to secure the inner workings of their mobile apps...or would they? It might also have the opposite effect, and push providers to realize they need to be more transparent with their APIs, and while they don't need to open up access to for everyone to use, they could publicly share the technological surface area their(our) apps depend on&mdash;which in my opinion is never the secret sauce, and a company should always be willing to share. (I know controversial) Think of it as the shared zone between provider and app.
<p>The concept of a rogue API registry for internal APIs is one of those areas I see as pretty damn grey, and I'm unsure how I feel about it. I personally wouldn't recommend building a tool or a registry for mapping private APIs like this, because I worry about the repercussions it would have. One the other side it also fascinates me, and is a concept that is very much in the public domain already, and is something I feel is  worthy of discussion, or at least more thought.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-waiter.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I began exploring the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">use a restaurant menu to help people understand API copyright</a>, and how your API definition is not your secret sauce, and that there is so much more to your API that just the surface area.
<p>I'm continuing my exploration of using restaurants as an analogy to help onboard people with not just API copyright, but introducing APIs to the masses--helping them understand the layers to the API space, in a way that is familiar.
<p>To prepare for future stories and conversations I'm expanding on my API definition = Menu analogy with:
<ul>
<li>API Providers = Restaurant Owners</li>
<li>Developer Portal = Restaurant</li>
<li>APIs = Food &amp; Drink Items</li>
<li>API Definition + Docs = Menu</li>
<li>API Consumers (Apps) = Restaurant&nbsp; Customers (People)</li>
<li>Freemium - Samples Out Front</li>
<li>Partner Access = Catering</li>
<li>Terms of Service = We Reserve The Right To Refuse - No Substitutions</li>
<li>API Service Providers = Restaurant Equipment Providers</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously it is work in progress. I will need better stories and visuals to get the concept across. Then once I start working through the different types of restaurants (ie. American, Chinese, Mexican, Fusion, etc), I'm sure I'll flush out more, while also potentially hitting some dead ends.
<p>Explaining what an API is, let alone the versatility and flexibility of an API, is really hard. I need as many tools in my API toolbox to help get people up to speed, understanding what an API is, and how it can apply to their business. We'll see where I go with the restaurant analogy, who knows it might be a dead end. It proved to be extremeley valuable in helping people understand API copyright, and I'm hopefull it will do the same for APIs in general.
<p>Let me know your thoughts...

<p>I spend a great deal of time looking at new APIs from companies, institutions, and government agencies during my weekly monitoring of the API space, and over the last couple years, I've come across an increasing number of APIs tht are out of higher educational institutions around the world. It began with a c<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/2012/05/29/university-information-services-with-apis/">entralized developer area at the University of Washington (UW)</a>, and then <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/get-a-list-of-all-classes-at-uc-berkeley-with-api-call/">I saw the same from UC Berkeley</a>, with more recently noticing the impressive <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">conversion of 250+ services from a traditional Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), to a more modern web API approach, at Brigham Young University (BYU)</a>.
<p>Along the way I began seeing that APIs at higher education institutions were going to be an important piece of the overall API puzzle, and as I do with any research area, I setup a Github repository (<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university.apievangelist.com</a>), and began tracking on universities who were doing anything interesting with APIs, no matter how small. I now track on twelve separate higher education institutions that have active API efforts, and I have been engaging in active conversations with two of the institutions, regarding their strategy, working to understand how I can provide any guidance, but also learn from each team about the unique challenges higher education institutions face when designing, deploying, manage, and even evangelize their APIs.
<p>My university API research has now reached a level, where I have enough material to produce a white paper, so over the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve worked to compile all of my work into a single downloadable narrative. As with all of my API research, this white paper will change often, as my work is never done. I&rsquo;ll keep adding institutions, and evolving my understanding an awareness of APIs in higher education as long as there is meaningful activity to be found. The reason I produced this white paper, before I finished other papers I&rsquo;m working on for <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/">payment APIs</a>, and&nbsp;APIs in the federal government, is because I feel like higher education is going to be critical to the futrue of not just APIs, but also the overall web literacy of our society.
<p><strong>Higher Education Is Front Line For Web Literacy</strong><br /> A large part of our worlds have moved online. Whether it is entertainment at home, education in the classroom, or out and about on our mobile devices, we are living more of our lives online&mdash;increasing the imperative that we are empowering every student with at least a minimum amount of web literacy. Think of web literacy, like understanding your personal finances, every single adult must have a certain level of awareness of how our financial system operates. You don't need to understand the inner workings of banking and global markets, but you need to know how to setup a bank account, apply for credit or debit cards, balance your checkbook and pay your taxes. As our lives move online and our digital footprint expands, our data is fast becoming the online currency of Internet platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, increasing the need for us to understand the mechanisms at play in this new digital economy, and empower each student to take back some control.
<p>Web literacy goes beyond just what you will need to know in your job and career, it is what you will need to be a literate citizen, and use government services, conduct business, and even interact with your friends and community around you. Just as higher education has played a significant role in preparing our youth for the real world in the past, it will have to take the lead in providing them with the basic web literacy skills they will need to engage online in everyday scenarios, as well as the specialty career trajectories. API is a layer of web literacy, one that allows the tech savvy individual to peel back how the Internet works, and configure, tweak, and make the Internet work for them--not the other way around.
<p><strong>Providing A Blueprint For Other University To Follow</strong><br /> As I spent more time looking at universities, I wanted to create a static snapshot of the current state of APIs in higher education, share some of what I learned looking through the leading universities in the space, and also apply some of my wider knowledge from the API industry beyond the university campus--in hopes university leaders are listening.
<p>I want this paper to be a blueprint that any university CIO or CTO, student or energetic professor can pick up, and get an idea of what is going on across other universities when it comes to APIs. I&rsquo;m fascinated by what I&rsquo;m seeing out of BYU, UW, UC Berkeley, and UM, and as I do with the rest of the space, I&rsquo;m looking forward to monitoring their progress, and having more conversations about how we can make university API efforts more successful.
<p>I will continue to update this white paper as I find more examples of institutions putting to APIs to work. While much of this research is rooted in what I'm seeing across these 12 higher education institutions, there is still much that is speculation based on my experience, and as I find more concrete examples in the wild I'll expand and add to this paper.
<p>I can't emphasize enough, the important role that higher education will play in not just equipping the next generation with the web literacy skills they will need to be successful, but also help take the lead in defining the underlying pipes that will drive our increasingly digital economy. APIs are not good by default, they can be used is some very bad ways, and I'm confident that if higher education take a lead in the space, the patterns that can be established will provide a healthier path forward than if we let Silicon Valley continue to exclusively lead.
<p>You can find my white paper over at <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university.apievangelist.com</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/1kn8uhX">download the PDF</a> if you prefer. As with any other research area on the API Evangelist network, please feel free to let me know what's missing, or if you find any spelling or grammar mistakes, you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/university/issues">submit as issue</a>, or if you are feeling adventurous you can submit a pull request with the desired changes.

<p>title: ‘The Hypermedia API Debate: Sorry Reasonable Just Does Not Sell’</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-panel-0.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>I moderated a panel of hypermedia experts at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft in Detroit</a> last week. One theme that dominated not just the panel, but was also pervasive in the conversation over the next two days of the API event, was how can the hypermedia space, improve its overall image, message, and potentially reach a wider audience, and maybe even converting some of the hypermedia skeptics, to hypermedia evangelists.
<p>After a session at #APICraft, <a href="https://github.com/apicraft/detroit2014/wiki/Hypermedia%3A-Why-Y'all-Hatin'%3F">dedicated to understanding all the hypermedia hate</a>, Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) and I continued the conversation, where he stated: When it comes to hypermedia, and technology online, reasonable just doesn't sell.
<p>This statement sums up my views of the current state of the hypermedia conversation. I went into the event expecting a very heated debate, filled with very intelligent, passionate, yet opinionated and hard-headed individuals. If you even lightly pay attention to the world of APIs, you probably have stumbled across the conversation between passionate REST practitioners (aka <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">Restafarians</a>), and the more recently the select group of hypermedia specialists&mdash;producing an image that is perceived by some as passionate, opinionated, and pushy, or even portrayed as being down right mean, nasty, delusional and confrontational by some.
<p>What I saw on the hypermedia panel last Monday, and over the next two days at #APICraft, was anything but the popular image of REST and the hypermedia community. I don&rsquo;t dismiss that some REST, and hypermedia practitioners can be rude, mean, and less than tolerant of those of us who don&rsquo;t quite understand every detail, but this group of hypermedia leaders were anything but. They were humble, articulate, and eager to better understand the hypermedia approaches of their colleagues, and try to understand how to better get the message out to the larger public.
<p>So where does this image come from? I think there are two camps, who are equally to blame: 1) The <strong><em>hypermedia pioneers</em></strong> 2) The <strong><em>hypermedia skeptics&nbsp;</em></strong>&mdash; the rest of us are just along for a ride on this hypermedia roller coaster.
<p>First let&rsquo;s look at from the hypermedia skeptic side:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>One Client To Rule Them All -</strong> You often hear claims, whether true or not, that hypermedia pioneers claim if all APIs were hypermedia, we could have a single, intelligent client to rule them all, and do away with all of the crap we have now&mdash;think web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Adds Unnecessary Complexity -</strong> Adding extra links, and payload to each response just adds more complexity, without any benefits to warrant the added work.</li>
<li><strong>Too Lofty, Dreamy, and Still Academic -</strong> Many say that Hypermedia is just to big of a vision, and the hypermedia pioneers are too dreamy, and stuck in just an academic discussion&mdash;it won&rsquo;t work in the real world.</li>
<li><strong>Solution For All APIs - </strong>There are many claims that hypermedia is something that all API designers should follow, applying to APIs in all industries as a silver bullet style solution.</li>
<li><strong>Will Prevent APIs From Breaking - </strong>When you use hypermedia, your APIs are completely protected from breakage, and your developers will never feel any pain from API versioning, and the evolution of your API.</li>
<li><strong>Solves Discoverability -</strong> With each payload, you get instructions for what is next, so if you know an API endpoint, you should be able to find everything else from there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next let&rsquo;s look at from the hypermedia pioneers side:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Haters Gonna Hate -</strong> It has nothing to do with Hypermedia being good or bad, haters gonna hate. There is nothing you can do.</li>
<li><strong>They Don&rsquo;t Care - </strong>Nobody even cares about learning new things like hypermedia, so there is no reason to even explain it to them.</li>
<li><strong>They Don&rsquo;t Need To Understand -</strong> Not everyone even needs to understand what hypermedia APIs are, they will just benefit from the results. </li>
<li><strong>They Just  Don&rsquo;t Understand - </strong>Skeptics just haven&rsquo;t taken the time to understand what APIs are, and would rather just remain ignorant.</li>
<li><strong>Its OK to Not Be Perfect -</strong> Hypermedia makes it ok to not build your API 100% correctly the first time, allowing you to change it along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Use Media Types -</strong> People don't read docs, we need to rely on media types help provide the information developers will need.</li>
<li><strong>Give Us A Break - </strong>This shit is hard, and the hypermedia community is working hard, and taking risks to push APIs forward.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-panel-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>Beyond both the hypermedia pioneers, and the hypermedia skeptic camps, I think the main problem with the hypermedia conversation is as Mike said, "reasonable just doesn't sell&rdquo;. I think this is the number one illness in the whole debate, that some bloggers feel the need to polarize any debate, sensationalize and use hyperbole at every turn. You can see this playing out in coverage of hypermedia, but also around other areas of the API space like API deprecation, where the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">argument was either APIs can go away at any moment, to the other end where you have to support APIs forever</a>&mdash;not discussing the middle reality which would show there are plenty of APIs who handle deprecation very well, but year, that is boring, and really doesn't sell.
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what the hypermedia pioneers can do to shift the conversation:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Strong Implementations - </strong>The space needs for examples of hypermedia APIs in the wild, providing as much detail about the implementation, and hopefully a public API that they can actually go play with.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling -</strong> There needs to be much more storytelling about hypermedia. Not the technical narrative of your implementation, but a story of hypermedia APIs, and the solutions it delivers. Keep stories, short, inviting, compelling, and published often&mdash;we are all busy and don't always have the time to commit to reading longer pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Patience -</strong> Have patience with the community, this is complex stuff, and it will take time for hypermedia to roll out, get the implementations we need to showcase the potential, the tooling and resources needed to support developers.</li>
<li><strong>Friendly -</strong> Make sure and keep things friendly&mdash;this will go a long way in defusing the skeptics, and you never know you might convert them, one by one along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Speak To Management - </strong>When you are telling stories, building case studies, and presenting on your work, make sure you speak to management level as well as to developers. It can be the leadership that carves out time for developers to learn about hypermedia, or possibly mandate that it should be part of an API design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what the hypermedia skeptics can do to shift the conversation:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Make The Time To Read - </strong>There is some great material out there about hypermedia, to get you up to speed if you can carve out the time. Sure, we need more examples of hypermedia in the wild, case studies, and tooling, but in the mean time, make sure and read as much as you can before casting judgement.</li>
<li><strong>Make Sure And Listen -</strong> I heard some really compelling stories around how hypermedia works, and I bet if you take the time to listen to more of the conversation you might at least evolve your opinion of hypermedia.</li>
<li><strong>Think Long Term - </strong>Hypermedia provides some long term benefits that are often overlooked in the short term concerns about time and resources needed to get up to speed with hypermedia, and actually implement as part of your API design.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Worry About What You Don&rsquo;t Know -</strong> I feel like some of the trolling of hypermedia might be based upon insecurity about what one doesn&rsquo;t understand. I have to admit I don&rsquo;t fully grasp everything about hypermedia, but I see enough to grasp the long term potential, and know I should worker harder to close the gaps in my understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Be Mean -</strong> I&rsquo;ve seen some pretty harsh responses to what hypermedia pioneers are working on, and I think it would be easier to just walk away, rather than shitting on someones hard work. Hypermedia pioneers are putting a lot of time and energy into moving the space forward in positive ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately the ball is in the court of the hypermedia pioneers.There really is no reason that skeptics, or anyone else should care, until there is more examples, tooling, and stories around why hypermedia is worth the extra work in getting up to speed, and implementing as part of our APIs designs.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-hater-session.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>I see hypermedia at the same place, as REST was in 2010 when I started API Evangelist. I had witnessed first hand the solutions a RESTful API provided, and saw what was playing out in the public API space with Amazon, Twitter, and Twilio. As I continue to  study the space I saw the RESTafarians arguing, shaming and generally making people feel stupid for not understanding HTTP, and fighting over exactly what REST was. It appeared to me that REST would suffer from the same image problems as the semantic web, and linked data.
<p>The API space needed a friendlier layer, one that would help soften up some of the technical debates, and tell stories that would make all of this valuable knowledge more accessible&mdash;with this in mind, API Evangelist was born. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m responsible for web APIs moving into the mainstream consciousness, it has taken all the valuable implementations available out there to do that, but I do know I&rsquo;ve started some important conversations by working so hard to help everyone better understand the space.
<p>After what I saw in Detroit last week, during the hypermedia panel I moderated, and over the following two days, I&rsquo;m confident that with a little more storytelling we can shift the tone of this conversation in just a year or two. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight, but I saw some really smart, hardworking folks who were very humble about their hypermedia work, and willing to admit there is a lot of work to be done, and eager to help the public to better understand the benefits hypermedia will bring to not just individual API operations, but the overall API space.
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t believe that hypermedia offered significant benefits, I wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about it. In 2014 I&rsquo;m seeing the hypermedia conversation move beyond just the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-craft">API-Craft forum</a>, beyond just academic discussion, and we are seeing some meaningful implementations of hypermedia in the wild. I will keep working to evolve my understanding and storytelling around hypermedia, while also working with the experts to generate more stories, and examples of their own work.
<p><strong>Update: </strong>I changed the word hater to skeptic (except in the haters gonna hate bullet), John Sheehan said I should use, which seems sensible, and following my own advice. Thanks John.

<p>Irakli Nadareishvili (<a href="https://twitter.com/inadarei">@inadarei</a>), Dave Goldberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/davidgoldberg">@davidgoldberg</a>)&nbsp;and I were having an interesting conversation on the Twitterz, after I posted "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/03/as-we-recover-the-banking-industry-seems-to-be-warming-up-to-apis/">As We Recover The Banking Industry Seems To Be Warming Up To APIs</a>", yesterday--on a topic I think is worth repeating regularly, to generate discussion within any business sector.
<p>I think that all three of us are optimistic about what APIs can do in an industry like banking, and because of our experience, we are very realistic about what is possible in the end--realizing not every API will be good by default.
<p>I'll just let you follow along with our conversation, then I'll explore a little more:

<p>What would a Twilio look like for the banking industry? Probably similar to <a href="https://openbankproject.com/en/">The Open Bank Project</a> or <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, and focusing on rebooting, and simplifying just a single slice of the insanely complex banking system. I'm not saying that these two startups are the next Twilio of banking, but I do see them as two potential dynamite holes being drilled into the bedrock of a very entrenched, highly regulated industry, and powerful industry.
<p>I don't see APIs being the silver bullet to the banking industry, or any other industry for that matter. Slow change will happen through the solid execution of an API focused business strategy by one or more of the existing banking powerhouses, at the same time it will also take a wave of API driven banking startups, who hopefully emulate much of Twilio's game plan, to slowly to blast away at the bedrock core of the banking industry.
<p>Another thing to pay attention to, is when the large banks do understand how APIs are becoming the pipes for this new digital economy, they will begin to wield their power and influence, just as other 1000lb gorillas do in business sectors like education, healthcare, and other critical areas of our economy. APIs don't just purify the distribution of legacy power like a rocky mountain stream does to water, it will take the development of some pretty sophisticated API facades to mask legacy complexity, every step of the way.
<p>In a next post, I'll explore what this top down, and bottom up approach looks like, by examining the progress we have all made with open data, and APIs in the <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">federal government</a>.
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Sorry Irakli, I just couldn't use Twilio the "HECK" out of them. I have an edgy image to uphold, but remember everyone Irakli is the first person to use Twilio as a verb!

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-bank.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I originally started writing this post after <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, where I had numerous conversations with banks, about the potential of APIs, and how banks might be starting to move from talk to action, when it comes to their API programs.
<p>After recent talks with a couple more folks, behind the scenes at banks, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced, as the enterprise are doing in other sectors, banks are slowly waking up to the potential of APIs&mdash;something that has taken a long time, as they slowly come out of their bank vaults, where they were hiding during the economic meltdown.
<p>When you Google the phase "<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=banking%20api">banking API</a>", you see the signs that the space is ripe for disruption with APIs from two open banking pioneers:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://openbankproject.com/en/"><strong>The Open Bank Projec</strong>t</a> - an open source API and App store for banks that empowers financial institutions to securely and rapidly enhance their digital offerings using an ecosystem of 3rd party applications and services</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a></strong> - The Modern API for Banking Data, allowing developers to programmatically interact with banks and credit cards</li>
</ul>
<p>These players do not represent movement from the banking space itself, the conversation I&rsquo;ve had with Visa, Mastercard, Capital One, Rabobank, and others I can&rsquo;t even mention are notoriously closed about what they are doing, but these new open banking API platforms do represent the opportunity that exists in the space.
<p>Until I see robust, open developer areas from Chase, HSBC, Citigroup, and other banking giants, I won&rsquo;t declare APIs getting traction in the banking sector, but I think the ice is thawing, and I feel we are moving from just banks talking about APIs, to banks maybe, kinda sorta considering taking action when it comes to APIs.
<p>Hopefully I will get to talk about more of my conversations in the future, until then I will just showcase what The Open Bank Project and Plaid are up to, hopefully through public, competitive, and regulatory pressure, banks will open up more&mdash;I have little faith that they will do it on their own, without a little nudging.

<p><span>When visiting an API developer area, as soon as the page loads,&nbsp;you can tell if its an organized effort, or something that was thrown up by a single project or team. Half of the institutions I track on as part of my university API monitoring have a centralized developer area for their APIs, as well as what appears to be an organized approach behind the designing, deploying, managing or evangelizing their APIs.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>I&rsquo;ve talked with both&nbsp;University of California Berkeley and Brigham Young Universities about their API strategies, while only having light communication with University of Washington and Michigan. I feel there are some interesting lessons to be had when taking a look at these six leading universities.</span>

<p>title: ‘Everyone Is About To Get An API With The New Wordpress API’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/wordpress/wordpress-logo-stacked-rgb.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://wp-api.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/wordpress/wordpress-logo-stacked-rgb.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>While at <a href="https://bit.ly/1zIq2sl">API Craft in Detroit</a> this week I had the pleasure of hanging with two leads on the WordPress(org) development team, and discuss the API strategy for the blogging platform. Andrew Nacin (<a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a>), Lead Developer, and Ryan McCue (<a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue">@rmccue</a>), WordPress Plugin Developer, facilitated an open circle discussion to work through the challenges that WordPress is facing when developing an API for the open source blogging platform.
<p>At face value, I know a number of API developers who will be less than pleased when they hear about a <a href="http://wp-api.org/">WordPress API</a>, as both PHP, and WordPress are easy targets for developer&rsquo;s hatred, for generating less than perfect code. ;-) But, in the end you can&rsquo;t ignore some of the stats on WordPress usage:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">Used by more than 22.0% of the top 10 million websites as of August 2013</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">Most popular blogging system in use on the Web, used in more than 60 million websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wordpress.com/stats/">Over 409 million people view more than 15.5 billion pages each month</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wordpress.com/stats/">Users produce about 41.7 million new posts and 60.5 million new comments each month</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These stats don&rsquo;t even touch on the number of WordPress plugins and mobile solutions there are developed on the insanely popular website, and blogging platform. I couldn't think of a better platform to start rolling APIs out APIs to the masses, and quickly educating a very large group of tech savvy folks along the way.
<p><a href="https://en.wordpress.com/stats/"><img style="padding: 15px; margin-left: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/wordpress/wordpress-traffic.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>Many of these WordPress sites are already integrated with popular API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, so it makes sense to educate WordPress administrators on the APIs they are already using, as well as introduce them to the concept of having their own API around the potentially valuable content they generate.
<p><strong>We Are Talking About Developing 60 M+ Distributed APIs</strong><br /> There is no API deployment or management service provider that is even close to numbers of this magnitude. When ready, the WordPress API will give millions of websites, and the individuals, companies, organizations and government agencies behind them, an Application Programming Interface (API). (weird, I haven't spelled that out in a while) What does this mean for the API sector? I do not know yet, but to me it definitely resembles the long tail of API deployment, that I, and <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> have been advocating for the last four years.&nbsp;
<p><strong>Building For The Lowest Common Denominator</strong><br /> One dominant theme in the conversation around the WordPress API at API Craft, was about building an API for the lowest common denominator. WordPress is an open source blogging platform built using PHP and MySQL, something that enables it to be installed on just about any hosting platform, which has contributed to the platform's growth. However, many of these platforms restrict common aspects of the Internet like the ability to use all of your HTTP verbs, like PUT or DELETE, or simply do not offer essentials like SSL, which is needed for oAuth. The bar for developing an API that will be used by 60 M+ providers has to be set pretty low, ensuring it will work across the entire ecosystem&mdash;something WordPress is already pretty damn good at.
<p><strong>Ensuring That The WordPress API Is Extensible</strong><br /> One of the hallmarks of WordPress is the ability to create custom themes and plugins, that extend the functionality of the blogging platform, and the API will be no different. WordPress is much more than just a collection of pages, posts, tags, and links. WordPress has been used as the core of just about any time of website, serving up books, photos, videos, maps, and any other content type you can dream up. The WordPress API has to be able to provide a common interface that can be used to create, read, update, and delete core WP content types, like pages and posts, as well as be extended to any other interpretation the WordPress community can dream up&mdash;adding another dimension to the already massive scope of delivering an API to 60M+ websites.
<p><strong>Single Place To Educate Everyone About APIs</strong><br /> I can't think of another platform that has introduced the average person to web programming, more than WordPress (maybe Drupal?). When you go back to the concept of lowest common denominator, WordPress employs PHP and MysQL to drive its functionality, and combined with the plugin and theme extensibility, the platform has provided a rich gateway to the world of web, and mobile app development. The opportunities to introduce, and educate the masses of the benefits (and downside) of APIs, is huge! While the already established API developer community may not want the WordPress community developing APIs, it will be the quickest way we from 10K APIs, into the millions of APIs.  WordPress drives 22.0% of the top 10 million websites, which will instantly provide access to some potentially high value content and data, that will significantly increase the size of the overall API economy, as well as contribute to API literacy in every business sector, around the globe.
<p>At the time of this post, the <a href="http://wp-api.org/">WordPress API is only a plugin</a>, which means it is an optional part of the platform, requiring a WordPress site administrator to know about the plugin, and install as part of their individual WordPress installation. However, the goal is to bake the API into WordPress as part of the 4.1 release, which could happen as soon as this fall, or at the latest the first or second quarter of 2015.  While not all 60 M+ WordPress sites will immediately update to the 4.1 release, a significant portion of websites around the world will instantly have an API--good or bad.
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited at the idea of so many websites having APIs, then at the same time I'm completely terrified. It is kind of like flooding the market, with some very high value APIs, while also adding millions of very shitty APIs, and I'm sure a lot in the middle. With a lot of the problems we are facing around discovery and integration at 10K, imagine what things will look like with millions of APIs all of a sudden. Do we want every website to have an API this fast?
<p>Beyond just giving a website an API, I'm also very interested in the potential of using WordPress API as purely an API core, allowing it to be used to drive content and data for mobile, and <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">single page applications (SPA)</a>. Considering the innovation we've seen around the core WordPress platform, from the community, I imagine we'll see similar when it comes to just raw API deployment, and when you start considering the potential when bundled with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">latest containerization movement</a>, led by <a href="https://docker.io">Docker.io</a>, and being driven by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/04/23/aws-elastic-beanstalk-adds-docker-support/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers">Google</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/06/09/docker-and-azure-coolness/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2014/4/red-hat-docker-expand-collaboration">Red Hat</a>&mdash;your head will start to spin.
<blockquote><strong><em>WordPress API + Virtual Containers = API Deployment As Part Of The Fabric Of The Cloud</em></strong></blockquote>
<p>I will be carving out more time to consider the implications of the introduction of the WordPress API, and hopefully provide more feedback to the WordPress API development team. If you are a seasoned WordPress developer, and experienced API consumer, you might consider getting involved too.  You can get access to the source code for <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API">WP API over at Github</a>, and you can <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues">submit issues via the issue management</a> for the project&mdash;they also provide updates via the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/json-api/">WP blog tagged as json-api</a>.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring one possible API future more and more lately, a future which centers around the a concept of being able to deploy <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>, by employing the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/the-power-of-designing-and-deploying-api-driven-resources-in-containers/">power of deploying API resources in virtualized containers</a>, something that will free individual API resources up for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">orchestration in new and exciting ways</a>--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">doing for APIs, what APIs have been doing for companies</a>.
<p>Driven by a recent evolution in cloud computing introduced by <a href="https://docker.io">Docker.io</a>, we are beginning to see new services emerge that get us closer to this vision of API orchesstration. Last week I wrote about how <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/23/the-new-strongloop-api-server-provides-a-look-at-future-of-api-deployment/">StrongLoop providing one look at the future of API deployment</a>, using Node.js. This week I was introduced to another API deployment solution that also resembles some of these earlier thoughts I have had on API orchestration, from <a href="https://api.blockspring.com/">BlockSpring</a>.
<p>Blockspring deploys a containerized API for any Python, Ruby, and R scripts, so all you do is take some code resource, deploy using BlockSpring, and it generates API endpoints, and a form interface for working with the resource. Blockspring provides documentation to help you understand how to craft your code, and a library to publish your API to, when ready.
<p>When you look at their API library, it even drops you into a folder called /blocks, which gives you into a list of APIs deployed using Blockspring, doing a range of functions from screen capture, applying image filters, to sentiment and text analysis. Blockspring enables, and encourages the design, and deployment of very granular API resources, that do one thing, and hopefully also doing it well, providing an interesting, and very modular way of deploying APIs--think legos.
<p>This deployment of simple, programmatic API resources, using a very containerized architecture, is an important new layer to the growing world of API orchestration, complimenting the simpler content and data driven API resources we are seeing deployed from spreadsheets and databases, and common file stores. I&rsquo;m not seeing a pure spreadsheet to API, or database to API solution which solely employs virtual containers, but I&rsquo;m sure its not far off.
<p>Seeing what Strongloop and Blockspring are up to makes me happy. Imagine a world where you can deploy exactly the data, content, and programmatic resources you will need for your web, mobile or single page application. This ability to define, deploy, scale and manage all of your API resources, in such a granular way will contribute significantly to the evolution how we build apps, and connect our devices to the Internet.
<p>This emerging landscape of new API orchestration platforms will change how we deploy and consume APIs, making APIs much more remixable and composable, bringing APIs out of their silos. I also hope this new approach will also expand on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale opportunities for API providers</a>, and continue to change how we monetize our content, data, and programmatic resources in the API economy.
