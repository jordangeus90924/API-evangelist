			<p><em>19 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time talking about the SalesForce API, using it as a reference for where the API evolution began 18 years ago, but it has been a long time since I’ve actually worked with the SalesForce API. Getting up and running with any API, especially iconic APIs that we all should be familiar with, is always an enlightening experience for me. Going from zero to understanding what is going on and actually achieving the API call(s) you want, is really what this game is all about. As part of some work I’m doing with Streamdata.io I needed to be able to add new leads into SalesForce, and I thought it would be a good time for me to get back into the saddle with the SalesForce REST API–so I volunteered to tackle the integration. The SalesForce API wasn’t as easy to get up and running as many simpler APIs I onboard with is, as the API docs isn’t as modern as I’d expect, and what you need is buried behind multiple clicks. Once you find what you are looking for, and click numerous times, you begin to get a feel for what is going on, and the object model in use becomes a little more accessible. In addition to finding what you need with the SalesForce REST API, you have to make sure you have a handle on the object structure and nuance of SalesForce itself. For this story, I am just working with one object–Leads. I’m using PHP to work with the API, and to begin I wanted to be able to get leads, to be able to see which leads I currently have in the system: I will add pagination, and other elements in the future. For now, I just wanted to be able to get the latest leads I have in the system to help with with some checks on what is being added. Now that I can check...[<a href="/2018/06/19/adding-a-lead-to-salesforce-using-the-rest-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>This report summarizes Skylight’s evaluation of the VA’s public datasets, which exist within the va.gov web domain, as well as an analysis of what types of data representatives of the Veteran community expressed would be most useful and valuable to Veterans and their supporters if made more digitally accessible and available by the VA. This report also outlines potential resources that can be turned into application programming interfaces (APIs) as part of the VA’s Lighthouse platform initiative, and actions the VA should consider to move forward successfully. Landscape analysis The purpose APIs are the next evolution in the web, and shouldn’t be thought of as the latest tech trend or vendor solution. The first phase of the web was about delivering data and content to humans using a browser. The second phase of the web is about delivering that same data and content to other applications and algorithms using APIs. With that said, the purpose of this landscape analysis is, in effect, to assist the VA in evaluating the data and content that they’ve made available during the first phase of the web. This, in turn, will help set the stage for the VA to make smart investments in phase two of their web presence. The VA has already signaled they’re committed to investing in the second phase of their web presence with the announcement of the Lighthouse API platform initiative. Our landscape analysis will help ensure that the Lighthouse program is aware of what types of data and content that the VA has already identified as important to serving the Veteran community. This visibility will allow the Lighthouse program to bring these resources into alignment with the development and operation of their API platform. The process To help the VA evaluate the landscape that defines their web presence, we employed a “low-hanging-fruit” process that involved identifying the resources that exist across their web properties. That process relied on a spidering script, which we ran...[<a href="/2018/06/18/va-api-landscape-analysis-and-roadmapping-project-report/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2018/06/18/the-importance-of-openapi-tooling/">The Importance Of OpenAPI Tooling</a></h3>
			<p><em>18 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>In my world, OpenAPI is always a primary actor, and the tooling and services that put it to work are always secondary. However, I’d say that 80% of the people I talk with are the opposite, putting OpenAPI tooling in a primary role, and the OpenAPI specification in a secondary role. This is the primary reason that many still see Swagger tooling as the value, and haven’t made the switch to the concept of OpenAPI, or understand the separation between the specification and the tooling. Another way in which you can see the importance of OpenAPI tooling is the slow migration of OpenAPI 2.0 to 3.0 users. Many folks I’ve talked to about OpenAPI 3.0 tell me that they haven’t made the jump because of the lack of tooling available for the specification. This isn’t always about the external services and tooling that supports OpenAPI 3.0, it is also about the internal tooling that supports it. It demonstrates the importance of tooling when it comes to the evolution, and adoption of OpenAPI. It demonstrates the need for the OAI community to keep investing in the development and evangelism of tooling for the latest version. I am going to work to invest more time into rounding up OpenAPI tooling, and getting to know the developers behind them, as I prepare APIStrat in Nashville, TN. I’m also going to invest in my own migration to OpenAPI 3.0. The reason I haven’t evolved isn’t because of lack tooling, it is because of a lack of time, and the cognitive load involved with thinking new ways. I fully grasp the differences between 2.0 and 3.0, but I just don’t have intuitive knowledge of 3.0 in the way I do for 2.0. I’ve spent hundreds of hours developing around 2.0, and I just don’t have the time in my schedule to make similar investment in 3.0–soon! If you need to get up to speed on the latest when it comes...[<a href="/2018/06/18/the-importance-of-openapi-tooling/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>After eight years of educating people about sensible API security and management, I’m always amazed at how many people I come across who still think public web APIs are about giving away access to your data, content, and algorithms for free. I regularly come across very smart people who say they’d be doing APIs, but they depend on revenue from selling their data and content, and wouldn’t benefit from just putting it online for everyone to download for free. I wonder when we stopped thinking the web was not about giving everything away for free? It is something I’m going to have to investigate a little more. For me, it shows how much education we still have ahead of us when it comes to informing people about what APIs are, and how to properly manage them. Which is a problem, when many of the companies I’m talking to are most likely doing APIs to drive internal systems, and public mobile applications. They are either unaware of the APIs that already exist across their organization, or think that because they don’t have a public developer portal showcasing their APIs, that they are much more private and secure than if they were openly offering them to partners and the public. Web API management has been around for over a decade now. Requiring ALL developers to authenticate when accessing any APIs, and the ability to put APIs into different access tiers, limit that the rate of consumption, while logging and billing for all API consumption isn’t anything new. Amazon has been extremely public about their AWS efforts, and the cloud isn’t a secret. The fact that smart business leaders see all of this and do not see that APIs are driving it all represents a disconnect amongst business leadership. It is something I’m going to be testing out a little bit more to see what levels of knowledge exist across many fortune 1000 companies, helping paint of picture...[<a href="/2018/06/08/people-still-think-apis-are-about-giving-away-your-data-for-free/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been evaluating API management providers, and this important stop along the API lifecycle in which they serve for eight years now. It is a space that I’m very familiar with, and have enjoyed watching it mature, evolve, and become something that is more standardized, and lately more commoditized. I’ve enjoyed watching the old guard (3Scale, Apigee, and Mashery) be acquired, and API management be baked into the cloud with AWS, Azure, and Google. I’ve also had fun learning about Kong, Tyk, and the next generation API management providers as they grow and evolve, as well as some of the older players like Axway as they work to retool so that they can compete and even lead the charge in the current environment. I am renewing efforts to study what each of the API management solutions provide, pushing forward my ongoing API management research, understanding what the current capacity of the active providers are, and potentially they are pushing forward the conversation. One of the things I’m extremely interested in learning more about is the connector, plugin, and extensibility opportunities that exist with each solution. Functionality that allows other 3rd party API service providers to inject their valuable services into the management layer of APIs, bringing other stops along the API lifecycle into management layer, allowing API providers to do more than just what their API management solution delivers. Turning the API management layer into much more than just authentication, service plan management, logging, analytics, and billing. Over the last year I’ve been working with API security provider ElasticBeam to help make sense of what is possible at the API management layer when it comes to securing our APIs. ElasticBeam can analyze the surface area of an API, as well as the DNS, web, API management, web server, and database logs for potential threats, and apply their machine learning models in real time. Without direct access at the API management layer, ElasticBeam is still valuable...[<a href="/2018/06/04/making-connections-at-the-api-management-layer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>
I’m kicking off a busy week of travel and talks this week in DC with a discussion about delivering microservices at federal agencies at DevNation Federal on Tuesday, June 5th, 2018. I was invited by Red Hat to come speak about the work I’m doing as API Evangelist across federal agencies. You can find me in the afternoon lineup, sharing my stories title “The Tech, Business, and Politics of APIs In Federal Government”. Focusing on information gathered as part of my research, workshops, and consulting across the public and private sector.

My talk reflects my work to motivate federal agencies to do APIs over the last five years, and help pollinate the ideas and practices I gather from across the private sector, and understand which ones will work in the public sphere. Not everything about doing APIs at startups and in the enterprise translates perfectly to delivering APIs in the federal government, but there are many practices that will help agencies better serve the people. My goal is to open up discussion with government employees and contractors, to help figure out what works and what doesn’t–sharing stories along the way.

Let me know if you are going to be at DevNation Federal let me know. I am happy to make some time to talk, and hear what you are up to with APIs. I depend on these hallway conversations to populate my blog with stories. I’ll be in town around noon, and there until around 5 or so until I head over to the DC API Meetup for my second talk of the day. Thanks to Red Hat for having me out. I enjoy doing talks for Red Hat events, as they tend to reflect more of the audience I’m looking for, with a focus on more open source, and a little less proprietary focus when it comes to delivering government technology. I’ll see you in Washington D.C. on Tuesday!

			<p><em>04 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>After I speak at DevNation Federal in Washington DC this Tuesday, I am going to give a similar talk at the DC API API User Group that evening. I love going to the Meetups in DC, partly because my good friend Gray Brooks runs the event, but also because I’ve been working to jumpstart API conversations in Washington DC since 2012 when I held the first DC edition of API Craft. I was on a mission to jumpstart API Craft gatherings around the country that year, and it makes me happy to see the API Meetup culture continuing to thrive in DC, where other places it has died out. At the DC API Meetup I’ll be giving a variation of my talk that I’m giving earlier that day at DevNation Federal. Talking about the technology, business, and politics of doing APIs, with an emphasis on a consistent and repeatable API lifecycle. I’ll be reworking my regular material in light of current projects I’m working on at the federal level including with the VA, FDIC, HHS, and beyond. Sharing stories about how a microservice approach can help make government services more agile, flexible, and delivered in smaller more bite sized chunks–helping move the IT conversation forward across federal agencies. If you can’t make it to DevNation Federal, I recommend you head out to the DC API User Group later that evening. I’d love to get a chance to hang out with you and talk about APIs. I’m always impressed with the folks who turn out for the DC API Meetup, consistently providing a fresh opportunity to discuss APIs and the impact they are making across the federal government. Organizer Gray Brooks has his finger on the pulse of what is going on across agencies, way beyond what I am capable of from the outside-in. I look forward to hanging out in DC, and hope you can make it out Tuesday to talk some APIs with me....[<a href="/2018/06/04/catch-me-at-the-dc-api-user-group-in-washington-dc-this-tuesday-evening/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I conducted an API workshop at Genscape in Boston yesterday. I thoroughly enjoyed the conversation with the technical folks there, and found their pragmatic, yet educated views on APIs refreshing. I spent the day going through the usual stops along the API lifecycle, but found some of our breakout conversations during the API design section to be what has stuck with me on my train ride back to New York. Specifically the discussions around versioning, content negotiation and the overall design of paths, parameters, and potentially providing query language layers on top of APIs. After going through much of my textbook API design patterns for paths, and parameters, then working my through content negotiation and headers, we kept finding ourselves talking about what their clients were capable of. Bringing the API design discussion back around to why REST is still dominate in my opinion–simplicity, and lowering the bar for consumers. Time after time we found ourselves talking about their target consumers, the spreadsheet wielding data analyst, and how the bar needed to be kept low to make sure their needs were being met. Sure, we can quickly get academic and theoretical with the design practices, but if they fall on deaf ears, and API consumers do not adopt and use the API-driven tools, does it matter? I know that all of us API “thawt liters” would rather folks just do things the right way, but this isn’t always the reality on the ground. Most people within real world businesses don’t have the time or luxury to learn the right way of doing things, and take the time to disrupt their flow with new ways of doing things. Most of the time we need to just get people the data and other resources they need, in the tooling they are comfortable with (spreadsheet cough cough), and get out of their way.

			<p><em>31 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>A question I get regularly in my API workshops is, “how should we be organizing all of our microservices?” To which I always recommend they tune into what the API Academy team is up to, and then I dance around give a long winded answer about how hard it is for me to answer that. I think in response, I’m going to start asking for a complete org chart for their operations, list of all their database schema, and a list of all their clients and the industries they are operating in. It will still be a journey for them, or me to answer that question, but maybe this response will help them understand the scope of what they are asking. I wish I could provide simple answers for folks when it came to how they should be naming, grouping, and organizing their microservices. I just don’t have enough knowledge about their organization, clients, and the domains in which they operate to provide a simple answer. It is another one of those API journeys an organization will have to embark on, and find their own way forward. It would take so much time for me to get to know an organization, its culture, resources, and how they are being put to use, I hesitate to even provide any advice, short of pointing them to what the API Academy team publishes books, and provides talks on. They are the only guidance I know that goes beyond the hyped of definition of microservices, and actually gets at the root of how you do it within specific domains, and tackle the cultural side of the conversation. A significant portion of my workshops lately have been about helping groups think about delivering services using a consistent API lifecycle, and showing them the potential for API governance if they can achieve this consistency.

			<p><em>30 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I know, time flies and we are all very busy, but have you submitted your talk for APIStrat Nashville? The call for papers closes next Friday, June 8, 2018 at 11:59 PM PST! This is the second edition of the conference being run by the OpenAPI community, and is something you aren’t going to want to miss. We are bringing together the usual API community suspects, but also working to build upon the work that is going on in the fast growing OpenAPI community. The conference continues to be its usual voice of the API community, and won’t be all about the OpenAPI specification, but it it will definitely be where you want to be showcasing any groundbreaking work you are doing around the specification. The CFP process for APIStrat Nashville asks three main questions: How will the audience benefit from your presentation? Why should YOU be the one to give this talk? You have a unique story. Tell it. Be prepared to explain how this fits into the API ecosystem. After answering these questions we are looking for talks in the following areas of doing APIs: API Design, API For the Greater Good, API Management, API SDKs &amp; Clients, API Security, API Success Stories, API Transformations, API Testing, API Usability, At The Protocol Level, Digital Transformation, GraphQL, Hypermedia, Machine Learning, Microservices, REST, RPC systems, and Standards &amp; Definitions. However, don’t let these topics put you in a box. We want you to think about whatever you think will make the biggest impact on the audience, and hopefully the wider API community. Do not wait until the last moment to get your talk submitted! Last year, as the program chair I spoke with a number of people who had waited too long, and didn’t get their talk in front of the program committee early on. As soon as the submission are close they will begin spending time reviewing the talks, and while we may consider...[<a href="/2018/05/30/apistrat-nashville-call-for-papers-closes-at-the-end-of-next-week/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>
Most of this API stuff isn’t technical. For APIs to work at scale within a single company, a wider industry, or across government agencies, you need people who are committed to evangelism, coaching, and communication around everything that is occurring across API ecosystems. We often times get caught up in our work, and operating within our silos and forget to email, call, and just walk next door sometimes to share stories of what is going on. If you are a regular reader of my work you know how I feel about storytelling, and just how important it is to all of this working or not. Which is why I like to make sure that I showcase the storyelling of other evangelists who are working their magic, and spreading API knowledge within their domains.

I’m a big fan of what the GSA is up to with APIs across the federal government, and specifically what my hero Gray Brooks does to support API efforts acorss multiple federal agencies. He does a lot of legwork, but one thing that has stood out for me is his work to establish an API community of practice, and share relevant API stories on the US Government APIs Google Group. To help highlight what he is up to, and hep amplify the knowledge he puts out there, I wanted to share his latest post from the Google Group in it’s entirety because it is, well, beautiful.

			<p>I’m kicking off a micro-procurement project with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) this week. I’m going to to be conducting one of my API low hanging fruit campaigns for them, where I help them identify the best possible data sets available across their public websites for turning into APIs. The project is one of many small projects the federal agency is putting out there to begin working on their agency wide API platform they are calling Lighthouse. Laying the groundwork for better serving veterans through a robust stack of microservices that each do one thing really well, but can be used in concert to deliver the applications the agency needs to meet their mission. While not specifically a project to develop a microservice. The landscape analysis project is an API focused research project, that is testing a new procurement model called microprocurement. At my government consulting agency partnership Skylight Digital, my partner in crime Chris Cairns has been pushing for a shift in how government tackles technology projects, pushing them to do in smaller chunks that essentially can be put on the credit card in less than 10K increments. So far we’ve been doing consulting, research, and training related projects like how to create a bug bounty program, and internal evangelism strategies. Now we are kicking our campaign into high gear and pushing more agencies to think about microprocurement for microservices–the VA was the first agency to buy into this new way of thinking about how government IT gets delivered. I am working with all of my partners to help me craft potential services that would fit into the definition of a microprocurement project. I’ve been working to educate people about the process so that more API experts are on hand to respond when agencies publish microprocurement RFPs on Github like the VA did, but I also want to make sure and have a suite of microprocurement packages that federal agencies can choose from...[<a href="/2018/05/29/a-microprocurement-package-for-api-monitoring-and-testing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I was on a call for a federal government API platform project with my partner in crime Chris Cairns (@cscairns) of Skylight.Digital. We were back channeling in our Slack channel during the call, when he said, “I always imagine you participating in these things, finding topics you haven’t covered or emphasized from a certain angle, and then writing a blog post in real time.” He was right, I had taken notes on a couple of new angles regarding the testing, monitoring, and understanding performance of APIs involved with federal government projects. The single conference call resulted in about seven potential stories in my notebook. I’m guessing that only four of them will actually end up being published. However, the conversation does a good job at highlighting my style for generating stories on the blog, which is something that allows me to publish 3-5 posts a day–keeping things as active as I possibly can, generating traffic, and bringing attention to my work. If you’ve ever worked closely with me, you know that I can turn anything into a story, even a story like this, about how I create stories. ;-) Think of API Evangelist as my public workbench where I work through the projects I’m tackling each day. It is how I make sense of my research, the projects I am working on, and the conversations I am having. All of which generates SEO exhaust, which brings more attention to my work, extends its reach, and ultimately brings in more work. It is a cycle that helps me work through my ideas in a way that forces me to make them more coherent (hopefully) along the way, while also making them immediately available to my partners, customers, and readers. Chris has been pushing this concept forward and advocating that we be public with as many of the Skylight.Digital responses and proposals as we possibly can, which resulted in me publishing both of our responses to the...[<a href="/2018/05/16/every-moment-is-potentially-an-api-story/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I have been intrigued by the people who reached out after I published a story about my partner program. One of the companies that reached out was the API integration agency Bridge Software, who reflects the next generation of software development groups who are emerging to focus exclusively on API integration. I’ve had several calls with the Bridge Software team this week, discussing the possible ways in which we can work together. I’m regularly in need of software development resources that I can refer projects to, and I’m also interested in hearing more interesting stories about how businesses are integrating with APIs. Of course, Bridge Software is looking for more customers, which is something I can definitely help with. So we started brainstorming more about how they can regularly feed me stories that I can develop into posts for API Evangelist, and I can help send new business their way. One of the most valuable resources I possess as the API Evangelist, is access to real world stories from the trenches of API providers and integrators. These sources of stories have been the bread and butter for API Evangelist for eight years. I have depended on the stories that businesses share with me to generate the 3,276 posts I have published on the blog since 2010. So I am stoked to have a new source of fresh stories, from a team who is neck deep in API integrations each day, and will be actively gathering stories from their regular developer team meetings. I’m looking forward to working with the Bridge Software team, and getting new stories from the API integration trenches. I’m also looking forward to assisting them with finding new customers, and helping them with deliver on their API integration needs. If you are looking for help with API integrations, Bridge Software has a pretty sophisticated approach to delivering integrations that has test driven development at its core.

			<p><em>15 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been on five separate government reflated projects lately where finding modular OpenAPI-driven open source tooling has been a top priority. All of these projects are microservice-focused and OpenAPI-driven, and are investing significant amounts of time looking open source tools that will help with design governance, monitoring, testing, and security, and interact with the Jenkins pipeline. Helping government agencies find success as their API journey picks up speed, and the number of APIs grows exponentially. Selling to the federal government can be a long journey in itself. They can’t always use the SaaS solutions many of us fire up to get the job done in our startup or enterprise lives. Increasingly government agencies are depending on open source solutions to help them move projects forward. Every agency I’m working with is using OpenAPI (Swagger) to drive their API lifecycle. While not all have gone design (define) first, they are using them as the contract for mocking, documentation, testing, monitoring, and security. The teams I’m working with are investing a lot of energy looking for, vetting, and testing out different open source modules on Github–with varying degrees of success. Ideally, there was an OpenAPI-driven marketplace, or federated set of marketplaces like OpenAPI.Tools. I’ve had one for a while, but haven’t kept up to date–I will invest some time / resources into it soon. My definition of an OpenAPI tool marketplace would be that it is OpenAPI-driven, and open source. I’m fine with there being other marketplaces of OpenAPI-driven services, but I want a way to get at just the actively maintained open source tools. When it comes to serving government this is an important, and meaningful distinction. I’d also like to encourage many of the project owners to ensure there is CI/CD integration, as well as make sure their projects are actively supported, and they are willing to entertain commercial implementations.

			<p><em>15 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) has an open call for help to test the new FedBizOpps API. Setting a pretty compelling precedent for releasing APIs in the federal government, slowly bringing federal agencies out of their shell, and moving the API conversation forward in government. Hopefully it will be something that other federal agencies, and other levels of government will consider as they move forward on their API journeys. It is good to see federal agencies reaching out to ask for help in making sure APIs are well designed, deliver value, and operate as expected. In my experience, most government agencies are gun-shy when it comes to seeking outside help, and accepting criticism when it comes to their work. The GSA is definitely the most progressive on this front, but they are leading by example, showing other agencies what is possible, and something that hopefully will spread. Something I am always keen to support with my storytelling here on API Evangelist. One thing I’d caution federal agencies on when seeking outside feedback in this area, is to be mindful of fatigue in the private sector when it comes to working for free. API providers have been encouraging developers to document, test, develop code libraries, and other essential aspects of operating APIs for years now, and many developers are growing weary of this exploitation by companies who can afford to pay, but choose not to. While it is good that government is getting on the API bandwagon here, but be aware that you are about 5+ years behind, and the tides are shifting. I’d recommend thinking about how micro-procurement models emerging at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and other agencies can be applied to testing, performance, security, and other needs agencies will have. Think about how you can create $500, $1,000, and other opportunities for professional testers to make money. Of course, you are going to have to establish a way of vetting developers, but...[<a href="/2018/05/15/general-services-administration-gsa-needs-help-testing-their-fedbizopps-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m working to define APIs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on several fronts right now. I’ve provided not just one, but two detailed reponses to their Lighthouse API platform RFIs. Additionally, I’m providing guidance to different teams who are working on a variety of projects occurring simultaneously to serve veterans who receive support from the agency. As I do this work, I am hyper aware of the privatization machinations of the current administration, and the potential for APIs to serve these desires. APIs aren’t good, bad, nor are they neutral. APIs reflect the desires of their owners, and the good or bad they can inflict is determined by their consumers. Because APIs are so abstract, and are often buried within web and mobile applications, it can be difficult to see what they are truly doing on a day to day basis. This is why we have API management solutions in place to help paint a picture of activity in real time, but as we’ve seen with the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica, it requires the API provider to be paying attention, and to possess incentives that ensure they will actually care about paying attention, and responding to negative events. By re-defining existing VA internal systems as APIs, we are opening up the possibility that digital resources can be extracted, and transferred externally. Of course, if these systems remain the sources of data, VA power and control can be retained, but it also opens up the possibilities for power to eventually be transferred externally–reversing the polarities of government power and putting it into private hands. Depending on your politics, this could be good, or it could be bad. Personally, I’m a fan of a balance being struck, allowing government to do what it does best, and allowing private, commercial entities to help fuel and participate in what is happening–both with proper oversight. This reflects the potential benefits APIs can bring, but this good isn’t present...[<a href="/2018/05/15/cautiously-aware-of-how-apis-can-be-used-to-feed-government-privatization/">Read More</a>]</p>

I’ve conducted seminars in the UK and France in April, and have more in Virginia, Massachusetts, and California in May. I’ve been working with a variety of companies, institutions, and government agencies to plan even more internal seminars, which is something that is proving to be challenging for some groups who are just getting started on their API journey. While groups are keen on me coming visit to share my API knowledge, some of them are having trouble getting me through legal, get me into their payment systems, and making everyone’s schedules work. Some of them don’t have a problem figuring it out, while others are facing significant amounts of bureaucracy and friction due to the size, complexity, and legacy of their organizations. To help simplify the process for organizations to participate in my seminars I am going to begin planning a rolling schedule of seminars beginning in New York City. Every two weeks, on Tuesday and Wednesday I’ll be planning to do a 2-day API lifecycle seminars in NYC. I’m going to be focusing on delivering 12 stops along the API lifecycle, targeting my readers and customers who have already embarked on their API journey: Day One: Definition - The basics of OpenAPI, Postman, and using Github to manage API definitions. Design - Entry level API design, including touching on API governance and guidance. Deployment - Looking at the big world of how APIs can deployed on-premise, and the clouds. Virtualization - Understanding mocking, and API, as well as data virtualization. Authentication - Thinking about the common patterns of authentication for API consumption.

			<p><em>14 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been evaluating microservices at scale, using their OpenAPI definitions to provide API design guidance to each team using Github. I just finished a round of work where I took 20 microservices, and evaluated each OpenAPI definition individually, and made design suggestions via an updated OpenAPI definition that I submitted as a Github issue. I was going to submit as a pull request, but I really want the API design guidance to be a suggestions, as well as a learning experience, so I didn’t want them to feel like they had to merge all my suggestions. After going through all 20 OpenAPI definitions, I took all of them and dumped them into a single local repository where I was running Jekyll via localhost. Then using Liquid I created a handful of web pages for looking at the APIs across all microservices in a single page–publishing two separate reports: API Paths - An alphabetical list of the APIs for all 20 services, listing the paths, verbs, parameters, and headers in a single bulleted list for evaluation. API Schema - An alphabetical list of the APIs for all 20 services, listing the schema definitions, properties, descriptions, and types in a single bulleted list for evaluation. While each service lives in its own Github repository, and operates independently of each other, I wanted to see them all together, to be able to evaluate their purpose and design patterns from the 100K level. I wanted to see if there was any redundancy in purpose, and if any services overlapped in functionality, as well as trying to see the potential when all API resources were laid out on a single page. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees when working with microservices, and publishing everything as a single document helps flatten things out, and is the equivalent of climbing to the top of the local mountain to get a better view of things.

I also support the virtualization of schema and data used across API operations, like I am doing at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), with synthetic healthcare data. I’m very interested in anything that moves forward the API virtualization conversation, so I found the live sporting API simulations over at SportRadar very interesting. SportRadar’s “live simulations give you the opportunity to test your code against a simulation of live data before the preseason starts or any time! Our simulation system replays select completed games allowing you to view our API feeds as if they were happening live.” Here are the details of their NFL Official API simulations that run every day: 11:00 am - Data is reset for the day’s simulations. 1:00 pm - PST week 1 games will run – Oakland at Houston, Detroit at Seattle, Miami at Pittsburgh, and New York at Green Bay 2:00 pm – PST week 2 games will run - Seattle at Atlanta, Houston at New England, Green Bay at Dallas, and Pittsburgh at Kansas City 3:00 pm – PST week 3 games will run – Green Bay at Atlanta and Pittsburgh at New England 4:00 pm – PST week 4 games will run – New England vs Atlanta Providing a pretty compelling evolution in the concept API virtualization when it comes to event data, or data that will happen on a schedule. I wanted to write up this story to make sure I bookmarked this as part of my API virtualization research. If I don’t write about it, it doesn’t happen.

			<p>I’ve written about how the startup community has driven the value exchange that occurs at the API management layer down a two lane road with API monetizatin and plans. To generate the value that investors have been looking for, we have ended up with a free, pro, enterprise approach to measuring value exchanged with API integration, when in reality there is so much more going on here. Something that really becomes evident when you begin evaluating the API conversations going on across government at all levels. In conversation after conversation I have with government API folk I hear that they don’t need API management reporting, analysis, and billing features. There is a perception that government isn’t selling access to APIs, so API management measurement isn’t really needed. Missing out on a huge opportunity to be measuring, analyzing, and reporting upon API usage, and requiring a huge amount of re-education on my part to help API providers within government to understand how they need to be measuring value exchange at the API management level. Honestly, I’d love to see government agencies actually invoicing API consumers at all levels for their usage. Even if the invoices aren’t in dollars. Measuring API usage, reporting, quantifying, and sending an invoice for usage each month would help bring awareness to how government digital resources are being put to use (or not). If all data, content, and algorithms in use across federal, state, and municipal government were available via APIs, then measured, rate limited, and reported upon across all internal, partner, and public consumers–the awareness around the value of government digital assets would increase significantly. I’m not saying we should charge for all access to government data. I’m saying we should be measuring and reporting upon all access to government data. The APIs, and a modern API management layer is how you do this. We have the ability to measure the value exchanged and generated around government digital resources, and we...[<a href="/2018/05/14/measuring-value-exchange-around-government-data-using-api-management/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I checked out the Github repositories for twenty microservices of one of my clients recently, looking understand what is being accomplished across all these services as they work independently to accomplish a single collective objective. I’m being contracted with to help come in blindly and provide feedback on the design of the APIs being exposed across services, and help provide guidance on their API lifecycle, as well as eventually API governance when things have matured to that level. Right now we are addressing pretty fundamental definition and design issues, but eventually we’ll hopefully graduate to the next level. A complete and up to date README for each microservice is essential to understanding what is going on with a service, and a robust OpenAPI definition is critical to breaking down the details of what each API delivers. When you aren’t part of each service’s development team it can be difficult to understand what each service does, but with an up to date README and OpenAPI, you can get up to speed pretty quickly. If an service is well documented via its README, and the API is well designed, and the surface area is reflected in it’s OpenAPI, you can go from not knowing what a service does to, understanding its value within hopefully minutes, not hours. When each service possesses an OpenAPI it becomes possible to evaluate what they deliver at scale. You can take all APIs, their paths, headers, parameters, and schema and out them in different ways so that you can begin to paint a picture of what they deliver in aggregate. Bringing all the disparate services back together to perform together in a sort of monolith concert, while still acknowledging they all do their own thing independently. Allowing us to look at how many different service can be used in concert to deliver a single application, or potentially a variety of application instances.

			<p><em>10 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>The topic of API discovery has been picking up momentum in 2018. It is something I’ve worked on for years, but with the number of microservices emerging out there, it is something I’m seeing become a concern amongst providers. It is also something I’m seeing more potential vendor chatter, looking to provide more services and tooling to help alleviate API discovery pain. Even with all this movement, there is still a lot of education and discussion to occur on the subject to help bring people up to speed on what is API discovery. The most common view of what is API discovery, is when you need to find an API for developing an application. You have a need for a resource in your application, and you need to look across your internal and partner resources to find what you are looking for. Beyond that, you will need to search for publicly available API resources, using Google, Github, ProgrammableWeb, and other common ways to find popular APIs. This is definitely the most prominent perspective when it comes to API discovery, but it isn’t the only dimension of this problem. There are several dimensions to this stop along the API lifecycle, that I’d like to flesh out further, so that I can better articulate across conversations I am having. Another area that gets lumped in with API discovery is the concept of service discovery, or how your APIs will find their backend services that they use to make the magic happen. Service discovery focuses on the initial discovery, connectivity, routing, and circuit breaker patterns involved with making sure an API is able to communicate with any service it depends on. With the growth of microservices there are a number of solutions like Consul that have emerged, and cloud providers like AWS are evolving their own service discovery mechanisms. Providing one dimension to the API discovery conversation, but different from, and often confused with front-end API discovery and...[<a href="/2018/05/10/api-discovery-is-for-internal-or-external-services/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>The more I study where the API management, gateway, and proxy layer is headed, the less I’m seeing a front-end or a backend, I’m seeing just a node. A node that can connect to existing databases, or what is traditionally considered a backend system, but also can just as easily proxy and be a gateway to any existing API. A lot has been talked about when it comes to API gateways deploying APIs from an existing database. There has also been considerable discussion around proxying existing internal APIs or web services, so that we can deploy newer APIs. However, I don’t think there has been near as much discussion around proxying other 3rd party public APIs–which flips the backend and frontend discuss on its head for me. After profiling the connector and plugin marketplaces for a handful of the leading API management providers I am seeing a number of API deployment opportunities for Twilio, Twitter, SendGrid, etc. Allowing API providers to publish API facades for commonly used public APIs, and obfuscate away the 3rd party provider, and make the API your own. Allowing providers to build a stack of APIs from existing backend systems, private APIs and services, as well as 3rd party public APIs. Shifting gateways and proxies from being API deployment and management gatekeepers for backend systems, to being nodes of connectivity for any system, service, and API that you can get your hand on. Changing how we think about designing, deploying, and managing APIs at scale. I feel like this conversation is why API deployment is such a hard thing to discuss. It can mean so many different things, and be accomplished in so many ways. It can be driven by a databases, or strictly using code, or be just taking an existing API and turning it into something new. I don’t think it is something that is well understood amongst developer circles, let alone in the business world.

			<p>I was in a conference session about an API design tool today, and someone asked if you could get at the OpenAPI definition behind the solution. They said yes, but quickly also said that the definition is boring and that you don’t want to be in there, you want to be in the interface. I get that service providers want you to focus on their interface, but we shouldn’t be burying, or abstracting away the API contract for APIs, we should always be educating people about it, an bringing it front and center in any service, tooling, or conversation. Technology folks burying or devaluing the OpenAPI definition with business users is common, but I also see technology folks doing it to each other. Reducing OpenAPI to be just another machine readable artifact alongside other components of delivering API infrastructure today. I think this begins with people not understanding what OpenAPI is, but I think it is sustained by people’s view of what is technological magic and should remain in the hands of the wizards, and what should be accessible to a wider audience. If you limit who has access and knowledge, you can usually maintain a higher level of control, so they use your interface in the case of a vendor, or they come to you develop and build an API in the case of a developer. There is nothing in a YAML OpenAPI definition that business users won’t be able to understand. OpenAPIs aren’t anymore boring than a Word document or Spreadsheet. If you are a stakeholder in the service, you should be able to read, understand, and engage with the OpenAPI contract. If we teach people to be afraid of the OpenAPI definitions we are repeating the past, and maintaining the canyon that can exist between business and IT/Developer groups. If you are in the business of burying the OpenAPI definition, I’m guessing you don’t understand the portable API lifecycle potential of this...[<a href="/2018/05/08/making-the-openapi-contract-friendlier-for-developers-and-business/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve had a few API groups contact me lately regarding the challenges they are facing when it comes to supporting organizational, or industry-wide API definitions and schema. They were eager to support common definitions and schema that have been standardized, but were getting frustrated by not being able to do everything they wanted, and having to live within the constraints introduced by the standardized definitions. Which is something that doesn’t get much discussion by those of use who are advocating for standardization of APIs and schema. Web APIs Come With Their Own Constraints We all want more developers to use our APIs. However, with more usage, comes more responsibility. Also, to get more usage our APIs need to speak to a wider audience, something that common API definitions and schema will help with. This is why web APIs are working, because they speak to a wider audience, however with this architectural decision we are making some tradeoffs, and accepting some constraints in how we do our APIs. This is why REST is just one tool in our toolbox, so we can use the right tool, establish the right set of constraints, to allow our APIs to be successful. The wider our API toolbox, the wider the number options we will have available when it comes to how we design our APIs, and what schema we can employ Allowing For Content Negotiation By Consumers One way I’ve encouraged folks to help alleviate some of the pain around the adoption of common API definitions and schema is to provide content negotiation to consumers, allowing them to obtain the response they are looking for. If people want the standardized approaches they can choose those, and if they want something more precise, or custom they can choose that. This also allows API providers to work around the API standards that have become bottlenecks, while still supporting them where they matter.

			<p><em>08 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m always fascinated by the API design debate, and how many entrenched positions there are when it comes to the right way of doing it. Personally, I don’t see any right way of doing it, I just see many different ways to put the responsibility on the provider or the consumer shoulders, or sharing the load between them. I spend a lot of time profiling APIs, crafting OpenAPI definitions that try to capture 100% of the surface area of an API. Something that is pretty difficult to do when you aren’t the provider, and you are just working from existing static documentation. It is just hard to find every parameter and potential value, exhaustively detailing what is possible when you use an API. When designing APIs I tend to lean towards exposing the surface area of an API in the path. This is my personal preference for when I’m using an API, but I also do this to try and make APIs more accessible to non-developers. However, I regularly get folks who freak out at how many API paths I have, preferring to have the complexity at the parameter level. This conversation continues with the GraphQL and other query language folks who prefer to craft more complex queries that can be passed in the body, to define exactly what is desired. I do not feel there is a right way of doing this, but it does reflect what I said early about balancing the load between provider and consumer. The burden for defining and designing the surface area of an API resides in the providers court–only the provider truly knows the entire surface area. Then I’d add that when you offload the responsibility to the consumer using GraphQL, you are limiting who will be able to craft a query, putting API access beyond the reach of business users, and many developers. I feel that exposing the surface area of an API in the URL makes...[<a href="/2018/05/08/api-design-either-the-provider-does-the-work-or-the-consumer-will-have-to/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’m turning different APIs into topical streams using Streamdata.io. I have been profiling hundreds of different APIs as part of my work to build out the Streamdata.io API Gallery, and as I’m creating OpenAPI definitions for each API, I’m realizing the potential for event and topical driven streams across many existing web APIs. One thing I am doing after profiling each API is that I benchmark them to see how often the data changes, applying what we are calling StreamRank to each API path. Then I try to make sure all the parameters, and even enum values for each parameter are represented for each API definition, helping me see the ENTIRE surface area of an API. Which is something that really illuminates the possibilities surrounding each API. After profiling the Stack Exchange Questions API, I began to see how much functionality and data is buried within a single API endpoint, and was something I wanted to expose and make much easier to access. Taking a single OpenAPI definition for the Stack Exchange Questions API: Then exploding it into 25 separate tech topic streaming APIs. Taking the top 25 enum value for the tags parameter for the Stack Overflow site, and exploding into 25 separate streaming API resources. To do this, I’m taking each OpenAPI definition, and generating an AsyncAPI definition to represent each possible stream: I’m not 100% sure I’m properly generating the AsyncAPI currently, as I’m still learning about how to use the topics and streams collections properly. However, the OpenAPI definition above is meant to represent the web API resource, and the AsyncAPI definition is meant to represent the streaming edition of the same resource. Something that can be replicated for any tag, or any site that is available via the Stack Exchange API.

			<p><em>07 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>One of the arguments I hear for why API providers should be employing GraphQL is that they should just get out of developers way, and let them build their own queries so that they can just get exactly the data that they want. As an application developer we know what we want from your API, do not have us make many different calls, to multiple endpoints–just give us one API and let us ask for exactly what we need. It is an eloquent, logical argument when you operate and live within a “known bubble”, and you know exactly what you want. Now, ask yourself, will every API consumer know what they want? Maybe in some scenarios, every API consumer will know what they want, but in most situations, developers will not have a clue what they want, need, or what an API does. This is where the GraphQL as a replacement for REST argument begins breaking down. In a narrowly defined bubble, where every developers knows the schema, knows GraphQL, and knows they want–GraphQL can make a lot of sense. In the autodidact alpha developer startup world this argument makes a lot of sense, and gets a lot of traction. However, not everyone lives in this world, and in this real world, API design can become very important. Helping people understand what is possible, learn the schema behind an API, and become more familiar with an API, until they have a better understanding of what they might want. I’m not saying GraphQL doesn’t have a place when you have a significant portion of your audience knowing what they want, I’m just saying that you shouldn’t leave everyone else behind. To further turn this argument on its head, as a developer, if I know what I want, why make me build a query at all? Just give me a single URL with what I want!

			<p>I received an email from my CRON job API (EasyCRON) provider this morning about discontinuing the usage of social logins to their service with Gmail, Facebook, etc. Something that I think is a sign of things to come in response to the recent (and continued) bad behavior by many of the leading technology platforms. EasyCRON gave the following response for removing social logins from their service: In order to: 1) prevent any confusion that could be caused by using third party platform’s authentication API, 2) decouple from those data greedy platforms, 3) and keep our system simple, we decide to stop using third party platform’s authentication API on EasyCron. As much as I prefer one click login using my Github or Google (rarely use Facebook), I can’t argue with their logic. I’m a big fan of minimizing data sharing, surveillance, and of course keeping things simple. I wish we could trust tech companies to be good citizens with our data, but they seem to prefer repeatedly demonstrating they are more concerned with profits than they are about us. I’m still on board with using Github login for my infrastructure related services, but will definitely stop using Google, Twitter, Facebook, and any other purely advertising related service for authentication purposes. As much of a pain in the ass as it might be to create yet another login, it is more of a pain in the ass to be surveilled, and exploited on a daily basis by technology platforms. I wish people would have more respect, and be better behaved, but things are what they are, and we should respond accordingly. Thanks for fucking this one up for us all Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other platforms who just can’t see the big picture over their short term profit. I am going to stop advising API platforms utilize social logins as part of their API management and on-boarding process, due to it putting developers and consumers at risk...[<a href="/2018/05/07/doing-away-with-social-logins-due-to-a-lack-of-trust/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have been studying API management for eight years now. I’ve spent a lot of time understanding the approach of leading API providers, and the services and tools put out there by API service providers from 3Scale to Tyk, and how the cloud service providers like AWS are baking API management into their clouds. API management isn’t the most exciting aspect of doing APIs, but I feel it is one of the most important elements of doing APIs, delivering on the business and politics of doing APIs, which can often make or break a platform and the applications that depend on it. Employing a common API management solution, and having a solid plan in place, takes time and investment. To do it properly takes lots of regular refinement, investment, and work. It is something that will often seem unnecessary–having to review applications, get to know developers, and consider how they fit into the picture picture. Making it something that can easily be to pushed aside for other tasks on a regular basis–until it is too late. This is frequently the case when your API access isn’t properly aligned with your business model, and there are no direct financial strings attached attached to new API users, or a line distinguishing active from inactive users, let alone governing what they can do with data, content, and algorithms that are made accessible via APIs. The API management layer is where the disconnect between API providers and consumers occur. It is also where the connection, and meaningful engagement occurs when done right. In most cases API providers aren’t being malicious, they are just investing in the platform as their leadership has directed, and acting upon the stage their business model has set into motion. If your business model is advertising, then revenue is not directly connected to your API consumption, and you just turn on the API faucet to let in as many consumers as you can possibly attract....[<a href="/2018/05/07/api-management-in-realtime-instead-of-after-the-media-shitstorm/">Read More</a>]</p>

The VA doesn’t want it called it a sandbox, so they are calling it a lab, but the idea is to provide an environment where developers can work with APIs, see data just like they would in a live environment, but not actually have access to live patient data before they can prove their applications are reviewed and meet requirements. One of the projects being used to help deliver data within this environment is called Synthea. Providing the virtualized data will be made available through VA labs API–here is the description of what they do from their website: Synthea is an open-source, synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Our mission is to provide high-quality, synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions, enabling research with Health IT data that is otherwise legally or practically unavailable. Synthea data contains a complete medical history, including medications, allergies, medical encounters, and social determinants of health, providing data can be used without concern for legal or privacy restrictions by developers to support a variety of data standards, including HL7 FHIR, C-CDA and CSV. Perfect work loading up into sandbox and lab API environments, allowing to developers to safely play around with building healthcare applications, without actually touching production patient data. I’ve been looking for solutions like this for other industries. Synthea even has a patient data generator available on Github, which is something I’d love to see for every industry. Sandbox and labs environment should be default for any API, especially APIs operating within heavily regulated industries. I think Synthea provides a pretty compelling model for the...[<a href="/2018/05/01/synthetic-healthcare-records-for-your-api-using-synthea/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been reading about all the work Facebook and Twitter have been doing over the last couple of weeks to begin asserting more control over their API applications. I’m not talking about the deprecation of APIs, that is a separate post. I’m focusing on them reviewing applications that have access to their API, and shutting off access to the ones who are’t adding value to the platform and violating the terms of service. Doing the hard work to maintain a level of quality on the platform, which is something they should have been doing all along. I don’t want to diminish the importance of the work they are doing, but it really is something that should have been done along the way–not just when something goes wrong. This kind of behavior really sets the wrong tone across the API sector, and people tend to focus on the thing that went wrong, rather than the best practices of what you should be doing to maintain quality across API operations. Other API providers will hesitate launching public APIs because they’ll not want to experience the same repercussions as Facebook and Twitter have, completely overlooking the fact that you can have public APIs, and maintain control along the way. Setting the wrong precedent for API providers to emulate, and damaging the overall reputation of operating public APIs. Facebook and Twitter have both had the tools all along to police the applications using their APIs. The problem is the incentives to do so, and to prioritize these efforts isn’t there, due to an imbalance with their business model, and a lack of diversity in their leadership. When you have a bunch of white dudes with a libertarian ethos pushing a company towards profitability with a advertising driven business model, investing in quality control at the API management layer just isn’t a priority. You want as may applications, users, and activity as you possibly can, and when you don’t see...[<a href="/2018/04/30/facebook-and-twitter-only-now-beginning-to-police-their-api-applications/">Read More</a>]</p>

Here is a general outline of the elements that should be present in a README for each microservice, providing as much of an overview as possible for each service: Title - A concise title for the service that fits the pattern identified and in use across all services. Description - Less than 500 words that describe what a service delivers, providing an informative, descriptive, and comprehensive overview of the value a service brings to the table. Documentation - Links to any documentation for the service including any machine readable definitions like an OpenAPI definition or Postman Collection, as well as any human readable documentation generated from definitions, or hand crafted and published as part of the repository. Requirements - An outline of what other services, tooling, and libraries needed to make a service operate, providing a complete list of EVERYTHING required to work properly. Setup - A step by step outline from start to finish of what is needed to setup and operate a service, providing as much detail as you possibly for any new user to be able to get up and running with a service.

			<p>p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;When I talk to government agencies, non-profit organizations, or organizations doing internal APIs I regularly receive pushback about the information I share regarding API management, service composition, rate limiting, access tiers, and the other essential ingredients of the business of APIs. People tell me they aren’t selling access to their APIs, they don’t need to be measuring APIs like publicly available commercial APIs do. They don’t need a free, pro, and other tiers of access, and they won’t be invoicing their consumers like the majority of APIs I showcase from the API universe. This phenomenon is just one of the many negative side effects of venture capital, and Silicon Valley startups driving the conversation around APIs. Most people can’t even see the value exchange that potentially happens at the API management layer, and only see one way commercial revenue. When in reality API management is all about measuring and developing an awareness of the value exchanged around all of an organizations digital assets. With charging consumers for access just one the many ways in which value exchange can be measured, quantified, and reporting upon, by invoicing the consumer. There are so many other ways in which value can be exchanged, incentivized, measured, and reported upon, but many people have tuned into a single dominant narrative, and are completely unaware there is more than one way of doing things. Each API request can be recorded at the API management level. Whether it originated internally, from partners, or through public applications. Each resource path, HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), application and end-user token(s) can is recorded. The value generated by ANY API resource, and the exchange with consumers can be measured. Charging for GETs is such a narrow, and unimaginative view of what is possible. Just because many tech startups are interested in charging to GET data, and extracting value by encouraging unrestrained POST, PUT, PATCH, doesn’t mean this is how all API platforms should...[<a href="/2018/04/27/venture-capital-obfuscating-the-opportunities-for-value-exchange-at-the-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’m always amazed what large organizations can achieve. They definitely have more resources, more momentum, and do way more than any single individual can achieve. However, as an individual actor I’m always also amazed at how large organization culture seems to always work to defend itself from change, and actively work to grind down API efforts I’m involved in. Even before I walk in the front door there are processes in place that work to ensure any effective API strategy gets ground down so that it won’t be as effective. NDAs, intellectual property, background checks, schedules, logistics, leadership buy-in, physical security, legacy incidents, software, processes all seem to begin doing their work. Grinding down on anything new. I would ask folks to leave their baggage at home, but in most cases they aren’t even aware of the number, or the size of the suitcases they travel with. This is how things are done! This is the way things are! This is our standard way of operating! Even when we just want to have a conversation. Even when I’m just looking to share some knowledge with you and your team. I haven’t even begun talking about getting paid, I just want to share some wisdom with y’all, and help your team figure all of this out. The machine isn’t setup for this time of knowledge sharing. This is why API can be so hard to achieve for some. The machine is setup to extract, aggregate, store, and control value–not share it. So when the machine encounters another entity that just wants to share, no string attached, it just doesn’t want it was designed to do. Even though many have made the conscious effort to open up doors and invite people in to share knowledge, innovate, and explore, the vacuum already in place will often consume anyone involved, sucking the oxygen out of the room, and oxidizing anything new, pulling nutrients and value into the central system....[<a href="/2018/04/27/existing-processes-and-culture-grinding-down-new-api-efforts/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I haven’t published any stories this week on API Evangelist. I’ve been on the road in Lyon and Paris, France. Giving talks, and conducting workshops about my API lifecycle and governance work. Often times when I go on the road I try to pre-populate the blog with stories, but I’ve been so busy lately with travel and projects that I just didn’t have the time. Resulting in the blog not resembling its usual stream of API rants and stories. While this bothers me, I understand the balance between virtual API evangelism and the need to be present in-person from time to time. While I feel like I can reach more people virtually, I feel like at least 30% of the time I should be present in-person. It helps re-enforce what I know, and allows me to evolve my work, and learn knew things by exercising my API knowledge on the ground in the trenches within existing organizations, and at conferences, Meetups, and workshops. While exhausting, and often costly, in-person gatherings help build relationships, allowing me to establish deeper connections with people. Helping my work penetrate the thick bubbles that exist around us in our personal and professional lives. I’m always exhausted after traveling and shaking so many hands, but ultimately it is worth it if I do it in a thoughtful and logical way. In-person experiences are valuable, but I still feel that consistent, smart, and a syndicated virtual experience can reach more people, and make a more significant impact. It costs a lot less that traveling and attending conferences too. A robust presence isn’t easy to setup, and takes time to establish, but once in motion it can be the most effective way to build an audience. After eight years of doing API Evangelist, with some of it exclusively operating on the road, I can say that the sustained virtual presence will have the biggest impact, and provide a much more evergreen exposure that...[<a href="/2018/04/27/balancing-virtual-api-evangelism-with-inperson-api-evangelism/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m participating in a meeting today where one of the agenda items will be discussing the different ways in which the team can deal with increasingly large API responses. I don’t feel there is a perfect response to this question, and the answer should depend on a variety of considerations, but I wanted to think through some of the possibilities, and make sure the answers were on the tip of my tongue. It helps to exercise these things regularly in my storytelling so when I need to recall them, they are just beneath the surface, ready to bring forward. Reduce Size Pagination I’d say the most common approach to send over large amounts of data is to break things down into smaller chunks, based upon rows being sent over, and paginate the responses. Sending over a default amount (ie. 10,25,100), and require consumers either ask for larger amount, as well as request each additional page of results in a separate API request. Providing consumers with a running count of how many pages, what the current page is, and the ability to paginate forward and backward through the pages with each request. It is common to send pagination parameters through the query parameters, but some providers prefer handle it through headers (ie. Github). Organizing Using Hypermedia Another approach, which usually augments and extends pagination is using common hypermedia formats for messaging. To paginate results, many API providers use hypermedia media types as a message format, because the media types allow for easy linking to paginate results, as well as providing the relevant parameters in the body of the response. Additionally, hypermedia would further allow you to intelligently break down large responses into different collections, beyond just simple pagination. Then use the linking that is native to hypermedia to provide meaningful links with relations to the different collections of potential responses. Allowing API consumers to obtain all, or just the portions of information they are looking for....[<a href="/2018/04/20/delivering-large-api-responses-as-efficiently-as-possible/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I wrote about Werner Vogel of Amazon’s post considering the impact of cloud regions a couple weeks back. I feel that his post captured an aspect of doing business in the cloud that isn’t discussed enough, and one that will continue to drive not just the business of APIs, but also increasingly the politics of APIs. Amidst increasing digital nationalism, and growing regulation of not just the pipes, but also platforms, understanding where your APIs are operating, and what networks you are using will become very important to doing business at a global scale. It is an area I’m adding to my list of machine readable API definitions I’d like to add to the APIs.json stack. The goal with APIs.json is to provide a single index where we can link to all the essential building blocks of a APIs operations, with OpenAPI being the first URI, which provides a machine readable definition of the surface area of the APIs. Shortly after establishing the APIs.json specification, we also created API Commons, which is designed to be a machine readable specification for describing the licensing applied to an API, in response to the Oracle v Google API copyright case. Beyond that, there hasn’t been many other machine readable resources, beyond some existing API driven solutions used as part of API operations like Github and Twitter. There are other API definitions like Postman Collections and API Blueprint that I reference, but they are in the same silo as OpenAPI operates within. Most of the resources we link to are still human-centered URLs like documentation, pricing, terms of service, support, and other essential building blocks of API operations. However, the goal is to evolve as many of these as possible towards being more machine readable. I’d like to see pricing, terms of services, and aspects of support become machine readable, allowing them to become more automated and understood not just at discovery, but also at runtime.

			<p>Google has been really moving forward with their development, and storytelling around gRPC. Their high speed to approach to doing APIs that uses HTTP/2 as a transport, and protocol buffers (ProtoBuf) as its serialized message format. Even with all this motion forward they aren’t leaving everyone doing basic web APIs behind, and are actively supporting both approaches across all new Google APIs, as well as in their services and tooling for deploying APIs in the Google Cloud–supporting two-speed APIs side by side, across their platform. When you are using Google Cloud Endpoints to deploy and manage your APIs, you can choose to offer a more RESTful edition, as well as a more advanced gRPC edition. They’ve continued to support this approach across their service features, and tooling, by now also documenting your APIs. As part of their rollout of a supporting API portal and documentation for your Google Cloud Endpoints, you can automatically document both flavors of your APIs. Making a strong case for considering to offer both types of APIs, depending on the types of use cases you are looking to solve, and the types of developers you are catering to. In my experience, simpler web APIs are ideal for people just getting going on their API journey, and will accommodate the evolution of 60-75% of the API deployment needs out there. Where some organizations further along in their API journey, and those providing B2B solutions, will potentially need higher performance, higher volume, gRPC APIs. Making what Google is offering with their cloud API infrastructure a pretty compelling option for helping mature API providers shift gears, or even helping folks understand that they’ll be able to shift gears down the road. You get an API deployment and management solution that simultaneously supports both speeds, but also the other supporting features, services, and tooling like documentation delivers at both speeds.

			<p><em>18 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>APIs are hard to talk about across large groups of people, while ensuring everyone is on the page. APIs don’t have much a visual side to them, providing a tangible reference for everyone to use by default. This is where OpenAPI comes in, helping us “see” an API, and establish a human and machine readable document that we can produce, pass around, and use as a reference to what an API does. OpenAPI makes me feel like I have a handle on what an API does, in a way that can actually have a conversation around with other people–without it, things are much fuzzier. Many folks associate OpenAPI with documentation, code generation, or some other tooling or service that uses the specification–putting their emphasis on the tangible thing, over the definition. While working on projects, I spend a lot of time educating folks about what OpenAPI is, what it is not, and how it can facilitate communication across teams and API stakeholders. While this work can be time consuming, and a little frustrating sometimes, it is worth it. A little education, and OpenAPI adoption can go a long way to moving projects along, because (almost) everyone involved is able to be actively involved in moving API operations forward. Without OpenAPI it is hard to consistently design API paths, as well as articulate the headers, parameters, status codes, and responses being applied across many APIs, and teams. If I ask, “are we using the sort parameter across APIs?” If there is no OpenAPI, I can’t get an immediate or timely answer, it is something that might not be reliably answered. Making OpenAPI a pretty critical conversation and collaboration driver across the API projects I’m working on. I am not even getting to the part where we are deploying, managing, documenting, or testing APIs. I’m just talking about APIs in general, and making sure everyone involved in a meeting is on the same page when we are...[<a href="/2018/04/18/openapi-makes-me-feel-like-i-have-a-handle-on-what-an-api-does/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>It has been almost a year and half since I first wrote my post questioning that GraphQL folks didn’t want to do the hard work of API design, which I also clarified that I was keeping my mind open regarding the approach to delivering APIs. I’ve covered several GraphQL implementations since then, as well as my post on waiting the GraphQL assault out-to which I received a stupid amount of, “dude you just don’t get it!”, and “why you gotta be so mean?” responses. GraphQL Is A Tool In My Toolbox I’ll start with my official stance on GraphQL. It is a tool in my API toolbox. When evaluating projects, and making recommendations regarding what technology to use, it exists alongside REST, Hypermedia, gRPC, Server-Sent Events (SSE), Websockets, Kafka, and other tools. I’m actively discussing the options with my clients, helping them understand the pros and cons of each approach, and working to help them define their client use cases, and when it makes sense I’m recommending a query language layer like GraphQL. When there are a large number of data points, and a knowledgeable, known group of developers being targeted for building web, mobile, and other client applications, it can make sense. I’m finding GraphQL to be a great option to augment a full stack of web APIs, and in many cases a streaming API, and other event-driven architectural considerations. GraphQL Does Not Replace REST Despite what many of the pundits and startups would like to be able to convince everyone of, GraphQL will not replace REST. Sorry, it doesn’t reach as wide of an audience as REST does, and it still keeps APIs in the database, and data literate club. It does make some very complex things simpler, but it also makes some very simple things more complex. I’ve reviewed almost 5 brand new GraphQL APIs lately where the on-boarding time was in the 1-2 hour range, rather than minutes with many other...[<a href="/2018/04/16/my-graphql-thoughts-after-almost-two-years/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>My world runs on Gitub. 100% of my public website projects run on Github Pages, and about 75% of my public web applications run on Gitub Pages. The remaining 25% of it all is my API infrastructure. However, I’m increasingly pushing my data and content APIs to run entirely on Github with Github Pages as frontend, and the Github repo as the backend, with the Github API as the transport. I’d rather be serving up static JSON and YAML from repositories, and building JavaScript web applications that run using Jekyll, than dynamic server-side web applications. It is pretty straightforward to engineer HTML, CSS, and JavaScript applications that run entirely on Github Pages, and leverage JSON and YAML stored in the underlying Github repo as the database backend, using the Github API as the API backend. Your Github OAuth token becomes your API key, and Github organization and user structure becomes the authentication and access management layer. These apps can run publicly, and when someone wants to write, as well as read data to the application, they just need to authenticate using Github–if they have permission, then they get access, and can write JSON or YAML data to the underlying repo via the API. I’m a big fan of building portable micro applications using this approach. The only road block for me to make them easier to use by other users, is the ability to fork them into their own Github account with a single click. I have a Github OAuth token for any authenticated user, and with the right scopes I can easily fork a self-contained web application into their account or organization, giving them full control over their own version of the application. The problem is that each user has to enable Github Pages for the repository before they can view the application. It is a simple, but pretty significant hurdle for many users, and is something that prevents me from developing more applications...[<a href="/2018/04/16/if-github-pages-could-be-turned-on-by-default-i-could-provide-a-run-on-github-button/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>This is a story, in a series I’m doing as part of the version 3.0 release of the Stoplight.io platform. Stoplight.io is one the few API service providers I’m excited about what when it comes to what they are delivering in the API space, so I jumped at the opportunity to do some paid work for them. As I do, I’m working to make these stories about the solutions the provide, and refrain from focusing on just their product, hopefully maintaining my independent stance as the API Evangelist, and keeping some of the credibility I’ve established. One of the things I’m seeing emerge from the API providers who are further along in their API journey, is a more shared experience when it comes to not just the API design process, but in action throughout the API lifecycle. You can see this reality playing out with the API definitions, and the move from Swagger 2.0 to the OpenAPI 3.0, where there is a more modular approach to defining an API, encouraging reuse of common patterns across API paths within a single definition, as well as across many different API definitions. Expanding on how API definitions can move an API through the lifecycle, and beginning to apply that across projects and teams, and moving APIs through lifecycle much more quickly, and consistently. Emulating the Models We Know We hear a lot about healthy API design practices, following RESTful philosophies, and learning from the API design guides published by leading API providers. While all of these areas have a significant influence on what happens during the API design and development process, the most significant influence on what developers know, it is just what they are exposed to in their own experience. The models we are exposed to often become the models we employ, demonstrating the importance of adopting a shared experience when it comes to defining, designing, and putting common API models to work for us in our...[<a href="/2018/04/10/sharing-api-definition-patterns-across-teams-by-default/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>You’ve heard of OpenAPI, right? It is the API specification for defining the surface area of your web API, and the schema you employ–making your public API more discoverable, and consumable in a variety of tools services. OpenAPI is the API definition for documenting your API when you are just getting started with your platform, and you are looking to maximize the availability and access of your platform API(s). After you’ve acquired all the users, content, investment, and other value, ClosedAPI is the format you will want to switch to, abandoning OpenAPI, for something a little more discreet. Collect As Much Data As You Possibly Can Early on you wanted to be defining the schema for your platform using OpenAPI, and even offering up a GraphQL layer, allowing your data model to rapidly scale, adding as may data points as you possible can. You really want to just ingest any data you can get your hands on the browser, mobile phones, and any other devices you come into contact with. You can just dump it all into big data lake, and sort it out later. Adding to your platform schema when possible, and continuing to establish new data points that can be used in advertising and targeting of your platform users. Turn The Firehose On To Drive Activity Early on you wanted your APIs to be 100% open. You’ve provided a firehose to partners. You’ve made your garden hose free to EVERYONE. OpenAPI was all about providing scalable access to as many users as you can through streaming APIs, as well as lower volume transactional APIs you offer. Don’t rate limit too heavily. Just keep the APIs operating at full capacity, generating data and value for the platform. ClosedAPI is for defining your API as you begin to turn off this firehose, and begin restricting access to your garden hose APIs. You’ve built up the capacity of the platform, you really don’t need your digital...[<a href="/2018/04/09/the-closedapi-specification/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am hitting the road this week heading to London to speak at the API Conference. I will be giving a keynote on Thursday afternoon, and conducting an all day workshop on Friday. Both of my talks are a continuation of my API life cycle work, and pushing forward my use of a transit map to help me make sense of the API life cycle. My keynote will be covering the big picture of why I think the transit model works for making sense of complex infrastructure, and my workshop is going to get down in the weeds with it all. My keynote is titled, “Looking At The API Life Cycle Through The Lens Of A Municipal Transit System”, with the following abstract, “As we move beyond a world of using just a handful of internal and external APIs, to a reality where we operate thousands of microservices, and depend on hundreds of 3rd party APIs, modern API infrastructure begins to look as complex as a municipal transit system. Realizing that API operations is anything but a linear life cycle, let’s begin to consider that all APIs are in transit, evolving from design to deprecation, while still also existing to move our value bits and bytes from one place to another. I would like to share with you a look at how API operations can be mapped using an API Transit map, and explored, managed, and understood through the lens of a modern, Internet enabled “transit system”.” My workshop is titled, “Beyond The API Lifecycle And Beginning To Establish An API Transit System”, with the following abstract, “Come explore 100 stops along the modern API life cycle, from definition to deprecation.

			<p>I’ve been retooling the partner program for API Evangelist. There are many reasons for this, and you can read the full backstory I have written a narrative for these changes to the way in which I partner. I need to make a living, and my readers are expecting me to share relevant stories from across the sector on my blog. I’m also tired of meaningless partner arrangements that never go anywhere, and I’m looking to incentivize my partners to engage with me, and the API community in an impactful way. I’ve crafted a program that I think will do that. While there will still be four logo slots available for partnership, the rest of the references to API services providers and the solutions they provide will be driven by my partner program. If you want to be involved, you need to partner with me. All that takes is to email me that you want to be involved. It doesn’t cost you a dime, all you have to do is reach out, let me know you are interested, and be willing to play the part of an active API service provider. If you are making an impact on the API space, then you’ll enjoy the following exposure across my work: API Lifecycle - Your services and tooling will be listed as part of my API lifecycle research, and displayed on the home page of my website, and across my network of sites. Short Form Storytelling - Being referenced as part of my stories when I talk about the areas of the API sector in which your services and tooling provides solutions. Long Form Storytelling - Similar to short form, when i’m writing white papers, and guides, I will use your products and services as examples to highlight the solutions I’m talking about.

			<p><em>09 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I struggle with partner relationships. I’ve had a lot of partners operating API Evangelist over the years. Some good. Some not so good. And some amazing! You know who you are. It’s tough to fund what I do as the API Evangelist. It’s even harder to fund who I am as Kin Lane. I’ve revamped my approach to partnering several times now trying to find the right formula for me, my partners, and for my readers. As the partner requests pile up, and I fall short for some of my existing partners, while delivering as expected for others, it is time for me to take another crack at shaping my partner program. A Strong Streamdata.io Partnership Base A cornerstone of my new approach to partnering is based upon my relationship with Streamdata.io. They are my primary partner, and supporter of API Evangelist. They have not just helped provide me with the financial base I need to live and operate API Evangelist, they are investing in, and helping grow my existing API lifecycle and API Stack work. We are also working in concert to formalize my API lifecycle work into a growing consultancy, and pushing forward my API Stack research, syndicating it as the Streamdata.io API Gallery, and refining the my ranking system for both API providers, and API service providers. Without Streamdata.io this latest round of API Evangelist wouldn’t be happening. Difficulties With The Current Mode Of Partnering One of the biggest challenges I have right now with partnering is that my partners want me to produce content about them. Writing stories for pay just isn’t a good idea for their brand, or for mine. I know it is what people want, but it just doesn’t work. The other challenge I have is people tend to want predictable stories on a schedule. I know it seems like I’m a regular machine, churning out content, but honestly when it flows, it all works.

Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket have taken up a central role in the delivery of the valuable API resources we are using across our web, mobile, and device-based applications. These platforms have become integral parts of our development, and software build processes, with Github being the most prominent player when it comes to defining how we deliver not just applications, but increasingly API-driven applications on the web, our mobile phones, and common Internet connected objects becoming more ubiquitous across our physical worlds. A Lifecycle Directory Of Groups and Users These social coding platforms come with the ability to manage different groups, projects, as well as the users involved with moving project forward. While version control isn’t new, Github is credited with making this aspect of managing code a very social endeavor which can be done publicly, or privately within select groups. Providing a rich environment for defining who is involved with each microservice that is being moved along the API lifecycle, allowing teams to leverage the existing organization and user structure provided by these platforms as part of their API lifecycle organizational structure.

			<p>I’m always looking out for examples of API providers who have invested energy into formalizing process around the business and politics of API operations. I’m hoping to aggregate a variety of approaches that I can aggregate into a single blueprint that I can use in my API storytelling and consulting. The more I can help API providers standardize what they do, the better off the API sector will be, so I’m always investing in the work that API providers should be doing, but doesn’t always get prioritized. The other day while profiling the way that Nest uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream activity via thermostats, cameras, and the other devices they provide, and I stumbled across their branding policies. It provides a pretty nice set of guidance for Nest developers in respect to the platform’s brand, and something you don’t see with many other API providers. I always say that branding is the biggest concern for new API providers, but also the one that is almost never addressed by API providers who are in operation–which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. If I had a major corporate brand, I’d work to protect it, and help developers understand what is important.

			<p><em>05 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been telling stories about what the Stoplight.io team has been building for a couple of years now. They are one of the few API service provider startups left that are doing things that interest me, and really delivering value to their API consumers. In the last couple of years, as things have consolidated, and funding cycles have shifted, there just hasn’t been the same amount of investment in interesting API solutions. So when Stoplight.io approached me to do some storytelling around their version 3.0 release, I was all in. Not just because I’m getting paid, but because they are doing interesting things, that I feel are worth talking about. I’ve always categorized Stoplight.io as an API design solution, but as they’ve iterated upon the last couple of versions, I feel they’ve managed to find their footing, and are maturing to become one of the few truly API lifecycle solutions available out there. They don’t serve every stop along the API lifecycle, but they do focus on a handful of the most valuable stops, and most importantly, they have adopted OpenAPI as the core of what they do, allowing API providers to put Stoplight.io to work for them, as well as any other solutions that support OpenAPI at the core. As far as the stops along the API lifecycle that they service, here is how I break them down: Definitions - An OpenAPI driven way of delivering APIs, that goes beyond just a single definition, and allows you to manage your API definitions at scale, across many teams, and services. Design - One of the most advanced API design GUI solutions out there, helping you craft and evolve your APIs using the GUI, or working directly with the raw JSON or YAML. Virtualization - Enabling the mocking and virtualization of your APIs, allowing you to share, consume, and iterate on your interfaces long before you have deliver more costly code.

			<p><em>03 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve talked about how generating an OpenAPI (fka Swagger) definition from code is still the dominate way that microservice owners are producing this artifact. This is a by-product of developers seeing it as just another JSON artifact in the pipeline, and from it being primarily used to create API documentation, often times using Swagger UI–which is also why it is still called Swagger, and not OpenAPI. I’m continuing my campaign to help the projects I’m consulting on be more successful with their overall microservices strategy by helping them better understand how they can work in concert by focus in on OpenAPI, and realizing that it is the central contract for their service. Each Service Begins With An OpenAPI Contract There is no reason that microservices should start with writing code. It is expensive, rigid, and time consuming. The contract that a service provides to clients can be hammered out using OpenAPI, and made available to consumers as a machine readable artifact (JSON or YAML), as well as visualized using documentation like Swagger UI, Redocs, and other open source tooling. This means that teams need to put down their IDE’s, and begin either handwriting their OpenAPI definitions, or being using an open source editor like Swagger Editor, Apicurio, API GUI, or even within the Postman development environment. The entire surface area of a service can be defined using OpenAPI, and then provided using mocked version of the service, with documentation for usage by UI and other application developers. All before code has to be written, making microservices development much more agile, flexible, iterative, and cost effective. Mocking Of Each Microservice To Hammer Out Contract Each OpenAPI can be used to generate a mock representation of the service using Postman, Stoplight.io, or other OpenAPI-driven mocking solution. There are a number of services, and tooling available that takes an OpenAPI, an generates a mock API, as well as the resulting data.

			<p>When you spend time looking at a lot of microservices, across many different organizations, you really begin to get a feel for the ones who have owners / stewards that are thinking about the bigger picture. When people are just focused on what the service does, and not actually how the service will be used, the Github repos tend to be cryptic, out of sync, and don’t really tell a story about what is happening. Github is often just seen as a vehicle for the code to participate in a pipeline, and not about speaking to the rest of the humans and systems involved in the overall microservices concert that is occurring. Github Is Your Showroom Each microservices is self-contained within a Github repository, making it the showcase for the service. Remember, the service isn’t just the code, and other artifacts buried away in the folders for nobody to understand, unless you understand how to operate the service or continuously deploy the code. It is a service. The service is part of a larger suite of services, and is meant to be understood and reusable by other human beings in the future, potentially long after you are gone, and aren’t present to give a 15 minute presentation in a meeting. Github is your asynchronous microservices showroom, where ANYONE should be able to land, and understand what is happening. README Is Your Menu The README is the centerpiece of your showroom. ANYONE should be able to land on the README for your service, and immediately get up to speed on what a service does, and where it is in its lifecycle. README should not be written for other developers, it should be written for other humans. It should have a title, and short, concise, plain language description of what a service does, as well as any other relevant details about what a service delivers.

			<p><em>02 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I just finished a narrative around my API Stack profiling, telling the entire story around the profiling of APIs for inclusion in the stack. To help encourage folks to get involved, I wanted to help distill down the process into a single checklist that could be implemented by anyone. The Github Base Everything begins as a Github repository, and it can existing in any user or organization. Once ready, I can fork and publish as part of the API stack, or sync with an existing repository project. Create Repo - Create a single repository with the name of the API provider in plain language. Create README - Add a README for the project, articulating who the target is and the author. OpenAPI Definition Profiling the API surface area using OpenAPI, providing a definition of the request and response structure for all APIs. Head over to their repository if you need to learn more about OpenAPI. Ideally, there is an existing OpenAPI you can start with, or other machine readable definition you can use as base–look around within their developer portal, because sometimes you can find an existing definition to start with. Next look on Github, as you never know where there might be something existing that will save you time an energy. However you approach, I’m looking for complete details on the following: info - Provide as much information about the API. host - Provide a host, or variables describing host. basePath - Document the basePath for the API. schemes - Provide any schemes that the API uses. produces - Document which media types the API uses. paths - Detail the paths including methods, parameters, enums, responses, and tags. definitions - Provide schema definitions used in all requests and responses. To help accomplish this, I often will scrape, and use any existing artifacts I can possible find. Then you just have to roll up your sleeves and begin copying and pasting from the existing API...[<a href="/2018/04/02/the-api-stack-profiling-checklist/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am escalating conversations I’m having with folks regarding how I profile and understand APIs as part of my API Stack work. It is something I’ve been evolving for 2-3 years, as I struggle with different ways to attack and provide solutions within the area of API discovery. I want to understand what APIs exist out there as part of my industry research, but along the way I want to also help others find the APIs they are looking for, while also helping API providers get their APIs found in the first place. All of this has lead me to establish a pretty robust process for profiling API providers, and document what they are doing. As I shift my API Stack work into 2nd gear, I need to further formalize this process, articulate to partners, and execute at scale. Here is my current snapshot of what is happening whenever I’m profiling an API and adding it to my API Stack organization, and hopefully moving it forward along this API discovery pipeline in a meaningful way. It is something I’m continuing to set into motion all by myself, but I am also looking to bring in other API service providers, API providers, and API consumers to help me realize this massive vision. Github as a Base Every new “entity” I am profiling starts with a Github repository and a README, within a single API Stack organization for providers. Right now this is all automated, as I’m transition to this way of doing things at scale. Once in motion, each provider I’m profiling will become pretty manual. What I consider an “entity” is fluid. Most smaller API providers have a single repository, while other larger ones are broken down by line of business, to help reduce API definitions and conversation around APIs down to the smallest possible unit we can. Every API service provider I’m profiling gets its own Github repository, subdomain, set of definitions, and conversation...[<a href="/2018/04/02/my-api-stack-profiling-process/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Apr 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m working on a healthcare related microservice project, and I’m looking for a way to help developers express their service dependencies within the OpenAPI or some other artifact. At this point I’m feeling like the OpenAPI is the place to articulate this, adding a vendor extension to the specification that can allow for the referencing of one or more other services any particular service is dependent on. Helping make service discovery more machine readable at discovery and runtime. To help not reinvent the wheel, I am looking at using the Schema.org Web API type including the extensions put forth by Mike Ralphson and team. I’d like the x-api-dependencies collection to adopt a standardized schema, that was flexible enough to reference different types of other services. I’d like to see the following elements be present for each dependency: versions (OPTIONAL array of thing -&gt; Property -&gt; softwareVersion). It is RECOMMENDED that APIs be versioned using [semver] entryPoints (OPTIONAL array of Thing -&gt; Intangible -&gt; EntryPoint) license (OPTIONAL, CreativeWork or URL) - the license for the design/signature of the API transport (enumerated Text: HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, MQTT, WS, WSS etc)&lt;/p&gt; apiProtocol (OPTIONAL, enumerated Text: SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, Hydra, JSON API, XML-RPC, JSON-RPC etc) webApiDefinitions (OPTIONAL array of EntryPoints) containing links to machine-readable API definitions webApiActions (OPTIONAL array of potential Actions) Using the Schema.org Web type would allow for a pretty robust way to reference dependencies between services in a machine readable way, that can be indexed, and even visualized in services and tooling. When it comes to evolving and moving forward services, having dependency details baked in by default make a lot of sense, and ideally each dependency definition would have all the details of the dependency, as well as potential contact information, to make sure everyone is connected regarding the service road map. Anytime a service is being deprecated, versioned, or impacted in any way, we have all the dependencies needed to make an educated decision...[<a href="/2018/04/02/an-openapi-service-dependency-vendor-extension/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’m taking time to showcase any API I come across who have published their OpenAPI definitions to Github like New York Times, Box, Stripe, SendGrid, Nexmo, and others have. I’m also taking the time to publish stories showcasing any API provider who similarly publish Postman Collections as part of their API documentation. Next up on my list is the Triathlon API, who provides a pretty sophisticated API stack for managing triathlons around the world, complete with a list of Postman Collections for exploring and getting up and running with their API. Much like Okta, which I wrote about last week, the Triathlon API has broken their Postman Collections into individual service collections, and provides a nice list of them for easy access. Making it quick and easy to get up and running making calls to the API. Something that ALL API providers should be doing. Sorry, but Postman Collections should be a default part of your API documentation, just like OpenAPI definition should be as the driver of your interactive API docs, and the rest of your API lifecycle. Every provider should be maintaining their OpenAPI definitions, as well as Postman Collections on Github, and baking them into their API documentation. Your OpenAPI should be the central truth for your API operations, and then you can easily import it, and generate Postman Collections as you design, test, and evolve your API using the Postman development suite. I know there are many API providers who haven’t caught up to this approach to delivering API resources, but it is something they need to tune into, and make the necessary shift in how you are delivering your resources. In addition to regular stories like this on the blog, you will find me reaching out to individual API providers asking if they have an OpenAPI and / or Postman Collections. I’m personally invested in getting API providers to adopt their API definition formats.

			<p>I have been editing my OpenAPI definitions manually for some time now, as I just haven’t found a GUI editor that works well with my workflow. Swagger editor really isn’t a GUI solution, and while I enjoy services like Stoplight.io, APIMATIC, and others, I’m very picky about what I adopt within my world. One aspect of this is that I’ve been holding out for a solution that I can run 100% on Github using Github Pages. I’ve delusionally thought that someday I would craft a slick JavaScript solution that I could run using only Github Pages, but in reality I’ve never had the time to pull together. So, I just kept manually editing my OpenAPI definitions on the desktop using Atom, and publish to Github as I needed. Well, now I can stop being so dumb, because my friend Mike Ralphson (@permittedsoc) has created my new favorite OpenAPI GUI, that is OpenAPI 3.0 compliant by default. As Mike defines it, “OpenAPI-GUI is a GUI for creating and editing OpenAPI version 3.0.x JSON/YAML definitions. In its current form it is most useful as a tool for starting off and editing simple OpenAPI definitions. Imported OpenAPI 2.0 definitions are automatically converted to v3.0.” He provides a pretty simple way to get up and running with OpenAPI GUI because, “OpenAPI-GUI runs entirely client-side using a number of Javascript frameworks including Vue.JS, jQuery and Bulma for CSS. To get the app up and running just browse to the live version on GitHub pages, deploy a clone to GitHub pages, deploy to Heroku using the button below, or clone the repo and point a browser at index.html or host it yourself - couldn’t be simpler.” – “You only need to npm install the Node.js modules if you wish to use the openapi-gui embedded web server (i.e. not if you are running your own web-server), otherwise they are only there for PaaS deployments.” Portable, Forkable API Design GUI The forkability of...[<a href="/2018/03/30/the-openapi-3-0-gui/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>There is a lot of talk of an API design first way of doing things when it comes to delivering microservices. I’m seeing a lot of organizations make significant strides towards truly decoupling how they deliver the APIs they depend on, and continue to streamline their API lifecycle, as well as governance. However, if you are down in the weeds, doing this work at scale, you know how truly hard it is to actualy get everything working in concert across many different teams. While I feel like I have many of the answers, actually achieving this reality, and assembling the right tools and services for the job is much harder then it is in theory. There was a question posted on API Craft recently that I think gets at the challenges we all face: We plan to use Open API 3 specification for designing API’s that are required to build our enterprise web application. These API’s are being developed to integrate the backend with frontend. They are initially planned to be internal/private. To roll out an API First strategy across multiple teams (~ 30) in our organization we want to recommend and centrally deploy a standard set of tools that could be used by teams to design and document API’s. I am new to the swagger tool set. I understand that there is a swagger-editor tool that can help in API design while swagger-ui could help in API documentation. Trying them I realized a few problems 1. How would teams save their API’s centrally on a server? Swagger editor does not provide a way to centrally store them. 2. How can we get a directory look up that displays all the designed API’s? 3. How can we integrate the API design and API documentation tool? 4. How can the API specifications be linked with the implementation (java) to keep them up-to-date? 5. How do we show API dependencies when one api uses the other one?...[<a href="/2018/03/30/obtaining-a-scalable-api-definition-driven-api-design-workflow-on-github/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Werner Vogels shared a great story looking back at 10 years of compartmentalization at AWS, where he talks about the impact Amazon has made on the landscape by allowing for the deployment of resources into different cloud regions, zones, and jurisdictions. I agree with him regarding the significant impact this has had on how we deliver infrastructure, and honestly isn’t something that gets as much recognition and discussion as it should. I think this is partly due to the fact that many companies, organizations, institutions, and governments are still making their way to the cloud, and aren’t far enough in their journeys to be able to sufficiently take advantage of the different availability zones. In Werner’s piece he focuses on the availability, scalability, and redundancy benefits of operating in different zones. Which I think gets at the technical benefits of this benefit of operating infrastructure in the cloud, but there are also significant business, and even political considerations at play here. As the web matures, the business and political implications of being able to operate precisely within a specific region, zone, and jurisdiction is becoming increasingly important. Sure, you want your API infrastructure to be reliable, redundant, and failover when there has been an outage in a specific region, but increasingly clients are asking for APIs to be delivered close to where business occurs, and regulatory bodies are beginning to mandate that digital business gets done within specific borders as well. Regions have become a top level priority for Amazon, Azure, and Google. Clearly, they are also becoming a top level priority for their customers who operate within their clouds. It is one of those things I notice evolving across the technology landscape and have felt the need to pay attention to more as I see more activity and chatter. I’ve begun documenting which regions each of the cloud providers are operating in, and have been increasing the number of stories I’m writing about the...[<a href="/2018/03/29/the-impact-of-availability-zones-regions-and-api-deployment-around-the-globe/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I know many folks in the API sector don’t know about APIs.json, and if they do they often think it is yet another API definition format, competing wit OpenAPI, Postman Collections, and others. So, I want to take a moment to share the vision again, and maybe convert one or two more folks to the possibilities around having a machine readable format for the entire operations. This is where APIs.json elevates the conversation, is it isn’t just about defining an API, it is about defining API operations, looking to make things more discoverable, and executable by default. APIs.json is a JSON format, as the name implies, but admittedly a bad name, as I’ve already started created APIs.yaml editions, which defines the entire API operations, not just any single API. It starts with the basics of the API providers, with: name, description, image, tags, created, and modified. Then it has a collection for defining one or many actual APIs. Repeating the need for a name, description, image, and tags, but this time for each API–admittedly this might be redundant in many cases. Each API also has a humanURL and baseURL for each API, providing two key links that developers will need. After that, we start getting to the meat of APIs.json, with the properties collection. The properties collection is an array of URLs and types, which can point to many different building blocks of API operations. Common elements that should be present with every API provider like: Documentation - URL to the API documentation. Plans &amp; Pricing - Landing page for the API tiers. Terms of Service - Where do you find the legal department. Sign Up - How do you sign up for an API. These elements are often times meant for humans, but the goal of APIs.json is to also provide machine readable URLs of common building blocks, including: OpenAPI - Where do you find the OpenAPI definition?

			<p>I’ve pushed my Github driven, Jekyll fueled, application delivery process to a new levels the last couple of weeks. I’ve been investing more cycles into my API Stack work, as I build out an API Gallery for Streamdata.io. All of my work as the API Evangelist has long lived as independent Github repositories, with a JSON or YAML core that drives the static Jekyll UI for my websites, applications, and API developer portals. Designed to be independent, data and API driven micro-solutions to some related aspect of my API research. I’m just turning up the volume on what already exists. I’m taking this to the next level with my approach to API discovery. API Stack used to be a single Github repository with huge number of APIs.json and OpenAPI definitions, but after hitting the ceiling with the size of the repository, I’ve begun to shard projects by entity, topic, and collection. So far I have 285 entities, with 9850 API paths, spanning 397 topics. Each entity, and topic exists within its own Github repository, acting as an individual set of API definitions, including an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index. Allowing me to move forward each API definition for an entity independently, and begin aggregating APIs into interesting collections by topic, industry, or other relevant area. There is no backend database for these projects. Well, there is a central system I use to help me orchestrate things, but each project is standalone, with everything it needs stored in the Github repository. It is something that took some engineering, and time to setup and first, but now that it is setup, managing it is actually pretty easy. The approach has also allowing me to scale it without any additional performance issues. Each entity I add becomes its own repo, and unless I hit some magic number for the number of repositories I can have within an organization, I should be able to scale to several thousand...[<a href="/2018/03/28/data-driven-apps-at-scale-using-github-and-jekyll/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>It’s been a long, long road for Twitter when it comes to realizing the importance of having a plan when it comes to their API management strategy. Aside from monetizing the firehose through former parter, and now acquired solution Gnip, Twitter has never had any sort of plan when it came to providing access tiers for their API. I try to revisit the Twitter developer portal a couple times a year, but I’m going to have to increase the number of visits as there seems to be more rapid shifts towards getting control over their API management layer in recent months. The API plan matrix that has emerged as part of Twitter’s pricing page provides a view of the unfolding plan for the social media platform. The Twitter API plan doesn’t show the entire scope, as it doesn’t cover the streaming layer of the API, but it does provide an important first step towards bringing coherence to how developers can access the API, and pay for premium levels of access. This conversation isn’t just about Twitter making money or Twitter charging for access to our data, this is about Twitter taking control over who has access to our data, and the platform. It is up to Twitter whether or not they focus on revenue, or the needs of end-users, something that we will only realize as their API plan continues to unfold. This is the layer where Twitter will begin to reign in bots, and other malicious activity, but it is something that won’t be easy, and undoubtedly cause a lot of pain and frustration for developers, and end-users. It is something they should have done a long time ago, but as we are seeing play out with Facebook, to incentivize the growth their investors and shareholders desired, these platform needed to look the other way at the API management layer.

These API providers tend to have more experience and insight, and are often worth studying further, and learning from. I’ve bee getting a wealth of valuable information from the German fashion and technology company Zalando, who has shared some pretty valuable API first principles. In a nutshell Zalando’s API First principles focuses on two areas: define APIs outside the code first using a standard specification language get early review feedback from peers and client developers By defining APIs outside the code, Zalando wants to facilitate early review feedback and also a development discipline that focus service interface design on: profound understanding of the domain and required functionality generalized business entities / resources, i.e. avoidance of use case specific APIs clear separation of WHAT vs. HOW concerns, i.e. abstraction from implementation aspects — APIs should be stable even if we replace complete service implementation including its underlying technology stack Moreover, API definitions with standardized specification format also facilitate: single source of truth for the API specification; it is a crucial part of a contract between service provider and client users infrastructure tooling for API discovery, API GUIs, API documents, automated quality checks Their guidance continues by stating: An element of API rirst are also a review process to get early review feedback from peers and client developers. Peer review is important for us to get high quality APIs, to enable architectural and design alignment and to supported development of client applications decoupled from service provider engineering life cycle. It is important to learn, that API First is not in conflict with the agile development principles that we love. Service applications should evolve incrementally — and so its APIs.

I always enjoy what Matt has to say, and regularly encourage him writing on his blog, and keep publishing his extremely thoughtful newsletter. It is important for the API sector to have many thoughtful, intelligent voices breaking down what is going on. I recommend subscribing to REST API Notes if you haven’t, you won’t regret it. Anyways, Matt replied with the following about my Facebook response: Kin Lane did a fine job identifying the mechanisms most companies already have in place to mitigate the kind of bad behavior displayed by Cambridge Analytica. It is a good starting point. However, I do want to challenge one of his assertions. Kin implies that OAuth consent is a sufficient control for folks to manage their data. While better than nothing, I maintain that most consumers are incapable of making informed decisions. It’s not a question of their intelligence. It is a question of complexity and incentives for the business to be deliberately opaque. I agree. To quote my other friend Mehdi Medjaoui (@medjawii), “OAuth is flawed, but it is the best we have”. I would say that “consumers are incapable of making informed decisions”, because we’ve crafted the world this way, and our profit margins depend on customers not being able to make informed decisions. It is how markets work things out, and “smart” people get ahead, and all that bullshit. You see this same thing playing out at the terms of service level as well. As a consumer of online services, I am regularly incapable of being able to make informed decisions around how my data is being used, in exchange for using a free web application.

			<p><em>27 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>There are many actors who have benefitted from Facebook not properly management their API platform. Collecting so many data points, tracking so many users, and looking the other way as 3rd party developers put them to use in a variety of applications. Facebook did what is expected of them, and focused on generating advertising revenue from allowing their customers to target the many data points that are generated by the web and mobile applications developed on top of their platform. I hear a lot of complaining about this being just about democrats being upset that it was the republicans who were doing this, when in reality there are so many camps that are complicit in this game, if you are focusing in on any single camp you are probably looking to shift attention and blame from your own camp, in my opinion. I’m all for calling everyone out, even ourselves for being so fucking complicit in this game where we allow ourselves to be turned into a surveillance marketplace. Something that benefits the Mark Zuckerbergs, Cambridge Analyticas, and the surveillance capitalist platform, but also providing a pipeline to government, and law enforcement. If government is going to jump on the bandwagon calling for change at Facebook, they need to acknowledge that they’ve been benefitting from the data free for all that is the Facebook API. We’ve heard stories about 3rd party developers building applications for law enforcement to target Black Lives Matters, all the way up to Peter Thiel’s (a Facebook Investor) Palantir who actively works with NSA, and other law enforcement. If we are going to shine a light on what is happening on Facebook, let’s make it a spotlight and call out ALL of the actors who have been sucking user’s data out of the API, and better understand what they have been doing. I’m all for a complete audit of how the RNC, DNC, and EVERY other election, policing, and government entity...[<a href="/2018/03/27/government-has-benefitted-from-lack-of-oversight-at-the-social-api-management/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>When I started doing API Evangelist in 2010 I was still very, very, very naive about why people were doing APIs. While I do not always expect everyone doing APIs to be ethical and sensible with the reasons behind doing APIs, I have been regularly surprised at how many different views there are out there regarding why we should be doing APIs in the first place. The lesson for me is to never assume that someone is doing APIs for the same reasons I am doing APIs, because rarely that will ever be the case–hopefully minimizing the chances I’ll get continue to be surprised down the road. After watching Salesforce, then Amazon, Flickr, Twitter, Facebook, and Google Maps doing APIs, I saw the potential for APIs to open up access to resources like never before. I also saw the potential for not just opening up these new opportunities to developers, but OAuth was beginning to give end-users a voice in how their data and content could be put to use. I saw the opportunity for a new type of partnership between platforms, developers, and end-users emerging that could change how we do business online, how government works, and much, much more. Sadly my white male privilege, and powers of denial prevented me from seeing the many other ways in which APIs were being seen as an opportunity. I find that the reasons people publish regarding why they are doing APIs rarely size up with the real reasons why they are actually doing APIs. Sometimes you can read between the lines by evaluating their overall business model, or lack of one. Other times you can find some telling signs present in the design of their API, as the paths, parameters, and technical details tend to tell a more accidentally honest view of what is happening behind the curtain. However, when it comes to the theater of “open APIs”, everything quickly becomes a funhouse of mirrors when...[<a href="/2018/03/27/acknowledging-that-why-i-do-apis-is-very-different-than-why-others-are-doing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’m big on supporting API providers that publish their OpenAPI definitions to Github. It is important for the wider API community that ALL API definitions are machine readable, and available in a way that can be forked, and integrated into continuous integration pipelines. I’m not even talking about the benefits to the API providers when it comes to managing their own API lifecycle. I’m just focusing on the benefits to API consumers, and helping make on-boarding, integration, and keeping in sync with the road map as frictionless as possible. To help incentivize API providers doing this I’m committed to writing up stories for each API provider that publishes their OpenAPI, APIs.json, or Postman Collections to Github. Bonus points if you are doing it in an interesting way that further benefits your operations, as well as your community. Today’s API provider to showcase is the SMS, voice and phone verifications API provider Nexmo, who tweeted the Github repository at me, which contains their OpenAPI definition for their APIs. As they say, it is a work in progress, but it provides a damn good start for a machine readable definition for their API(s), and I mean c’mon, aren’t all of our APIs a working progress? Nexmo uses their API definition as “a single point of truth that can be used end-to-end can we used to:” Planning Shared during product discussions for planning API functionality Implementation Inform engineering during development Testing As the basis for testing or mocking API endpoints Documentation For producing thorough and interactive documentation Tooling To generate server stubs and client SDKs. Nexmo has adopted version 3.0 of the OpenAPI definition, which is forward leaning for the API provider. They also provide a list of resources, tooling, and their API definition available as Ruby packages for easier integration. Another thing they do that I think is interesting, is they list the owner, and contributors for each API definition they have published, or are working on....[<a href="/2018/03/26/nexmo-manages-their-openapi-3-0-definition-using-github/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>There is lots of talk this week about regulating Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica story broke. Individuals, businesses, lawmakers, and even Facebook are talking about how we begin to better regulate not just Facebook, but the entire data industry. From my perspective, as the API Evangelist, the mechanisms are already in place, they just aren’t being used to their fullest by providers, with no sufficient policy in place at the federal level to incentivize healthy behavior by API providers, data brokers, and 3rd party application developers. API Management Is Already In Place Modern API platforms, Facebook included, leverage what is called an API management layer, to help manage the applications being developed on their platforms. Every developer who wants to access platform APIs has to sign up, submit the name and details of their application(s), and then receive an API key which they have to include with each call they make to a platform’s API when requesting ANY data, content, or usage of an algorithm. This means that all the platforms should already be in tune with every application that is using their platform, unless they allow internal groups, and specific partners to bypass the API management layer. An Application Review Process Every application submitting for API keys has to go through some sort of review process. The bar for this review process might be as low as requiring you to have an email address, or as high as submitting drivers and business licenses, and verify how you are storing your data. Facebook has an application review process in place, and is something they are promising to tighten up a bit in response to Cambridge Analytica. How loose, or tight a platform is with their application review process is always in alignment with the platform’s business model, and how the value their user’s privacy and security.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>I have a lot of conversations with folks down in the trenches about API security, and what they are doing to be proactive when it comes to keeping their API infrastructure secure. The will and the desire amongst folks I talk to regarding API security is present. They want to do what it takes to truly understand what is needed to keep their APIs secure, but many have their hands tied because lack of resources to actually do what is needed. Every API team I know is short-handed, and doing the best they can with what they have available to them. A lack of investment in API security isn’t always intentional, it ends up just begin a reality of the priorities on the ground within the organizations they work in. While I’m sure leaders within these companies are concerned about breaches within their API infrastructure, the urgency to invest in this area isn’t always a priority. Despite an increase in high profile, often API-induced breaches, IT and API groups are still not given the amount of resources they need to do something about potential security incidents. Other than the stress and bad press of a breach, there really are no consequences in the United States. We have seen this play out over and over, and when high profile breaches like Equifax go unpunished, other corporate leaders fully understand that there will no consequences, so why invest in preventative measures–we will just respond to it “if” it happens. This is why GDPR, and other similar legislation will become important to the API security industry. Without real civil or criminal penalties involved with breaches, and even heavier penalties for poorly handled breaches, companies just aren’t going to care. Data is just a replaceable commodity, and a company can recover from the hit to their brand when a breach does occur. Making the investment in proactive API security training, staffing, services, and processes an unnecessary thing.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>All the controls for Facebook to have done something about the Cambridge Analytics situation are already in place. The Facebook API management layer has everything needed to have prevented the type of user data abuse we’ve experienced, and honestly the user data abuse that has happens in many other applications, and will continue to occur. The cause of this behavior is rooted in Facebook’s business model, and a wider culture that is fueled by venture capital investment, and backdoor data brokering. It is just how the big data / app economy is funded, and when your business model is all based upon advertising, user engagement to generate data / signals, and being about leveraging that behavior for targeting–you are never going to reign in your API management layer. In alignment with my other story today around lack of investment in security, Facebook just doesn’t have the incentive to invest in policing their API management layer. There is no motivation to thoroughly vet new applications, let alone regularly review and audit what each application is doing as they approach 10K tokens, 100K, or 270K tokens. Sure you can’t get at all the friends data anymore, so they did work tighten things down at the API management schema layer, but most action we’ve seen is in response to bad situations, and not preventative. If you are properly managing the access to your APIs, and have the resources to monitor and respond to activity in real time, you are going to see the bad actors, and respond accordingly. Minimizing the damage that occurs to end-user, developing a robust set of patterns to keep an eye out for, and just get better at keeping your platform data consumption tight. The problem is when your primary business model is centered around advertising, and providing a wealth of controls around targeting users based upon the data points they provide, you want as many apps, as many data points, and as many...[<a href="/2018/03/21/facebooks-business-model-is-out-of-alignment-with-their-api-management-layer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>This is a post that has been in my API notebook for quite a while. I feel it is important to keep showcasing the growing number of API providers who are not just using OpenAPI, but also managing them on Github, so I had to make the time to talk about the email API provider SendGrid managing their OpenAPI using Github. Adding to the stack of top tier API providers managing their API definitions in this way. SendGrid is managing announcements around their OpenAPI definition using Github, allowing developers to signup for email notifications around releases and breaking changes. You can use the Github repository to stay in tune with the API roadmap, and contribute feature requests, submit bug reports, and even submit a pull request with the changes you’d like to see. Going beyond just an API definition being about API documentation, and actually driving the API road map and feedback loop. This approach to managing an API definition, while also making it a centerpiece of the feedback loop with your community is why I keep beating this drum, and showcasing API providers who are doing this. It is a way to manage the central API contract, where the platform provider and API consumers both have a voice, and producing a machine readable artifact that can be then used across the API lifecycle, from design to deprecation. Elevating the API definition beyond just a bi-product of creating API docs, and making it a central actor in everything that occurs as part of API operations. I’m still struggling with convincing API providers that they should be adopting OpenAPI. That it is much more than an artifact driving interactive documentation. Showcasing companies like SendGrid using OpenAPI, as well as their usage of Github, is an important part of me convincing other API providers to do the same.

			<p><em>20 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m fascinated with the unit of compute as defined by a microservice, OpenAPI definition, Postman Collection, or other way of quantifying an API-driven resource. Asking the question, “how big or how small is an API?”, and working to define the small unit of compute needed at runtime. I do not feel there is a perfect answer to any of these questions, but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be asking the questions, and packaging up our API definitions in a more meaningful way. As I was profiling APIs, and creating Postman Collections, the Okta team tweeted at me, their own approach to delivering their APIs. They tactically place Run in Postman buttons throughout their API documentation, as well as provide a complete listing of all the Postman Collections they have. Showcasing that they have broken up their Postman Collections along what I’d consider to be service lines. Providing small, meaningful collections for each of their user authentication and authorization APIs: Collections Click to Run Authentication API Access Management (OAuth 2.0) OpenID Connect Client Registration Sessions Apps Events Factors Groups Identity Providers (IdP) Logs Admin Roles Schemas Users Custom SMS Templates Okta’s approach delivers a pretty coherent, microservices approach to crafting their Postman Collections, providing separate API runtimes for each service they bring to the table. Which I think gets at what I’m looking to understand when it comes to defining and presenting our APIs. It can be a lot more work to create your Postman Collections like this, rather than just creating one single collection, with all API paths, but I think from a API consumer standpoint, I’d rather have them broken down like this. I may not care about all APIs, and I’m just looking at getting my hands on a couple of services–why make me wade through everything? I have imported the Postman Collections for the Okta API, and added to my API Stack research.

			<p><em>19 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been learning more about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recently, and have been having conversation about compliance with companies in the EU, as well as the US. In short, GDPR requires anyone working with personal data to be up front about the data they collect, making sure what they do with that data is observable to end-users, and takes a privacy and security by design approach when it comes to working with all personal data. While the regulations seems heavy handed and unrealistic to many, it really reflects a healthy view of what personal data is, and what a sustainable digital future will look like. The biggest challenge with becoming GDPR compliant is the data mess most companies operate in. Most companies collect huge amounts of data, believing it is essential to the value they bring to the table, without no real understanding of everything that is being collected, and any logical reasons behind why it is gathered, stored, and kept around. A “gather it all”, big data mentality has dominated the last decade of doing business online. Database groups within organizations hold a lot of power and control because of the data they possess. There is a lot of money to be made when it comes to data access, aggregation, and brokering. It won’t be easy to unwind and change the data-driven culture that has emerged and flourished in the Internet age. I regularly work with companies who do not have coherent maps of all the data they possess. If you asked them for details on what they track about any given customer, very few will be able to give you a consistent answer. Doing web APIs has forced many organizations to think more deeply about what data they posses, and how they can make it more discoverable, accessible, and usable across systems, web, mobile, and device applications. Even with this opportunity, most large organizations are still struggling with what data...[<a href="/2018/03/19/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-forcing-us-to-ask-questions-about/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m processing the recent announcement by Facebook to shut off the access of Cambridge Analytica to it’s valuable social data. The story emphasizes the importance of having a real time awareness and response to API consumers at the API management level, as well as the difficulty in ensuring that API consumers are doing what they should be with the data and content being made available via APIs. Access to platforms using APIs is more art than science, but there are some proven ways to help mitigate serious abuses, and identify the bad actors early on, and prevent their operation within the community. While I applaud Facebook’s response, I’m guessing they could have taken more action earlier on. Their response is more about damage control to their reputation, after the fact, than it is about preventing the problem from happening. Facebook most likely had plenty of warning signs regarding what Aleksandr Kogan, Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, were up to. If they weren’t than that is a problem in itself, and Facebook should be investing in more policing of their API consumers activity, as they claim they are doing in their release. If Aleksandr Kogan has that many OAuth tokens for Facebook users, then Facebook should be up in his business, better understanding what he is doing, where his money comes from, and who is partners are. I’m guessing Facebook probably had more knowledge, but because it drove traffic, generated ad revenue, and was in alignment with their business model, it wasn’t a problem. They were willing to look the other way with the data sharing that was occurring, until it became a wider problem for the election, our democracy, and in the press. Facebook should have more awareness, oversight, and enforcement at the API management layer of their platform.

			<p><em>14 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m spending time learning from the API design guides of other leading API providers, absorbing their healthy practices, and assimilating them into my own consulting and storytelling. One API design guide I am learning a lot from is out of the Adidas Group, which contains a wealth of wisdom regarding not just the design of your API, but also the deployment and evolution of the API resources we are publishing. One particularly interesting piece of advice I found within Adidas API design guidance were their rules for extending an API, which I think is pretty healthy advice for an API developer to think about. Any modification to an existing API MUST avoid breaking changes and MUST maintain backward compatibility. In particular, any change to an API MUST follow the following Rules for Extending: You MUST NOT take anything away (related: Minimal Surface Principle , Robustness Principle) You MUST NOT change processing rules You MUST NOT make optional things required Anything you add MUST be optional (related Robustness Principle) NOTE: These rules cover also renaming and change to identifiers (URIs). Names and identifiers should be stable over the time including their semantics. First of all, I think many API developers aren’t even thinking about what constitutes a breaking change most of the time. So having any guidance that makes them pause and think about this topic is a good thing. Second, I think we should be sharing more stories about when things break, helping folks think more about these elements–the problem is that many folks are embarrassed they introduced a breaking changes, and would rather not talk about it, let alone make it publicly known. I am working my way through the API Stylebook, learning from all the API design guides it has aggregated. There is a wealth of knowledge in there to learn from, and contains topics that make for great stories here on the blog.

			<p>I was on-boarding with the data marketplace Dawex the other day, and I thought their on-boarding process was interesting. It is pretty rigid, requiring users to validate themselves in multiple ways, but it provides some interesting approaches to knowing more about who your API developers are. Dawex has the basic level email and phone number validation, but they have added a 3rd dimension, validating who you are using your LinkedIn profile. After signing up, I was required to validate my email account–pretty standard stuff. Then I was asked to enter a code sent to my cell phone via SMS–not as common, but increasingly a way that platforms are using to verify you. Then I was asked to OAuth and connect my LinkedIn account to my Dawex profile. I’ve seen sign up and login using LinkedIn, but never using it as a 3rd type of validating who you are, and that you are truly a legitimate business user. I haven’t been verified yet, it says it will take up to 72 hour is what the notification at the top of my dashboard says, but it caught my attention. Dawes also has a complete, Know Your Customer (KYC) process, which takes the validation to another level, and something I’ll write about separately. I think the social profile validation provides an interesting look at how platforms validate who we are. In an environment where API developers will often sign up for multiple accounts, and do other shady things with anonymous accounts, I can get behind requiring consumers to prove who they are. I also think that providing robust, active, verifiable social media accounts using Github, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook makes a lot of sense. I’d say that all four of these profiles represent who I am as a person, as well as a business. I have talked about using Github to validate and rate API consumers before. I could see a world where I get validated upon signup...[<a href="/2018/03/14/linkedin-account-validation-for-new-api-consumers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The clothing marketplace Zalando has an interesting approach to classifying their APIs based upon who is consuming them. It isn’t just about APIs being published publicly, or privately, they actually have standardized their definition, and have established an OpenAPI vendor extension, so that the definition is machine readable and available via their OpenAPI. According to the Zalando API design guide, “each API must be classified with respect to the intended target audience supposed to consume the API, to facilitate differentiated standards on APIs for discoverability, changeability, quality of design and documentation, as well as permission granting. We differentiate the following API audience groups with clear organisational and legal boundaries.” component-internal - The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of the same functional component (internal link). All services of a functional component are owned by specific dedicated owner and engineering team. Typical examples are APIs being used by internal helper and worker services or that support service operation. business-unit-internal - The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of a specific product portfolio owned by the same business unit. company-internal - The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications owned by the business units of the same the company (e.g. Zalando company with Zalando SE, Zalando Payments SE &amp; Co. KG. etc.) external-partner - The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of business partners of the company owning the API and the company itself. external-public - APIs with this audience can be accessed by anyone with Internet access. Note: a smaller audience group is intentionally included in the wider group and thus does not need to be declared additionally. The API audience is provided as API meta information in the info-block of the Open API specification and must conform to the following specification: #/info/x-audience: type: string x-extensible-enum: - component-internal - business-unit-internal - company-internal - external-partner - external-public description: | Intended target audience of the API.

			<p>Interactive API documentation is nothing new. We’ve had Swagger UI, and other incarnations for over five years now. We also have API explorers, and full API lifecycle client solutions like Postman to help us engage with APIs, and be able to quickly see responses from the APIs we are consuming. In my effort to keep pushing forward the API documentation conversation I’ve been beating the drum for more visual solutions to be baked into our interactive documentation for a while now, encouraging providers to make the responses we receive much more meaningful, and intuitive for consumers. To help drum up awareness to this aspect of API documentation I’m always on the lookout for any interesting examples of it in the wild. There was the interesting approach out of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and now I’ve seen one out of the web data feeds API provider Webhose.io. When you are making API calls in their interactive dashboard you get a JSON response for things like news articles on the left hand side, but you also get an interesting slider that will show a visual representation of the JSON response on the right side–making it much more readable to non-developers. It provides a nice way to quickly make sense of API responses. Making them more accessible. Making it something that even non-developers can do. Essentially providing a reverse view source (view results?) for API responses. Taking the raw JSON, and providing an HTML lens for the humans trying to make decisions around the usage of a particular API. View source is how I learned HTML back in the mid 1990s, and I can see visualization tools for API responses helping average businesses users learn JSON, or at least make it a little less intimidating, and something they feel like they put to work for them. I really feel like more visualizations baked into API documentation is the future of interactive API docs.

			<p>I’m generating OpenAPI definitions for a wide variety of APIs currently, and I’m regularly stumbling on the messiness of the API design practices being deployed. When you are exposed to a large number of different APIs it is easy to get frustrated, begin ranting, and bitching about how ignorant people are of healthy, sensible API practices. This is the easy route. Making sense of it all, finding the interesting signals and patterns, and extracting where the opportunity are takes a significant amount of effort (so does biting tongue). After profiling almost 500 API providers, I have almost 25K separate API paths indexed using OpenAPI, and APIs.json. I’ve tagged each API path using its OpenAPI definition. Pulling words from the path name, and any summary and description provided within the API documentation. Doing my best to describe the value contained within each API resource. Then I started grouping by these tags, to see what it produced. Sometimes the API paths it lists makes total sense, but most of the time it makes no sense at all. Then, I started noticing interesting patterns in how people describe their resources. Grouping things like “favorites” across all types of APIs, revealing some pretty interesting perspectives, and honest views of the resources being exposed. Something as simple as “activities” can mean 30 or 40 different things when applied across CRM, storage, DNS, travel or sports APIs. At first, I’m like this shit is broken. The more time I spend with the mess, the more I’m starting to think there is more to this mess than meets the eye. I could be wrong. I often am. It is likely just my contrarian view of things, and my unique view of the API landscape in action. Where many people see duplicative work, I see common patterns. I just see the landscape differently than people who are just looking to get their work done, sell a product or service, and find an exit...[<a href="/2018/03/13/seeing-messy-api-design-practices-as-an-opportunity/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Machine learning API ParallelDots has a story on launching their APIs in multiple languages. Allowing them to “serve a truly global customer base with following language options for our key APIs (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Keyword generator)”. Something that I think more APIs providers are going to have to think about in coming years, as the need for API resources expands around the globe. I’m tracking on the localization efforts of different API providers, and I’d say that having service availability in different regions, and multi-lingual support are the top two areas I’m seeing movement. I see two driving forces behind this, 1) the customers are demanding localization for their businesses, and 2) the governments in those countries are imposing regulations and other laws that dictate where resources can be stored and operate. I guess, something that can be seen as markets working things out, if you also believe in the value of regulations. I also see a negative in all of this, specifically in this case, the imperialistic aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Meaning, the models are trained here in western countries, but then being applied, injected, and imposed upon people in other countries. Selling the service as some sort of truth, watermark, and organic solution to sentiment, emotion, and intelligence without actually localizing the models. I’m not making any assumptions around ParralelDots motivations, just pointing out that this will be a problem, and should be ignored–if it makes you mad, then you are probably part of the problem. As I conduct my API research, I will keep tracking on localization efforts like this. When I have the bandwidth I will dive in deeper and better understand how providers are defining these localization layers to their APIs in their API design, deployment, documentation, and other elements. I’ll be keeping an eye on which industries are moving fastest when it comes to API localization, and try to understand where it is deemed...[<a href="/2018/03/13/multilingual-machine-learning-api-deployments/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>Google is renewing its interest in the healthcare space by releasing a protocol buffer implementation of the fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR) standard. Protocol buffers are “Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler”. Its the core of the next generation of APIs at Google, often using HTTP/2 as a transport, while also living side by side with RESTful APIs, which use OpenAPI as the definition, in parallel to what protocol buffers deliver. It’s a smart move by Google. Providing a gateway for healthcare data to find its way to their data platform products like Google Cloud BigQuery, and their machine learning solutions built on Tensorflow. They want to empower healthcare providers with powerful solutions that help onboard their data, and be able to connect the dots, and make sense of it at scale. However, I wouldn’t stop with protocol buffers. I would also make sure they also invest in API infrastructure on the RESTful side of the equation, developing OpenAPI specs alongside the protocol buffers, and providing translation between, and tooling for both realms. While I am a big supporter of gRPC, and protocol buffers, I’m skeptical of the complexity it brings, in exchange for higher performance. Part of making sense of health care data will require not just technical folks being able to make sense of what is going on, but also business folks, and protocol buffers, and gRPC solutions will be out of reach of these users. Web APIs, combined with YAML OpenAPI has begun to make the API contracts involved in all of this much more accessible to business users, putting everything within their reach. In our technological push forward, let’s not forget the simplicity of web APIs, and exclude business healthcare users as IT has done historically. I’m happy to see more FHIR-compliant APIs emerging on the landscape.

I wanted to showcase the section about their API as a product principles, which I think reflects what I hear many companies striving for when they do APIs. From the Zalando API design guide principles: Zalando is transforming from an online shop into an expansive fashion platform comprising a rich set of products following a Software as a Platform (SaaP) model for our business partners. As a company we want to deliver products to our (internal and external) customers which can be consumed like a service. Platform products provide their functionality via (public) APIs; hence, the design of our APIs should be based on the API as a Product principle: Treat your API as product and act like a product owner Put yourself into the place of your customers; be an advocate for their needs Emphasize simplicity, comprehensibility, and usability of APIs to make them irresistible for client engineers Actively improve and maintain API consistency over the long term Make use of customer feedback and provide service level support RESTful API as a Product makes the difference between enterprise integration business and agile, innovative product service business built on a platform of APIs. Based on your concrete customer use cases, you should carefully check the trade-offs of API design variants and avoid short-term server side implementation optimizations at the expense of unnecessary client side obligations and have a high attention on API quality and client developer experience. API as a Product is closely related to our API First principle which is more focused on how we engineer high quality APIs.

I am pulling together some API design guidance for some projects I’m consulting on, so I’m spending time reviewing the API design guides the leading API providers who have published them publicly. Learning from what they are doing across their own companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies when it comes to sensible API governance.

Today, I am learning from the British food delivery company, Deliveroo, and documenting their guidance for which HTTP status codes should be returned for any API methods that use DELETE:

If it exists, it should return status:


  204 No Content if the entity was successfully destroyed,
  404 Not Found if the entity does not exist
  410 Gone if the entity is known to have existed but no longer does.


Additionally 4xx response codes may be used:


  412 Precondition Failed
  415 Unsupported if using versioning and the server doesn’t support the specified version.


I have to admit, I haven’t been properly publishing status codes any DELETE methods I provide. I’ve just been returning a 200 if successful, and 404 if it didn’t exist. I hadn’t put any further thought into the proper way of handling it. I just haven’t had the time, or the knowledge within reach to be able to handle properly.

I know that the RESTafarians enjoy debating these finer details of API design, and using HTTP, but for the rest of us, we just need some guidance from y’all. Which is why I spend time learning from existing API leaders who publish their API design guidance, and sharing as individual stories here on the blog, as well as including in my official project consulting guidance.

			<p>I am profiling APIs as part of my partnership with Streamdata.io, and my continued API Stack work. As part of my work, I am creating OpenAPI, Postman Collections, and APIs.json indexes for APIs in a variety of business sectors, and as I’m finishing up the profile for ParallelDots machine learning APIs, I am struck (again) by the importance of tags within OpenAPI definitions when it comes to defining what any API does, and something that will have significant effects on the growing machine learning, and artificial intelligence space. While profiling ParallelDots, I had to generate the OpenAPI definition from the Postman Collection they provide, which was void of any tags. I went through the handful of API paths, manually adding tags for each of the machine learning resources. I’m adding tags like sentiment, emotions, semantics, taxonomy, and classification, to each path. Trying to capture what resources were available, allowing for the discovery, filtering, and execution of each individual machine learning model being exposed using a simple web API. While the summary and description explain what each API does to developers, the tags are really the precise meaning in a machine readable context. In the fast moving, abstract realm of machine learning, and artificial intelligence it can be difficult to truly understand what each API does, or doesn’t do. I struggle with it, and I’m pretty well versed in what is possible and not possible with machine learning. Precise tagging provide us with a single definition of what each machine learning API does, setting a baseline of understanding for putting ML APIs to work. Something that if I consistently apply across all of the machine learning APIs I’m profiling, I can can begin honing and dialing in my catalog of valuable API resources, and begin creating a coherent map of what is possible with machine learning APIs–helping ground us in this often hyped realm.

This time, I am taking a look at the API design guide publish by Adidas, specifically the portion of it addressing what some of the common API types should be. Providing some API design essentials, that all of us API providers should be baking into our APIs by default. Here is the short list of default standards Adidas is supporting across their API operations: Date and Time Format - Date and Time MUST always conform to the ISO 8601 format e.g.: 2017-06-21T14:07:17Z (date time) or 2017-06-21 (date), it MUST use the UTC (without time offsets). Duration Format - Duration format MUST conform to the ISO 8601 format standard e.g.: P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S (three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds). Time Interval Format - Time Interval format MUST conform to the ISO 8601 format standard e.g.: 2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z. Standard Time Stamps - Where applicable, a resource representation SHOULD contain the standard timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt, and finishedAt, using the ISO 8601 format. Language Code Format - Language codes MUST conform to the ISO 639 e.g.: en for English. Country Code Format - Country codes MUST conform to the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 e.g.: DE for Germany. Currency Format - Currency codes MUST conform to the ISO 4217 e.g.: EUR for Euro. These are the common data formats we are all using across our APIs. We should be working to support standard formats wherever possible, embracing the wider web, and investing in the longevity and usability of our API designs. Making our APIs sure that they speak to as wide of audience as they possibly can, and operate in a consistent way, no matter which API you are integrating with.

I’m spending a significant portion of my day profiling API providers, documenting what it is they bring to the table. Historically I’ve published the resulting APIs.json and OpenAPI definition(s) to a single Github repository driving theapistack.com. The primary folder was already getting too big, and since I’m looking at adding at least a thousand more API providers to the stack, I am going to need to shard things out a bit. To help accommodate the increased scale, I’m breaking up the API Stack into two separate Github organizations. One for individual API providers called api-stack-providers, and a second for individual topics called api-stack-topics. I’ve began publishing individual repositories for each API provider that I am monitoring, establishing a self-contained, continuously deployable, and integratabtle set of definitions for each API. I’m needing each API provider to be independent from each other, and I’m even publishing individual API definitions for each API path, distilling things down to the smallest possible unit of compute possible. Each repository contains three main API definitions, using the ParallelDots machine learning API as an example: APIs.json - The entire index of the API provider’s operation. OpenAPI - The definition of the surface area of entire API. Postman Collection - An execute-time ready definition for the Postman client. I’m also publishing an individual OpenAPI for each API path within a listings folder, allowing me to provide the detailed execute-time definition I’m needing to work with each API. I’m also considering how I can do this with the Postman Collections. Next, I’m looking to understand how I can include the multiple source definitions within the repository, providing original copies of API definitions that I’m pulling from sources like APIs.guru, Any API, and directly from API providers.

As Postman continues its expansion from being just an API client, to a full lifecycle API development solution, they’ve added a network for discovering existing APIs that you can begin using within Postman in a single click. Postman Collections make it ridiculously easy to get up and running with an API. So easy, I’m confounded why ALL APIs aren’t publishing Postman Collections with Run in Postman Buttons published in their API docs. The Postman API Network provides a catalog of APIs in over ten categories, with links to each API’s documentation. All of the APIs in the network have a Run in Postman button available as part of their documentation, which includes them in the Postman API Network. It is a pretty sensible approach to building a network of valuable APIs, who all have invested in there being a runtime-ready, machine readable Postman Collection for their APIs. One of the more interesting approaches I’ve seen introduced to help solve the API discovery problem in the eight years I’ve been doing API Evangelist. I’ve been talking to Abhinav Asthana (@a85) about the Postman API Network, and working to understand how I can contribute, and help grow the catalog as part of my work as the API Evangelist. I’m a fan of Postman, and an advocate of it as an API lifecycle development solution, but I’m also really keen on bringing comprehensive API discovery solutions to the table. With the Postman API Network, and other API discovery solutions I’m seeing emerge recently, I’m finding renewed energy for this area of my work. Something I’ll be brainstorming and writing about more frequently in coming months. Streamdata.io has been investing in me moving forward the API discovery conversation, to build out their vision of a Streamdata.io API Gallery, but also to contribute to the overall API...[<a href="/2018/03/09/the-postman-api-network/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>Open source software is increasingly driving the federal government, despite the wishes of companies like Oracle. I’ve been watching an interesting project grow within the federal government to help quantify open source across the federal government called Code.gov, which “leverages the power of code sharing and collaboration to help the US Government cut down on duplicative software development and save millions of taxpayer dollars for the American people.” Something I think we can all get behind, when it comes to the collision of technology and government we are seeing play out. Code.gov allows you to browse open source projects by government agency, see the details for the project, visit the repository, and contact the project owners. The project even has a help wanted section where you can roll up your sleeves and actually contribute to specific projects, and help agencies push forward their project. You can follow up on what is happening using the Code.gov roadmap, and stay in tune with whats next for the very important project. However, the aspect I’m most interested in, is the evolution of the Code.gov API. There is an open source API behind the Code.gov project, providing programmatic access to government agencies repositories, the code, types of programming languages used, status, and other critical details for projects. There is an OpenAPI-driven, Swagger UI documentation for the project, providing a nice look at the programmatic surface for the project. You can use the API they have provided, or you can fork the API and operate yourself, providing an interesting look at delivering open source APIs that span multiple federal agencies–a blueprint that should be considered for other types of projects. Code.gov reflects what I want to see come out of the federal government when it comes to technology. Open source. API-driven. Doing on thing, and doing it well. I can see spinoffs of the project emerge, focusing on just the environment, transportation, healthcare, and other verticals, helping shine a light...[<a href="/2018/03/09/keeping-track-of-federal-government-open-source-projects-using-the-code-gov/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m thinking a lot about what is needed at API runtime lately. How we document and provide machine readable definitions for APIs, and how we provide authentication, pricing, and even terms of service to help reduce friction. As Mike Amundsen (@mamund) puts it, to enable “find and bind”. This goes beyond simple API on-boarding, and getting started pages, and looks to make APIs executable within a single click, allowing us to put them to use as soon as we find them. The most real world example of this in action can be found with the Run in Postman button, which won’t always deal with the business and politics of APIs at runtime, but will deal with just about everything else. Allowing API providers to publish Run in Postman Buttons, defined using a Postman Collection, which include authentication environment details, that API consumers can use to quickly fire up an API in a single click. One characteristic I’ve come across that contributes to Postman Collections being truly executable is that they reflect the small unit possible for use at API runtime. You can see an example of this in action over at Peachtree Data, who like many other API providers have crafted Run in Postman buttons, but instead of doing this for the entire surface area of their API, they have done it for a single API path. Making the Run in Postman button much more precise, and executable. Taking it beyond just documentation, to actually being more of a API runtime executable artifact. This is a simple shift in how Postman Collections can be used, but a pretty significant one. Now instead of wading through all of Peachtree’s APIs in my Postman, I can just do an address cleanse, zip code lookup, or email validation–getting down to business in a single click. This is an important aspect of on-boarding developers. I may not care about wading through and learning about all your APIs right now....[<a href="/2018/03/09/defining-the-smallest-unit-possible-for-use-at-api-runtime/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been profiling a number of market data APIs as part of my work with Streamdata.io to identify valuable sources of data that could be streamed using their service. A significant portion of the APIs I come across are making it difficult for me to get at the data they have because of their views around the value of the data, intellectual property, and maintaining control over it in an API-driven world. These APIs don’t end up on the list of APIs I’m including in the profiling work, the gallery / directory, and don’t get included in any of the stories I’m telling, as a result of this tight control. The side effect of this is I end up getting repeated sales emails and phone calls asking if I am still interested in their data. If there was just one or two of these, I’d jump on phones and explain, but because I’m dealing with 50+ of them, I just don’t have the bandwidth, and I have to move on. The thing is, I’m personally not interested in their data. I’m interested in other people being interested in their data, and being an enabler to helping them to get at it. However, since I can’t actually profile the APIs, create OpenAPI definitions for the request and response structure for inclusion in the API gallery / directory I’m building, I really don’t need their APIs in my work. I know these platforms are protective of their data because it is valuable. They should be. However modern API management allows for them to open up the sampling of everything they have to offer, without giving away the farm. This allows enablers, analysts, and storytellers like me to test drive things, profile what they have to offer, and include within our applications. Then my users find what they want, head over to the source of the data, sign up for API keys, talk to their sales staff about...[<a href="/2018/03/08/your-obsessive-focus-on-the-api-resource-is-hindering-meaningful-events-from/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>Imagine if we didn’t actually write code when we developed our APIs initially. What if the bar for putting an API into production was so high, that many APIs never actually made it to that level. I spend a lot of time mocking and prototyping APIs, but I don’t have a strict maturity model determining when I actually bring an API to life using code. I’d love it if I never actually write code for many of my API prototypes and just mocked them, and iterated upon the mocks instead of thinking they needed actually have a database backend, and code or gateway front-end. What if I only executed these stops along the API lifecycle, instead of actually writing any code: Define - Define what I want my API to do, and what types of resources will be involved. Design - Actually design my API and underlying schema using an OpenAPI definition. Mock - Publish a mock representation of my API, complete with virtualized data behind responses. Document - Make sure and publish documentation to a simple developer portal. Plan - A overview of what it will cost, and the model for managing consumption. Testing - Set up tests to ensure each API is up and doing what it was intended to do. Communicate - Actually write stories, and communicate around what an API does. Support - Establish and maintain feedback loops around the API to listen to consumers. Road Map - Gather feedback into a road map, and plan next version, complete with a change log. In this life cycle I would never actually write any code. I would never actually setup a database backend. Everything would be mocked and virtualized, but seem as real as I possibly can. Even maybe providing different types of virtualized datasets and responses, so people can experience different types of responses or scenarios. I’d work hard to make sure each API was as complete, and function like a...[<a href="/2018/03/08/imagine-a-mock-only-api-development-reality/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>We are working closely with Axway on a number of projects over here at Streamdata.io. After we got out of a meeting with their team the other day we received an email from them asking if we had an OpenAPI definition for a demo Streamdata.io market data API. They were wanting to include it in some marketing materials, and needed a screenshot of it. To be able to generate the visual they desired, they needed an OpenAPI to make it tangible enough for capturing in a screenshot and presenting as part of a larger story. This may sound like a pretty banal thing, but when you step back and realize the importance of OPenAPI when it comes to communication, and making something very abstract a tangible, visual thing, it becomes more significant. You can tell someone there is a market data API, but taking a screenshot of documentation generated via an OpenAPI which displays the market data paths, a couple of parameters like stocker ticker symbol and maybe date range, and then plug in some actual values like the ticker symbol for AAPL, and show the JSON response takes things to a new level. This is OpenAPI empowered storytelling, marketing and communications in my book. Elevating what OpenAPI brings to the table to new stops along the API life cycle. This isn’t just about documentation. This is about making an abstract API concept more visual, more meaningful, and able to be captured in an image. Axway is trying to demonstrate the value of their API solutions, coupled potentially with Streamdata.io services, in a single image–providing a lot more rich context, and visualizations that amplify their marketing materials. This isn’t just documenting what is going on so that developers know what to do with an API, this is telling stories so that business users understanding what is possible with an API–using a machine readable format like OpenAPI to help deliver the 1000 words the image will...[<a href="/2018/03/08/axway-asking-for-an-openapi-of-the-streamdata-io-api-so-they-can-screenshot-it/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>It can be tough to know where to start with APIs at your large organization. Everyone is already in motion, in a variety of groups, geographic regions, serving different lines of business. The API conversation is already occurring across your organization, it is just happening in a distributed and fragmented way, without any coherent orchestration, and strategy moving it forward in unison. I’d like to sit down with your team(s), and understand what APIs look like across your organization, and help work through a first draft of your API strategy, and define how we can better orchestrate existing efforts, and begin establishing an API governance framework for bringing the API vision into focus. Let’s put together a schedule for me to sit down with a variety of teams in a partial day, full day, or multi-day series of workshops. Where we can work to define a more comprehensive, and coherent strategy for APIs. One that is rooted in what is already happening, but works to brig together the disparate voices from each team into a single conversation about how APIs can make change across your organization in a more consistent, and meaningful way. Let’s sit down and begin to define what APIs mean at your organization and map of what is already occurring, and develop framework that will allow us to begin to move things forward. Define Objectives I’d like to learn more about the objectives behind your investment in an organization-wide API strategy, and understand more around the motivations, vision behind what you are looking to achieve. I’d like to cut through the hype, and get to the real reasons you want to be doing APIs. Internal - What benefits should APIs bring to internal teams within the organization? Partner - How will APIs be used to further partner engagements, and maximize their deliverables? Public - What can be achieved by performing APIs in the public sphere, and engaging 3rd party developers, and media?...[<a href="/2018/03/07/where-do-we-start-the-api-conversation-at-our-large-organization/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2018</em></p>
			<p>I find it to be a telling sign of the culture at US companies when it comes to their response, or lack of response to EU regulations. I’ve been curating stories from the API providers that I track on when it comes to GDPR or PSD2, keeping a notebook or research that is ready when I get around to diving in deeper. The companies who are openly talking about these regulations and being proactive about responding to them, are usually the API providers who have a strong stance in the US market, and are poised to, or already expanding this reach to Europe. Companies who haven’t made any noise are probably not concerned with the European market, or just hoping the regulations fizzle out I guess? After diving into my curation notebook the first company to stand out is Auth0, with a variety of blog posts, and resources on navigating both PSD2 and GDPR. Auth0 is in a good position to provide critical authentication and user information management APIs to other companies who are working to comply with the regulations, so it makes sense that they would be getting ahead of all of this. I fully grasp that many companies are simply issuing their press releases stating they can help with GDPR or PSD2, but you can quickly cut through the fluff by looking at how much they’ve invested in their response, materials, and services. Auth0 has a pretty extensive knowledge-base on GDPR, providing PSD2 guidance on their blog, as well as investing in their EU region for a couple of years–demonstrating it is more than just a press release. I’m working my way through the list of US API providers, and service providers who are being active on the subject of EU regulations. I feel it is an important sign of the strength of the company, and demonstrates a healthy understanding of how regulations aren’t always bad, and that they can actually help industries...[<a href="/2018/03/07/us-companies-getting-ahead-of-eu-regulations/">Read More</a>]</p>
