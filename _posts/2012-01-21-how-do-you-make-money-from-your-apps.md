{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the areas of API development Im focusing a lot of energy on in 2012 is around monetization.I want to help define the playing field, of how API owners make money from their APIs, as well as how developers make money from their apps.Both areas are extremely critical for the success of any API ecosystem.If the API owner does not have a clear path to generate revenue, the API wont be sustainable, and eventually will go away.On the other side of the coin, developers have to be able to make money from their apps in order to sustain their work, and build a viable business around an API.</p>
