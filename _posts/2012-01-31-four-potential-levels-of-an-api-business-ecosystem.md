{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im working on a framework for the City Grid API that helps define the different types of developers that are using our APIs, helping me understand how to better support them, and ensure their success.This particular approach is different than segmenting my developers by type of development, like web and mobile or by industry like real estate or medical.Im focusing on the business side of the API, and identifying what developers need to be successful in the business of the applications they are building on the CityGrid API, and where I should focus CityGrid resources.Im breaking down our API developers into four distinct levels: Open - Publicly available, self-service use of the API, with general forum and email support via developer area.Associate - Motivated app developers who demonstrate their understanding of an API, submit their app for internal approval and take advantage of revenue sharing opportunities around the API.</p>
