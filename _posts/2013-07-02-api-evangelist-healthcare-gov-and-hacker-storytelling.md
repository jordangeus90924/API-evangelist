{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive been slowly evolving API Evangelist from a single site, into an interconnected network of individual API projects.API Evangelist started as a research project back in July 2010, making its shift to be a network of smaller, inter-connected research projects is fitting.While API Evangelist currently still runs on my home brew CMS, shortly it will finish the migration to completely run on Github, making it merely a hollywood front for what is currently 37+ API related, living research projects of mine.I call my evolving approach to projects, Hacker Storytelling.I made up the name, but the approach is borrowed from several other philosophies which starts with concept of data journalism, but then has also evolved from conversations last year in Washington DC from very smart folks including Ben Balter (@BenBalter), Gray Brooks (@gbinal), and the very forward thinking work of the Development Seed team.</p>
