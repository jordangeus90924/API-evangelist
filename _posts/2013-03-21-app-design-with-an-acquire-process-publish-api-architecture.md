{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im tracking on a new wave of application frameworks and API centric architecture patterns, that are not just helping deliver the next wave of web &amp; mobile apps, but also bridging, aggregating and providing interoperability and transformations between APIs platforms.One company Ive been watching closely is Seabourne.The Seabourne team has an approach to application development that follows a very interesting set of principles: Information Flows Instead of Pipelines - Information operates in ‘flows’ where inputs and outputs are flexible and happen at any point.Flows are fluid and flexible, unlike structured, point-to-point pipelines Data has Multiple Owners - Information flows are composed of multiple streams of data owned by different partners and vendors.Any process must accommodate multiple canonical sources for different information Use APIs to Move Information - By using APIs to move information around, we decouple the data from the underlying technology and vendor, and make it possible to combine information from different technologies.</p>
