<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/audiosearch-people-index.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I was doing one of my regular checkins with my friend Anne Wootton (<a href="https://twitter.com/annewootton">@annewootton</a>) of P<a href="https://www.popuparchive.com/">opup Archive</a> today, something we try to do regularly, to share stories about what they are up to in the world of audio and podcast API, and what I am seeing across the voice, audio, video, and wider API landscape.&nbsp;
<p>Anne was walking me through their latest rollout&nbsp;<a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/">AudioSear.ch</a>, <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/">a&nbsp;full text search &amp; recommendation API for podcasts and radio</a>, that is API driven. One of the endpoints for the <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">AudioSear.ch API</a> allows for searching of people who are involved with the podcasts and radio programs that they are indexing. As we talked, she articulated that in order to help people see the value the <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">AudioSear.ch People API</a>, rather than just telling them about it, they were <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/people/a">building micro applications, that demonstrated it</a>.
<p>This may seem obvious too many, but I've made a career out of shining a light on the obvious, and with APIs being such an abstract concept, little ideas like this can go a long ways. In this era of microservices, the concept of micro, portable, simple, and focused goes a long way, and what AudioSear.ch is doing with their people API is something that other API providers should consider as well.
<p>Sometimes, the little things like a demo micro application built on top of your API can be the thing that plants a seed in someones mind about what your API does--a seed that over time could grow into something much, much more. <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I already advocate for other code related building blocks like SDK, PDKs, and starter projects</a>--maybe I'll add micro apps as a building block and see if I can incite API providers to deploy more of them to support API operations.

<p>I try to go through each of my areas of research as often as I can and update the content, as well as my understanding. Ideally I update the news each week, take a look at the organizations involved once a month, and evaluate the building blocks and tools each quarter. Unfortunately it doesn't always happen as planned, but as a one man operation, I think I do pretty well.&nbsp;
<p>I just went through my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>, and adjusted my definition of what I felt needed be listed there. As I move API definitions to their own research area(s), I'm reconsidering what I want to keep an eye on when it comes to API design, and my current definition involves organizations who offer API design editors, either in the cloud or as download. They should allow you to add, edit, and manage the API details, then also provide the ability to import and export using common API definition format(s).
<p>Currently I have nine organizations represented, as part of my API design research:

<p>As I work to refine each of my research areas, it can be hard to draw the line where each projects starts, and ends. I had <a href="https://readme.io">Readme.io</a>, and <a href="http://wavemaker.com">Wavemaker</a> on this list, but I really felt they were more in the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a>, and <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> realms, resulting in me drawing the line where I did.
<p>Next I am looking to tackle the API design tooling, which I am looking to organize into groups, as there is kind of a mash-up of different things there now. Hopefully I can break it all into a more coherent breakdown of not just the open tooling, but also open content, and other resources that might help all of us all in our API design journey.&nbsp;
<p>One thing I have to say after updating the list of organizations on my API design research, is I am impressed how far the services, tooling, and overall API design mindset has come in just two short years. We have more than one editor, with a couple of the implementations being open source--I'd say this is pretty healthy progress. ;-)

<p>I am going through each of my research projects, and tightening things down, now that I have them all driven through my new, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">master stack of APIs</a>. First up was <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/30/tightening-up-the-organizations-that-are-included-in-my-api-design-research/">the other day I spent time going through the organization I track on as part of my API design research</a>, and today mission was to refine the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">tooling section</a>.
<p>Previously my tooling page was just an alphabetical list of tools, and I wanted to at least group things in a more meaningful way, reflecting how I break them down in my own monitoring system. So I reworked the publishing to allow me to group the tools by tags, resulting in the following list:
<div class="page">

<p>&nbsp;
<p>API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A couple of semantic assumptions over the plain Markdown. API Blueprint is perfect for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read &ndash; after all it is just a form of plain text. API Blueprint, its parser, and most of its tools are completely open sourced so you don't have to worry about vendor lock-in. This also means you can freely integrate API Blueprint into any type of product, commercial or not.

<p><a href="https://recode.net/2015/06/29/u-s-top-court-declines-to-hear-google-appeal-in-oracle-software-fight/">I just read on Re/Code, that the Supreme Court declined to hear Google's appeal on the Oracle v Google case</a>--prepare for the waves of stories from tech blogs, that this will suffocate the API economy. During the last response to the case by the US Solicitor General, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/28/regarding-the-solicitor-general-weighing-in-on-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case-are-you-really-surprised-they-do-not-get-apis-i-am-not/">I wrote about how I can't even argue the concept anymore</a>, and nothing has changed for me.&nbsp;
<p>I just wanted to take the moment to remind everyone that this decision means nothing if we all share our API definitions, in open ways, using machine readable definitions like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. The disturbing move by Oracle to bring a lawsuit against Google, and the very unaware decision(s) made all the way up to federal level, will NOT bring down the API economy--your inaction will!
<p>If I've learned anything during my time defending APIs, as part of the Oracle v Google case, is that many of you are holding your API designs close to your chest, thinking maybe, just maybe, they are intellectual property we should protect, and can make money on, when we are the next unicorn start-up. You are willing to do this, even at the expense of the success of your APIs, ignoring that it creates huge amounts of friction with developers, and the businesses you are asking to integrate your APIs into their systems.
<p>When you bundle this with the large numbers of folks who don't even understand the difference between an API definition or design, and its code back-end, you end up with a very dangerous, controllable group of folks, who will slowly stifle, and potentially suffocate any momentum we have built with the API economy. It will be these groups of individuals and companies, who will blindly do Oracle's bidding, and make sure any democratizing power APIs had, stays in the hands of the powerful few.
<p>Why would anyone integrate your API definition into their application, if at some point they can be forced to license and pay for the naming, and order of API endpoints that are called? I sure wouldn't. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/3scale-launches-api-commons-to-allow-developers-to-share-apis-under-creative-commons-licenses/">This is why Steve Willmott and I started API Commons</a>, so that we can start sorting out the open API definitions, from the closed ones, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">index these API operations using APIs.json</a>, allowing the API economy to filter itself at run-time, leaving closed, potentially dangerous definitions behind.
<p>Please join me in the fight, by helping me define the common API patterns available across the space, as part our&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>&nbsp;work--do not let this decision get you down.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">I wrote that&nbsp;we should be generating Slate API documentation from Swagger so we maintain a machine readable core the other day</a>--while I love the look of <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a>, I want to make sure all API meta data is machine readable by default. Shortly after publishing my post, someone kindly pointed me to a version of Swagger that was developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jensoleg">Jens-Ole Graulund</a>, which was exactly the evolution that I was looking for.
<p><a href="https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui">The more response, Swagger driven version of Slate API document is perfect</a>!&nbsp;Giving API providers a more attractive, response version of Swagger UI (sorry Tony), while also keeping the core machine readable.--it is the best of both worlds! I plugged in one of my other complete Swagger definitions, and boom...I had a new version of my API docs.

<p>Tips like this from my readers is why I blog about all my ideas out loud. If I kept my thoughts locked up, this type of discovery would never occur. I am going to play with deploying this version of the Swagger UI for my API stack, to see how versatile it is, and how well it works with my own site template.&nbsp;
<p>I just wanted to put it out there that this new option for Swagger UI exists, in case you were looking for an alternate version of the Swagger UI. I predict this is the beginning of many different iterations on Swagger UI, resulting in one eventually that is themable. ;-)

title: 'APIs.json Driven API Dictionaries For Use In Atom IDE Autocomplete Packages'

---

<p><a href="https://atom.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/atom-editor/atom-editor-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I have been using the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom editor</a>&nbsp;when I work on local files on my workstation for some time now. With the latest version 1.0 release I took a fresh look at the architecture, and under the hood at the packages that make the platform so powerful, and extensible. One of the packages I was reverse engineering this weekend, is the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-atom-api">Atom API Autocomplete Package</a>.
<p><a href="https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-atom-api">The&nbsp;Atom API Autocomplete Package</a> is one of <a href="https://atom.io/packages/search?q=autocomplete">several autocompete packages</a> that gives Atom some of that IDE feel when you are editing files. I like the feel of Atom autocomplete, and I really dig that this functionality is extensible via Atom packages. This experience got me thinking again about the IDEs role in API design and development, and how I'd like to see more API definition driven dictionaries, defined using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, driving IDE autocomplete features like the Atom editor has.
<p>Like everything in my world, my concept of APIs.json driven dictionaries is a work in progress, but to kick things off <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/dictionary/">I launched a new API I'm calling my dictionary API</a>, that helps me build and manage dictionaries that I can potentially use in an Atom autocomplete package. As I do with all of my work, I want to put my ideas out there early to get feedback, and stimulate other people's imaginations.
<p>To provide the content for my dictionaries, I am using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, my primary API definition format. All I do is index any single, or collection of multiple APIs using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and pass the URL to my new dictionary API, and I get back a JSON dictionary.&nbsp;
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/378e4a9a4ec021fb7c4a.js"></script>
<p>This is my first draft of an potential dictionary output. I still have to get familiar with the Atom package design, and I've noticed different autocomplete packages handle their completions differently, but I at least wanted an automated way for importing Swagger definition(s), and create a single JSON dictionary that I could use as my Atom package completion store. My API will allow me to iterate on my JSON schema until I find one that works, while allowing me to generate dictionaries from existing APIs.json collections that I have defined.
<p>Along with other APIs.json driven services that I am working on, like generating <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">Postman Collections</a>, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a>, I want to be able to easily generate API dictionaries that can be used throughout the API lifecycle to enrich any developer's IDE experience, and make sure they have the paths, parameters, and underlying data models for the APIs they need, right at their fingertips, in the environment they already use.
<p>Imagine what API dictionaries could do for enterprise groups, in helping them standardize their API design practices, across groups, and an entire organization when they are working from common dictionaries, that are kept in sync using machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, bound into indexes using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.

<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">API documentation when done using Slate</a>. It creates very beautiful, and easy to use documentation, that makes learning about an API much more pleasant. You can find some pretty good examples of Slate being used in the wild, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/api/#overview">Travis CI API</a>, <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/#introduction">Dwolla API</a>, and <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/docs/api">API Science API</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Slate goes a long way in standardizing the documentation for APIs, but I would like to see this go further. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/23/the-over-30-apis-i-depend-on-to-run-api-evangelist/">I am working to profile both Dwolla and API Science as part of defining the stack of APIs that I depend on to operate the API Evangelist network</a>, and while I enjoy the attractive UX Slate brings to the table, I'm lamenting the lack of a machine readable API definitions along the way.
<p>I have a set of import scripts I use to scrape API documentation, and generate Swagger definitions, which I will be using to auto-generate a first draft Swagger file for any API I come across using Slate for the documentation, but I'd like to see a formal solution emerge. It would make sense to have a Slate generator from Swagger, for the API providers who would prefer the attractive looking Slate documentation, over the more functionality interactive <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>.
<p>We definitely need to make sure API documentation UX is as polished as possible, but we can't lose any of the momentum we've gained from machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">I have previously talked about moving forward the API documentation and UI conversation forward</a>, and making sure Slate, and other attractive API documentation tooling, are interoperable with common API definition formats will be critical to keeping things moving forward.

<p><em>This is one of several stories I am evolving as part of series I'm calling API fairy tales. With these tales I want to educate business leaders, technologists, and government about the importance of Application Programming Interfaces (API), and how they are being applied in almost every aspect of business occurring online today--providing simple examples that mainstream users can learn from, as well as retell in their circles.</em>
<p dir="ltr">The Internet is slowly changing almost every aspect of our society, and a major part of this evolution is rooted in how we develop software, something that has been slowly building over the last 15 years, in the form of what is known an Application Programming Interfaces, or simply called APIs. This new breed of web APIs are providing access to data, content, and the other digital assets that are essential in building websites, mobile applications, and increasingly even physical devices.
<p dir="ltr">This modern web API movement is not some new software from a company like IBM, Microsoft, or Google, it is simply the next step in the World Wide Web, where you don&rsquo;t just surf the web, consuming HTML documents. In the API economy you navigate the Internet, creating, consuming, and interacting with not just HTML files, but any type of content, data, or digital resource that can be accessed via the web, desktop, and mobile applications that we increasingly depend on in our personal, and professional lives.
<p dir="ltr">APIs are being used by almost every type of company, across almost every industry, to deliver the web and mobile applications business and consumer users are demanding. Companies ranging from Amazon to AT&amp;T are putting APIs to work across business operations, and are something you increasingly see in governments as well, with APIs available for the city of San Francisco, New York, the White House, and across government of all shapes and sizes.
<p dir="ltr">If you buy a product online, stream the latest movie, pay health insurance, send money online, or pay your taxes--it is likely your transaction used one or many APIs to make it happen, exposing the unit of currency for the API economy. This new API driven economy provides a digital transaction format that can be used in any business, any industry, anywhere in the world, via any Internet connected device.
<p dir="ltr">APIs are not just the latest high tech product, they are the next evolution of the Internet. In 1995 companies were trying to decide whether or not they needed a website, and by 2000, having a website became critical for almost all aspects of business. In 2010 companies were trying to decide whether or not they needed an API, and in 2015, having an API is becoming critical to doing business in the rapidly expanding API economy.

title: 'Looking At API Design, Deployment, And Management From A Form Point Of View'

<p><a href="https://form.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/form-io/formio-logo-full.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>The concept of a form, is one one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphs</a>, that have taken on an entirely new life on the Internet. The concept of a form is baked into HTML, PDFs, and many other commons aspects of our digital lives, while also still dominating many of the information exchanges in our physical worlds. There are a handful of APIs out there that let you build forms, and their are APIs that let you build forms for platforms like Drupal, but I have yet to see a platform that uses the concept of a form, as carrot to design, deploy, and manage your API--until now.&nbsp;
<p><a href="https://form.io/">I was introduced to Form.io at Gluecon this year</a>, and was very please with the demo I was given (and my time playing with since). Form.io is a platform that enables developers to build web and mobile applications using a drag &amp; drop interface which allows you to create both the forms and the RESTful APIs all at once. I like this concept, because forms is something the average business user will potentially understand, and is something that has helped them also better understand web, PDF, and other digital platforms--whcih tells me it might do the same for the world of APIs.
<p>Form.io lets users craft their resources, from a forms point of view, allowing you to construct using common elements like email, password, address block, as well as being able to define the custom elements you will need. This is important because it is shifting API design to begin from the standpoint of how it will gathered or put to use, rather than just the system resource it came from like a database. This approach, in my opinion, has the potential to bring API design, closer to the people who are trying to solve everyday problems.
<p><a href="https://form.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/form-io/form-io-builder.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a>
<p>Once you have crafted your forms, and the underlying resources, Form.io gives you the ability to publish <a href="https://angularjs.org/">an application front-end as an AngularJS driven Single Page Application (SPA)</a>, which will be a whole other aspect that I will write about in coming weeks. Using Form.io, you end up with simple, embeddable forms you can publish anywhere, and a complete API that you can easily integrate with other systems, or web, and mobile applications.&nbsp;
<p>I am putting Form.io into the category of meaningful approaches to API design, deployment, and management for the masses, like <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">APISpark for building APIs from common file and data sources</a>, or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono for scraping web data, and publishing as simple API</a>. I also feel it will <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">move the API conversation forward significantly with mainstream business users like Blockspring is doing</a>, because like spreadsheets, users just get forms.&nbsp;
<p>You will hear more about Form.io from me in coming months. The platform is in beta right now, but will be announcing a wider release soon. I am also helping them work through their thoughts about how they deliver their services in the cloud, on-premise, and their overall business model and service level agreements. I am eager to support services like Form.io because while they help move the API discussion forward, they do it in a way that supports the average business user, not just developers, and the API elite.

<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/">I am working to craft complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack</a>, and what better place to start than with the APIs that I actually use on a daily basis. I am working hard to make sure all the APIs for my own <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master API stack</a> are as complete as possible, but taking inventory of the public APIs that I depend on also makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/the-apis-i-depend-on-to-run-api-evangelist/">I've long kept a list of APIs that I use, for IT purposes</a>, but I don't have a complete profile of all of these services. As with any vendo, I should have a complete profile of the APIs I depend on, with relevant support channels, documentation, code samples, monitors, and some of the other essentials I track on for other APIs in the space.
<p>This is all a work in progress, <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">that is published as its own Github Pages hosted API Evangelist research project</a>, but here are the 30+ APIs I have on my list:

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-tools.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
<p>As part of my monitoring of the API space, I keep track of new posts on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a>, and occasionally I come across an API integration project. Some of the times it references it as an API project, while most of the time it will just reference the platform being used, like a Magento Commerce project, or a Youtube project.
<p>As I was reviewing a couple of interesting projects this week, I was thinking it would be nice to have a more modern, simpler version of CodeProject, but exclusively dedicated to APIs. The site could provide regular walk-through of API <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">integration</a>, <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a>, or <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a> patterns. The site wouldn't have to do that many projects, just a couple a month would be fine to begin with, increasing the volume after things get going.&nbsp;
<p>Another important feature would be the ability browse project by API provider, so you could find all the Twitter how-tos, or the Instagram how-to. The site would use Github to host each how-to, providing a simple, forkable way for API projects to submitting for inclusion by the community, while also empowering the audience to take each how-to-project with them.
<p>I would totally love to do this idea, but I need another project like I need a hold in my head (any new ones). I would surely support anyone who setup a site like this, provide how-to, and help get the word out about it. ;-) I think you could easily monetize by getting paid to do how-to for specific APIs, and within specific business uses cases and industries.&nbsp;
<p>Alighty, idea share, back to work.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-notification.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/22/apimatic-adds-new-api-validation-endpoint-to-their-api-client-code-generation-api-stack/">I wrote a story yesterday about APIMATIC releasing a new API validation API to compliment their existing API client code generation API</a>. I received an email from the APIMATIC team is how I found out about the API, but as I'm processing that story, and thoughts around what I'd like to see for <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API Changelog</a> (something Paul of <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockSpring">@BlockSpring</a> brought up), I'm lefting thinking about how antiquated our whole world of API discovery is.
<p>As soon as APIMATIC updated their API Blueprint file, all who use APIMATIC, and us API pundits (clowns) in the space should, should receive a push notification. This type of notification is exactly what API Changelog does, but it does it based upon a document diff, rather than finer grain, machine readable detail like what is available in a Swagger or API Blueprint definition. This is something I know they are working on changing, using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Using APIs.json, companies like APIMATIC can publish a machine readable index of API operations in a "known location", aka the root of their domain--in this case, it would be at http://apimatic.io/apis.json. This index lists all of the APIs, and their supporting elements, in a machine readable way, that companies like API Changelog could parse, and provide notification to API consumers, and the pundits like me--providing us with fine grain notifications like, change to existing API, addition of new API, or changes to parameters, data model, etc.
<p>I know API Changelog is working on all of this, but I wanted to recount, to keep the topic fresh in my head, and also acknowledge that one of the problems in all of this, is the initial discovery. API Changelog is good at tracking on known or existing APIs, but how do you find new APIs? This is a very manual process, but when you can just introduce a list of URLs, and look for APIs.json--the API discovery game will improve significantly.&nbsp;
<p>When any service like API Changelog, or even API Science, or APIMATIC finds a new APIs.json file, they are immediately made aware of vital metadata about API operations like the name, description, tags, and contact info, but also are given access to other machine readable building blocks like Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, which give us even deeper insight into API operations.&nbsp;
<p>Someday, I will just get a simple notification via my API design workspace (aka IDE), via email, Twitter, or maybe even Github, that a new API exists, for the companies I already track on, as well as any knew companies I may be interested in learning about--of course these new APIs will fit some definition of what I look for not just in API design, but also other aspects of operation like licensing, pricing, and what SDKs are available.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/04/what-do-i-mean-when-i-say-apis-are-just-the-next-step-in-the-evolution-of-the-web/">I wrote about the Global Change Information System (GCIS) API earlier this year, and how they what they are doing with their API design represent how APIs are the next step in the evolution of the web</a>. If you have the time, go look at what they have done, it is mind-blowing. I am on their email newsletter, and have had their latest update in my inbox for a few days, with some thoughts attached to it I wanted to blog about, before I archived the email.
<p>I love that they provide updates like this via email, but ultimately this story is about how they are iterating on their API design, making it much more useful, and powerful along the way&mdash;with some elements I&rsquo;d like to see spread across other content and document based APIs. Maybe I should backup, and clarify what GCIS does. The platform <em>&ldquo;use identifiers and semantic information to provide points of reference and traceability&rdquo;</em> across the research from 13 US federal agencies, that researchers, citizen scientists, application developers or information theorists can put to work for them.
<p>With their latest release, GCIS provide a very approach to the relationship between publications and its references, enabling some interesting ways of getting at the information contained within publications. First, with any publication you can append /reference to any publication in the API, and receive a list of any references for the publication. For me, where things start getting cool, is that you can then also apply the same to a specific chapter in the publication, or even down to a particular figure.
<p>This is something I&rsquo;m trying to establish in a coherent way in my own systems. I&rsquo;m looking to apply this line of thinking beyond just references, and also make it work for specific companies, tooling, and what I consider to be common building blocks for each area of the API space I track on. Keeping an eye on projects like GCIS make my research such a valuable are of my operations, allowing me to learn from the companies, organizations, and government agencies that I monitor, and apply best practices across them to my own projects.
<p>In my opinion there are two parts to this story: 1) The API design lessons around what GCIS team is doing by providing publication level references via their API (in JSON and YAML), while also breaking it down to chapter and figure levels, and 2) the fact that they communicate the story to their community via the email newsletter--personally I&rsquo;d also like to see more blogging, and tweeting about it as well, but I&rsquo;m happy just to get what I get.
<p>The more I learn from the API space, the more I realize how much my own API design abilities need to improve.

<p>I am <a href="http://restlet.com/summer-of-apis/">partnering with the Restlet team to put on a Summer of APIs, a virtual API challenge</a>. The goal with this summer program isn't to build apps on top of APIs, but build APIs that anyone can use, by crunching some valuable information resource, and make it easier to use in web and mobile, as well as potentially in embeddable tools, and even in spreadsheets--using APIs.
<p>I've gathered up some valuable sources of data, ranging from industry datasets from Data.gov in Washington DC to data sets that can help us with the water crisis out in California, which is included in detail about the program. I did a little homework for you, but dont' feel like you have to stop there, you can make any data, content, or other digital resource into an API during the Summer of APIs.
<p>With the summer of APIs we want bring awareness to the API design, deployment, and management tools that <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a> brings to the table, but we also want to increase the number of valuable APis out there, and potentially make a bigger impact. You'd be surprised how the right access to election data could shift an election, or the availability of health inspection data could save lives--so put some thought into the change you'd like to see.
<p>The Summer of APIs is not just for developers. Using Restlets API Spark platform, just about anyone can design, deploy, and manage APIs--without knowing how to program. All you need is a healthy curiosity about how to work with data, and make the time to learn the API Spark interface which walks you through everything you'll need to import the data, develop the APIs, and manage them. It doesn't hurt to have some coding expertise, but not a requirement.
<p><a href="http://restlet.com/summer-of-apis/">Head over to the Restlet Summer of Code website for all the details</a>. If you need ideas for projects, feel free to tweet at me (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>)--I have lots of ideas to share! I look forward to reviewing your projects this fall, and see the valuable APIs you bring to the table. Thanks for getting involved, and working to make change through APIs with Restlet and API Evangelist.

<p>I am working hard to <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">establish a complete set of APIs for my own API stack</a> which includes establishing complete Swagger definitions for the 25 APIs that I personally operate. These Swagger definitions are then used to generate <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">Postman Collections</a>, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a>. I am also <a href="http://theapistack.com/">working hard to establish complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack</a>, something I am partnering with <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> on.&nbsp;
<p>As part of this work, both teams are working hard to evolve our tooling for working with, and validating API definitions. I mentioned a couple weeks back, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">when I shared client SDK research conducted by APIMATIC,</a> that quality SDK generation is kind of the high water mark for measuring API definition completion--meaning if your API definition isn't complete enough to generate a functional SDK, you need to spend more time in your API design editor, until it is more complete.
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">As I've been working to establish my own definition of what a complete Swagger definition is</a>, APIMATIC has been hard at work doing the same, but applying to&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery. Also at the same time <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">I'm building my questions API to help me automate the validation of Swagger definitions</a>, <a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io/#reference/api-description-validation">APIMATIC has been working on their own validation API, which they just added to their existing API client code generation API</a>.
<p><a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io">If you are generating machine readable API definitions in&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, or Google Discovery, then you should be validating your API designs using APIMATIC.</a> Once you know your API definitions are solid, then you should also generate all your SDKs with APIMATIC too--I am only about 20% the way through doing this for my API Stack.&nbsp;
<p>Nice work <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. I predict by the end of the year we will have a full stack of APIs, and tooling, that helps us through almost every step of the API definition driven, API lifecycle.&nbsp;
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>They just added Node.js and Go SDKs to their stack this week!</em>
<p><em><strong>P.S.S. </strong>APIMATIC is using Apiary.io.<br /></em>

<p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-cherry.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I create a lot of machine readable API definitions for the 1000 companies I monitor as part of my API Stack</a>. I am using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> to define all of my APIs, providing me with a simple, yet powerful way to profile each of the APIs I'm working to understand better. If you aren't familiar with Swagger, it provides a handful of fields you can use to fill out the metadata profile for APIs, like title, description, etc., but where it really gets powerful is when you put the paths collection to work, outline the details of each endpoint.
<p>Most of the APIs I come across that are defined using Swagger, focuses on providing details on each path, including verbs, headers, parameters, and sometimes response status codes. When looking for the benefits of Swagger, many stop here. With basic metadata, and details about the paths, <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">you can launch interactive documentation using Swagger UI</a>--which is how about 80% of folks are using the API specification format.
<p>When it comes to Swagger, my own motivations are all about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, so when crafting Swagger files for the APIs I track on, I can easily call it quits after defining the basic meta information, and path details, but all of this ignores some of the exremely valuable aspect of using Swagger--with the definitions collection.
<p>Using the Swagger definitions collection you can quantify the underlying data model across API operations, providing a machine readable profile of the XML and JSON that will be part of each API request and response. Once you have the underlying data model defined, including each parameter, description, and type, you can then link to each path and / or parameter, where the data model is being put to use as part of the request or response.&nbsp;
<p>Swagger definition collections are not a requirement for Swagger UI, or for API discovery currently, but if you want to generate high quality server side code, or client SDKs, you will need a complete set of definitions present. The problem is, this is a shitload of work, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/twitter/twitter-api-swagger.json">as I face the Swagger definition for Twitter</a>, I'm looking at many hours of work if I want to ensure that Twitter's Swagger file has all of its underlying data model present, understanding why many people stop short of a complete Swagger spec.
<p>In the end, the Swagger definition collections is really the cherry on top of each API I am profiling, highlighting the maturity of a particular API definition, demonstrating that you can do more with a machine readable definition, than just discovery, and documentation.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/charles-proxy-to-swagger.png" alt="Charles Proxy to Swagger" width="250" align="right" />
<p>Making sure the Swagger files I craft possess a complete definition for its underlying data model, one that is linked to each API path, and parameters where it is put to use, is important to me, but damn it is a lot of work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/the-swagger-definitions-collection-is-the-cherry-on-top-of-each-api-that-i-profile/">As I mentioned in my last piece</a> I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/twitter/twitter-api-swagger.json">the Twitter Swagger file</a>, and my head starts spinning thinking about how much work it will be to hand-define all of the data models that used across the almost 100 Twitter endpoints.
<p>I quickly got to work finding a better solution--I landed on <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">I had downloaded and installed Charles Proxy to better understand how we could map out the dark layer of the API universe</a>, that the popular mobile applications we use depend on. When running, Charles proxies all the requests and responses my desktop apps, and browsers make on my local Macbook. I can also route my iPhone and iPad through the proxy, when I want to also record my mobile app usage. This is perfect for helping me map out the public APIs in my API Stack work!
<p>When the Charles Proxy is running, it saves an XML summary export to my local Dropbox folder, which then gets synced to the cloud via the Dropbox API. I am now working on a script that will keep an eye on my Dropbox folder, and process any new Charles export files it finds. As I process each file, I'm cherry picking from the domains of specific companies that I'm tracking on, pulling out the request and response information I need to craft a Swagger definition.&nbsp;
<p>To generate the traffic I need, I just load up any API I'm looking to profile in <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, and started working my way through the list of endpoints, until I've covered the entire surface area of any API. I find it is easy to generate a beginning Swagger definition, which includes the host, base uRL, endpoints, and parameters, then load it into Postman, and let Charles proxy complete the rest of the Swagger definition collection, and link each one to any path or parameter it is referenced by. I will be running checks on request details, to make sure I haven't forgotten about any endpoints, and parameters, but my goal is primarily around polishing the definition collection, with an endpoint linkage.
<p>I will not rely on these Swagger definitions generated from the Charles proxy. I will be queuing them up in a Github repo(s), and syncing them existing, often hand-crafted Swagger definitions I'm already evolving. Hopefully this process will help me automate the profiling of popular public APIs, and enable me to crank through more APIs this summer, as part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack research</a>.
<p>All of this is working out well. My need to automate the defining of underlying data models, reminded me of the dark API work I was already doing with Charles Proxy--something I will spend more time on this summer. I am looking to generate a Swagger definition for each of the desktop apps I use on my MacBook, and the mobile apps I use on my iDevices--stay tuned!

---

<p><a href="http://codenvy-api-101.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-codenvy-menu.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I am playing around with making several stops along the API life cycle more accessible, and machine readable using APIs.json. To help me in my work, I am using&nbsp;<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">my own API stack</a>&nbsp;as a proving ground, resulting in the&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">addition of Postman Collections</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a> over the last couple weeks. As I'm working through the 25 APIs I have, and almost 350 endpoints, making sure the Swagger definitions are complete,&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/08/my-api-service-composition-tiers/">the latest evolution of my API management service composition is applied</a>, APIMATIC SDKs up to date, and API Science monitors are setup, I stumbled across another critical stop along the life cycle--the IDE.
<p><a href="http://codenvy.com">I use Codenvy for my IDE</a>. It allows me to easily manage my numerous APIs, and applications that depend on my APIs, in a single cloud based development environment. The definitions for my API stack, both front and back-end lives on Github, but I use Codenvy work spaces to manage each repo, the runners to design, develop, and test out my APIs, and apps, at various stops along the life cycle. As I was doing my work, I saw how non-linear the life cycle ultimately could be, and how the IDE is a window for several stops I am concerned with along it.
<p>While I am using Codenvy to design, develop, and deploy my own APIs, I am also using to evolve my own educational API integration projects. As part of this work,&nbsp;<a href="http://codenvy-api-101.apievangelist.com/">I am currently developing what I consider an API 101 stack of APIs, a common set of APIs, anyone who is just getting started with API integration would want to learn about</a>--I am starting with the classics:
<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Twilio</li>
<li>Sendgrid&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I would consider these APIs to be messaging 101, and a good place to start for anyone looking to learn about APIs. While I am building this single <a href="http://codenvy-api-101.apievangelist.com/">general API 101 project</a>, I am looking to craft a number of these, and I don't want to have to do heavy lifting with each project,&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">so I'm standardizing how I define my projects using APIs.json</a>. Out of <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">my central API API (directory of APIs I track on)</a>, I am able to generate APIs.json files,&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com">which I use in my API Stack work</a>, something that allows me to also aggregate APIs together into collections, or as I prefer to call them, "API menus".
<p>Each API menu is meant to provide an aggregate view of all the APIs I wish to present as part of a project, and Github along with Codenvy allows me to turn an aggregate "API menu" into an API integration starter project--one that is forkable and sharable. So, back to my API 101 project, I am using APIs.json to aggregate Twitter, Twilio, and Sendgrid into a single project, which I am using as a map to all aspects of API integration across these very separate APIs.&nbsp;
<p>I am starting with the essential links, like to each portal, pricing, blog, Twitter, and Github pages. At this point, each project is just an aggregate API directory page, I want it to be more, so I am using APIs.json + Swagger to localize a handful of the important building blocks of any API integration process, such as:
<p><a href="https://codenvy.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/codenvy/codenvy-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation -&nbsp;</strong>Provide aggregate API documentation using Swagger UI, allowing developers to explore all APIs as they learn about them. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/documentation/">I have done this across all 25 of my APIs, something that needs some performance tuning, but provides a worthwhile aggregate API documentation experience</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development Kits -</strong>&nbsp;Using APIMATIC + SDKs.io I will be localizing relevant SDKs for each API, so if the project is a PHP project, I will include a copy of the PHP SDK.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring -</strong>&nbsp;Bring in monitoring data for APIs that I include in the project using API Science. I can setup monitors, and using their API I can regularly pull data, and publish to drive JavaScript visualizations that are part of each project--keeping developers up to date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually I'd like to bring in other essential elements of API integration, like load testing, security, and other things developers will need, but I needed to start somewhere. I think I will tackle more user friendly items like an API walk-through for developers, and adding in more APIs, before I branch out into actually offering different services. My goal is to have a set of 101 projects that anyone can fork, and use to learn how to get started with API integration, in PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js. If I can make sure the projects are APIs.json driven, I can use the open format to provide the&nbsp; backbone for each developers IDE project, in a way that keeps them connected, and in sync with any API changes.
<p>I am sorry this post is so long, and a little rambling, but as I do with all of my work, I'm just trying to make sense of this, and bring some coherence to my work. I see the IDE playing several roles throughout the API lifecycle, from API discovery, to design, and development for the API provider, to potentially a starting point for API consumers to start their own projects, and as critical window throughout their own application development life cycle.&nbsp;
<p>Right now I am using Codenvy to manage the discovery, design, and development of my own internal APIs, but I also intend on using it as a sort of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">devops version of my API broker visions</a>, where I can easily assemble aggregate views of multiple APIs that can be used to develop a meaningful applications. Imagine assembling all the APIs that will be needed to develop a HIPAA compliant healthcare apps, or to bringing together the stack of valuable API resources a data journalist will need to be successful. My goal is to not just bring together the meta data for multiple APIs into one place, I want to localize documentation, SDKs, monitors, and other critical aspects of API operations as well.
<p>Lots more thoughts to work through, thanks for reading.

title: 'Initial Thoughts Around Monetization For An API Deployment Service'
image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-dollar-sign.png

<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-dollar-sign.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p class="p1">I am helping a client work through their monetization strategy for an API deployment service. To help me give me a starting point for the work, I wanted to take a look at a handful of existing service providers, that may not be a perfect match, but somewhat in the same realm--<a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment</a>.&nbsp;
<p class="p1">For this phase of the work, I looked at six&nbsp;<a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API deployment providers</a>, who in my opinion have a pretty straightforward, modern approach to crafting, publishing, and sharing their pricing. It always amazes me how hard it can be to just find a companies pricing, let alone make sense of it...but I digress, that is another story.
<p class="p1">Here are the API deployment providers I reviewed:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">API Spark</a></strong>, with 5 pricing tiers, broken down by concurrent connection (based upon IP address), number of APIs, the entity and file storage across APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.apitite.net/pricing">APItite</a></strong>, width 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs, API calls, data transfers, data storage (by row), whether the API is public / unlisted / private, and support</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.instantapi.co/#pricing">InstantAPI</a></strong>, with 1 pricing tier, with incremental add-ons to get more API call volume, broken down just by the number of API calls, with an option to pay for custom domain.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://sheetlabs.com/#/pricing">Sheetlabs</a></strong>, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by storage, number of queries, spreadsheets, APIs, and users.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://orchestrate.io/#pricing">Orchestrate</a></strong>, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs calls and applications, with options for Service Level Agreement (SLA) and support as well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://algorithmia.com/pricing">Algorithmia</a></strong>, with 2 pricing tiers, broken down by an equal ratio of credits to API calls. You get 10K credits for free, and can purchase more at 10K per $1.00.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I think these six provide a good test sample to kick of my research. Most of the other API deployment providers didn't have a straightforward pricing model, were open source, or just didn't seem like a good fit. &nbsp;As I looked through these companies approaches to monetization, I see two of the three hard costs of each provider covered:
<ul>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<p>The only one not present is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"compute"</span>, but in my experience this is usually applied across the other pricing variables, as it is harder to calculate. After the hard costs, some of the obvious elements of API monetization are present:
<ul>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>API Calls</li>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Applications</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most common elements of API service provider pricing, providing tangible things that users will understand. There were also two additional elements I found, that I would consider less than common, but interesting enough to include:
<ul>
<li>Connections</li>
<li>Data Storage by Row</li>
</ul>
<p>The "connections "concept introduced by Restlet's APISpark platform is an interesting way to try and quantity the compute used by each API consumer. There were also three other I guess, kind of value-add aspects that were included in pricing packages:
<ul>
<li>Support</li>
<li>SLA</li>
<li>Public / Private</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the number of APIs, API calls, users, apps, and connections are all just ways for carving up the third hard cost of "compute"--with some profit built in of course. It all gives me a great framework to think about what is important when it comes to crafting a monetization strategy, like the hard costs of compute, storage, and bandwidth, but also provides the tangible elements that potential customers will likely understand, such as the number of APIs, API calls, users, and apps.&nbsp;
<p>Ultimately, I am a fan of simple, tiered API pricing, providing a free, $9.99, 19.99, $49.99, $99.99, and onward--kind of like with Restlet's APISpark. Each package should be assembled from all the moving parts identified, both hard costs, and perceived costs that the end-users will get &nbsp;like storage, bandwidth, APIs, API cals, users, apps, etc. In my opinion, each tier should allow purchasing of additional units as needed, as well as being able to scale up and down the plan each month.&nbsp;
<p>Each of the providers listed above had a "contact us" or "enterprise" option for pricing. This is an area I'd like to see more transparency around what partnership opportunities there are, as well as potential reseller possibilities--I see no reason why some developers can't achieve credits for bringing in other business. I see the partner and reseller layer of any API, as the key to platform success, in a way that can also become a external marketing vehicle for the ecosystem.
<p>Alrighty. That gives me a good amount of information to the prime the pump around the conversation with my client, as well as help build a foundation for how I can approach future <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/index.html">API monetization</a> strategy discussions. I will incorporate this into my <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">api-pricing strategy</a>, where i am trying to define a machine readable format that can be indexed as part of any APIs, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json index</a>. I am happy with this as a start, to what I see as a continuing conversation about not just strategies for API monetization, but also API service provider monetization.&nbsp;

<p>I use <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> for publishing of my white papers, and I also keep an eye on what they are up to as part of my API monitoring--<a href="https://gumroad.com/api">they have a pretty useful publishing API</a>. During <a href="http://api.report/2015/06/15/weekly-apireport-for-june-15th-2015/">my weekly API.Report this last wee</a>k I came across their&nbsp;<a href="https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab">Gumroad Small Product Lab</a>, a cool idea that I'd like to see happen in more API ecosystems, or maybe even across them.&nbsp;
<p>According to Gumroad the the Small Product Lab is a <em>"mini course, community, launchpad, and contest to remove the unknowns and barriers to getting your work out in the world"</em>--Ten days, ten actionable lessons:
<p><a href="https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/gumroad/gumroad-small-product-labs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: Mark your calendars</li>
<li>Day 2: What&rsquo;s your product?</li>
<li>Day 3: Plan it</li>
<li>Day 4: Create a style guide</li>
<li>Day 5: Ready, set, go!</li>
<li>Day 6: Share your process and progress</li>
<li>Day 7: Decoding the pricing puzzle</li>
<li>Day 8: Package it up</li>
<li>Day 9: Prep for launch</li>
<li>Day 10: The launch and onward</li>
</ul>
<p>Gumroad is focusing on their customer base (media publishing), but the format is something I'd love to see occur in API ecosystems, helping developers and API consumers put API resources to work for them. It seems like something API providers could do quarterly, monthly, or some other relevant schedule, that would really help API consumers be more successful.&nbsp;
<p>The idea of a Small Product Lab, also seems like something that be done across APIs, help API consumers put multiple APIs to work, in the name of a single objective. This kind of approach seems in line with a lot of the micro service, and micro app discussions I am seeing going on across the landscape--when you learn to tackle projects / products in smaller chunks, the chances for success go up (failure hurts less too). Lots of good lessons to be learned along the way!
<p>Anyways, just shedding light on what is going on in the space, and putting the seeds for other ideas out there. I do not have the time to tackle such a project, but will definitely be here to support API providers who do small product labs within their ecosystems, as well as anyone who wanted to step up and do at a larger level. I am also going to consider adding it to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my master list of API management building blocks</a>.

<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-science-monitors.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I've long advocated that an <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/">API Status page</a>&nbsp;should be&nbsp;a required building block for any API operation. As I work on monitoring for my own <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master API stack</a>, and as I read stories like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/06/pingometer-keeps-your-uptime-in-the-9s-with-twilio-sms.html">Pingometer Keeps Your Uptime In The 9&rsquo;s With Twilio SMS</a>, I'm thinking we need more that just a simple status report for our APIs.
<p>From an API provider standpoint, we should have a more nuanced view of our API availability, beyond just up or down--something popular API integration service providers like <a href="https://runscope.com">Runscope</a> and <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a> have been saying for a while. If our APIs are publicly available, I'm going to even suggest providers start actively sharing their API monitoring strategy, and resulting data with the ecosystem--something I'm going to also be <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">advocating for inclusion in the APIs.json index</a>.
<p>From an API consumer standpoint, you are going to want a real-time awareness about the availability of all the APIs you depend on, and much like the provider standpoint, this view needs to be more nuanced than just whether a service is up or down. Developers need to be making tactical, run-time decisions based upon API monitoring, as well as be able to make longer term strategic decisions about which APIs they depend on, based upon API monitoring exhaust.&nbsp;
<p>I like Twilio's style for showcasing <a href="https://pingometer.com/">Pingometer</a> as a solution. I'm thinking every API provider should cozy up with an API monitoring service provider for their own needs, while also establishing an approach they can also share with their API consumers, to meet their needs as well. I'm currently adding API Science and Runscope as default building blocks for my API Stack, something you will find indexed as part of each of my services APIs.json file.
<p>I'm working to coherently separate out the benefits API service providers like API Science and Runscope bring to the table for both API providers, and API consumers, in a way that is also in alignment with a common set of building blocks, that everyone involved can benefit from, throughout the API life-cycle.

title: 'Add SDKs.io URL For Companies And APIs That I Track On Via The API Stack'

---

<p><a href="https://sdks.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/sdks-io/sdks-io-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I am partnering with <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> to help establish a common set of complete, and validated API definitions for the almost <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">1000 APIs I track on as part of my API Stack</a>. I am using my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/question/">Questions API</a> to identify what work is needed to be done, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">by asking basic questions about companies, via their APIs.json definition, resulting in quick tasks I can accomplish that help us achieve our goals.</a>
<p>A portion of this work, involves making sure that the APIs in my stack are also linked to their <a href="https://sdks.io/">SDKs.io</a> profile. If an API in my stack doesn't have an SDKs.io icon, I know that I either need to search and find it in SDKs.io, or I need to publish a copy of the Swagger definitions I have to APIMATIC, and publish it to SDKs.io--then record the default SDKs.io page in my system, and republish. #hakunamatata
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/sdks-io/sdks-sio-api-stack-icon.png" alt="" align="middle" />
<p>Right now you will only find a handful of SDKs.io on the main listing(AngelList, Google, Eventbrite). I am just declaring that I will be doing this as part of the process moving forward. So keep an eye out for the SDKs.io icon, because it means that SDKs.io is in sync with the API Stack (or shortly will be). <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">For all of my own internal APIs I will be actually generating SDKs using APIMATIC</a>--for the APIs I profile as part of my API Stack work, I'll just make sure things are in sync with SDKs.io.
<p>Another problem you'll notice in this work, is the company vs. API aspect--meaning that some companies have the SDKs.io icon as one of its resource links, while some have it on the API itself. Look at AngelList and Google to see what I mean. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/13/you-gotta-keep-em-separated-breaking-down-apis-into-smaller-swagger-files/">This reflects the micro aspect to API definitions I've talked about before</a>. It is common to look at a single API for each company, but through this work, I am trying to distill it down to the smallest possible unit of valuable possible--maybe eventually separate SDKs for each API, plus one for entire company?? What do you think Adeel and Zeeshan?
<p>I like having SDKs.io profile as a default building block for the APIs I track on. It provides me an incentive for ensuring there is as complete of a machine readable API definition for the API as I possibly can. The presence of an SDKs.io profile does not mean the Swagger definition is complete, I have other ways for certifying that, but when the SDKs.io icon is present I know that an API is further along in the process, and closer to being an API that anyone can quickly integrate with.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">I have been working hard to establish some sort of minimum viable definition for a complete Swagger definition is</a>, and I think I finally have got to a point where I have it--at least enough to work through the next 100 or so APIs I'm targeting for completion.&nbsp;
<p>I originally identified almost 30 separate questions specifically targeting Swagger, but for my minimum viable definition I've isolated it to just 19. I automated asking of these questions, using <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/question/">my Questions API</a>, and to test things out I applied it to my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">API API</a>:

<p>In theory, I can run this on any <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> file, and it will return answers for any API that has a valid Swagger file present. My goal is to provide me with a quick action todo list for <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">any API in my API Stac</a>k.
<p>Now I want some sort of way to certify that all these questions were asked, import the Swagger into Postman, or some other tool and actually execute a real call against each endpoint. I'm still evaluating how to record this information somewhere, so it can be verified at any time, but anyone.&nbsp;
<p>Anyways, I have about 50 APis targeted for completion, using my new Questions API. <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/swagger.html">I even created a simple little widget to ask the questions of each API, something I will automate as soon as possible, and build into my API stack</a>.

<p>I have been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized API stacks</a> for a while now, slowly evolving my own view of whats next for the world of APIs, based upon what I'm seeing happen across the sector. I am working hard to convert my own <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master stack of APIs</a>, in 25+ separate container driven APIs, which I can then orchestrate into other collections for my own use, as well as the needs of my partners, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale API</a> clients.&nbsp;
<p>The post&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.dreamfactory.com/running-dreamfactory-as-a-docker-container">Running DreamFactory as a Docker Containers</a> came across my monitors this weekend, which for me is a sign we are getting closer to a version of the API economy that I think will actually scale. The days where you launch one API platform, with one or many APIs, and you only sell that service via a single platform domain, have peaked. The technology, business, and politics of your API operations will have to be flexible enough to be deployed anywhere, by any partner you wish to give access, in a way that maximizes the same innovation we've seen popularize the API movement.
<p>As John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) of <a href="https://www.runscope.com">Runscope</a> says: <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">Containers will do for APIs, what API have done for businesses over the last 15 years</a>.
<p>In 2015 all your APIs need to be modular, and containerized using common approaches like Docker, alowing your API infrastructure to be deploy-able anywhere, anytime. H<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">opefully by now you have your API management and service composition house in order, and the business of your APIs can also scale to meet this new, containerized landscape</a>. If you are worried about discovery in all of this, you better start talking to me about <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and making sure you use a common API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>&nbsp;across all of your APIs.
<p>Just like the early API providers like SalesForce, Amazon, and Twilio were able to out-innovate, and out-maneuver their business competitors using APIs in the last decade, <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/">companies who can containerize the approach to their API deployment and management like DreamFactory brings to the table</a>, will realize entirely new levels of agility, and flexibility--in a time when you really, really, really need any competitive advantage you can to stay relevant.

<p>As I work to chase an elusive answer to the question, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">what is a complete API Swagger definition</a>, I'm also faced with what I know John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>)&nbsp;would agree is the age old question, what exactly constitutes an API? Is it the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter API</a>, or is it the Twitter account, status, friends, media, etc. APIs? While this has been a tough question, facing anyone who considers API discovery, I think it is a question that is evolving as part of the current microservices conversation.&nbsp;
<p>One layer of the microservices onion is focused on breaking down services into their smallest possible unit of value (at least this is one of my takeaways). Doing this is an enabler all the other orchestration, devops, voodoo magic that represent the other architectural layers of the microservices onion. As I work to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">define Swagger definitions for the almost 1000+ companies in my API Stack</a>, I'm working to employ this line of thought, and actively breaking down each API I profile, into the smallest unit possible, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>.
<p>An example of this in the wild, is with the messaging API from <a href="http://www.tigertext.com/">TigerText</a>, which could easily be a single API Swagger definition called <a href="http://www.tigertext.com/tigerconnect/">TigerConnect API</a>, but after breaking things down I'm left with six separate Swagger files:
<table border="0" width="100%">

<p>Ultimately this is more work for me, but from an API discovery perspective, I'm looking to identify the small, most unique unit of value possible, which allows me to discovery, and organize APIs into extremely precise, yet powerful <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API menus</span>. Right now this is a very manual process, but I'm developing tooling that will help me to "explode" existing Swagger definitions based upon unique API paths--we will see how that goes.
<p>Now I can evaluate TigerText's approach to user APIs, or metadata APIs, without wading through the actual messaging side of the coin. I am not in the business of creating at database of APIs, where my metric is number of APIs--my objective is a database of high quality APIs, where my metric is number of companies, with complete API definitions for resources they provide, and as complete profile of overall API operations as possible.&nbsp;
<p>We'll see how I feel about this after doing another 500 APIs (I've done almost 500 so far) :-) My tune may change, but I'm hoping to have more tooling that helps me throughout the process. I will never be able to fully automate the creation, or fine tuning of API definitions, but I feel I can automate certain aspects--greasing the gears.

<p>I am working through each of <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">my 25 APIs</a> right now, tackling a list of changes that include some adjustment for an&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/08/my-api-service-composition-tiers/">evolution in my service composition</a>, generating <a href="https://www.postman.com/docs/collections">Postman collections</a>, <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">API Science monitors</a>--for each API. I was talking through the process of setting up my API monitors, and how I will be <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/">generating status pages for each API portal,</a>&nbsp;with John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), and he reminded me of the&nbsp;<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/HAR/Overview.html">HTTP Archive (HAR) format</a>.&nbsp;
<p>HAR is all about providing an archival format for HTTP transactions that can be used by a web browser to export detailed performance data about web pages it loads, which got me thinking about how we can use the existing format to record and quantify the exhaust from our increasing API activity. There are some areas of the HAR specification that wouldn't apply to this, but for the most part, it provides an existing format for collecting, evaluating, and potentially understanding the value we generate (or not) via our APIs in real-time.
<p>As I work through each of the stops along my API lifecycles (Postman Collections, SDKs, monitors, etc), I'm working to make sure the input and output from the stop is indexed as part of the APIs.json collection. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">In short, you will be able to find the Postman Collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors via the APIs.json index for each of my 25 APIs. </a>Right now APIMATIC SDKs and API Science monitors just link to HTML pages for getting at details, but eventually I am looking to make this detail machine readable as well--this is why John and I started discussing HAR.
<p>To help me wrap my head around possiblities, I wanted to elevate myself and look at the the role HAR could play in the index of my APIs, and potentially the wider industries that I am building <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> collections for. As I look at the core of each of my APIs, Swagger very much represents the value that is possible with each of my APIs, while I see each Postman Collection as a unit of this value that is ready to be executed as a transaction, and HAR has the potential to be the evidence thta this value transaction actually occurred.&nbsp;
<p>The introduction of HAR into my APIs.json index provides an import linkage for me, in preparing each API for the API economy. Steve Willmott's and mines objective with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json is to index APIs</a>, preparing them for a more run-time engagement in the API economy, acknowledging we need a full machine readable picutre of what an API resource delivers, ranging from the what that API does, to the cost and licensing of that resources. API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> provide an important way to quantify this value pre-transaction, Postman Collections provide the snapshot right at integration or client execution, and HAR could be used a record that this transaction occurred--think of this a trillion times over, in the context of a global API economy.
<p>I will keep working through these thoughts, but I see API economy level potential here, and <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com">even opportunities for evolving the patent process for at least the digital side of the patent equation</a>. Meaning, when you file a patent, diagrams aren't enough in the API economy, you need an API definition showing what is possible, a Postman Colleciton demonstrating it can be run, and a HAR file from a certified provider like API Science, as a timestamp showing that this value was demonstrated on this date and time.&nbsp;
<p>Ok, enough geeking out on that, back to preparing for&nbsp;<a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">my Internet of Things talk at API Days San Francisco this week.</a>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-journey.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>As I work to create <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Swagger API definitions for the almost 1000 companies in my API stack</a>, I'm chasing an elusive definition of a complete Swagger definition for any API. Only a small portion of APIs I am defining using Swagger will reach an 80-90% completions status, in reality most will never be complete for reasons that are totally out of my control.
<p>When it comes to crafting API definitions for public APIs, I may be able to get the API definition complete in the sense that it has all the paths, parameters, responses, definitions, and security configurations, but if the API itself is missing pieces--the API definition will always be incomplete (in perpetuity).
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">As I work to automate the questions I ask of Swagger definitions</a>, helping me get to a more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">coherent definition of what is a complete Swagger definition</a>, I can't help feel the need to offer API design tips to the API providers I am profiling. Honestly I have never considered myself a high quality API designer, I've been more business than tech, but I can't help pointing out the obvious stuff.&nbsp;
<p>I am still using my API definition tooling for my own goals around defining <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, but because I'm building it all as APIs, I intend to open it up to others for analyzing their own API definitions, determining how complete they are, and potentially offering up tips on what could be done to improve them. A kind of self-service, API design tip API, that helps with some of the most common elements that are missing from API designs.
<p>In 2015, API definitions are opening up a buffet of services that are courting API providers ranging from mocking and deployment, to monitoring and security. I don't see why API definitions couldn't also allow for professional API designers to help API providers evolve their APIs in a more constructive ways, from the outside-in. Using Swagger or API Blueprint, professional designers could easily provide suggestions for existing API providers and their designs, then give them potential suggestions that they could use in their API design road-map.
<p>Anyhoo, food for thought!

<p>When I started API Evangelist, I knew I didn't want to use WordPress or other common CMS, so I developed my own API, and page and blogging CMS. During the latest migration of my internal API infrastructure, I'm rebuilding everything as a <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">single stack of APIs</a> that I &nbsp;can use to operate API Evangelist. Part of this process is breaking down legacy systems, into the small possible unit of value, something I consider deeply as I rebuild each API.
<p>It started with my link system, which I broke up into <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/link/">link</a>, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/curated/">curation</a>, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/keyword/">keyword</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/linkrot/">linkrot</a> APIs. Now I'm eyeballing my legacy blog API, which historically I also use to publish news pieces to <a href="http://api.report">API.Report,</a> and sections that I syndicate to white papers I have published. My goal with my blogging API is to get it down to its simplest possible functionality--publishing posts to my blogs.
<p>With this in mind I forked my newer <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog API</a>, and labeled it my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/news/">news API</a>. Right now, my news API behaves very similar to my blog, but it already has new features like automated pulling of press releases, extraction of proper nouns, and a few other bells and whistles that make my news management workflow as painless as possible. Over time I may share some of the features with the blogging API, I think my news and analysis worlds will remain separate beasts, from here forward.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-internet-desktop.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I was recently reading about&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/05/11/google-moves-its-corporate-applications-to-the-internet/">Google moving its corporate applications to the Internet</a>, and as my brain works, began applying this ine of thinking to the world APIs. I am big advocate for companies being more transparent, and acknowledging that more and more of our ever day business occurs on the open Internet, and we should start treating it like we are.
<p>I think one statement in the Google paper says it well:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The new model &mdash; called the BeyondCorp initiative &mdash; assumes that the internal network is as dangerous as the Internet.&nbsp;</em>
<p>As the Internet penetrates more of our personal and business lives, the concept of a private, localized, and secure network, is fading. Even if a system is only accessible via a local area network, if any node on that network has Internet access, and delivers resources to web, mobile, and increasingly devices via DNS--it is operating on the open Internet.
<p>I am not saying that we need to put all our private information out on the open Internet, but I know too many organizations who feel pretty confident in their security through obscurity strategies, and that if things are kept hidden, and lightly secured, you are fine. Inversely they also claim that if you push directories of infrastructure out on the web, that you are just giving a map to the bad guys. This all just feels way out of balance to me.
<p>Ultimately I feel like an API first approach for all digital resources is the way to go. Acknowledging that all of these resources will use the open Internet as a transport, and require all systems, web applications, mobile applications, and devices to use the same API--proving a single surface area that a company can secure. With it being publicly available, but secured properly using a sound identity and access management approach, companies can easily bring in external service providers to audit and help secure.
<p>I am not selling this concept as a holy grail, but I wanted to point out that other large companies are thinking along the same lines, and I am looking to plant the seeds that maybe your current belief in the privacy and security of your internal networks isn't as solid as you think. We are seeing more security breaches in recent months, and I think in 2015 we need to start having a more honest conversations about how we operate our infrastructure.&nbsp;

<p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-mapper/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/cloud-elements-element-mapper.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I have had <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> under my <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API aggregation research</a> for some time now, keeping an eye on what they are up to via their <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/blog/">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudElements">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cloud-elements">Github</a> accounts. Cloud Elements takes a handful of top API driven platforms, which they organize into their <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/elements-catalog/">Elements Catalog</a>, aggregating them into a single API driven platform.
<p>API aggregation is something I've been a big supporter of, and API reciprocity as with companies like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, is something I feel compliments how we operate on the open Internet. Today, <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-mapper/">Cloud Elements made an interesting move forward with the ability to map new elements</a>, <a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/home.jsp#DocumentationElementsPanel">via an API</a>, which in my book moves them more into API reciprocity space, than it does aggregation--meaning you could in theory launch a specialized Zapier, using Cloud Elements.&nbsp;
<p>One additional thing that Cloud Elements does that I think is significant, is they aggregate API driven platforms (elements) into meaningful buckets like documents, messaging, CRM, social, and finance. Things that actually mean something to end users. With the Element Mapper, you now map to any API driven resource you need, all via the API, to solve precise business solutions, for specific business groups.
<p>Zapier has an API, but it focuses on the creation of new channels, and opening the potential for recipe development. What I like about Cloud Elements is they bring in the organizational aspect of it all as well, helping you establish some order. Establishing a stack of the APIs you depend on for your business, while organizing them in a meaningful and coherent way--all via an API. #Wining
<p>It makes me happy to see a provider like Cloud Elements doing what they do. I've seen a lot of aggregation and interoperability API service providers come and go (Yahoo Pipes, cough cough!!) I like the approach Cloud Elements is taking. They are paying it forward in my opinion, meaning they are building value on top of existing APIs, using a wide variety of publicly available APIs, while also allowing API access to everything you can do with their Cloud Elements platform.
<p>I will make time to play with Cloud Elements more, and compare it with some of my more manual approaches to API aggregation, and reciprocity. I actually can picture what Cloud Elements is doing becoming a very common model for how IT operates on the open Internet in the near future.

<p>I am currently trying to move forward the&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">917 companies, from 223 business areas, with a total 882 APIs catalogued, and 407 Swagger definitions created</a>, while working on a distributed way to understand where the profiling for each company is, and how far along the underlying Swagger definitions is. <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">I had kicked off another prototype APIs.json type a few months back I'm calling api-questions to handle just this</a>, in a way that allows me to ask human readable questions about APis, while also storing in a distributed, machine readable format that can be indexed via each APIs.json file.
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/a-walk-through-a-swagger-api-definition-to-identify-the-moving-parts/">The other evening I publishd a walk through of a Swagger file</a>. I wanted to create a simple walkthrough for my readers, but my primary goal was to break down the moving parts of a Swagger file, and try to quantity what elements <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">I would need before I could call a Swagger definition "complete"</a>.

<p>Much of this I could easily do with the JSON schema for Swagger, but I'm working on some more nuance to it, something eventually I'd like to evolve into an API design guide. Right now, I'm just trying to establish how complete any Swagger definition is programmatically, and queue up the API definitions that need work.&nbsp;
<p>I've created a <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/">simple API for management of my API related questions</a>, then I created <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=https://kin-lane.github.io/api/apis.json&amp;questions=46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73">another API for asking these questions of specific Swagger files</a>. However if you want to use this API, you need an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> index for your APIs, which all of mine in the API stack do--then it will spider any indexed Swagger files, and do its best to answer the 25+ questions above, and return specific answers.&nbsp;
<p>The results are far from perfect, but it is a start. I will be making the questions more precise, and adding new questions. I hope to get more intelligent with things like status code recommendations, and linkage between the API paths and underlying data models. My goal is to have a real-time way of telling how complete my Swagger files are, and where the work is that needs to be done--as I am doing the work.
<p>I'm sure the definition of exactly what is a complete Swagger definition is will continue to evolve, always resulting in a human having the final vote, but for now I will just keep defining, until I find the right balance between programmatic, and the human touch.

<p>I am slowly getting my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">new API stack</a> in order, where I am close to opening it up for access to a wider audience. As part of this last round of work, I'm fine tuning my service composition strategy a little more. If you aren't familiar with API service composition, it is just about creating different levels of access to your APIs, and using my <a href="https://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a> I can easily break this down.
<p>The most common approach to API service composition you see out there is public and private, with maybe an additional partner tier. I'm taking a slightly different approach to defining my layers, and so far, her is what I have:
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong> - The completely open layer to my APIs that doesn't require any keys at all, like my website, but JSON.</li>
<li><strong>Retail</strong> - The retail storefront to my API operations that anyone can sign up for, and begin consuming my resources.</li>
<li><strong>Trusted</strong> - Same access to resources as my retail layer, but given higher rates of access to be able to make more calls.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale</strong> - APIs from my stack, but running in someone elses infrastructure, alongside their own APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - Access to almost all of my APIs, giving higher levels of responsibility for my partners in crime.</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong> - The highest level access, giving my systems and applications the ability to get the resources they need.</li>
<li><strong>Personal</strong> - A private access level, giving me a layer across all my systems that is only for me to access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of my API consumers will begin as a retail user, and either stay there, or evolve into one of the other tiers. In the end I can custom tailor access to any of my users, and their applications, but I prefer establish specific layers for users to exist in--giving me clear security groups, that are also in alignment with my business goals.
<p>My service composition approach will most likely stay staty static for a while now, as I play with a credit system that I can use for accessing different resourcs. Right now all APIs use the same unit of value for each API call, something I want to change. I am looking to develop a metering system that puts my 3Scale infrastructure to use, allowing me to maximize the value of each individual APIs.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round-certified.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>As I go through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">the research from APIMATIC regarding automatically generating client code using Swagger</a>, and I prepare to crank out Swagger definitions for almost <a href="http://theapistack.com/">1000 companies in the API Stack</a>, one big question I face is, what exactly is a complete Swagger definition?
<p>An incomplete Swagger definition does you little good. I've gotten away with just mapping out some API endpoints, verbs, and parameters, to add another dimension to my API monitoring, but without authentication details, status codes, and the underlying data model, you can't do much else that is meaningful with them--as the APIMATIC research demonstrates. We need to start refining not just a definition about what is complete, but tooling and services that can help us get to complete as fast as we can, and automate the certification of any API, using Swagger.
<p>I extracted version definition of what is a complete Swagger definition from APIMATIC's research that I recently wrote about:
<ul>
<li>Valid JSON</li>
<li>Correct BaseURIs</li>
<li>Authentication Information</li>
<li>Endpoints</li>
<li>Verbs</li>
<li>Parameters</li>
<li>Schemas</li>
<li>Satus Codes</li>
<li>Data Models</li>
</ul>
<p>I would add that the basic elements of a Swagger specification, while maybe not critical to generating SDKs, are important to discovery, and other aspects of API operations.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Tags</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I would say there is always the human element:
<ul>
<li><strong>API Designer Review </strong>- Sign-off from an API designer who compared the API definition to the actual API, while also rounding off any missing elements, and just giving the API design the love it needs.</li>
<li><strong>API Provider Review -</strong> Sign-off from the actual API provider. This will not be possible for all APIs, but having this is definitely a major score for the overall completion score.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I guess we also need some sort of code level validation an API is complete. I guess this can be done manually during the human API design review, but ideally it would be something a little automated, and potentially generating some output from an API monitoring service provider like <a href="https://runscope.com">Runscope</a> or <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a>--some sort of recent, timestamped output from an actual call that was made to each of the endpoints in a Swagger definition.
<p>Next up, to actually create a walk though of each of the moving parts of a Swagger definition, and create 5-10 Swagger definition that I'd consider to be be 100% complete--something that I'm sure will evolve through the process. If you have additional thoughts on what is a complete Swagger definition, or an example of a Swagger definition, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
<ul>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://apimatic.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I have met with the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC team</a> several times over the last couple weeks to discuss the state of API definitions. If you aren't familiar with <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC, they are a API code as a service provider</a>, that generates high quality client code in several languages, if your APIs are defined using common API definition formats like Swagger (they are also the people behind <a href="http://sdks.io">SDKs.io</a>).&nbsp;APIMATIC is as passionate about high quality Swagger definitions as I am, and have shared some really valuable research to help push forward the API definition conversation.
<p>In May, APIMATIC wanted to compare the quality of automatic code generation tools, using common Swagger specifications they found on Github. To set the bar for their research, APIMATIC established some basic operational parameters:
<ul>
<li>Code generator must support Swagger file format</li>
<li>Only client-side bindings are considered</li>
<li>Must create complete libraries rather than just code snippets</li>
<li>Only the following languages are considered: C#, Java / Android, Objective-C, PHP, Python Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>While this research focuses on Swagger, I think the findings can be applied when thinking about other API definition formats like API Blueprint or RAML, but kicking things off with a focus on Swagger is wise.  With a basic framework defined, APIMATIC picked four of the leading code generation tools out there currently:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Swagger CodeGen</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://restunited.com">REST United</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the decision to look at Swagger CodeGen, REST United, Restlet Studio, and their own APIMATIC solution, they provide a little detail on the code generation engines behind each solution:
<ul>
<li>Swagger.io is the official host for open source Swagger CodeGen project</li>
<li>REST United uses a customized version of Swagger CodeGen project and performs better than the official branch</li>
<li>Restlet Studio uses Swagger CodeGen for Objective-C, but has its own CodeGen engine for Android and Java</li>
<li>APIMATIC has its own CodeGen engine for all languages</li>
</ul>
<p>They took a sampling of Swagger specifications out of the thousands they found, and did a side by side comparison of how well each of the platforms did with the Swagger definitions, bringing us to the meat of this research, which as APIMATIC states &ldquo;successful compilation does not mean that the SDK will work out of the box!&rdquo;. In short, there are a lot of things to consider when generating code, and APIMATIC helps us see the problems with approaches to code generation, as well as the overall quality of Swagger definitions that are available out there.
<p>Embarrassingly two of the Swagger definitions they used were mine, which I acknowledge are often very incomplete, but they did use others well, including the sample Petstore definition used as demo for Swagger. The message is pretty loud -- the quality of Swagger definitions right now is pretty poor, and while APIMATIC goes a long way to ensure a usable client SDK is generated, they can only do so much with crap Swagger definitions.
<p>&nbsp;APIMATIC looks at some of the tops reasons why the code generated is so bad, resulting in code that often times just will not work:
<ul>
<li>Missing Authentication Info</li>
<li>Swagger.IO and Restlet Studio do not generate authentication code, even when auth info is available</li>
<li>APIMATIC and REST United support OAuth 1 &amp; 2, Basic Auth, and Custom Headers/Parameters</li>
<li>Missing Schemas/Model definitions</li>
<li>All except APIMATIC use &ldquo;void&rdquo; return type when schemas are missing, meaning all responses are ignored, and no data is returned</li>
</ul>
<p>As they put it, here is APIMATIC&rsquo;s struggle: <em>"SDK&rsquo;s should work out of the box!&nbsp;Generated code often does not work out of the box, AND to make matter even worse, its not even easy to fix by hand.&nbsp;APIMATIC has implemented fallbacks to handle missing schemas and model definitions, but missing auth info cannot be fixed by any fallback measure."</em>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>After you separate the differences in approaches by each code generation engine, it really comes down to a handful of reasons why the Swagger definitions are incomplete--something I see a lot of, as I look for Swagger definitions across the space:
<ul>
<li>Invalid JSON</li>
<li>Missing BaseURIs</li>
<li>Missing Authentication Information</li>
<li>Missing Endpoint OperationIds/NickNames</li>
<li>Missing Schemas/Models</li>
<li>Missing Error Codes/Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the common problems I suffer from with many of my own Swagger definitions, as well as many I discover across the Internet. In my opinion, a complete Swagger definition is more art than tech, and you need the human who really cares about an API to hand finish it. I have many Swagger definitions that are complete, well as complete as the API is, but many I have for public APIs in my API Stack directory, are a work in progress.
<p>APIMATIC also provides three interesting proposal for enhancing Swagger definitions so we can automatically generate more robust code in the future:
<ul>
<li>Support for Streaming API</li>
<li>Support for WebHooks</li>
<li>Support for Error Models, not just Error Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is just good API design, the other two are more about additions to the Swagger specification. APIMATIC also provides us with a look at the future, if we get our collective Swagger together, we can realize some serious benefits that will help us throughout the API life cycle:
<ul>
<li>Naming conventions</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Namespaces and packaging</li>
<li>High readability and general formatting</li>
<li>Code comments</li>
<li>Identify redundant and unreachable code</li>
<li>Generate IDE support (Visual Studio, XCode, Android Studio, Eclipse)</li>
<li>Enabled IDE type-hinting (ie. PyCharm, Ruby Mine, Netbeans)</li>
</ul>
<p>I see APIMATIC as just one of many emerging API service providers who live along a Swagger driven API life cycle, but I feel they are one of the most important barometers we have, that we can use to understand the overall health of the Swagger ecosystem. If you can&rsquo;t generate working client code from your Swagger, it is likely you won&rsquo;t be able to mock, test, monitor, or achieve other critical stops along the API life cycle.
<p>Of course, I would be neglectful if I didn&rsquo;t mention that the&nbsp;APIMATIC team is obviously biased, as their motivation is to sell their services. This is true, but APIMATIC is the only player to emerge in the code generation game that I&rsquo;ve seen actually provide a high quality perspective and solution to the problem of client code generation. Look at what they offer:
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Interface -</strong> Easy to use interface for managing code generation.</li>
<li><strong>API -</strong> APIMATIC&rsquo;s CGaaS is available as an API.</li>
<li><strong>Multi Definitions - </strong>Accepts API Description (Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IO Docs, Google Discovery)</li>
<li><strong>Widgets -</strong> Maintain your API description, and the widget provides fresh SDKs where you need.</li>
<li><strong>APIMATIC On-Prem - </strong>Available as a universal Linux binary - Provides simple locally hosted API.</li>
<li><strong>SmartBear Ready! API Plugin - </strong>Generates SDKs from inside Ready! API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also known Adeel and Zeeshan, and know they truly care about the health and quality of the API ecosystem, as well as looking to sell the valuable services they bring to the table with APIMATIC and SDKs.io. There is a lot of valuable insights to work with in the research they have started, something I will be contributing to in the future. I will let you review the slide deck from their research below, but I also wanted to point out two addition slides that I thought were interesting.
<p><strong>Statistics for Sources of API Descriptions (Where They Found Definitions)</strong>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-api-definition-research-location.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" />
<p><strong>Statistics for API Descriptions Located (What Format The Definitions Were)</strong>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-api-definition-research-type.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" />
<p>There are two things interesting here, what formats are available, and where are people putting them. I&rsquo;m focused heavily on supporting Swagger and API Blueprint, and often find that discovery and indexing of these definitions is very difficult. I can find definitions on Github fairly easy, but finding them on the open Internet is proving to be more challenging, and resource intensive&mdash;something I will be working with the APIMATIC team on more as well.
<p>The moral of this story is that the Swagger definitions we are creating need to be more complete, and I think it points to the fact that we need more services and tooling to help us validate the completeness of our definitions, something I will also be working with the APIMATIC team on. We need a community driven way to share these API definitions, and as a community to help validate and certify API definitions, and also help complete them when necessary.
<p>I will work with APIMATIC to conduct this research on a regular basis, and is something we are both committed to improving on. In future posts, I&rsquo;ll talk about the work we are doing between APIMATIC, SDKs.io, and my API Stack research, which will provide opportunities for the community to get involved&mdash;so stay tuned.

<p>I recently added a new tool to my hacker storytelling toolbox, that allows me to easily assemble walk through, that help me guide my readers through a scripted series of steps around any of my research areas. <a href="http://api-portal.apievangelist.com/">I first did it to walk through what I'd consider to be my minimum viable developer portal</a>, and now I decided to <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">apply to my Swagger research</a>.
<p>I am working on a set of APIs that help me quantify whether a Swagger definition is "complete" or not, to help me tackle my goals around <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack research</a>, and establish a rich set of complete, open API definitions that the community can put to use. What better way to quantify all the moving parts of Swagger, than to actually create a 101 walk through of its moving parts.&nbsp;
<p><a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/walk-through.html">I added the Swagger walk through to my Swagger research</a>, and will keep refining, and adding more information to it. I've managed to further evolve my definition of what constitutes a complete Swagger definition, allowing me to work towards a somewhat automated, API driven service that will help me understand how complete each Swagger definition in my API stack is, and where the work is that needs to be done.&nbsp;
<p>The goal here is to get <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">all the APIs for 900+ companies in my API Stack fully defined using APIs.json and Swagger</a>, while also establishing a pretty robust set of tools and services for certifying Swagger definitions. If you want to get involved, there is a lot of work to be done, just visit the API Stack, and get involved via the Github repo.

<p><a href="https://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and I have been working hard to craft <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files for the top public APIs out there, including machine readable Swagger definitions, ever since <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">we launched the open source API search engine APIs.io</a>. We will keep working to define, and index the API space, but it is a lot of work ahead, and we could use some help.
<p>Over the last couple months I've had several conversations with folks about the need for <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprints</a> for popular APIs, so that the community can build valuable tooling and services on top of commonly used APIs. Two companies who I've been talking to are&nbsp;<a href="http://apimatic.io">SDK generation service APIMATIC</a>, and <a href="https://blockspring.com">API spreadsheet integration provider BlockSpring</a>.
<p>APIMATC wants see better quality Swagger definitions emerge, so they can build client SDKs that work, and make available via <a href="http://sdks.io">SKDs.io</a>. BlockSpring wants to be able to integrate popular API content, data, and functionality into Google Spreadsheets, using their slick plugin. These are just two examples of services that are emerging to deliver much needed functionality on top of APIs -- if we can establish a rich, open, machine readable repository of API definitions, it will open up the flood gates for even more API tooling and services. #win
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">I've added some new information to the API Stack to support this effort</a>. So far <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">I have&nbsp;917 companies, in 223 areas, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions.</a> I want all 917 companies to have all their APIs fully defined using APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprint by the end of the summer, as well as any important companies that are not listed. It is a lofty goal, but I think with some help, we can do it.
<p>As a working group, we have several challenges, that we are hoping to work out in real-time via the <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">API Stack Github repository</a>. First we have to actually do the heavy lifting of generating APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprints, but we also have to also define a process for what is considered a "complete API definition"--I'll be working through these thoughts separately.
<p>Now that I am done traveling, I will be dedicating a considerable amount of time to this work in June. If you want to get involved, <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">please participate via the API Stack site and Github repository</a>, or feel free to ping me directly. We need all the help we can get, and are looking to have a robust repository of high quality API definitions for 1000+ of the top APIs available today.

<p>Darrel Miller(<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) reminded me of the <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">desktop development platform Electron</a> the other day, with his story on <a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/moving-beyond-the-browser-with-javascript-and-hypermedia">Moving Beyond the Browser with JavaScript and Hypermedia</a>. I had been eyeballing Electron as a potential candidate for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my perfect API design editor</a>, something I honestly don't have the bandwidth to build, but is something I enjoy pushing forward in thought.
<p>If you aren't familiar with <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, it is what powers popular desktop version of the apps that I use most--Github, and Slack. The open source desktop framework, developed and maintained Github, allows you to deliver simple, easy to maintain desktop experiences, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--powered by Chromium and Node.js. Electron is appealing to me because it allows me to use the tech that I am most fluent in, to deliver high quality desktop apps, but also as Darrel mentions in his story, it has the potential to improve on the quality of JavaScript apps we build--giving us C grade JavaScript people a framework to live within. ;-)
<p>I have a pretty clear vision in my head of the API design editor that I would like to see developed. I doubt this will be something I will have the time to develop personally, but I would like to encourage others to develop API design editors using Electron, and encourage a focus on it being extensible, allowing 3rd party, API driven API design features to be added--keeping the editor simple, with almost every feature living as an extension.
<p>I think the API workflow and life-cycle will be different for each API provider, and we need to be able to have the features that we need most, right at our fingertips. <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Through my profiling of 917 companies, in 223 business sectors, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions so far, I intend to provide API design tips and dictionary functionality based upon popular / successful API designs</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Anyways, back the actual work at hand. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">I just wanted to revive these visions of my perfect API design editor</a>, so I can add to, and make sure it is connected with the potential for developing the next killer API design editor, using Electron.

<p><a href="https://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/one-night-at-kachka-eater.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>Helping people understand the potential you see around a particular approach to API design, is hard stuff. Providing easy to follow stories, and implementations that the average person can follow is something I've dedicated myself to at API Evangelist, and something I'll keep working on when it comes to evolving API approaches like hypermedia.&nbsp;
<p>Hypermedia has long suffered from an image problem, something I feel can be remedied through a little hacker storytelling on the part of hypermedia API media type owners, API providers who bake hypermedia into their practices, and the developers who are crafting meaningful hypermedia driven experiences. In 2015 I feel like we are getting closer to fixing this, but as I said, this stuff is hard, and takes a lot of work.
<p>Until there are easy to follow stories, and examples of hypermedia in practice, only us in the know are going to care. I see a lot of potential ideas for hypermedia hacker storytelling in my head, but getting these out into stories, and into practice takes a lot of work, and massaging of ideas. One idea that was just moved forward for me, was derived from a post <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">Audrey</a> sent to me today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka">a story from Eater, called One Night Kachka</a>.
<p>This approach to storytelling, provides me with a potential blueprint for evolving how I can tell stories using hypermedia APIs, and Single Page Apps (SPA). The Kachka story is full of rich structured data and content, providing a compelling timeline breakdown of a nights activity at a restaurant. There are so many interesting objects here that could be defined and woven together with a hypermedia core--then simply presented via a hypermedia client (aka Single Page App).&nbsp;
<p>Additionally you could generate an administrative SPA, allowing a user to be walked through the process of telling a story, adding the timeline elements, people, pictures, videos, and data around sales and activity--then point user towards the SPA client that allows them to explore the interactive story they just told. This represents an evolution in storytelling around hypermedia for me, where I move from talking about "clients" to talking about a more tangible storytelling SPA, that potentially a wider audience might be able to follow.
<p>What is really beautiful about this model, is an API designer who was skilled in a hypermedia approach like&nbsp;<a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collections+JSON</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>&nbsp;could craft a core that could drive this restaurant experience, but also be flexible enough to tell other similar stories like one night at the club, concert, or maybe just Christmas eve at home with the family. With the SPA client approach, you could easily provide some amazing CSS implementations, <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">using a CSS Zen Garden approach</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Food for thought!<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/a-good-example-of-hypermedia-api-using-the-siren-specification/"> I am just now playing with Siren, in redesigning how I tell the story around my API news curation</a>, but once I get my chops up with Siren, HAL, and Collecton+JSON, I may take a crack at assembling a hypermedia core for an API that could drive stories like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka">One Night Kachka</a>.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/27/a-cleaner-simpler-example-of-api-to-spa/">I wrote about a simpler example of API to SPA the other day, continuing my journey for apps, services, and tooling that easily deploys a Single Page App (SPA) or light-weight web and mobile clients from a single API, or many APIs</a>. One of the reason I am so transparent about my ideas, is because I depend on my audience to help educate me about what is out there--one of my readers, who is always schooling me, pointed me at&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdubray/reacall/src">Project ReaCall</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Jean-Jacques Dubray's (<a href="https://twitter.com/metapgmr">@metapgmr</a>), <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdubray/reacall/src">Project ReaCall</a> combines <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> to make it easier for API providers to develop and evolve API Client SDKs (ACS). This is definitely the direction I'd like to see client SDK and SPA deployment space go. I will have to play with ReaCall more, and I do not have any experience with React.js apps, but it looks pretty easy to bind your API endpoints to specific components in a React.js generated app.
<p>Where this will get even more powerful, is when there are ready to go templates, and starter kits for developer to reverse engineer, and better understand how it works. I see that<a href="http://www.vimoctechnologies.com/">&nbsp;VIMOC Technologies' Landscape-Computing Architecture, and ambient computing API for city infrastructure employes ReaCall for their client deployment</a>. Some more examples, demonstrating common API uses, and real-world client deployments would go a long way in on-boarding people with the approach.
<p><span>The API Evangelist network operates as almost 100 separate Jekyll driven sites / apps (some have more functionality than others), that run on Github Pages. I can easily envision other operators managing hundreds or thousands of sites, sub-sites, web, mobile, and devices based applications that are generated, maintained, and version-ed using the Project ReaCall approach.</span>
<p>I'd also like to play around with defining web, mobile, or device application stacks using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, bringing together many disparate APIs into a single collection, and use ReaCall to deploy the application--essentially using APIs.json as the index for where each of the Swagger definitions exist. Adding this to my to-do list, and we'll see if I can manage to float it to the top of my list this summer.

<p>My first emotion after reading <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/oracle-v-google/google-v-oracle-solicitor-general-brief-may-2015.pdf">the brief filed by the US Solicitor General</a>, is that the federal government's stance is so wrong, antiquated, and shows how behind the curve our government actually is when it comes to the unfolding API economy around us. Then as with each moment in the past, associated with this very important legal case, I become tangled in the web that is politics and intellectual property (IP) law in our country--leaving me confused, betrayed, and embarrassed for the industry that I take pride in being a champion for. It is easy to get caught up in the page view buzz, emotion, and hype of each of these episodes, but in the end I will just keep fighting for open API patterns, and Oracle's damaging stance, and the fact the federal government is a revolving door for industry, really is just par for the course--business as usual.
<p>This is not the first time, nor will it be the last time, that someone who does not understand APIs will be making laws that regulate how things work in industry. What is really frustrating is that this isn't just a single court case, it sets a very dangerous precedent that will impact every business sectors. Think of the role the web plays in our lives in 2015, and how important companies like SalesForce, eBay, Paypal, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Facebook have been to the economy--you just dealt a potentially lethal blow to the next wave of these companies even existing, good job US government. The Solicitor General has no idea of the separation in the API layers, but most of the API industry doesn't see it as well, so why would I be surprised that the government isn't up to speed.
<p>Honestly, I cannot argue this case anymore. I do not believe in the bullshit rhetoric in the defense of IP in a digital age, I'm sorry. I'm overwhelmed making sense of the actual reality of the API space, let alone when framed in the context of what everyone owns, who started something first, who has the legal resources to defend (or attack) -- something that actively works against the interoperability that enables the API economy. I cannot allow myself to get bogged down in the legal quagmire that is copyright and patents, when it comes to APIs. Like many other aspects of our world it isn't about right or wrong, open or proprietary, this is about having the resources to be at the table. Period. I am also looking at you Google. Intellectual property is not a poor man's game, or even a slightly well to do man's game--it is a power that the business giants wield to get what they need done--<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/companies.html">take a look at the companies who have API related patents currently to see who has the power.</a>
<p>In the year since I launched <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> I've come to realize that most of you in the API space would rather keep the design of your API close to your chest, because your VCs told you to, or maybe you think that somehow, someday it will be your golden ticket--forget the larger API community. <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">Similar to the menu sitting on the table at your restaurant, the naming, and order, and design presentation of your API means very different things than you think they do, in reality it is all about the delivery behind this set of instructions, and the overall execution of your platform</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Intellectual property laws exists because the space is full of vultures and zombies, and while it may provide some defense for a handful of artists or companies, in the end it really protects those who know how to, and those who have the resources (and fortitude) to wield it. In this new digital world, success is about the widest people possible audience understanding the naming, order, and design of your APIs, not limiting this! Try to scale your restaurant chain without a menu, or suing everyone who has a menu similar to yours, and we aren't even discussing with the critical nature of interoperability which makes APIs a thing, going well beyond what a restaurant menu does. In a digital age you want EVERYONE understanding and re-using the pattern you have designed is essential, not a negative.
<p>This latest flareup in the Oracle v Google case is just a reminder of the larger disease that is government procurement and our IP system, and the federal government is just responding to the powers who are yanking their chain (follow the $$ behind the affordable care act, for a sampling of this). The US Supreme court hasn't even made their decision, the Solicitor General is only keeping things in line with the wider objectives of the administration. This is how power flows, and people are influenced. Oracle, the White House, and even Google do not understand the wider implications of what they are doing, they are just responding as they do, to get the results their constituents desire (no, not you).
<p>Ok, enough bitching. What do we do? We keep on, keep'n on. If you understand the difference between your API and your API design / definition, take a stance--put into the API Commons. If you feel your API definitions are copyrightable, license it API CC-BY or CC0, if you feel your API design is code, the apply an MIT or Apache license, either way make sure people can reuse as they need. I am not saying copyright and patents should be applied--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am not pro copyright or patent</span>. As I do with much of the API space, I'm just acknowledging the best past forward in the fucked up world we have created for ourselves. The problem with taking this stance, is you still have to have the resources to defend and police whichever position you take. Go ahead and copyright your API design, and patent the API process you deliver, and enjoy defending in court, and policing on the web, rather than actually running your APIs. This is the wonderful API economy we are building for ourselves, a world where us smaller people get to "do", and deliver on meaningful ideas, and the people who have the power will ultimately own the exhaust from all our hard work at some point, either through investment, acquisition, or litigation and regulation--it is inevitable.
<p>I just can't help but think that in this digital age, the copy / paste world we live in now, the only defense we have is&nbsp; doing, and staying ahead through meaningful action and leadership.<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/03/apis-are-establishing-new-and-useful-processes-faster-than-patents-can-keep-pace-with/"> The patent system cannot keep up with the pace of change in the API economy</a>, and copyright has to be viewed very differently, this is why we have Creative Commons, something we desperately need for the patent life cycle. This recent brief filed by the Solicitor General is&nbsp; very misguided and damaging, Oracle is hurting their future business with such a short sighted view of the Java API, and I&nbsp; can't keep defending Google on this, or argue within the schizophrenic realm of intellectual property in a digital age. I will keep an eye on it, and undoubtedly have opinions along the way, but I insist on being a lubricant for the API economy, not spending my time being distracted by concepts of IP.
<p>I'm just going to keep building, doing, and sharing the best API stories and patterns I can find. I hope you do as well.

<p><a href="http://roll.space/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/roll-dice.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>I enjoy playing with simple, meaningful ways of leaning about APIs. <a href="http://roll.space/">The other day, during the regular monitoring of the API space, I came across a simple dice rolling API, which I decide to map out using Swagger</a>. Shortly after I did &nbsp;this, <a href="https://github.com/alps-io/profiles/blob/master/roll-dice-alps.xml">I saw Mike Amundsen post an ALPS representation of the Dice Rolling API. Around the same time</a>, I then imported my Swagger into my Postman client, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5a0cbb906697c4f4b8fc">exported a Postman collection</a>.
<p>Once I had the three formats, I sat back to consider what each of these representations mean to me:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a></strong> - A map of the surface area that is dice rolling.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a></strong> - A single representation of actions that can be taken--now.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://alps.io/">ALPs</a></strong> - A representations of the what it means to roll the dice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am constantly working to evolve how I view the available API formats that are emerging throughout the space. I will be spending more time <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">generating machine readable definitions for APIs in my stack</a>, trying to push these definitions through these valuable filters. I do not think any single approach provides me with a definitive view of the resources I am describing, but at least give me with various lenses to look through, during my journey.
<p>Swagger left me feel like I am mapping out a vast expanse, but alone doesn't do much for me without more tooling to interpret the map. Postman left me feeling like I could do one thing, linked to the surface area I mapped with my Swagger, but was very confined to just that specific instance, within the world I have drawn with Swagger. ALPS left me feeling like I described something meaningful, closer to the actual experience of rolling a dice.&nbsp;
<p>Ultimately I do not see any of the emerging approaches to defining API driven resources as 100% the solution, or in black and white terms as wrong or right. I see Swagger as very much a bridge to a better defined world, while Postman satisfies the more immediate urges that I have, but ALPS...ALPS has the potential to help me internalize, feel, and interact with my digital resources, in a way that is much closer to the real world (not quite, but closer).

<p><a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">One of my areas of research that got boost of energy at Gluecon last week, was the area of Single Page Applications, aka SPAs</a>. SPAs are one huge area of potential growth for the API space, but like many other areas, they haven't seen the wider, more meaningful deployments, or adoption, that I had hoped for early on. I think up until now the definition of what an SPA is has been heavily dominated by the technical side of things, as opposed to the delivery side--SPA are still mostly about providing solutions for developers, over solutions for the end-user or business owner.
<p>When it comes to SPAs, I stay away from the more established frameworks, opting for a simpler design--minimal platform or framework adoption. Not that solutions like <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> don't do amazing things, just at this point in my career, I'm looking to avoid the adoption, and resulting dogma and dependency that can often come from drinking a specific frameworks kool-aid. I guess the overall footprint needs to be small, before I will allow something to creep my day to day operational world.
<p>While at Gluecon, I was given a demo of a new product, which i won't go into detail about now, but I feel moves us closer to the vision than I have in my head. Many of the existing SPAs employ APIs, but I envision a world where you can design, deploy, and manage APIs, which alongside you can also deploy and manage simple, useful SPAs driven by your valuable API resources. I keep an eye on the SPA space, so I can be in tune with anything that emerges--hopefully my stories and research will also stimulate other solutions in the space as well.
<p>To help you understand the potential for APIs in the SPA space, I am talking about deploying a simple, and I mean as simple as you can SPA deployment, using an API that is defined using a machine readable API definition like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="http://apiblueprint.com">API Blueprint</a>. I want to be able to deploy 10s or 100s of mini sites, landing pages, and apps from a single stack of API resources. API providers, and consumers should be able to easily deploy the SPAs they need, driven by the valuable APIs of their choosing, into the infrastructure they desire, like on Github Pages, Heroku, or their own internal infrastructure.&nbsp;
<p>Some day, we will see the cleaner, simple example of an API to SPA solution, that for now, is trapped in my head. Now that I write about this, I would also think of it as a lightweight, API client, which I'd also like to see be hypermedia compliant--man I am a demanding shit. ;-)&nbsp;

<p>Yeah, I know, it is a click-bait title. My goal is to not flame the haters, but educate everyone involved, both the people looking to learn about microservices, and those who are practicing microservices, so I'm hoping you will forgive me--my goal is not page views.
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/on-apis-and-microservices/">I'm sticking to my goal of not making microservices a regular thing I talk about</a>, but I wanted to share some observations after listening to folks talk at Gluecon last week--a week that was full of microservices love (and hate). In the past, I mentioned that I received a handful of emails, and DMS from folks letting me know I'm not doing microservices, and after Gluecon I think I have a beginning list of why I think people generally are telling me I'm doing it wrong.
<ul>
<li><strong>Tooling</strong> - People tend to identify with the tooling they use, and deeply associate the function with the tool. So if I don't use Puppet or Chef, I'm not orchestrating. If your not using Jenkins, your not doing continous delivery, and so on. This is dangerous for microservices storytelling, but also is something that will continue.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor</strong> - This is probably the most egregious reason I see people telling others they are doing microservices wrong, and is somewhat akin to the tooling item, but is really just rooted in selling you something. You will never do it right, unless you are their customer, so don't worry about it.</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong> - You just aren't doing it at the scope someone else is doing it. Microservices is something large enterprises do, not small companies, or individuals. You have to be operating across many availability zones, many servers, etc. Horseshit. Microservices can be done at any scope, don't listen to them.</li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong> - You are only doing some of the aspects of microservices. Maybe you don't need to orchestrate across many operational zones, and your traffic looks very different than some of the usual suspects. Microservices is very seldom a complete picture, it is more about doing what works for you, cherry picking the valuable items you can apply in your world, not any complete definition.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete Info</strong> - Someone just read a single blog post you wrote, and hasn't been following the series, asked any questions, and just make assumptions about a single thing you wrote. While I feel you should make each post as complete as possible, the responsibility is on the reader to do their homework - Bwahahaha! yeah right, pundits will never do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far these are the biggest reasons that I've extracted from people me telling me I am not doing it right. Ultimately it comes down to power and control, which I saw play out with SOA, REST, Linked Data, and other areas of "API". They either want to make you feel small, or not cool because you aren't using the tools they are using, or they just want you to buy their snake oil.&nbsp;
<p>In the end, for me, microservices are just a new storytelling package. They are mostly marketing, as many of the skeptics like to point out, and the companies who are truly doing microservices, will care about sharing their real-world stories, and work overtime to help you understand--there are a handful of them out there, like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> and <a href="http://www.iron.io/">Iron.io</a>.&nbsp;
<p>For me, I will be focusing on the moving parts of microservices, which is why you'll see me talking about API design, deployment, management, testing, monitoring, security over just "microservices" umbrella. I could easily attack many of the pundits who challenge me, and say you aren't doing API management, evangelism, monetization, or other critical areas right, but why would I? Where does that get us?
<p>As usual, if you have any questions, let me know how I can help. I'm happy to share, as I try to make sense of all of this. I'm adding some new research sites to support the conversation.&nbsp;

<p>I am going on five years of API Evangelist this summer, and I've been doing some reflecting about what the next five years will be about. While listening to my friend Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), I had an idea, that I think I will evolve more during the operations of the next five years of API Evangelist (yes, sorry I'm not going anywhere).
<p>First, I want to clarify that when I started API Evangelist in summer of 2010, I spent a lot of time trying to create a logo, resulting in me creating this temporary (5 years) logo, that you have seen on my t-shirts for the last five years.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/t-shirts/api-evangelist.png" alt="" width="525" />
<p>After listening to Mike spin his yarn, I'm convinced that the next wave of growth for API Evangelist has very little to do with me, and my brand, than it does with the rest of the API community. I've spent a lot of time sharing stories, but for us to get to the next level, it has to be about the community sharing its stories, or we will never get to the scale all of us API delusionaries envision.&nbsp;
<p>To support this vision, I'm going to play with a new logo for API Evangelist, and print up a round of t-shirts with this evolution of the logo.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/t-shirts/api-evangelist-next.png" alt="" width="525" />
<p>I know I'll get a lot of flack from the restarfarians, and hypermedia folks about the design, but it is more about the storytelling, than it is about being technical, but in my opinion, they both work in concert. I've often answered, when people ask me what is scale for API Evangelist, that it is about having hundreds of people doing what I do, across many business sectors, around the globe--this new design reflects that.
<p>While this is a marketing effort for my brand, it realyy is about the next phase of growth for the space. To get to that API economy thing we are all showcase across the space, we are going to need API Evangelists to step up and own each sector, region, and country around the globe. API Evangelist isn't something that can scale as a business, it will take people who are passionate to step up in their industries and regions, and help evangelize APIs in a way that isn't about products, but about ideas, stories, and the people and brands who make things go around.
<p>I'll let you know when t-shirts are avaiable, if you'd like to have one let me know, but in exchange you have be the evangelist that is needed in your area--otherwise you will have to wear the reqgular conference schwag you get at conferences and hackathons. ;-)

<p>I look at a lot of API documentation, something that until recently has been pretty static--pun intended. As an API consumer I really appreciate standardized approaches to documenting an API, like using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="http://apiblueprint.com">API Blueprint</a>, but I also really enjoy when people go the extra mile to add little details, that make the experience a little more fun.
<p>A recent example of this is from the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify API team</a>. When it comes to the search endpoint for the Spotify API, they put in this little addition:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>T<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/" target="_blank">he field filter tag:new can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums released in the last two weeks. The field filter tag:hipster can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums with the lowest 10% popularity.</a></em>
<p><em>I love shit like this. It makes the often mundane world of APIs, a lttle more bright. It shows that there is a human beneath the very technical story that is often being told as part of API operatoins.&nbsp;</em>
<p>I don't about you, while I enjoy the self-service nature of APIs, where I don't have to deal with people and sales teams to be able to put a valuable resource to usee--I also enoy knowing there is a human behind the scenes. Especially if it someone who cares enough about an API enough to have fun, and enjoy themselves along the way.

<p>While at Gluecon this week, one of the events I particpated in was the Swagger API Meetup, Tuesday evening. There was a small group of Colorado Bros (TM) there, admittedly there "just for the beers", who asked what is Swagger? Valid question, and something I'm always willing to help onboard folks with. First I made sure they knew what an API was, then simply stated, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"Swagger lets you see the girl in the red dress"</em></span> -- making a Matrix reference, hoping to onboard them with the concept of Swagger, via a familiar movie analogy.&nbsp;
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">As I've spent time hand crafting the Swagger definitions for my 25 APIs, which includes almost 350 endpoints, the surface area of my operations have slowly come into focus</a>. Before this, the only visual assistance I had was via any client UI I crafted on top of my APIs. My APIs are so much more than just the single client I had built for them, but this was the reality I had constructed. Swagger allows me to see my API, beyond just the 0s and 1s flying by on my screen, giving me a reference that helps not just see my own APIs, but also potentially share with others, and have a conversation around what is possible with my APIs.
<p>I'll keep working on this Matrix analogy to help people understand what Swagger is. If nothing else it will just open up a deeper conversation about what APis are, and the Swagger brings to the table. The ironic thing about this, and I know that my friend Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) will agree, is that the girl in the red dress doesn't exist, and in fact API definitons are just a mental crutch, assisting us down a longer road, towards a deeper understanding of how we define our digital self, and the increasingly digital world we live in--I apologize, I get ahead of myself, let me keep with the stories at hand, and not give away future sequels.

<p>I have written many times before <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/this-is-how-you-onboard-with-an-api/">about the right way to onboard with an API</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/how-not-to-onboard-with-your-api-fiber-locator-api/">how not to onboard with an API</a>. I see a lot of APIs, and can tell you which APIs have put thought into the process, and those who haven't. Helping companies smooth out the sharp edges on their API onboarding is something I spend a lot of time doing, so I work hard to make sure the topic shows up regularly in my writing.
<p>Today I want to highlight a slight different onboarding email I received from <a href="http://weather2020.com/">Weather2020</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Hi there Mr. Lane!<br /></em><br /><em>First off I'll get my lil bit of gushing out of the way. &nbsp;I really enjoy what you're doing out there in the world. &nbsp;I love your commitment and passion to the growing world and need for APIs and your focus on the narrative vs. straight technical details. &nbsp;So even if you find some reason to hate what we have going on here just please keep up the great work.<br /></em><br /><em>But now without further delay, I generated a key that grants you an unlimited number of calls. &nbsp;That key is: c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee<br /></em><br /><em>The structure of our API calls are:http://api.weather2020.com/[APIKEY]/[LAT],[LNG]</em><br /><em><br />So a sample functioning call for us here in Kansas City is:<a href="http://api.weather2020.com/c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee/39.099727,-94.578567">http://api.weather2020.com/<em>c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee</em>/39.099727,-94.578567</a></em><br /><em><br />Just because you're obviously just a bit of an enthusiast I'll let you know I have 2 other call structures that deliver the forecast data based on zip codes and city names. &nbsp;I use them strictly for our internal purposes but I've enabled your API key to work with them as well. &nbsp;Just in case you want to play around with them. &nbsp;They're not that super impressive but involved a very different kind of internal data mapping so I'm mildly proud of em.http://api.weather2020.com/zip/<em>c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee</em>/90210http://api.weather2020.com/city/<em>c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee</em>/Portland,OR</em><br /><em><br />I plan to have some documentation at the root API domain very soon ( ie. here: http://api.weather2020.com ) . &nbsp;So hopefully none of the returned data is too much of a mystery. &nbsp;If you have any questions just let me know. &nbsp;Also if you have any feedback whatsoever I'd love to hear it. &nbsp;I can always use some wisdom!</em><br /><em><br />Enjoy!</em>
<p>I do not always read the API signup emails I receive, but I do store them in a folder for later review, and I happen to read this one today. It always makes me happy to receive nice emails from my readers, but the fact that this was also in the form of an API onboarding response--made me smile.
<p>I added a couple random characters to the API key above, so don't worry about the security side of this post. I don't expect everyone to personalize their new developers message like this, but I do think it is helpful to let developers know there is a human behind the self-service registration for any API--it could go a long way.

<p><em>This is a Github issue submission I received, i<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/13/are-you-doing-anything-interesting-with-swagger-or-know-someone-who-is/">n response to whether or not anyone is doing anything interesting with Swagger</a>. In the lead up to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/13/it-will-be-a-busy-week-for-api-industry-next-week-at-gluecon/">talks about Swagger next week at Gluecon, in Colorado.</a> I'm pretty impressed with this work at UCSB, and while I am processing it, I wanted to share with you, and hopefully stimulate others to share what they are working on behind the scenes, using Swagger--<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/swagger/issues">I've gotten some pretty cool submissions so far</a>.</em>
<p>We use Swagger in a series of on going research projects at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/racelab.html" target="_blank">RACELab</a>&nbsp;of UC Santa Barbara. Our research focuses on designing and implementing new mechanisms for governing APIs in cloud platforms. Following are some of our published works that make use of Swagger.
<ul>

<li>

<li><a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/research/tech-reports/2014-08" target="_blank">REST Web Service Maintenance Through API Policy Enforcement</a>&nbsp;-- UCSB Computer Science Tech Report</li>
</ul>
<p>In first two papers, we use Swagger as a mechanism for describing the syntax and semantics of web APIs. The base Swagger standard covers all the crucial syntactic features of the APIs. We extended the base Swagger specification to include some simple axiomatic semantics (API preconditions and postconditions). We use this syntactic and semantic information to measure the similarity between different API alternatives.
<p>In EAGER (Enforced API Governance Engine for REST), we use the base Swagger 1.1 standard to describe all APIs deployed into the cloud. We auto-generate Swagger descriptions from Java (JAXRS) source code at the compile-time using a custom Maven plug-in. Once uploaded to the cloud, we use Swagger descriptions to validate APIs, enforce policies on them and establish the backward compatibility between different versions of the same API. This way we can prevent or warn the API developer when a backward incompatible API change is being rolled out into a production cloud.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/13/it-will-be-a-busy-week-for-api-industry-next-week-at-gluecon/">I am preparing for a big week of discussion around API definitions at Gluecon</a>, and <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">in addition to working on my Swagger research</a>, I kicked off deeper research into <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprin</a>, looking for the companies that are doing interesting things in the space, using the machine readable API definition format.
<p>As i do with all my work,&nbsp;<a href="http://api-blueprint.apievangelist.com/">I have a Github repository setup for the research</a>, allowing me to publish all of my work publicly, and manage feedback and engagement with the community, using my Github workflow. If you want to make any changes to the data you can fork and submit a pull request, or&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-blueprint/issues/new?title=Question%20About%20Your%20API%20Blueprint%20Research&amp;body=">you can also suggest companies I should be looking at, as a Github issu</a>e.
<p>So far, I've broken things into four areas:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-blueprint.apievangelist.com/platform-integrations.html">Platform Integrations</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Companies who are using the API Blueprint specification as part of their platforms--essentially baking it in.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-blueprint.apievangelist.com/external-integrations.html">External Integrations</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Companies and individuals who have integrated API Blueprint into an existing platform, or framework, from the oustide-in.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://api-blueprint.apievangelist.com/tools.html">Tooling</a></strong> - What toolin ghas emerged that puts API Blueprint to work, from documentation, to generating code samples, to IDE integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm working on organizing the tooling that I have found so far, but I figured I'd publish what I have currently, and ask for suggestions about anything that is missing. If you know of a platform that is using API Blueprint, either baked directly in, via an external framework, or are just using <a href="https://apiary.io/">Apiary</a> for its documentation, and management platform --&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-blueprint/issues/new?title=Question%20About%20Your%20API%20Blueprint%20Research&amp;body=">please let me know, by submitting a Github issue</a>.
<p>I know there is a lot more API Blueprint out there, and if you are doing something cool with the API Blueprint specification, there is a good opportunity for it to be included in the discussion next week. If you don't share your story, nobody will know, and there are a huge amount of fence sitters right now when it comes to API definitions--people just waiting, and watching for the right sign to jump in.
<p>I'm going to be writing a lot about API definition formats this week, priming my brain for&nbsp;<a href="http://gluecon.com/">the conversation at Gluecon next week in Colorado</a>. I apologize in advance. ;-) And thanks for sharing your stories!

<p><a href="http://gluecon.com/">I am preparing to head to Colorado next week for Gluecon</a>--one of my can't miss events in the API space. Gluecon is always a great place to be, to discuss the API space with the folks who are leading the charge, but this year is shaping up to be a particularly important one. There are number of things happening this year, primarily focused around API definitions, that stand to have a pretty significant impact on how the space operates.
<p>To help showcase the goings on next week, I wanted to walk through my schedule, which I think speaks for itself. Starting next <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tuesday, May 19th</strong></span>, we have two events:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apistrat.com/2nd-annual-api-strategy-practice-tech-un-workshops-gluecon-2015/">APIStrat, API Definitions, Design, and The API Lifecycle Workshop from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Swagger-API/events/221572540/">Swagger API Meetup from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Then on the afternoon of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wednesday May 20th</strong></span>, I am moderating the API session track on the main stage:
<ul>
<li><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">1:30-1:45 -</span></span>&nbsp;Track introduction, <strong>Kin Lane (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>)</strong></li>
<li><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">1:45-2:15 -</span></span>&nbsp;API Readiness: Visualizing and Virtualizing -- <strong>Lorinda Brandon (<a href="https://twitter.com/lindybrandon">@lindybrandon</a>), <a href="https://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a></strong></li>
<li><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">2:15-2:45 -</span></span>&nbsp;How REST APIs Can Glue All Types of Devices Together -- <strong>Jerome Louvel, (<a href="https://twitter.com/jlouvel">@jlouvel</a>) <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<p>Then after the session <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/29/the-technology-business-and-politics-of-apis-via-a-community-driven-api-life-cycle/">I am doing a keynote on the main stage on the Tech, Business, and Politics of APIs in 2015, where I'll conclude the latest talk I've been doing around where I see the space going, rooted in stories out of the evolution of my own infrastructure</a>. I first gave the talk at 3Scale in Barcelona, continued to evolve for the audience at APIDays Mediterranea, and will conclude with a version of it at Gluecon.
<p>Many of the core people who are working on the Swagger definition will be present at Gluecon, and while much of the conversation will also be about the wider API space, and other API definition formats, there will be some important discussion about the future of Swagger, and what is next for the open API definition format. In addition to the in-person discussion throughout the week, there will be an virtual gathering of the Swagger working group at the end of the week as well.
<p>Another part of the discussion next week will also be around the <a href="http://apisjson.org">API definition format APIs.json</a>, which <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/05/20/announcing-apisjson-at-gluecon-2014/">since we launched the format last year at Gluecon</a>, it make sense to talk about next steps, and some significant additions to the platform that has occurred in recent weeks. APIs.json, bundled with the potential of leading formats like API Blueprint, and Swagger, are delivering a growing number of services, and tooling to almost every step of the API lifecycle in 2015--Gluecon is where we get together to discuss.
<p>If your are applying API definitions to your API lifecycle currently, I strongly urge you to get to Colorado next week for the discussions. I know it is a week away, but getting to Colorado is pretty easy, and this is a conversation you will not want to miss. As usual Gluecon is proving to be where some of the most important conversations occur, in the halls of the Omni Interlocken, and on the stools in the Taproom--we will see you there.

If you don't share your story, nobody will know, and there are a huge amount of fence sitters right now when it comes to Swagger--people just waiting, and watching for the right sign to jump in.
<p>I'm going to be writing a lot about API definition formats this week, priming my brain for <a href="http://gluecon.com/">the conversation at Gluecon next week in Colorado</a>. I apologize in advance. ;-)

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I get hypermedia at a high level, but have no real experience designing or deploying a hypermedia API or client. For the longest time I just watched the hypermedia conversation from afar, but in the last year I have spent time learning about the different approaches, but I still have not gone as deep as I'd like. I'm looking to change this over the summer, and begin to add some hypermedia thinking to my own API design.
<p>To get started I've targeted my curation API for the addition of a hypermedia layer, and I'm choosing <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> as my hypermedia format. Siren spoke to me over some of the other approaches, but once I get my bearings I will look at tackling one or two more implementations. As I do with my other work, I'm just looking to share my thoughts in real-time, as I go along.
<p>First, the process is really helping me tight down my API design. This is something I feel going with an API first design approach using Swagger has helped me, but adding the Siren format to the design of my API is taking this to a whole new level. I still have a longs ways to go in crafting the Siren responses for my curation API, but so far the process of defining the entities, actions, and links is really helping me think through the overall API design--leaving very few loose ends.
<p>Second, the actions and links are also helping me really craft a more meaningful workflow around an API resource that I depend each day. This link curation API that I use in my daily, weekly, and monthly monitoring of the API space has an ever evolving workflow associated with it, but ultimately its been something I've kept in my head, or visualizing in the minmium viable (half-assed) clients I have built to help manage my world. This hypermedia learning process is forcing me to think it through, as if I'm telling the workflow to the world.&nbsp;
<p>This feels very much like storytelling on API Evangelist to me. You see I tell stories to work through my ideas, and craft a nevernding stream of evolving ideas, that help me better understand the world of APis, but also share it in a way that my readers can understand along the way. While applying hypermedia principles to my API design, I feel like I'm working through my API resources in much meaningful ways, and I'm not even approaching what some of the popular benefits of hypermedia are, yet.
<p>I still don't what I am doing entirely, but sure enjoying the process.

<p>I am spending a small amount of time each week, adding a new hypermedia layer to my link curation API. My goal is to better understand hypermedia, while also improving the designs of the APIs that I depend on for my own operations. During todays work, I was looking for a more extensive example of <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> being used by an actual API provider, taking me beyond what Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>) provides in his examples.&nbsp;
<p>The example I found that has really helped me go from 0-60 when it comes to Siren (well maybe more like 0-15), was the <a href="http://developers.wurl.com/">TV and streaming video API platform Wurl</a>. The API has a pretty robust example of Siren being used in the wild, allowing me to reverse engineer the design patterns and apply in my own way--this is one way I learn things, through breaking down other people's work.&nbsp;
<p><a href="http://developers.wurl.com/pages/reference">Wurl has 11 entities defined</a>, demonstrating the really versatile power of Siren in defining the resources an API is serving up. They have some really nice workflows around each video episode, allowing them to be organized into series, bundles, and providing user management and search. For me it is a great introduction into what hypermedia is, and more specifically what Siren offers, in a working, real-world example.
<p>I only have so much bandwidth to spend on this work, but after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">getting my feet wet adding a hypermedia layer link curation API using Siren</a>, and playing with the Wurl API, I've got a lof of new thoughts floating around my head around how I can improve my own API designs, and better present the large amount of information, visualizations, and other information available within my API curation lifecycle.

<p>I had a great conversation with Chris Taggart (<a href="https://twitter.com/countculture">@countculture</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a>, after his keynote at <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">APIDays Berlin / APIDays Europe 2015</a> last week, about how they get the data they need, to make the change they want to see in how we do business globally. Us technologists get excited about the potential around the ingestion of large data files published by companies and governments, and the scraping of data where we can. All of this is definitely be part of the open data lifecycle, but often times the whole open data thing, comes down to the human variable.
<p>Almost every open data project I've embarked on, always has a portion of the process which involves me rolling up my sleeve, and cleaning up, and validating of data--there is just no way around it. Of course I do everything I can to automate the harvesting, mounting, processing, and cleaning up of data, but in the end most of the data I come across is just messy. This is just way things are, and while I'd love to not have to get my hands dirty, it is always a requirement to achieve my goal.
<p>This is why it made me happy to talk through some of OpenCorporates processes with Chris, and learn that they have pretty similar approaches. They can definitely automate the extraction of files, and large of amounts of data, but when it comes to normalizing it, they often have to depend on putting the data into small batches, publishing to Google Spreadsheets, and rely on humans to do the detail work--yes, humans still have a purpose, when it comes to open data!
<p>OpenCorporates tries to do as much of the heavy lifing as they can, but they still require on individuals, with as minimal amount of training as possible, to look at PDFs, HTML docs, and other files, and enter specific values into associated columns, and validate data that has been harvested--these Google Spreadsheets are then imported into the main system, that drives the site, and the OpenCorporates API.&nbsp;
<p>I want to point this our for two reasons, 1) opening up data is hard work, and there is only so much that we can rely on machines to do, and 2) this is a model that I feel we all can apply across other aspects of open data, not just opening up of corporate data. I'd like to see this applied to critical areas of city, county, and state government, and specifically the area of policing. I have ideas on how to federate this approach, something I'll share more when I have the time.
<p>I just wanted to talk about the re-enforcement that I got from Chris, someone with a wealth of experience in the area, that compute ultimately will only gets us so far, and we need will legions of open data enthusiasts who can help make business and government a little more transparent. Are you with me? Let me know if you need an open data project, I have endless amounts.

<p>I was taking a look at a new healthcare API recently, adding it to my stack, for deeper review at a later date. Whenever I add a company to my monitoring and review system, I go through the site to make sure they have some of the characteristics of a modern API. I am not interested in many of the APIs that I come across that are older web services, or just poorly done APIs. I want to make sure APIs have self-service registration, some web API characteristics, code libraries, support, and a minimum viable set of building blocks.
<p><a href="https://validic.com/">The API I was looking at is&nbsp;Validic, which bills itself as a "Digital Health Platform"</a>. I'm coming across a number of new API driven, healthcare platforms, like Validic lately. As I was adding it to my database I noticed the legal section in the footer, which had five elements:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Data Security Policy</li>
<li>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</li>
<li>Support Policy</li>
<li>Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Terms &amp; Conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Three of the five elements, I have as building blocks that I recommend for platforms. I'm taking note of two of the two that I do not have recorded, a data security policy, and support policy. While I think the stakes are a little bitter higher in healthcare, an industry that would require this added level of protection for the platform, developers, and users, I think these building blocks could be something I may include for all API providers.
<p>I think having a support policy sets the bar, for how a platform will support its developers. I also find the data security policy very intriguing, setting the bar for how a platform will secure users data on the platform--something every online platform should step up and do, no matter what industry you are in. As I review the platform more, I will break down these potential new building blocks, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">and add them to my master list</a>.&nbsp;

<p>This is a review of the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">communication API platform CallFire</a>, crafting a snapshot of platform operations, from an external viewpoint, providing the CallFire platform team with a fresh take on their API from the outside-in. The criteria applied in this review is gathered from looking at the API operations across thousands of API providers, and aggregating best practices, into a single, distilled review process.
<p>This review has been commissioned by CallFire, but as anyone who's paid me for a review knows, money doesn't equal a favorable review&mdash;I tell it like I see it. My objective is to help CallFire see their platform through a different sense, as developers might see their platform. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees, and I find the API review is a great way to help API providers see the bigger picture.
<p>I prefer to share my API reviews in a narrative format, walking through each of the important aspect of API management, telling the story of what I see, and what I don't see. Here is the story of what I found while reviewing the communication API platform for CallFire.
<p><strong>Overview<br /></strong>CallFire makes for an easier review than some API operations, because the API is the product. As soon as you land on the homepage of the website, you begin your API journey as a potential API consumer. The first thing you read is "Over 2 Billion Messages Delivered&rdquo;, so you immediately understand what CallFire does, and the next thing that grabs your eye is &ldquo;Signup For Free&rdquo;&mdash;way to not miss a beat, CallFire.
<p>Next you see five simple icons, with simple text, breaking what CallFire does down: Text Messaging, Call Tracking, Video Broadcast, Cloud Call Center, IVR. Within the first five seconds you fully understand what is being offered, and given the opportunity to sign up. If that is not enough, you are also told the reasons why: Engage Your Customers, Save Valuable Time, Increase Revenue.
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-home-page.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a>
<p>After you look at thousands of APIs, nothing is more frustrating than to have to figure out what an API does. CallFire gives me what I need, in five seconds or less, without clicking or scrolling. This is the way all APIs should be, if not the homepage of website, then the landing page of the API developer portal. The main page of the CallFire website is well designed, and organized in a simple, and robust way, giving you one-click access to everything you need to get going with the platform--no other feedback required.
<p><strong>Endpoints</strong><br />This is the part of the review I dive into the actual design of the API, and provide some feedback on the technical endpoints of the APIs themselves. CallFire is unique because it has a REST and a SOAP version of the API available, which I think is important in today's business climate, where APIs are targeting open developers, as well as those within the enterprise.
<p>The CallFire API is very robust, with wide range of endpoints / methods for the most basic text and call features, all the way up to campaign, subscription, and contact management. You can tell the system is well thought out, providing a full suite of communication resources for all types of developers.
<p>On you dig into the REST API you begin to see quite a bit of SOAP residue, and while the API has a well thought out list of endpoints, many elements of the parameters, requests, and responses feel SOAPy, including the XML responses. There is also a lack of consistent response codes, and defined data model, giving the REST API an unfinished, empty bottom feeling.
<p>Overall I give the API a solid B in that it is a very robust stack, but I'd say it needs some hard use, and integrations before some of the rough edges are hammered off, parameters become more intuitive, and request and response structures normalize. Much of this just comes with usage, and requires getting closer to real world use cases, end users, before it becomes more of an experience based design vs. the resource based design it currently is.
<p>I could easily go through the entire Swagger definition for CallFire and make recommendations on naming conventions, and help craft the resource definitions for the underlying data models, but this is best worked out with the community, iterating, and communicating with developers, and learning more about truly what they need. Think of it as kiln firing of the API, through developer execution, and robust platform feedback loops.
<p><strong>On-Boarding</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API was frictionless. I went one click from home page, authenticated with my Google Account, and immediately I was dropped into my account dashboard, with a helpful intro screen showing me where things are. I easily found the area in my account to add an application, and get my API keys, then stumbled into the overview of how to activate your account as well&mdash;account management was intuitive.
<p>The intuitive and informative CallFire home page made the API easy to find, and with frictionless account signup, and a standard API app management, I was ready to make my first call on the API within 10 minutes. The only thing I would consider adding as part of the process, is an option for signup and login using my Github credentials, in addition to Facebook, and Google.
<p>On-boarding with an API is often the most frustrating part of API integration, and it wasn't something I worried about at all with CallFire. The process was intuitive, smooth, and didn't leave me trying to understand what the API does, and how I am supposed to make it work. Solid A on the on-boarding process for the CallFire API.
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/api-documentation/rest/version/1.1"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-api-documentation.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br />Documentation is one of the most critical aspects of API integration, making or breaking many integration efforts by developers. CallFire has double duty, in that it needs to provide documentation for the REST and SOAP version. Somethig CallFire manages to deliver with no problem, providing clean, easy to follow documentation for both APIs they offer.
<p>The SOAP API document provides a simple breakdown of operations and methods, with easy to follow descriptions for everything. Ultimately the SDKs do most of the heavy lifting here, but the SOAP docs provide a nice overview of the CallFire platform.
<p>The REST API for CallFire is defined using the machine readable API definition format Swagger, and uses Swagger UI to generate documentation, making learning about the API more interactive. Swagger provides a machine readable overview of the CallFire API, and is an approach to delivering API documentation that keeps pace with modern approaches.
<p>I do not have much feedback for the documentation side of CallFire, I'd like to see more information about the underlying data model described in the Swagger definition, as well more detail about the response codes, but I give the platform documentation a solid B for being simple, clean, and complete--the API just needs some hardening, and the documentation will improve.
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API is frictionless, and adding an app, and finding your API keys are intuitive enough. The platform also provides a nice overview on how to enable the API on your CallFire account, but ultimately the topic of authentication is neglected.
<p>Authentication for SOAP interactions, and REST for that matter, are abstracted away by each of the SDKs. However one of the elements of RESTful APIs is that authentication should be clearly defined as part of the documentation. I suggest adding a page, or section on an existing page that is dedicated authentication, explaining the BasicAuth used to secure the CallFire API. For any experienced API consumer it isn't difficult navigate, but the app manager with login and password, has appearance that it may be app key via a header or parameter, not BasicAuth--a dedicated authentication overview page would help clear up.
<p>As part of authentication review I do not usually advocate for a specific authentication approach, when the choices are BasicAuth, or using the app id and keys in the header or parameters. The best option is to pick one, be consistent, and explain it clearly, on a page that stands out. Overall the authentication for CallFire is intuitive, it just needs a little bit of information to makes things 100% clear when you first find yourself making that first API call.
<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Since I wrote this review, and the time of publishing, <a href="https://answers.callfire.com/hc/en-us/articles/205407787-Authentication">CallFire has updated their portal to include a well formed authentication overview for the platform</a>.</em>
<p><strong>Code</strong><br />After documentation, code samples, libraries, and SDKs are key to a painless API integration. For the CallFire API, there are only two SDKs available currently, for the PHP, and .NET platforms. It is common that platforms who are just getting going, only have a handful of SDKs in specific language, and is forgivable, but is also a sign of platform immaturity (aka lots of work still to be done).
<p>Another aspect of SDK design for CallFire, that I'd like to bring up, is the cohabitation of REST and SOAP in a single SDK. I'm not sure this type of cross pollination is ideal for all integrations. Maybe it is just my architectural style, but I like seeing each SDK be as smallest possible footprint as possible, and meet the needs of developers without any extraneous bloat.
<p>CallFire needs to have Python, Ruby, Java, Node.Js, Go, and JavaScript language SDKs to be able to serve as wide as possible audience as we possibly can. To help achieve this I recommend soliciting the help of platform users, or even paying a 3rd party developer to build SDKs, if needed.
<p>Moving beyond SDKs, into what I call Platform Development Kits (PDK), CallFire does well in providing two distinct platform plugins for WordPress and Drupal. I recommend bringing these PDKs to the surface, and showcase them in a full SDK and PDK showcase page&mdash;showing what is possible. &nbsp;Maybe even considering the next step, of what is the 3rd PDK that could be developed? SalesForce? Heroku?
<p>The usage of Github by CallFire is another important signal, showing the platform is progressive, and something that developers can depend on. I recommend further bringing Github into the site, linking to accounts, providing direct links to SDK and PDK repositories from an official page, and add Github authentication for developers to be able to create and manage their accounts. Github isn't just about code, it is a potentially important social layer to the CallFire API ecosystem.
<p><strong>Mobile</strong><br />There really is no evidence of any mobile SDKs, or information for mobile developers available on the CallFire platform. It is common to find entire sections dedicated to mobile developers, or at least links to mobile platform specific code libraries. I recommend establishing a mobile focused section of the platform, and invest the resources necessary to help developers build iOS, Android, and Windows mobile applications using CallFire.
<p><strong>Support</strong><br />CallFire is doing well on the support front, providing building blocks for both direct, and self-service support. I like to see a mix of support services that developers can find on their own, getting the help they need 24/7, but they also need to be able to get direct support when they get stuck.
<p>When it comes to direct support, CallFire is rocking it, with a support email, live chat, phone number, contact form, and ticketing system tied to your account messaging area. The only additional things I could recommend CallFire offering is paid support plans, allowing developers to pay for one-on-one support via chat, online hangout, or other means.
<p>With self-service support, there is the CallFire FAQ, which I'd call more a knowledgeable than a simple FAQ, providing a wealth of knowledge about the platform. The only common element I see missing is more of a community element with a forum, or usage of Stack Overflow to engage with the wider developer community. &nbsp;The current FAQ is very robust, and with the integrated ticketing system, the potential is great, but it is all missing that community piece.
<p>Overall, CallFire support is as robust as you'd expect from any API platform. When you combine with the social media presence the platform has, that I'll cover as part of the communication strategy, the platform has all of its bases covered. A+ on support effort.
<p><strong>Communications</strong><br />When it comes to my review criteria for communications, other than a newsletter, CallFire nailed everyone of them. The platform has all of the expected social media platforms, has an active blog with RSS feed, and is very accessible with email, phone, and chat. All of this sends the right signals to the community, and potential API consumers, that someone is home. I have nothing to contribute when it comes to communications, as long as all channels are kept active, CallFire is doing everything it can in my mind.
<p><strong>Change Practices</strong><br />As platform providers, we are asking developers to depend on us, and integrate our resources into their applications, and businesses. That is asking a lot, and we need to provide as much information as possible about what the future hold, to hlep build trust with developers. There a handful of proven ways for doing this, established by leading API platforms.
<ul>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - API roadmaps are usually a simple, bulleted list, derived from the APIs own internal roadmap, showing what the future holds for the platform. Transparency around an APIs roadmap is a tough balance, since you don't want to give away too much, alerting your competitors, but your developer ecosystem needs to know what is next.</li>
<li><strong>Status Dashboard -</strong> Status dashboards are a common way for API platforms to communicate the availability of an API, but also show the track record of a platform, helping developers understand the track record for an API they are to integrate with. There are several simple services, that help API providers do this, without investment in new tools and systems.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log - </strong>Knowing the past is a big part of understanding where things are in store for the future. A change log should work in sync with the API roadmap building block, but provide much more detailed information about changes that have occurred with an API. Developers will not always pay attention to announced updates, but can use a change log as a guide for deciding what changes they need to make in their applications and how they will use an API.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Sharing the change history of a platform, a roadmap to the future, and a status of API operations at the moment go a long way in help build trust with developers. Transparency in the development of any platform, is essential in helping developers feel comfortable that a platform will be around to support their needs, and is worthy of their time.

<p><strong>Business Model</strong><br />When reviewing APIs, the overall business model is usually one of the most incomplete aspects of operations, in my experience. This is ok, as many platforms are still figuring this out, however this is not the case with CallFire. The business model for the platform isn't just well defined, it provides me with an example to use when helping other API providers visualize what is possible.
<p>The pricing page for CallFire is clean, well thought out, and provides sensibles tiers of operation, with clear units of measurement, letting me know what I get for each level. I can easily upgrade the access tier directly from my account settings, and I can get volume pricing if needed. This is how APIs should work, allowing me to easily calculate what I'll need, and figure out which tier I will be operating within, complete with a self-service option for scaling as I need, paying for what I use, as I go.
<p>The billing management and credit system for CallFire is superior to most of even the most thought out API billing and pricing models. It is clean, well thought out, and makes sense from a user perspective&mdash;which is the most important aspect. I'll be using CallFire credit system as a reference when I talk about how the platforms should build tooling that supports the underlying API business model.
<p>I can't articulate enough, how well done the business model, pricing, supporting billing and the other business elements of the CallFire API.
<p><strong>Resources</strong><br />When it comes to available support resources, it is another area CallFire does very well. The platform has heavily invested in case studies, videos, webinars, and a tour of the platform. They even have a communications and marketing glossary developers can use to get up to speed. CallFire does a good job of providing valuable resources to get developers quickly understand all aspects of platform operations..
<p>A couple of areas I could provide suggestions for improvement, in is when it comes to more industry level white papers, and when the evangelism side of things kicks in maybe consider posting slide decks from events CallFire presents at, as well as a calendar of interesting events. These things will happen I'm sure once an API evangelism strategy is kicked into full gear, but for now just keep doing more of the same--providing lots of rich resources for devs.
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br />I'd file R&amp;D in the same category as mobile, non-existent. API ecosystem are essentially external R&amp;D labels for companies, and general operations are about exploring ideas of what can be build with an API, but it helps to have some element available to stimulate overall R&amp;D via the platform.
<p>Some of these elements are:
<ul>
<li>Idea Showcase - A place the community can share ideas of what could be built with the CallFire platform.</li>
<li>Labs Environment - A workbench showing what CallFire is working on when it comes to their own integration.</li>
<li>Opportunities - Available opportunities to build things like SDKs, PDKs, or specific projects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>These are just three things that help stimulate the innovation around an API. Sometimes developers just need something to spark the imagination, or possibly see an existing labs project to help them see something in their own work. These rich R&amp;D environments can provide a great opportunity to help meet the needs of CallFire, and its partners.
<p><strong>Legal Department</strong><br />CallFire has the requisite Terms of Service (TOS), and privacy policy. I'm not a lawyer, so i'm not going to parse all of the details of each. There was nothing that raised my TOS alarms too significantly, the TOS were pretty standard, and the privacy policy didn't raise any huge privacy concerns as well I wouldn't have any problems integrating my own platform and business into CallFire.
<p>A couple of items I'd recommend also considering, based upon what I seen on other platforms:
<ul>
<li><strong>Code License - </strong>The PHP SDK has an MIT license, but the .NET didn't have anything. A centralized code licensing page could help as well.</li>
<li><strong>API License -</strong> A license for the API itself, applied to the REST API interface that is defined by Swagger, using API Commons format.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA) - </strong>Provide a service level agreement for API consumers to take advantage of, and understand service level commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Branding -</strong> There are no branding or style guidelines with support resources like logos, etc&mdash;missed opportunity for spreading word, and steering developers in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Just a couple of things to think about. All of these would go a long way in building trust with developers, and the branding thing is a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. When you bundle these with the TOS, privacy, and compliance information already provided by the platform, it would round off the legal department of the CallFire API nicely.
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong><br />Embeddable tooling is another area that is non-existent for the CallFire API. There are no embeddable tools like widgets, buttons, etc that allow the average end-user, and developer to put the API to use in web pages, and applications. I'm not sure what an embeddable suite of tools would look like for CallFire, that would need to be a separate brainstorming process.
<p>When it comes to communication platforms, especially ones involving media, and deep social interactions, embeddable tools are a proven way to grow platform, expand the network effect, and potentially bring in new developers. I recommend including an embeddable section to the site, with a handful of embeddable tooling to compliment the SDK and PDK resources already available.
<p><strong>Environment</strong><br />One area I consider when looking through API operations, is the environment itself. By default many APIs are live, ready for production use, but increasingly platforms are employing alternate environments for development, QA, and potentially variant product environment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - With the sensitive information available via many APIs, providing developers a sandbox environment to develop and test their code might be wise idea. Sandboxes environments will increase the overall cost of an API deployment, but can reduce headaches for developers and can significantly reduce support overhead. Consider the value of a sandbox when planning an API.</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - When planning an API, consider if all deployments need to have access to live data in real-time or there is the need to require developers to request for separate production access for their API applications. In line with the sandbox building block, a separate API production environment can make for a much healthier API ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Simulator</strong> - Providing an environment where developers can find existing profiles, templates or other collections of data, as well as sequence for simulating a particular experience via an API platform. While this is emerging as critical building block for Internet of Thing APIs, it is something other API providers have been doing to help onboard new users.</li>
<li><strong>Templates</strong> - Predefined templates of operation, when a new environment is setup, either sandbox, production, or simulator, it can be pre-populated with data, and other configuration, making it more useful to developers. These templates can be used throughout the API lifecycle from development, QA, all the way to simulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>This approach to delivering an environment for the CallFire API is not essential, but I could see it providing some interesting scenarios for communication campaigns, and the deployment of messaging infrastructure in a containerized, Internet of Things rich environment. Deployment CallFire communication infrastructure should be as flexible as possible to support the next generation of Internet enabled communication, both in the cloud and on-premise.
<p><strong>Developers</strong><br />An often overlooked aspect of API operations is the tools provided to API consumers. CallFire is in a fortunate position as the API is core to their product, and the API integration is an extension of a primary CallFire user account. The account area for CallFire is well done, clean, and gives users, and those who choose to be API consumers, quite a bit of control over their communication infrastructure.
<p>CallFire nailed almost every API account area I like to see in any API platform:
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Dashboard - </strong>The dashboard for CallFire account is well done, and information.</li>
<li><strong>Account Settings - </strong>CallFire provides a high level of control over account settings.</li>
<li><strong>Reset Password -</strong> Resetting password is important, and I like to highlight separately.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - The app management for CallFire is on par with rest of industry.</li>
<li><strong>Service Tiers -</strong> The ability to change service tier, and scale is pretty significant.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - An import part of the communication and support strategy of platform.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> &nbsp;- Essential to the economy portion of platform operations, well executed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of areas I'd like to see, to round off developer account operations:
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Authentication -</strong> It would fit nicely with Facebook, and Google Auth--I prefer authenticating for APIs with my Github.</li>
<li><strong>Delete Account - </strong>Maybe it is in there, but I couldn't find it. The ability to delete an account is important in my book.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Logs &amp; Analytics -</strong> I'd like to see application specific analytics like on the dashboard, showing usage per app.</li>
<li><strong>Account API -</strong> Allow API access to all account operations, allowing access to account settings, usage limits, billing, messaging and other areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The CallFire account management for users and developers is much more robust than I see in many of the APIs I review. Like I said before the monetization portion is something to be showcased, and all the most important aspects of account management for API operations are present. It wouldn't take much to round off with a couple more features, some more analytics, and an account management API would really take things to the next level.
<p><strong>Consistency</strong><br />I always enjoy when I come find consistent design, and function across API operations. This is what I found with CallFire. The API isn't an afterthought like other platforms, it is their product, and the site design, messaging, and content are consistent across the platform.
<p>The API design is consistent, and the supporting documentation is as well. The only thing I'd add is design patterns across the SOAP and REST API should be less consistent, and stay true to their own design constraints. The details of the REST could be tightened, to be more consistent in how parameters are formed, and response formats, and error code are commonly presented.
<p>Usually when reviewing APIs, I look for fractures between API operations, like clunky UI between website sections, or incomplete documentation, often created by disparate teams. This doesn't exist with CallFire, and while there are many details that could be cleaned up, the consistency is all there.
<p><strong>Openness</strong><br />This is a term thrown around a lot in the space, and very seldom do sites live up to it. There are many things that contribute to whether or not an API is truly open. CallFire delivers on all of the important areas, making open a word I'd apply to CallFire.
<p>First on-boarding for the platform frictionless, and everything is self-service, even scaling your account when you need more credits. You have control over your account, and the terms of service and privacy policy are liberal. These are all hallmarks of an open API. Add the ability to delete my account, I'm 100% on board.
<p>One of the things I think heavily contribute to the openness of the CallFire platform is the business model. The monetization strategy is well formed, with pricing and service tiers well defined. You know what things cost, and how to get what you need. This type of approach eliminates the need for other extraneous rate list, or restrictions&mdash;this type of balance is important to truly achieving openness.
<p>After this review I'd call CallFire an open API, but only time will tell, if the platform is also stable, support channels are truly supportive, and other aspects of open that only CallFire can deliver on. For right now I consider them open for business, and open for developers, but ultimately whether or not CallFire is willing to share this review, will put the exclamation on the platform openness definition, won't it! ;-)
<p><strong>Evangelism</strong><br />The usual footprint you'd see when an API platform has an active evangelism program doesn't exist for CallFire, but that is part of the motivation of this review. We are looking to take a snapshot of where &nbsp;the platform is at, in hopes of providing much needed input for the roadmap, as well as establish a version 1.0 evangelism strategy--we will revisit the evangelism portion of this review in a couple months.
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In short, the CallFire passes my review. There are several key areas like mobile, and roadmap communication, that are missing from the platform entirely, but then there are other areas CallFire nails almost every one of my review criteria. The API is robust, the documentation is complete, and they provide all the essential support building blocks.
<p>One of the things that really stand out for me is the CallFire business model, something that I think really cuts through the BS of many APIs I look at. CallFire has a clear business model, and the tools to manage your API usage. There is no grey area with the business of model for CallFire, which is something I just don't see a lot of.
<p>I'd say my biggest concern with the platform is the lack of diverse code resources. I can't tell if they are just getting going, or maybe the lack of developer skills is slowing the diversity of available coding resources--I am just not sure. My guess is their is a lack of diverse developer skills on staff, which explains the lack of mobile SDKs, and the SOAP residue on the REST API. My advice is to invest in the developer resources necessary to load the platform up with a wide variety of coding resources that developers can put to work in their projects.
<p>Beyond the code resources, it is really just a bunch smaller items that would bring the platform into better form. CallFire definitely reflects everything I'm looking for in an API platform, and is something I've included in the top APIs I track on as part of my API Stack. Additionally, I've gathered a couple of other stories while doing this review, including the overall monetization strategy, the notification system under account settings, and their usage of Swagger&mdash;which is always another good sign of a healthy platform, and a positive review.
<p>Lots going on with the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">CallFire platform</a>, I recommend taking a look at what they are up to.
<p><em>This was a paid review of the CallFire platform, if you'd like to schedule a review of your platform, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d0f0b9beb6bf90b1a0b9b5a6b1beb7b5bcb9a3a4feb3bfbd">please contact me</a>, and we'll see if I can make time. &nbsp;A paid review does not equal a good review. it is my goal to give as critical, and constructive feedback as I can to help API providers enhance their roadmap and better serve their consumers.</em><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/t-shirts/KL_InApiWeTrust-1000.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>In 2010 I started API Evangelist, as part of my effort to better understand the world of APIs. I was looking to not just the technology of how it was done, I saw there were plenty of people doing this. I wanted to better understand the business of APIs, and how popular APIs were finding success with their business models, developer outreach, and other aspects of API operations--going well beyond just the technology.
<p>API Evangelist started simply as a blog. I was not a big fan of WordPress, as I knew it can be quite a security target, and as a platform, for a programmer like me, can be more difficult to get even the simple things done. With this in mind I started the first API Evangelist API, by following the same advice that I would be giving to my potential audience.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/blog/</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quickly I needed some additional APIs, to keep track of some of the players I saw emerging across the landscape. In 2010, the most important piece of the puzzle, when it came to the business of APIs (after the APIs themselves) was the growing number of API service providers, who were popping up to deliver much needed services to API providers. To support my work I added a couple more API endpoints.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/ </strong>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/apis/</strong>
<p>Tracking on APIs wasn't that critical, as it was something <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> already did, but I still preferred to track on some addition details for my own needs. When it came to deploying my own APIs, I kept the as simple as possible, using the backend that I knew best -- the LAMP stack. I was already running several websites on Amazon Web Services, so I chose to deploy my servers and database using Amazon, using a pretty proven formula for delivering a backend stack.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>LAMP Stack - MySQL (RDS) + PHP / Linux (EC2)</strong>
<p>PHP may not be the choice of API champions, but I was fluent in it, and I new that when the time came, and I open sourced the back-end for API Evangelist, that if everything was straight up LAMP stack, I would reach the widest possible audience. Now, with my base API infrastructure in place, I began designing, and deploying other APIs I needed to track on the world of APIs. I needed to track on some of the open source tools I was finding so I added a new endpoint.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/tools/</strong>
<p>After tooling, links were quickly becoming a big challenge for me. I needed a way to track on links to not just stories, but also events, white papers, presentations, and other resources that I was referencing in my research. I needed another API that I could use to store links from across the space.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/links/</strong>
<p>Once my links API was in place, I also began using it for a number of other functions, showing me that I quickly needed more functionality beyond simply storing a title, description, and URL. As I was monitoring the space, I  saw that I would needed a way to curate links to important stories across the fast growing space each week--resulting in me adding a new layer to my links API.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/links/curation/</strong>
<p>Beyond tracking on important links, and curating the news each week, I started to see that many of the links I placed in my blog posts were disappearing. The API space moves really fast, and many of the API companies that were being acquired or shutting down, were simply disappearing. I didn't like my readers stumbling across dead links, so I added another layer to my links APIs to help, which I called.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/links/linkrot/</strong>
<p>Part of the linkrot API operations, was taking a screenshot of each website referenced, so when it disappeared, I could easily replace it with a popup screenshot of what used to be there. To support this I was using a number of 3rd party screenshot APIs, which after using three separate ones, each shutting down, I eventually created my own screen capture API.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/links/screenshots/</strong>
<p>Beyond links, I was hitting on similar problems with my service provider API. Some of the companies I tracked on were not APIs or API service providers, I needed a way to track on other types of companies. At the same moment I realized I also needed a way to track the individuals who were also doing interesting things in the space, as well as the companies they worked at, resulting in the creation of two new APIs:
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/people/</strong><br /><strong> api.apievangelist.com/companies/</strong>
<p>Similar to links, I created a new API that allowed me to centrally manage all the images I used. I store all my images on Amazon S3, but I needed a way to track not the URL, but also a plain english title, description, tags, and other metadata about images. I added another new API.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/images/</strong>
<p>Then, similar to my link system, I began having more advanced needs for images, which required numerous endpoints to be added, allowing me to better manage the visual side of operations for API Evangelist. Images are critical to my storytelling, so I hand crafted exactly the APIs resources I needed to get the job done.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/images/resize/</strong><br /><strong> api.apievangelist.com/images/crop/</strong><br /><strong> api.apievangelist.com/images/compress/</strong>
<p>There are too many APIs to list as part of this story. Ultimately over the last five years, I've added an ever increasing number of utility APIs that help me manage data and content across the API Evangelist network. Most of these APIs were custom developed, but some simply provided a facade for other public APIs, or open source software I had installed on the server.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/images/conversion/<br /> api.apievangelist.com/file/conversion/<br /> api.apievangelist.com/url/parse/<br /> api.apievangelist.com/database/backups/<br /> api.apievangelist.com/log/sync/<br /> api.apievangelist.com/dns/backup/</strong>
<p><strong> </strong>
<p>I was accumulating a pretty interesting stack of information, which I was using to power my own network, but I was the API Evangelist, without any public APIs. I wanted to open up my APIs to the public, and what better way to do it than to evaluating the API management providers I had been writing about, a process which resulted with me choosing 3Scale API Infrastructure. 3Scale had the features I needed like user management, analytics, and valuable service composition tooling, allowing me to craft different levels of access to my APIs for public usage, access by my partners, and of course for my own internal usage.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/API-Management+-3scale-API-Management-Solution.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" />
<p>Using 3Scale I dropped an include file into my existing API stack, and with just a few lines of code I secured my APIs, and metered who had access, requiring registration for public or partner levels of access. To support this I launched a simple portal for the APIs I was making public. I didn't release all of my APIs, only the ones I felt the public would be interested in.&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/API-Evangelist-Core-APIs.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" />
<p>I kept on working on my infrastructure, adding an increasing number of endpoints, building on existing APIs, evolving my APIs to help me better monitor the API space, organize information, and craft the stories that I publish each week to the API evangelist network. Eventually I had hundreds of endpoints, some of them well planned, but many of them just thrown up to support some need I had at the moment.

<p>The API Evangelist API stack was growing more unwieldy by the day, and even though I am the sole developer, sometimes I'd lose track of what I had. I also struggled with consistency, I am not always the most regular guy when it comes to naming conventions, use of query parameters, headers, and other common illnesses you see in API design across the space. Another thing that was getting out of control, was my backend database.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/apievangelist-backend-database.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" />
<p>It was my database. I could do whatever I wanted. I just added tables, columns, and new databases as I saw fit--again, all without much consistency. I was growing a pretty large legacy code base, which was API driven, but API does not always equal better. You can just as easily build a monster with APIs, as you can with historical approaches to API design. Additionally, my architecture ran on a single Amazon RDS database instance, with a single Amazon EC2 Linux instance, serving up all the APIs.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-broken-link.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" />
<p>If one API failed, all APIs failed. If I was running a large job against a single API, say creating screenshots, compressing images, or other CPU intensive processes, my other APIs suffered. Also if I rebooted the server, everything went dark. Which as a independent operator, is always very tempting.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-server-reboot.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>I loved my evolving API stack, it did what I needed, but was increasingly looking like many of the legacy systems I had managed in the past, only this time it was all accessible through a single API stack. If my APIs did what I needed, this wasn't a problem, but in my back of my head I knew eventually it would catch up with me. For now I ignored it, and moved forward comfortably numb (Pink Floyd).
<p>Along the way I also discovered new tools for helping me manage my APIs, specifically my API documentation, by using Swagger. If I crafted a machine readable JSON definition for my APIs using Swagger, I could automatically generate interactive documentation for my APIs, that was always up to date.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>Quickly I found Swagger to be much more than just a machine readable API definition format, that just can be used to generate interactive documentation, or the generation of client side code libraries. While it still fully isn't realized, I saw that if I took an API design first approach, using Swagger, that it slowly was becoming a central truth throughout my API life cycle. This was just the beginning of a new world of API design, deployment, and management for me.
<p>Along the way in 2014, Steve Willmott, the CEO of 3Scale and I developed a machine readable API discover format, which we called APIs.json. This new JSON format, was intended to provide a machine readable index of all APIs that exist within a single website domain.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-json/apis-json.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></a></strong>
<p>Using APIs.json I could provide essential meta data about the domain an API operates in, as well as for each API endpoint available, like name, description, tags, and critical links to aspects of operations like the portal landing page, API documentation, code libraries, pricing, or terms of service. For each API I hand crafted an APIs.json, allowing me to publish a machine readable index of APIs that exist within my domain.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-json/apis-json-apis-with-swagger.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>APIs.json immediately provided me with a very valuable index of my own APIs. Then I got thinking, what if I also indexed the public APIs that I depended on as well? So, I put around 50 public APIs to use, and nowhere did I have a comprehensive list of these APIs, especially not all the meta data for API operations including documentation, code libraries, pricing and terms of service, let alone a machine readable definition of the surface area using Swagger.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-internal-api.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>I now had three separate APIs.json files, one for my own internal APIs, one for my own APIs I offer up publicly, and a third for the distributed public APIs that I depend on for my operations. I didn't just have a single index of my APIs, I had essentially mapped out all of my stack, providing me with a single location I could go to find all my APIs.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-map-pin.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>This isn't just about providing the public with a discovery solution for my APIs, it is also about me understanding my entire surface area. Something that honestly, showed me what a mess much of my infrastructure was, but regardless, at least now it was mapped out and known, for good or bad. For the first time, I felt like there was potential for getting my house in order--then Docker happened.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/docker/docker-logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>The new containerization solution provided me a new way to look at my architecture. Rather than one big MySQL instance, and a support Linux / PHP / Apache server instance, I could deploy a single Docker instance, with many little LAMP nodes, each with the basic configuration I needed to run my APIs. Rather than having all my APIs served up via one server, I was able to essentially break up each API, and put into its own, independent container.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>Sure, my APIs still ran on a single AWS EC2 instance, but now they each ran in individual Docker containers which could be easily fired up in separate instances, running in any infrastructure, something I would test out later. For now, I was happy knowing that I could slowly separate out each of my APIs, allowing them to act independently of each other, with hopes that a single API could fail, without bringing the entire stack to its needs. Conversely, each API could be independently scaled to meet my specific needs of just that API, without be forced to scale all my APIs.
<p>At the same moment, another thought process was evolving, something that really wasn't much different than what I could already do, but provided me a strong incentive for rethinking how I approached my architecture, something that was not just complemented by, but also facilitated by Docker containerization--Microservices.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-micro-definition.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>Microservices is more philosophy, than a concrete technology like Docker, but it provides a healthy basis for thinking about how you design, deploy, and manage your APIs. With this in mind I set forth crafting my own definition, of just exactly what micro meant to me, something that is proving to be a very personal thing, evolving from individual to individual, and company to company.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>minimal surface</strong><br /><strong> minimal on disk</strong><br /><strong> minimal compute</strong><br /><strong> minimal message</strong><br /><strong> minimal network</strong><br /><strong> minimal time to rebuild</strong><br /><strong> minimal time to throw away</strong><br /><strong> minimal ownership</strong><br /><strong> minimal dependencies</strong>
<p>A microservice way of thinking, coupled with Docker enabled containerization, has allowed me to rethink how I design, and deploy my APIs. While I'm not fully subscribing to popular opinions around what is a microservice, it is allowing me to rethink many of my own architectural patterns. However this new way of thinking, came with some shortcomings, around how I uniquely identify API resources, as well as discover resources, but luckily I already had been working on solutions in these areas.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>All of my APIs were already defined using Swagger, which essentially provided me with a fingerprint of each API, that I can use to uniquely identify each API, as well as quantify the entire surface area, such as how many endpoints, parameters, and details about underlying data model, and message formats. I now had, my solution for API identification, but what about API discovery?
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-json/apis-json-apis-with-swagger.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>As I contemplated untangling the legacy API mess I had created for myself, I was concerned that if I reduced the size of each API, spawning new APIs, I would eventually have over 500 individual APIs, potentially creating even more of a nightmare for myself. Luckily I had already started hanging these APIs onto an APIs.json file, something I can continue to replicate into smaller, more isolated groups, while also linking up using the APIs.json include collection. I would no longer have just three APIs.json files, I would have many nodes of APIs, indexed using APIs.json, with a master APIs.json as the doorway to my increasingly decoupled world.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-json/kin-lane-master-stack.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>As I got to work redefining my API stack, I couldn't disrupt my current set of APIs I have deployed to API Evangelist, so I decided to publish this core set of tools under the KinLane.com domain. It actually makes sense, because many of the APIs are not directly related to API Evangelist, spanning larger work that I do. My brand is bigger than just API Evangelist, it is just one node underneath the Kin Lane brand.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/kin.png" alt="" width="18%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>After completing the first wave of converting my legacy API stack, using my new containerized, micro design approach, each complete with its own Swagger, and APIs.json, I end up with 25 separate APIs, with over 250 endpoints. This provided me with a next generation blueprint of my API stack, that I could easy follow, add to, and evolve over time.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-json/kin-lane-master-apis.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>As I carved off each API, defining the next generation I worked to keep as small, and self-contained as possible. My link API, became link, curation, and linkrot APIs, with additional supporting services for screen capture, pulling content, and other utilities as their own, individual endpoints.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>/links/</strong><br /><strong> /curated/</strong><br /><strong> /linkrot/</strong><br /><strong> /screencapture/</strong>
<p>My images API is getting similar treatment and carving off many of the support utilities as stand alone features so that I can use them separately. While I may use resize, compress, and other utilities in conjunction with my core images API, many times this won't be the case, especially if I open up to the outside world.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>/images/</strong><br /><strong> /resize/</strong><br /><strong> /compression/</strong><br /><strong> /filter/</strong>
<p>This process of reducing the scope of my APIs isn't just about size, it is also about isolation of services, keeping my APIs doing one thing, and doing it well. Allowing me to deploy, scale, and migrate my services exactly as I see fit. While my definition of a microservice may not be everyone else, it helps provide a guide for me as I'm evolving legacy APIs, as well as defining and evolving new ones. With my new stack, I can now begin to think about how I deploy my cloud infrastructure a little differently.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>AWS = Containers</strong><br /><strong> Google = Containers<br />Microsoft = Containers</strong>
<p>I can easily fire up a Docker stack in both AWS and Google, both using the exact same LAMP stack configuration, and pull in each of my API definitions, allowing me to easily deploy, and migrate between cloud providers. To accomplish this, it isn't as if I can drag one container from AWS to Google, I rely on Git, or more specifically Github to help me achieve this.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-json/kin-lane-master-apis.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>Each API lives as its own Github repository, with every aspect of its existence present either within the private master branch of the repository, and some of it available in a public gh-pages branch. Using Github I store the server side PHP code I will use when deploying each Docker container, but I also story the data model, data backups in the private, secure master branch of the repository.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-github.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>At the center of reach Github repository is the APIs.json for the API, providing of index of not just meta data about the API, but its Swagger fingerprint, server code, client code, and other essential elements of operations. When I fire up a new Docker container, I reference where to find its server side API code, which also simultaneously provides it with the Github organization and repo where it can find its APIs.json index.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/github-repo-store.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>This approach allows me to easily fire up containers in any cloud provider that supports Docker, which is pretty much all of them in 2015. The best part of this, is I can also deploy locally in my own home or office, using a local server, or even via Raspberry Pi (work in progress).
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/raspberry-pi-docker.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>Another important aspect of this evolution of my API stack, is that as I've decoupled my APIs, allowing them to reborn as a decoupled set of independent portable APIs, forever changing how I design and deploy my APIs, my API management is also undergoing the same treatment. You see, if my APIs can migrate and move, so does the API management layer that I use to orchestrate them.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/3scale-localized.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>To begin with, I need the basic ability to mange my API consumers. I need the basic controls for managing access to all the APIs contained within a stack, alongside all my APIs, as an equal resource.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong><strong>api.apievangelist.com</strong>/users/</strong><br /><strong>User Create</strong><br /><strong>User Read</strong><br /><strong>User Update</strong><br /><strong>User Delete</strong>
<p>With the ability to add, read, update, and delete users on my platform, I also need to the ability to manage each of the accounts. This way I can directly access each account within my API stack, but more importantly my API consumers can also manage their own accounts using the same APIs.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/account/</strong><br /><strong> Account Set Credit Card</strong><br /><strong> Account Delete Credit Card</strong><br /><strong> Invoice By Account</strong><br /><strong> Invoice Line Item List</strong><br /><strong> Invoice Payment Transaction List</strong>
<p>A key part of my API management infrastructure is the concept of service composition. Using 3Scale I have created multiple tiers of access to APIs, allowing for a public free, entry level layer, as well as higher levels of paid, partner, and internal access. I need the details of these service plans I've created, including their features to move with my API infrastructure.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong><strong>api.apievangelist.com</strong>/services/</strong><br /><strong> Service Plan List</strong><br /><strong> Service Plan Feature List</strong><br /><strong> Service Plan Set To Default</strong>
<p>As each of my API consumers register, and manage their API access, the next level of API access is handled through the application level management layer. 3Scale gives me the tools to do this, which I've extended as individual API endpoints.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong><strong>api.apievangelist.com</strong>/applications/</strong><br /><strong> Application Plan List (per isolated service)</strong><br /><strong> Application List</strong><br /><strong> Application Create</strong><br /><strong> Application Read</strong><br /><strong> Application Update</strong><br /><strong> Application Change Plan</strong><br /><strong> Application Key List</strong><br /><strong> Application Key Create</strong><br /><strong> Application Key Delete</strong><br /><strong> Application Usage by Metric</strong>
<p>There are plenty of other services that 3Scale API infrastructure gives me, but this represent the v1 API stack I need to help orchestrate this new, containerized, potentially distributed API stack I've setup for myself.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/Interactive-Docs-3scale-Documentation.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a></strong>
<p>Eventually I'd like to see entire 3SCale infrastructure decoupled, similar to my stack, giving me, and my consumers to access all API management features, right alongside the other API resources I am providing--giving me a pretty complete stack. Now I'm ready for the higher level evolution of my APIs, between my two organizations.

</tbody>
</table>
<p>With my new approach I can easily establish a new Github organization for API Evangelist, pick exactly the APIs I want, fork them to my new organization, deploy a new container server on AWS, Google, or wherever I need it, and have a brand new stack. I will use the same 3Scale API infrastructure account to manage both my Kin Lane and API Evangelist API stack, so other than deploying the individual APIs, there is no configuration needed, my API management follows my APIs.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/3scale-key.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>All along the way, I've been on-boarding new API consumers, as well as migrated the users who have historically used my API Evangelist stack of APIs. Some of these users have shown interest in being able to scale their usage of some of my APIs. These tend to not be the core blog, or company APIs I've developed as part of my monitoring of the API space, they are other more utility APIs.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>/screencapture/</strong><br /><strong> /image/resize/</strong><br /><strong> /api/swagger/</strong>
<p>While many of my users are perfectly happy using these utility APIs via my API stack, some of them have expressed interest in being able to scale the API to meet the demands of their operations. Just as I will scale up Docker containers for my own needs, my customers are hoping to do this same, or possibly even deploy my API designs, in their own infrastructure -- opening up a whole new level of API monetization for me.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-wholesale.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>I can even take this to the next level, and deploy entire API stacks for customers, their infrastructure or mine. Providing all APIs, via an a la carte menu, giving an entire new dimension to my API deployment strategy. I can deploy API stacks, exactly as I need them, for my own needs, or for my customers--using the same API infrastructure. The best part of this, is it isn't just about deploying API infrastructure of my needs, my customers can get in on the API provider game.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-provider.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>My customers can start by consuming APIs, then evolve to deploying them within their own infrastructure, and when ready, they can open up these APIs to their own customers, and the way my 3Scale infrastructure works, I can switch them over to their own API management account at any time, with no changes needed. I just create a new top level account, change the master API management key from mine to theirs, replicate service levels, and their customers can start signing up, and consuming their APIs.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>This approach to API deployment and management opens up not just a new way of monetizing APIs at a wholesale level, it opens up the power of being an API provider to my API community. Another interesting aspect of this approach is because each API comes complete with a machine readable Swagger API definition, and APIs.json file index, each API, and each API stack is easily discoverable, and open to the delivery of API focused services, from 3rd party providers.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-services.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>In 2015, more API service providers are supporting Swagger, and other common API definition formats like API Blueprint, as a way to on board, configure, automate, and access valuable API services in the cloud, or even on-premise. While to many Swagger is a way to generate interactive documentation or client code libraries, it is being used by a growing number of companies for much, much more.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://apiscience.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-science/api-science-logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></strong>
<p>Using API Science I can import the Swagger files for my APIs, and generate the monitors I need to keep an eye on API operations. Once API monitors are setup, I receive regular emails per my account, and can embed dashboard tools for helping me visualize my platform availability.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.runscope.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/runscope/runscope-logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></strong>
<p>Similar to API Science, using Runscope, I can import Swagger definitions into my account, and automate the setup of tests, which I can run as part of my regular platform monitoring and testing--saving serious time in how I monitor my APIs.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="20%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>Postman allows me to import my Swagger definitions, and create ready to go API calls, where I can see easily understand the request and responses of all my API calls, collaborate with other API consumers on my team. Postman allows me to easily work with my APIs, without a UI, and with some of my APis, is how I engage -- never quite needing a full UI.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://smartbear.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/smartbear/SmartBear-Logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></strong>
<p>SmartBear also allows you to import Swagger, and allow you to generate mock and virtualized APis, run testing, monitoring, performance, and security tests against your APIs. Using Swagger I can quickly configure a number of vital services I need to operate a healthy platform.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/apis-json-properties-postman.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></a></strong>
<p>This is something that isn't just machine readable, and can be translated into UI, browser, IDE, and other more human aspects of API integration and engagement.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/blog-apis-json-postman.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>While none of these service providers listed, currently support the importing of APIs.json, only Swagger -- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eventually they will.</span> APIs.json will provide a single entry point that these API service providers can import not just one, but many APIs, and configure valuable services throughout an APIs life cycle. An example of this in action can be found using the APIs.io API search engine.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://apis.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></a></strong>
<p>APIs.io provides an APIs.json import, allowing you to index all of your APis, and the supporting elements of API operations. Once indexed, APIs will be available to the public, via the open source API search engine. This is just the beginning of APIs.json enabled search, other providers are getting in the game as well.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://wso2.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/wso2/wso2-logo-white-400X180-tr.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></strong>
<p>With the next release of the WSO2 API management platform, API providers will be able to organize APIs, and export them as APIs.json collections, opening up for either listing in the public APis.io search engine, but also opening up for the deployment of private, internal API search engines using either APIs.io, which is open source, or the deployment of a custom solution. I have also begun delivering tooling that employs APIs.json, for delivering vital services along the API life cycle.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/api-codegen.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>Using the Swagger Codegen project, which is an open source solution for generating client side libraries, I deployed an API that accepts any valid APIs.json file, and return seven separate client side libraries, from the Swagger definition. While these are by no means a perfect client solution, it provides a nice start for some developers to get going, eliminating some of the more redundant aspects of API integration.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/apis-json-properties-postman.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>An advantage of using APIs.json to index API operations, and on board API service providers, is that it can provide access to one, or many API definitions, as well as other aspects of API operations, like documentation, code, pricing. While many of these aspects are not machine readable, once an API has been imported into a service providers platform, these other elements can provide important references that service providers can use to determine next steps. I'd call this level of API service delivery a more inbound approach, but APIs.json also brings outbound effects to the table.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/talks/3scale/apis-json-api-science-outbound.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>Once a service has been rendered, service providers can also provide other elements that can be hung on an APIs.json, just as with Swagger, and other elements of operations. I am already including references to Postman collections in my APIs.json files, and have begun adding API Science statistics and visualizations as part of regular API indexing details.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-recycling.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>This provides both an inbound opportunity for the delivery of new services, but also the publishing of essential outcomes from those services being delivered, that can benefit API service providers. These details can also provide important elements for other API service providers to use. Imagine if API providers like API Change Log could pull in API Science and Runscope details to enhance and augment their own services, providing more details about the availability of services, and the changes that have occurred--then API Change Log can publish their own results, further enriching the index for each API.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-apis-json-community-driven.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>This opens up a community effect, when it comes to delivering vital services throughout an API life cycle. As an API provider I do not have to do everything myself. I can design, deploy, and management my APIs, then allow service providers to index my APIs.json, and demonstrate the value their services deliver, and then choose which services I need--making the API life cycle a more community driven affair, opening the door up to a wealth of potential APIs.json driven services.
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>API Testing</strong><br /><strong> API Monitoring</strong><br /><strong> API Discovery</strong><br /><strong> API Performance</strong><br /><strong> API Proxy</strong><br /><strong> API Cache</strong><br /><strong> API Performance</strong><br /><strong> API Visualization</strong><br /><strong> API Dictionary</strong>
<p>As an API provider I do not have time to do everything, and many of the API service providers out there need valuable meta data about API operations to offer, enhance, and evolve their service offerings. I can take these services and improve my API operations, no matter where these APIs exist, publicly or privately--all I need is an APIs.json file as the seed. All of this moves APIs.json well beyond just discovery, and like Swagger provides a central truth for not just defining the API, but defining entire API operations.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-operations.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong>
<p>We still have a long way to go, before all aspects of API operations are machine readable, but APIs.json can be used today for indexing of the technical side of operations, and with the help of API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint, these elements of operations, can be read, imported, and acted upon programmatically both other systems. Since all of my APIs, now live in their own Github repositories, with APIs.json as a central index, pull requests can be made adding elements to the index, potentially by 3rd parties--further making the API life cycle a community effort.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-technology-of-apis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="center" />
<p>Swagger and API Blueprint have solidly moved beyond an interesting new advancement of the API space, they are being used by start ups, small businesses, enterprise groups, and even government agencies to define the technical side of API operations. When bundled with APIs.json, we can build a machine readable bridge to the other aspects of API operations, like the business side.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-business-of-apis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="center" />
<p>Swagger and API Blueprint both started by providing interactive API documentation, an essential building block for on-boarding API consumers, which is more about API business, then the technical details. These API definition are now moving into other business areas like delivering how-two materials, potentially driving pricing, dashboard elements, or other embeddable elements that can be used across API operations.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-politics-of-apis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="center" />
<p>With the introduction of machine readable API licensing formats like API Commons, the legal, or as I call it, the political aspects of API operations comes into play as well. I am using APIs.json to connect the service composition, tiers, and rate limits, to the technical, and business details that are indexed in an APIs.json file. This is just the beginning, soon other aspects like terms of service, patents, and deprecation policies can also be included, further expanding the APIs.json index of each API, and the collections of APIs.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/tech-business-politics-03-2014.png" alt="" width="90%" />
<p>This is a story of my own infrastructure, but is derived from the research I do across the API space. I work hard to not be just an API pundit, and actually practice what I preach. I'm slowly moving from the academic version of this, to a fully functional version, that is my own architecture that I use to run the API Evangelist network.
<p>I gave a version of this talk last night at 3Scale offices, and will be giving various versions of it at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea</a> this coming week in Barcelona, and again at <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon in Colorado</a>, on May 20th. Over the summer I will continue to evolve my architecture for both Kin Lane and API Evangelist, and evolve a new set of stories, and talks that I can give, helping me share my approach.
<p>I will publish the slide deck of each talk that I give at APIDays and Gluecon on my Github repo when ready, for everyone to reference. Thanks for paying attention.
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale and WSO2 are both API Evangelist Partners</em>

<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/27/thank-you-berlin-for-helping-make-apidaysberlin--apistrat-europe-so-amazing/">recovering from an amazing week in Berlin for APIDaysBerlin / APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, and catching up on some work, which <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/28/weekly-apireport-for-april-27th-2015/">included a 20 hour push to get the last weeks API.Report completed</a>, I am now preparing for <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th in Barcelona, Spain</a>. The event is billed as "The Independent Conference on APIs, NLP, and Language Technology", and brings together may of the leading API minds, but also the cross-over with APIs and language technology--something you won't see anywhere else.
<p>While the main event is next Wednesday and Thursday, things kick off the night before, on Tuesday, May 5th with some pre-conference workshops and partying at 3Scales office:
<ul>
<li>17:30 - Practical 3scale API Management Crash Course at 3scale's office (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/API-Meetup-Barcelona/events/221808677/">register</a>)</li>
<li>19:00 - API Meetup Barcelona: Marketing APIs: Do's and Dont's and APIdays warm-up party at 3scale's office (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/API-Meetup-Barcelona/events/221808517/">register</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then starting Wednesday, the main event kicks off with many of the usual suspects, who don't just lead in the API industry, but also work very hard traveling the world evangelizing API best practices:
<ul>
<li>Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), <a href="http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx">CA Technologies</a> - From Stacia to Hyperion and Back Again: A Hypermedia Hero's Tale</li>
<li>Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Hypermedia Evangelist - JSON API: your anti-bikeshedding weapon</li>
<li>Bruno Pedro (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpedro">@bpedro</a>), <a href="https://redbooth.com/">Redbooth</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API Changelog</a> - How to Automate API Discovery</li>
<li>Andy Thurai (<a href="https://twitter.com/andythurai">@andythurai</a>), <a href="https://ibm.com">IBM</a> - Machine Learning with IBM Watson and Alchemy API</li>
<li>Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>), <a href="https://klout.com/home">Klout</a> - Topics as an Engine For Insights</li>
<li>Tony Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/thetonyblank">@thetonyblank</a>), <a href="http://Context.io">Context.io</a> - The True Value Of Email Data</li>
<li>Manfred Bortenschlager (<a href="https://twitter.com/manfredbo">@manfredbo</a>), <a href="https://3scale.net">3scale</a> - What does it take to design and run a successful API program?</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't stop there. What really makes me happy about APIDays, is the increasing number of local, and regional API talent the event attracts. I see a number of other talented API prfoessional, doing some very interesting talks, ranging from the business of APIs to hypermedia. This is the most important aspect of APIDays in my opinion, is that it doesn't just import API talent from around the world, it also cultivates and grows local and regional API voices.
<p><a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apidays-mediteranea-2.jpg" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a>
<p>I will also be speaking, closing up the two day event, with a talk on what I'm calling "A Community Driven API Lifecycle", where I'll showcase some of the work I'm doing around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, driven by Swagger, Docker, and brought together using APIs.json. This is the first in a series of talks I'll be doing on this subject, concluding with Gluecon in Colorado, later this month.
<p><a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">If you aren't registered, visit the site and get signed up before all the tickets are gone, the space is limited, and I know they have already sold most of the tickets</a>. I look forward to hanging out with some of my old friends in the space, as well as making some new ones, and hearing their stories of API design, deployment, management, discovery, and integration, in one of the my favorite cities--Barcelona.

<p>I am still coming off the high that was&nbsp;<a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe</a> this last April 23rd through 25th in Berlin. There were a number of talks that I enjoyed, ranging from open data, to 3D printing, to hypermedia--too many to list. I love the German view of technology, data privacy, and generally on what is going on in the United States.
<p>Other than the wifi issues, the conference was a success. We sold out the event, with 450 people in attendance (goal was 400), and even with the final day being on a Saturday, the turnout was very impressive. Each session I ran, was full of questions, with an IoT session, and another architecture session running 10 minutes over, because there were so many good questions, I didn't want to stop.
<p><a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/apistrat-berlin-2015/apistrat-berlin-pano1.jpg" alt="" width="95%" /></a>
<p>We are processing the videos from the conference, which I will spend time watching each one--telling stories along the way. So keep an eye out on API Evangelist, and on the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/category/blog/">@APIStrat blog</a> for each video release, as we will be trickling them out as each video comes off the production line over the next couple of weeks. &nbsp;
<p>Thank you to 3Scale, APIDays, and Commerce Tools to for making sure this amazing event came together. I'm just now getting my brain back in gear, so look for more &nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat stories over next couple weeks!
<p><a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/apistrat-berlin-2015/apistrat-berlin-pano2.jpg" alt="" width="95%" /></a>

<p>In addition to helping be the MC for the API event, one of the conversation I am facilitating at&nbsp;<a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe this Friday in Berlin</a>, is an open data discussion on the main stage. What better place to discuss the world of open data and API, then in Germany. The country has some of the strictest laws when it comes to protecting the privacy of German citizens, and when it comes to API access to data, I couldn't think of a better place to have an open discussion in 2015.
<p>I have invited two data specialists to the stage Friday afternoon:

<p>I am looking forward to hearing what Ali and Jonathan have to say about open data, from a European perspective. To help stimulate the conversation, I've also invited one of our keynotes to join us:
<table width="95%" align="center">

<p>I do not have a list of questions prepared for these gentlemen. I think we all know the space well enough, just discussing who they are, their projects, and the wider open data space is sure to fill up 30 minutes of main stage action. I am eager to hear Chris's keynote as well, as I'm extremely interested in what <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> is doing.
<p><a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/#tile_registration">If you aren't registered, there are like 20 tickets left, so you better jump now before the conference sells out</a>.

<p>I'm very fortunate to be the API Evangelist, as I get to spend my days discussing, some very lofty ideas, with extremely smart and entrepreneurial folks from across many different business sectors. An ongoing conversation I have going on with Bret Tobey (<a href="https://twitter.com/batobey">@batobey</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/">Carvoyant</a>, is around the big data generated around the Internet of Things. Many companies that I engage with are very closed about their big data operations, where Carvoyant is the opposite, they want to openly discuss, and figure it out as a community, out in the open--something I fully support.
<p>In reality, the Internet of Things (IoT) is less about devices, than it is about the data that is produced. If someone is exclusively focusing on the device as part of their pitch, it is mostly likely they are trying to distract you from the data being generated, because they are looking to monetize the IoT data exhaust for themselves. Carvoyant is keen on discussing the realities of IoT data exhaust, and not just from Internet connected automobile perspective, but also the wider world of Internet connected devices. If you want to join in the discussion, of course you can comment on this blog, and via Twitter, but <a href="http://gluecon.com/announcing-the-apistrat-un-workshops/">you can also come to Gluecon in May, where 3Scale, API Evangelist, and Carvoyant will be conducting an IoT big data workshop</a>, on this topic.
<p><a href="https://www.carvoyant.com">If you aren't familiar with Carvoyant, they are an API-driven device that you can connect to your vehicle, if it was manufactured after 1996, and access the volumes of data being produced each day</a>. Carvoyant's tag line says "Your Car, Your Data, Your API" -- I like that. This is why I enjoy talking through their strategy, because they see the world of APIs, connected devices, and big data the way I do. Sure there is lots of opportunity for platforms, and developers to make money in all of this, but if there is user generated content and data involved, the end-users should also have a stake in the action--I do not care how good your business idea is.&nbsp;
<p>Carvoyant does a great job of acknowledging that the car is center to our existence, and the data generated around our vehicles is potentially very valuable, but it is also a very personal thing, even when anonymized. Here is how they put it:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Connected car data tells the repair industry when a vehicle needs service &ndash; the moment it happens. &nbsp;Connected car data tells an insurer how a driver actually drives and if they are eligible for a better priced policy. &nbsp;Connected car data tells gas stations if a vehicle is low on gas. &nbsp;If a vehicle has not been to the grocery store for a while, than it may be time to make an offer.</em>
<p>The difference in this conversation, is Carvoyant isn't just making this pitch to investors, the automobile industry, and developers, they are making it to the automobile owners as well. They are working to establish best practices for gathering, accessing, storing, and making sense of Internet of Things data exhaust, in a way that keeps the end-users interests in mind. Every platform should think this way. There is too much exploitation going on around user-generated data, and Carvoyants vision is important.
<p><strong>Monetization Via Classic Affiliate Program</strong><br />When it comes to figuring out a healthy monetization strategy for the Carvoyant platform, and resulting data, the company is starting with a familiar concept, the affiliate program. Establishing potential referral networks, where end-consumers, and developers of apps can refer potential customers to businesses, and when there is a successful sale, an affiliate commisison is paid out. This is a great place to start, because it is a concept that businesses, developers, and consumers will understand and be able to operate within, without changing much on the ground behavior.
<p>If you identify a customer in need of vehicle servicing, and successfully refer them to a local service center, you can be paid money for making the connection, something that when done right could also be applied to the end-user in form of credits, discounts, and other loyalty opportunities. An affiliate approach to the monetization of data via the Carvoyant API makes for an easy sell, but one that can be applied to a myriad of business sectors ranging from automobile services to food, shopping, travel, and much, much more. While an affiliate base is being established, Carvoyant can also begin to look towards the future, and shifting behavior.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-highway-open.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p><strong>Monetization Beyond Affiliate</strong><br />While I'm fine with Carvoyant kicking off their monetization strategy with a calssic affiliate program, I feel pretty strongly there are many other opportunities for monetization, something that Bret agrees too. When you think about the central role cars play in our lives, the opportunities for inciting meaningful experiences, are endless. While the real money is probably around the mundane realities of the average car owner, the chances for serendipity, beyond these known areas is the exciting aspect. How do you not just help users find the best time to get their oil changed, but also take that side street, instead of freeway that might involve a chance experience that could range from dinner, to concert, or just find that right sunset location.
<p>There is a pretty clear conversion event involved with the affiliate model. A user clicks on just the right deal, a sale is made, and revenue is kicked back from the business to the platform, developer, and is something that hopefully reaches the end-user in meaningful way. What other types of "conversion events" (man I hate that phrase) can we identify in car culture. How do we encourage people to take public transit, share vehicles, or how do we make large fleets operate more in harmony? With the right platform, I think we can quickly go beyond the traditional affiliate transaction, and develop a new wave of monetization around IoT data, that goes beyond just eyeballs, and links, and is more about engagement and true experiences.
<p><strong>Experience Credits Not Just Sales&nbsp;<br /></strong>Just like moving beyond the affiliate conversion event, I think we can go beyond the transaction also being currency or sale based. How do we create a more experience based currency or credit system that can be used equally to help businesses generate sales, and establish loyalty with customers, but also allow developers and end-consumers to exchange units of value, attached to valuable automobile data? If a $20.00 deal on a $30.00 oil change, results in a $2.00 affiliate revenue share, what would the value of pulling off the freeway, taking the side road and catching just the right sunset picture be worth? How do we incentivize experiences, not just sales? If we are continuing to weave data generated from our physical worlds, it cannot always be about money, there has to be other value generated, that will keep end-users engaged in valuable, yet meaningful ways.
<p><strong>Sharing Economy</strong><br />As our worlds continue to change, partially because of technology, but also because of other environmental and societal pressures, what value, sales, and experiences can be generated from the data exhaust produced as part of the sharing economy? If its our car, our data, and our API--does this apply when it involves our ZipCar usage, rental car, or possibly Uber? How does the sharing economy impact data generated via connected cars. When the end-user is the center of the conversations, these alternate use cases have to be included, and make sure privacy is protected, but also opportunities around that data to be securely shared with users. This isn't just a shared automobile data conversation, it is potentially applicable to any other objects we rent and share like tools, equipment, supplies, and anything else we may use as part of our business and personal lives.
<p><strong>Commercial Fleets<br /></strong>Just like the data exhaust from personally owned vehicles, or automobiles used as part of the sharing economy, the opportunities, and patterns available for commercial fleets will look very different. How do we incentivize efficiency, cost savings, and safety in fleet operations? What do the affiliate deals, and experiences look like for fleet vehicle drives, and the companies that own and manage them. Think of the implications of big data exhaust from vehicles in heavily regulated industries, and public service entities like police, and fire. We will also have to think very differently about how revenue is generated and shared, as well as look at privacy and security very differently. This doesn't reduce the opportunity in the area of fleet management, it just needs a significantly different conversation about what we need for this class of automobile.
<p><strong>Establishing Common Blueprints&nbsp;<br /></strong>Beyond the individual conversion events for individual drives, or the wider opportunities for sharing economy companies, and commercial fleet operators, where are the opportunities around identifying common patterns of vehicle usage at scale? How does the vehicle usage of the LAPD differ from NYPD? What does the average residential vehicle owner in San Diego look like, versus the rental car tourist for San Diego? Using connected vehicle technology like Carvoyant opens up a huge opportunity for better understanding car culture at a macro level, beyond what the auto industry, or maybe Department of Transportation sees. How do we begin having honest conversations about our vehicle usage, and allow drivers to be educated about larger studies, allowing them as a company or individual to opt in, and share data, to participate in larger studies? We have to make sure and consider the bigger opportunities for understanding beyond any single endpoint on the connected car network, and look at entire cities, states, countries, and other meaningful demographics.

<p><strong>Lots More To Discuss, Something That Needs Transparency<br /></strong>This is just the beginning of these types of discussions. I have a handful of companies, like https://www.carvoyant.com, who have access to huge volumes of extremely valuable user-generated data, who are trying to figure out how to developer useful tech, make money, all while doing it in a healthy way that protects end-users privacy and security. I am not opposed to companies making money off their API platforms, and user generated data, I just insist that APIs always be used to make it more transparent, and technology such as oAuth employed to give end-users more control, and a vote in how their data is collected, stored, shared.
<p>This post is about me working through my last conversation with Bret, and hopefully will result in several more stories here on the blog. <a href="http://gluecon.com/announcing-the-apistrat-un-workshops/">I also want to prime the pump for the APIStrat IoT Big Data Workshop at Gluecon in May, and make sure my readers are aware the workshop will be happening, and if you want to join in the conversation</a>. This is just one of many posts you'll see from me discussing the big data exhaust generated from Internet connected devices, but also the potential for transparency and healthier platform operations when APIs and oAuth are employed. These types conversations are only going to become more critical as more of our physical worlds are connected to the Internet.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-hurdles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I was reading&nbsp;<a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2015/04/15/obama-administration-agrees-with-sunlight-agencies-should-disclose-what-data-they-keep-private/">Obama administration agrees with Sunlight: Agencies should disclose what data they keep private</a>, which is a topic I follow closely, as I'm passionate about government opening up their data inventory, but also because worked as a Presidential Innovation Fellow on helping agencies open up their data. I completely agree that agencies should have to disclose lists of even their private enterprise data repository, to help establish a clear picture of just exactly what is public or private government data.
<p>While reading the post, I noticed the statement that, <em>"most agencies seem to have accepted and understood the need for this change, but some concerns have been voiced"</em>:
<ul>
<li>The Department of Commerce, which holds a very sizable amount of data, has cited &ldquo;certain technological issues that are creating major barriers to creating the PDL as described [in OMB&rsquo;s guidance].&rdquo; This is a concern, but Commerce appears to be working through these issues with relevant officials in the General Services Administration and OMB.</li>
<li>NASA has expressed significant concerns with the new process, specifically citing pushback and time constraints from its FOIA office and legal team. They claim that &ldquo;identifying and indexing our open data is our priority,&rdquo; and indexing its non-public data will take valuable capacity away. Fortunately, NASA has bought into the public process and are engaged in meaningful conversation about the agency's concerns on the Project Open Data Github.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting that agencies cite the technology challenges in complying with open data mandates. In my experience working on opening up government data, right after the education of the average government employee, challenges imposed by the technology they use is one of the biggest hurdles. To make my point, you can't find "Export Spreadsheet to JSON" as a Microsoft Excel option. Most systems encourage the output of PDFs from core systems, which when it is combined with lack of open data export capabilities, makes opening up of inventories extra work.
<p>We need to continue the hard work to educate the average government employee about open data principles, and the little things they can do in their daily work, to help collectively move their agency towards being more open, and machine readable by default. However, we also need to push harder on software vendors, who are providing technological solutions to make sure the imports and exports of data in open, machine readable formats is a default feature. There also needs to be more mandatory API language in procurement contracts, requring APIs to be baked in by default in all government systems--should never be an afterthought.
<p>There is only so much responsibility that we can place on the average government employee, trying to get their job done on a daily basis. All of the companies who are profiting off selling the government software solutions, also need to share in the responsibility, and help make sure our government is equipped with the proper tools. Government being open and machine readable by default shouldn't create extra work for agencies, it should help reduce their workload.

<p><a href="https://withknown.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/known/known-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I see a lot of software come and go. I adopt applications, tools, and online services for a variety of reasons, with some of these tools remaining a regular part my operations, with others coming and going with time. I'm currently abandoning Evernote, in favor of my own home brew note tool, while I'm also adopting a handful of new <a href="https://luckymarmot.com/paw">HTTP Client tools like Paw</a>. There are a number of reasons these tools go away, sometimes the reason I needed them shifts, other times they evolve to a point where they are no longer useful to me, and other times they go away after an acquisition, or running out of money, and not being able to keep the lights on. In the end, when i find tools I believe in, and deeply integrate them into my life, and want to better understand how I can help ensure they will be successful.
<p>One tool that I am using as part of my daily operations is <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a>. If you are unfamiliar,&nbsp;Known it is a simple, social publishing platform for your blog or website. I'm am personally invested in helping the Known founders find the customers they need to be successful, and as part of this effort I wanted to practice explaining Known to my readers, while I also expand my own understanding of the role Known can play in my own operations.
<p><strong>Reclaim Your Domain</strong><br />For me, Known is about reclaiming my domain. Rather than posting tweets to Twitter, I post to Known, and using the Twitter API, Known publishes a copy of the Tweet to Twitter. I maintain the original copy of my Tweet. When I write a wall post I can publish to LinkedIn, as well as Facebook, with the original content staying in Known. <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">This is all about POSSE for me, which is&nbsp;Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</a>. As a professional who operates in online world, it is extremely important to me to retain ownership over my content, and intellectual exhaust.
<p><strong>Managing My Life Bits</strong><br />Known allows me to manage a significant portion of my life bits, which include simple status updates, posts, photos, bookmarks, and audio, then provides me with a handful of connected services like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and SoundCloud which I can then syndicate these life bits to. The important piece of this for me, is thinking about my life bits, independent of the services I use to publish and manage or publish these life bits. Employing a POSSE approach allows me to decouple these valuable life bits, and manage them in a central location, which helps me achieve my goal of keeping control my digital exhaust.
<p><strong>Syndication Channels</strong><br />The cloud version of Known offers a handful of common channels for me to syndicate my life bits to, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Foursquare, and SoundCloud. I'm not a big Foursquare user anymore, but I'm still active on all the other channels, and Known provides me a simple interface for managing syndication to these channels. &nbsp;The cloud version of Known is a great start for any individual, or organization looking to get a handle on their basic
<p><strong>Public or Private Page</strong><br />Beyond the whole syndication aspect, Known provides an important aggregation, and centralization feature for me, by providing a single public, or private page (if I decide), where I can find all of my syndicated Known content. Since most of my presence is public, <a href="https://kinlane.withknown.com/">I keep it open as a single, public place where you can find all of the content I syndicate across Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn</a>. With a simple keyword search available, the platform provides a valuable resource that I am increasingly using to re-discover content across my network.
<p><strong>Plugins and Webhooks</strong><br />Where Known really starts to get exciting for me, is when it comes to the extensibility via plugins and webhooks. First I can create simple webhooks for syndicating out my life bits to custom channels of my choosing. It is easy for me to setup custom webhooks, that can handle various syndication scenarios for me. After that I can create plugins, something I haven't done yet, so I can't speak intelligently about. I am working to carve out time to setup my own custom Known installation, and craft my first API driven plugin. I envision this as the gateway to not just syndicating to other public channels, but also to custom, private channels that I define.
<p><strong>API Driven Known Targets</strong><br />The default syndication channels that Known provides, coupled with the opportunities the plugins and webhooks introduce, open up an endless amount of POSSE scenarios for me. I envision an entire API stack deployed to support various types of Known installations. I'd like to see API driven docker containers that can auto deploy with a push of a button to provide additional syndication channels for Known. Once you have a POSSE approach established with Known, defining new API driven channels that you can take advantage of, brokering further sydnication, transformation, and storage of all of my personal and business life bits, become much easier envision.
<p><a href="https://withknown.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/known/known-publishing.png" alt="" width="95%" /></a>
<p><strong>Who Could Put Known To Work?</strong><br />This is where I need to work through some of my initial thoughts about Known, and push things to new levels. Known makes sense to me when it comes to reclaiming control over my content, while also giving me a single doorway to create additional channels for syndication and publishing, beyond the Twitter, and Facebook I am already working with. However when it comes to other folks who aren't familiar with reclaim, or POSSE principles, it becomes challenging to explain how it can be put to work.
<p>First, I want to disconnect Known being a tool for individuals. Known can bring together any online channels used by an individual, organization, business, event, or any other entity you can think of, that would possibly have an online presence. What are some of the possibilities for putting Known to work:
<ul>
<li><strong>Businesses</strong> - To manage a centralized social media, blogging, and other online presence for a small to large business.</li>
<li><strong>Churches</strong> - Provide a central place for church groups to manage their online presence, from an interface everyone can use.</li>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong> - Give the local library a single way to control messaging online, and engage with constituents via a single&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Museums</strong> - Perfect for museum collections to manage the communication and messaging around exhibits that have online presence.</li>
<li><strong>Schools</strong> - Known has already made inroads into schools, perfect for overall institutions, as well as departments, classes, or individual projects.</li>
<li><strong>Public Space -</strong> Parks, dog parks, open space, and other public space often have a social media, and messaging presence, where Known can be put to work.</li>
<li><strong>Farmers Market -</strong> A farmers market needs an active presence to stay engage with constituents, and known can be used to control, and centralize messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Neighborhoods</strong> - Bringing it down to the hyper-local level, allowing people to work together and manage the messaging and communication within a neighborhood.</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong> - Providing a common platform for government agencies to work together on projects, as well as manage digital strategies for any size of agency.</li>
<li><strong>Group Projects </strong>- I can think of a number of other project scenarios that have an online presence ranging from open source projects, to public / private sector partnerships that could use Known.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a start, when it comes to the potential uses of Known. I'll keep working on them, and post individual stories that help people see the ways they can put Known to work. I see the platform providing a free, low cost, asw well as a privately hosted solution that individuals and organizations can use to get a handle on their content and digital presence.&nbsp;
<p>This is the toughest part of the Known proposition, is quantifying the endless scenarios of where it can be applied. In my opinion this is the potential, while also a significant challenge for the platform.
<p><strong>How Do I Explain What Known Is?</strong><br />One of the biggest problems with concepts like Reclaim Your Domain, and POSSE is the average Joe or Jane citizen could often care less about these concepts, that is until you find a relevant context, tha is important for them--which is why I'm writing this post. If you are a photographer, you are going to care about your photos more, and think more critically about where and how you publish. If you are a writer, or creative professional, keeping track of your work, ideas, and intellectual exhaust should be important, but for many other people, businesses, and organizations, this is just not relevant or prominent in their existence.
<p>Known is not a social media management tool, even thought it possesses many of the same characteristics. It is more about staying in control of content across all of your digital channels, in an easily extensible way. The trick is to help people see the potential, encourage enough developer to develop plugins, and craft valuable webhooks, so that individuals, businesses, organizations, institutions, and government agencies find it immediately useful. In a regular start-up, the focus would be on the most lucrative targets, like within the enterprise, but I'd like to see Known find an audience within some lucrative circles, as well as in the long tail of use, serving those who can't afford costly solutions, but could be providing a valuable community service.
<p>The trick is going to be helping everyone understand the wide, API driven of potential, to the point where they will pay for a pro service, and help keep the platform thriving. Not everyone is moved by the important reclaim and POSSE concepts, but could really benefit from the easy of use, centralization, and management of their presence across the increasing number of platforms we are publishing to across any number of industries.
<p><strong>Where Would I Pay For Known?</strong><br />I have upgraded my Known account to the pro version. It is important to me that I support them, and I use the tool every day so it is worth me paying for the service. Beyond that I'd be into paying for premium services, the ability to publish links, stories, and other items to specialty channels. Think event or blog syndication, or possibly tapping interesting transformation services that I can apply to my audio notes, podcasts, or other life bits. (translation, transcription, etc)
<p>I also imagine in the future there being premium plugins that I can discover, and add to my Known projects with a push of a button. I'd be happy to pay developers a premium for these bells and whistles, something that Known could definitely take a cut of. Once I get more comfortable with plugin development, and the potential for API driven channels, I'm sure I'll have more ideas about areas I'd cough up cash for, within the Known ecosystem.
<p><strong>POSSE In Addition To Reciprocity</strong><br />I am increasingly using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, as what I call a reciprocity service. I use it to move valuable information between the cloud service I depend on. Countries establish reciprocity agreements for trade, Zapier gives me tools for managing trade between the digital spaces I operate between. Known adds a POSSE layer to my digital operations, where Zapier allows me to move things around, Known allows me to publish once, an syndicate wherever I need to. While I could hand code all of this myself, these services allow me to do it in a simple, extensible way, that saves me a lot of time and resources.
<p><strong>An Open Source Solution</strong><br />In 2015, it is getting increasingly rare for me to adopt a new tool or service, if there isn't an open source aspect to it. Most of the time I end up depending on cloud services instead of the open source edition, but having the option to migrate my own platform, or help deploy customized solutions using open source version is important. In my opinion open source, software as a service, and APIs all work together in creating a winning business model, something Known is taking full advantage of.
<p><strong>The Known Team</strong><br />Another important factor in all of this for me, is the Known team. I believe in&nbsp;Ben Werdmuller and Erin Jo Richey, the Known founders. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/07/22/reclaim-your-domain-hackathon/">I've spent enough time with both of them at the Reclaim Your Domain events we have organized to get to know them</a>&nbsp;well. They don't just have the skills, they have the vision, and a healthy view of how the Internet should work.&nbsp;Ben believes that technology is an empowering force that makes the world better by leveling playing fields, informing citizens, and connecting us all, and with a background in cognitive science, Erin loves creating engaging, human-centric software within the context of sustainable businesses. #win #win
<p><strong>The Known Mission</strong><br />Known is a start-up, but it has a larger mission, to help empower people through simple, standards-based, open source software, which also has free, and low cost cloud services for those without the resources to deploy all of it on their own. This type of approach to software is the future in my opinion. It is not just the open source software, in conjunction with a free and paid cloud model, it is also the embracing of APis as a distribution channel--this API-centric focus is why I believe in Known.
<p><strong>Making Sure We can Have Simple, Powerful API Driven Tools Like Known</strong><br />I am writing this post, first to help me better understand, and articulate the potential of Known. I've been using for over a month now, and it is proving to be very useful in managing the daily syndication of content across my primary channels. I'm working to better understand the potential for webhooks and plugins, and extend it to better meet my own operational needs. Along the way I want to better understand how to on-board other people with the concept, whether they are into the reclaim or POSSE concepts, or just looking to get a better handle on the their social media.
<p>Along the way I am going to tell stories about how I am using Known, in hopes of helping people learn how they can put it to work as well. Services like Known, are good for the API industry, and I want to see it succeed, so in addition to helping the platform find new users, I also want to help encourage the development of API driven plugins, and webhooks that can be employed via Known. I can see Known becoming an essential building block like I've identified Zapier as, I think it could become that important for API providers to consider offering a plugin for.&nbsp;
<p>It is also important for me to help Known find success using its simple, pro business model, and potentially find future revenue opportunities, that help keep the lights on, but also don't change the platform in ways that take it down the wrong path. I trust Ben and Erin to make the right technological, and business decisions, what worries me is that people won't see the potential, and the importance of API, standards driven tools like Known, that help us take control of our digital personas. It often seems in this crazy tech driven world that the best products don't always win, and intend to ensure this doesn't happen to Known.
<p>We need more tools like known that help empower everyone to own the valuable exhaust that they produce online daily, not ceding control to the endless waves of exploitative platforms and applications that seem to step up and try to own people's valuable life bits. Look for more stories about Known from me, as I continue to extend its functionality to help me maintain my POSSE stance when it comes to my digital presence.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I get a number of folks contacting me about their API ideas, and email or call me, looking to schedule a meeting or briefing to discuss the API ideas. This is something I always reply with a request for existing links to the portal, blog, Twitter, and Github accounts of those involved. Even when companies are doing something interesting, I prefer to approach it like any random Joe or Jane would, from the public portal, with very little information up-front. Your overall approach to API, the value it delivers, and ease of integration should speak for itself, in my opinion.
<p>I am sure there are plenty of companies still who would prefer a briefing, meeting, call, or other personal touch, sales or pitch like engagement, but increasingly in an API driven world, a self-service, pull approach is preferred. A well done API shouldn't have to rely only on traditional marketing. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have these mechanims in place, but by pushing this approach on media, developers, and other potential consumers, you are doing yourself a disservice in many situations--going backwards, not forwards.
<p>There is also another group of people who contact me, who really don't have a thing yet. They are just looking for validation, and potentially stimulate discussions that will get them more attention from would be investors. As with the previous group, I think the "just do it" approach works best. You are going to stimulate much more meaningful discussions amongst investors if you are actually doing something, and generating real buzz amongst developers. Additionally you never know, you may be able to bootstrap and make it happen, without attracting major investment.
<p>I know many of you traditional busines folks are used to a push approach to getting your business out there, but when you are looking to make inroads in the API economy, your majority investment should be about creating a platform that people can visit, and pull the value you generate into their worlds, via a self-service model. Right behind the portal, you should have robust marketing, sales, and other outreach mechanisms, but your primary outreach approach should be just about doing what you preach, not scheduling calls to discuss and convince someone of what you do.
<p>For me when someone insists on jumping on a call to discuss their API, is an immediate filter of bad ideas. If someone is just talking, and not showing, more often than not, there isn't anything really there. If you have to defend or hide your idea, it probably shouldn't be out there anyways.

<p><a href="https://github.com/JustGiving/JustGiving.Api.Tools.Postman"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/just-giving-postman.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I have been slowly <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">adding Postman Collections to many of the APIs indexes</a>&nbsp;for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">new master stack</a>. I index each API using an APIs.json file, as well as provide a master APIs.json which brings together all of the APIs, into the single portal I've published to Github. Within some of the APIs, you will see a Postman icon, allowing you to easily import the API definition into postman, directly from each APIs landing page.
<p>When <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">I first published that I was publishing these Postman collections on my Alpha API Evangelist blog</a>, someone from the <a href="https://api.justgiving.com/docs">donation API platform Just Giving</a> said they also <a href="https://github.com/JustGiving/JustGiving.Api.Tools.Postman">prepare Postman collections for their developers, and publish them to Github</a> for their API consumers:&nbsp;
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At JustGiving we give our API consumers a set of collections to import to make their jobs even easier, we also use the "Environments" feature to substitute different values depending on whether you're using our Sandbox or Production environment - it's a real time saver and also helps when supporting our API consumers.</em>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/postman-collections-as-unit-of-measurement-for-transactions-in-the-api-economy/">Postman is a measurable unit for transactions in the API economy</a>, and I feel it goes a long way in helping API consumers onboard with each new API. As a developer, if I can import a Postman Collections into my client, within just a couple clicks, and be up and running with an API--I am going to be a much happier camper, and be that much closer to integration.
<p>I'm considering adding Postman collections as a building block under API on-boarding, and encourage API providers to follow JustGivings lead. Postman Collections is kind of the new API explorer, allowing developers to quickly test drive an API they are going to integrate with. With my own platform, I'm also going to play with publishing Postman Collections, complete with API keys that I refresh regularly, allowing immediate, but limited access my APIs, for anyone who stumble across them.&nbsp;
<p>Like Swagger, Postman is increasingly a machine readable definition that API proviers should be producing, alongside Swagger and API Blueprint for the entire API surface area, and APIs.json for indexing of all API operations.

<p><img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I have had Steve Willmotts of 3Scale's response to the announcement that Twitter was cutting off firehose access for over a week now, and bringing the higher level access completely in house via their Gnip acquisition. You can read the response from Gnip via their blog post&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.gnip.com/twitter-data-ecosystem/">Working Directly With the Twitter Data Ecosystem</a>, and from DataSift in their&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.datasift.com/2015/04/13/twitter-datasift-gap/">The Twitter/Gnip Gap: Data Licensing vs Data Processing</a>. Steve and I are in agreement with the points made via his <a href="https://www.3scale.net/2015/04/losing-innovation-twitters-firehose-mistake/">How Not to be a Platform: Twitter&rsquo;s Firehose Mistake</a> post. Where I really struggled with over the last week, in producing a official response, was after responding <a href="https://medium.com/politics-of-apis/how-to-be-a-platform-making-tough-partnership-choices-b9cd473821de">How To Be A Platform: Making Tough Partnership Choices</a>, from my friend Tyler Singletary.&nbsp;
<p>You see, I agree with everything Tyler pointed as well. He's right. Twitter has probably made the right decision for Twitter, and based upon their goals and understanding of the Twitter API ecosystem, did exactly what should be prescribed. I have lots of opinions around the Twitter ecosystem, and how&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter Continues to Restrict Access to Our Tweets</a>. However, when I step back, and put on my API operations hat, everything Tyler points out, is valid in my opinion. Twitter gets to decide who has access, and in respect to their goals, chooseing the Gnip offering over the DataSift offering makes sense. It's all about the winning solution, and where the ROI is when it comes platform operations? Life is good when you are on the winning team. However #winning != #good, and #winning != best outcome. I also guess, that #open != good, and #open != best outcome either. There are no absolutes in API land--sorry.
<p>Where Tyler stance really begin to lose its shine for me, is when you zoom out. You see Tyler, you are on the winning team. You have access to the firehose, and you operate squarely within in the #winning conversation (I know you don't have direct firehose, and rely on Gnip). Those of who aren't, the conversation looks very different. Let's take a look at the Gnip vs. Datasift product comparison you provide, but from my stance.
<p>After two phone calls with Gnip sales team, they realized I didn't have the requisite $45K to move forward, not worthy of continuing to talk to this one. All I'm left with is Twitter REST and Streaming API, and DataSift. Gnip isn't even on the menu, isn't even an option in my world. So only the players who can afford to be at the table, get to play--kind of sounds like a familiar story to me. Where have I heard this before? Oh in every industry, throughout history. This isn't the API promise I've been hearing! ;-)
<p>I remember in 2007 and 2008 when Twitter was built on these same principles. Only people with the big money could step up and play on the platform. Oh wait no! It was the other way, the people with money didn't give shit about Twitter, and only us small fish were playing on the platform. We were building widgets, Wordpress plugins, developing meaningful analytics, mobile apps, and Twitter encouraged it all. Prove what you are building on the public API, and when you are ready, we'll get rid of any rate limits, or even give you the firehose-just ask us, we'll give you the access you need--the firehose rhetoric was much different 5 years ago:
<p><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2010/enabling-rush-innovation">Full investment in this ecosystem of innovation, means all our partners should have access to the same volume of data, regardless of company size. More than fifty thousand interesting applications are currently using our freely available, rate-limited platform offerings. With access to the full Firehose of data, it is possible to move far beyond the Twitter experiences we know today. In fact, we&rsquo;re pretty sure that some amazing innovation is possible.</a>&rdquo;</em>
<p>The rush of innovation did happen, but does anyone have access to the same volume of data regarless of company size in 2015? Does the argument that Tyler lays out today, apply in a 2007 or 2010 Twitter ecosystem? How does this line of thinging impact the new startups who are trying to get API developers to come out to use their ecosystems, now, when the big money players don't care about them? Sure things have changed, things have evolved, but I just don't buy the argument that the better product (Gnip) won out over the other product (DataSift). In the neatly package and positioned arguement sure, it makes sense, but if you zoom out, it just doesn't hold weight, now or then. Things have changed for Twitter, but things haven't changed for new startups who are building platforms--they are still depending on early adopters to build on their platform and turn them into a success story, and attact VCS and users.
<p>This is what leaves many of us so disgruntled, its not Twitter making the hard decisions around platform operations. It is their abrasive stance towards those of us who are not in the club, and their lack of communication about the ecosystem, and their sharecropping, and poaching of the best of ideas along along the way, and changing the tune slowly over time. Honestly, I feel like they've done a good job in correcting much earlier bad behavior recently, with their overall partner program, API operations, and evangelism, but their whole firehose position is lacking the bigger ecosystem vision--it is just self centered. Twitter exploited the community when they could, they hand picked a group of partners (<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/12/the-twitter-firehose/">Gnip, DataSift, DataMinr, Mass Relevance, and many more</a>) to serve this need when they didn't have time or resources to do it on their own, and now that they see that there more dumbass enteprise peopleare willing to pay Gnip prices for our data, over people building on the long tail, I respect the whole thing even less--to the point where I almost have stopped giving a shit, and begun moving on.
<p>Steve is right, Tyler is right, and sure Twitter is right. You might even be able to build an argument that Twitter doesn't owe the long tail of ecosystem developer anything for helping make Twitter what is, which would be a tough argument in my opinion, but you can't argue that Twitter doesn't owes a certain amount of responsibility to end-users to keep platform operations real. This means not making firehose access something only the IBM, Intel's, Oracle's, and other big $$ companies of the world can afford to build (at scale) on Twitter. Sure the rest of us can still build on the public REST and streaming API, but what then? Why would we build on the platform if we reach the 100K token limit, we have no guarantees for the future--that is unless we are in the good ol boy club, and don't have anything to worry about.
<p>I guess in the end, this is all about access (pun intended). Like with many other areas of the world, if you are lucky enough to have a priveleged position, which I'm not just pointing out the Klout / Twitter releationship. I'm also talking about the other cozy VC relationships I've witnessed companies enjoy with Twitter, versus the companies who I've seen that do not enjoy such priveleged access. The conversation cannot just be about he merits of Twitters decision, and the performance of Gnip and DataSift, without including the bigger ecosystem picture. Making the hard API ecosystem decision argument is only valid, if they take into consideration all of the macro issues that truly impact a platform, not just those of the platform owners and its most cherished partners and investors have. While I think Twitter and its investors feel like they own Twitter, us developers, and power users who have been on the platform since early days, also feel like we have a certain amount of ownership too--an ownership Twitter has shown they don't respect.
<p>Twitter definitely holds the cards at the moment, but eventually as more of us power user realize we are just fine without a Twitter presence, Twitter will face becoming the NBC of social media--still relevant, but are you still truly relevant? Not forever.

<p>The most important stories told across the API space, the ones that have the biggest impact on API providers, and ultimately API consumers, are the stories that come out of the trenches of the API operations at the leading public API providers. This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist started APIStrat, and what the audiences over the last 3 years of operating APIDays and APIStrat have consistently requested--more stories from the trenches.
<p>With this in mind, we've asked S&eacute;bastien Cevey (<a href="https://twitter.com/theefer">@theefer</a>) of The Guardian to come to <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, and share a story from API operations at the worlds leading media API provider. S&eacute;bastien wanted to share their view of what Hypermedia APIs are, by comparing them to a classical RPC architecture and ad-hoc "JSON APIs". He will also cover key benefits of using Hypermedia APIs (cacheability, discoverability, evolveability/extensibility, simplicity, interactive nature), presented in the context of real-world examples and the different constraints of REST (HTTP, URIs, verbs, hypermedia controls like links and forms).
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/theefer"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sebastien-sevey-the-guardian.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>What I like about S&eacute;bastien viepoint, is 1) he works at one of the most progressive media outlets in the world, where he is actually putting APIs to work, and 2) his pragmatic approach. S&eacute;bastien will talk about what hypermedia APIs are, anchoring his lessons in real-world examples from Guardian operations, but he will also discuss the caveats of this API style, acknowledging the realities of API operations. There are no perfect solutions, but technologists like S&eacute;bastien&nbsp;are pushing the discipline of API design forward, while also balancing with the real-world reality that exists in their workplaces.
<p>The keynote from S&eacute;bastien Cevey (@theefer) of The Guardian, <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">will kick off the first day of @APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, so <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/#tile_registration">make sure you are registered today</a>, so you don't get locked out when we sell out (which we are very close). If you are looking to learn more about hypermedia APIs, I recommend starting with S&eacute;bastien's keynote, but also make sure and join us Saturday morning for the entire hypermedia API session, where you can learn more about this fast growing API design consideration, from those pushing the conversation forward, and putting hypermedia APIs to work in the real world.
<p>I look forward to seeing you all in Berlin, next week!

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-idea-struggle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I've been monitoring an emerging slice of the API, that has been dubbed "microservices" for some time now, and you've even heard me explore its use, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/25/aspiring-to-be-a-network-of-loosely-coupled-gitnodes-over-being-an-organization-of-github-repos/">when describing my architectural approach to redesigning more core API stack for my internal systems</a>. I&rsquo;m slowly redesigning my internal API stack, keeping them as small as possible, throughout all aspects of operations, deploying each endpoint in a single dockerized container, that contains the OS, database, web server and all server side API code. I'm also using Github, in conjunction with <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/what-is-missing-on-my-microservices-using-apisjson/">APIs.json to assist me in my orchestration</a>, throughout every aspect of these APIs lifecycle from design to testing&mdash;all a new approach for me when managing my APIs.
<p>Is defining my APIs in this way, so that the definition is much more than just the actual API endpoints, but also include the entire backend, and lifecycle workflow Microservices? Fuck if I know. One thing I do know, is I've had enough conversations with folks who are doing microservices, resulting in me saying&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">several times that the micro services definition is something very personal</a>. Something which the first 10 times I said , sounded very positive, but after experiencing multiple people telling me what I'm doing isn't microservices, I can tell the term definitely will continue to be very personal&mdash;very much in the same way conversations around REST or Hypermedia has gotten personal on forums, and HN threads.
<p>You know what this tells me about microservices? Is it is more about power, control and influence, everything from enterprise architects stating their endorsement of the concept, down to the individual architects, who love to make sure you know that the way you are doing it, is WRONG! I don't think there is a single definition of "microservice", and much like REST, I think we'll hear plenty of &ldquo;right&rdquo; definitions, by the enterprise justifying what they are doing, and those who are selling something to the enterprise. Is there anything wrong with this? Nope. Just not my style, not my game, and has shown me over the couple months how the concept is not a fit for me.
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stick in the realm of API. It is a completely bullshit term, that means everything, but you know what? Somehow it escaped the IT, architect, and vendor ownership that SOA and now microservices possesses. For me APIs have long been more than just the tech, it is also about the business and politics of any platform implementation, so why can&rsquo;t it contain my architecture styles as well? So from here forward I will be closely paying attention to microservices conversations, but you won&rsquo;t hear me use the word, as I&rsquo;m more comfortable in API land, and what it has come to mean to the wider public&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t give a shit about what the enterprise adopts, or doesn't.
<p>Microservices will reflect the power and control of the entities behind them, unlike APIs, which also possesses that characteristic, but also quickly shifts the conversation to be more about the innovation and opportunity that developers bring to the table, and the end-users who put that to use. Let&rsquo;s make sure as we do not get caught up in the architectural discussions behind the technical curtain, and that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">we remember why all of this API stuff is working</a>. Let's not get caught up in all the value being just about our architectural styles, and re-live a classic IT tale, ignoring that the real value is what people actually do with our services.

<p>This is something I talk about often, but it has been a while since I&rsquo;ve done a story dedicated to it, so I wanted to make sure and take a fresh look at what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable footprint for any API&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care if it is public or not. This definition has grown out of five years of monitoring the approach taken by leading API providers, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">is also baked into what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable APIs.json definition</a>&mdash;which provides an important index for API operations.
<p>What do I want to see when I visit a developer area? More importantly, what does your average developer, or API consumer need when they land on your API portal? Let&rsquo;s look at the basics:
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal -</strong> A clean, easily accessible, prominently place portal landing page. This shouldn&rsquo;t be buried with your help section, it should be located at developer.[yourdomain].com. '</li>
<li><strong>Description -</strong> As soon as developers land, they need a simple, concise explanation of what an API does. Actually describe what the API does, not just that it provides programmatic access to your products and services. </li>
<li><strong>Getting Started -</strong> Give everyone, even non-developers as place to start, helping us understand what is needed to get started with API integration, from signing up for an account to where do I find support.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation -</strong> Deliver, simple, clean, and up to date documentation, preferably of the interactive kind with a Swagger or API Blueprint behind.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication -</strong> Help developers understand authentication. There are a handful of common approaches from BasicAuth, and API keys, to oAuth--provide a simple overview of how authentication is handled.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration -</strong> How do I sign up? Give me a link to a self-service account signup, and make it as easy for me to create my new account, and go from idea to live integration as fast as possible&mdash;don&rsquo;t make me wait for initial approval, that can come later.</li>
<li><strong>Code -</strong> Provide consumers with code, whether they are samples, libraries, or full blown Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Platform Development Kits (PDK). Make sure as many possible languages are provided, not just the languages you use.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Support -</strong> Give API consumers a way to reach you via email, ticketing system, chat, or good ol fashioned phone.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Support -</strong> Provide self service support options via FAQ, Knowledgbases, Forums and other proven ways developers can find the answers they need, when they need.</li>
<li><strong>Communication -</strong> Setup the proper communication channels like a blog and PR section, as well as a healthy social presence on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, or other places your audience already exists.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing -</strong> Even if an API is free, provide an overview of how the platform makes it money, and generates value &mdash; enough to keep it up and running, so I know, as an API consumer I can depend on. Let me know all pricing levels, and provide insight into other partner opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong> Provide a clear overview of how the platform is rate limited, even if they are to protect service availability, let consumers know what to expect.</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap -</strong> Give consumers a look at what is coming in the future, keeping it as a simple, forecast of the short and long term future of an API.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log -</strong> Provide us consumers with a list of all changes that have been made to platform operations, don&rsquo;t limit to just API changes, and include significant roadmap milestones that have been reached.</li>
<li><strong>Status - </strong>Offer a real-time status dashboard of the platform, with a history view of platform status, that consumers can use as a decision making tool, as well as get current platform status.</li>
<li><strong>Github -</strong> Use Github for all aspects of your API platform operations from hosting code, to providing support via issues, to actually hosting your entire developer portal on Github Pages. </li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> Provide, easy to find, and understand terms of service for platform operations, helping API consumers understand what they are in for.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json - </strong>A machine readable index of any API driven platform, providing a single place to find not just the API endpoints, but also all of the essential building blocks of API operations listed above.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my shortlist, of common building blocks that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every API platform should have</span>. Part of the reason I&rsquo;m publishing this, is to provide a fresh look at what I&rsquo;d consider to be the minimum viable footprint, but <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I&rsquo;m also working to get my own API portal for my new master API stack up to snuff</a>, meeting my own criteria. Without a checklist, I forget what some of the essential building blocks are&mdash;you know the cobbler's kids have the worst shoes and all.
<p>After I&rsquo;m done making sure my own API portal meets this criteria, something I can programmatically measure when done, via the APIs.json file, I will provide a self-service evaluation tool that anyone can use to measure whether or not their own portal meets my minimum viable API footprint definition.

<p><a href="http://www.fiberlocator.com/fiberlocator-api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiberlocator-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Somewhere during my weekly monitoring I found the <a href="http://www.fiberlocator.com/fiberlocator-api/">Fiber Locator API</a>, which like all APIs, especially the ones that ask me to &ldquo;request access&rdquo;, I signed up for the service.  Understanding where telecommunications companies have laid fiber optic cable, for me, equals a potentially valuable API resource&mdash;sure I would consider integrating these resources into my applications, and systems.
<p>I&rsquo;m never a big fan of APIs, who make you request access vs self-service registration, but if the API has value, I jump through hoops, so I can can better understand what an API does, which according to the Fiber Locator site:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>FiberLocator offers an application programming interface that gives you access to our database of over 265+ carriers, over 272,000 carrier lit buildings locations and 3,000+ data centers. We created our API services so that client companies can augment their own systems and analyses with our unique data sets.</em>
<p>I filled out the form, providing my name, email, phone and company name, the provided the additional details:<em> I am the API Evangelist, and I&rsquo;d like to write a story about the Fiber Locator API</em>. Something I do a lot. Within 24 hours I received:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiber-api-2.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" />
<p>Then I got this:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiber-api-1.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" />
<p>Both of these emails I replied with the same additional details I included with my request for API access. I received a third solicitation, but felt it didn't add any value to the conversation. From what I can tell, the Fiber Locator API is simply a lead generation form, which routes to sales people&mdash;I see no evidence of an API.
<p>Maybe there is something really there, if there is, this is not how you on-board people. I may just be writing a story about the API, which you should probably encourage, but that is just me, but if you really want developers to integrate fiber location into their applications and internal systems, you should probably let us kick the tires, see what the service is all about.
<p>Modern APIs are not a lead generation tool, and API evangelism does not equal sales. If I cannot understand what your API platform offers, sign up to get at least a taste of that value, I&rsquo;m moving on. I&rsquo;ll keep the Fiber Locator API in my database, but I will not be tuning into what they are up to, because by my definition, they don&rsquo;t fit the model of a modern API platform.

title: 'Bridging Our Virtual and Physical Worlds With The Link Creation Studio'

<p>APIs are very much a virtual concept, something that is very abstract, often difficult to explain, and is something that very much lives in the online world. Spending much of my daily life in this world, I&rsquo;m always excited to come across APIs that bridge this digital world, with our existing physical worlds.
<p>At first read, you might think I&rsquo;m talking about the recent growth of Internet of Things APIs, that are connecting physical devices like our thermostats and smoke alarms, to our mobile devices, using APIs. This is part of it, but for this post I&rsquo;m referencing APIs that don&rsquo;t just connect to objects in our physical world, but they actually bind to existing experiences, processes, and other aspects of our personal and professional worlds.
<p>The Link Creation Studio from HP, is this. Using the web interface, or the API, you can create QR codes, and images with digital watermarks, which can be printed, then any user with a mobile device can snap a picture, which then triggers an action, that then takes the user to a specific location online--providing a bridge from a printed object in our physical world, to an online extension of that object.
<p>This bridge comes with the ability to manage the action that is embedded in print, and the resulting online link destination. You can print the QR code, and digital watermarks, and over time see analytics for each user that traverses the bridge, from print to web page. Link Creation Studio users can also manage this experience, and change it over time to get the resulting experience, that both the publisher, and users desire.
<p>The Link Creation Studio is a simple, but very powerful tool for building bridges between our physical and online worlds. The fact that it has an API is extremely significant, allowing these bridges to be built in real-time, from any system, whether that is a classic business print situation like business cards and product brochures, or something more ad-hoc like a individual person printing flyers, and hanging on telephone poles in their neighborhood, for a party that weekend.
<p>This type of API implementation is more significant to me than just an API that connects, a single device to my mobile phone. This type of API can be used in a million different business, and personal scenarios, resulting in some potentially very interesting, and impactful implementations. These are the APIs that fascinate me, and hold the most potential for making big change in my opinion.
<p><em><strong>Disclosure: </strong>This story came out of a paid review I did of the HP Link Creation Studio, but as anyone who has paid me to do a review knows, a paid review does not equal a good review, let alone extra stories. These were actual thoughts I had while conducting the review, that I wanted to share once done.</em>

<p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve had an increasing number of conversation with folks about in the last couple months, and a friend of mine Tweeted in response to today, resulting in this lovely rant. This is about two very separate problems, in which the solutions are what I'd consider significantly overlapped. I&rsquo;m talking about the need to make sure the valuable metadata, as well as underlying resources made available via an API is accessible to search engines, while also making sure the it is all <a href="https://www.section508.gov/section508-laws">Section 508 compliant</a>, providing critical access to people with disabilities.
<p>In response to my recent post, on "Why The New API Blueprint Sharing Button From Apiary Is So Important&rdquo;, said:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>I'm heavy user of <a href="https://twitter.com/apiaryio">@apiaryio</a> but disappointed with discoverability features of the product. Google just ignores them. <a href="https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd">https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd</a>
&mdash; Kristopher Kleva (@klevland) <a href="https://twitter.com/klevland/status/586289568632168449">April 9, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>First, this is another reason why the API Blueprint being more open is important, anyone can now come along and not just build an SEO API documentation solution, they can get access to Apiary.io users who desire such a solution. Ok, that might seem bad for Apiary, but in situations that Apiary is not concerned with, this allows the community to step up and serve the long tail, and if it is something that concerns Apiary, it lights the fire under their ass to consider adding to the road map (sorry Jakub &amp; Z, I know I"m a pain ;-).
<p>Second, it allows the community to step up and serve what I'd consider the critical long tail&mdash;like Section 508. In our rush to deliver the latest in technological innovations, we often forget about significant portions of our society who, well, aren&rsquo;t like us. How many leading apps and platforms that you use are Section 508 compliant? I guarantee almost all API tooling is not&mdash;something we need to address now, and is a&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/us-government-apis/508/us-government-apis/dX34Bn5dcWQ/-Avg7rEbaNkJ">topic where discussion is currently happening the federal government circles</a>.&nbsp;
<p>I am a big fan of Swagger UI, and Apiary, and what they have done for API design, deployment, management, discovery, and evangelism, but we need to keep working on the next generation of UI, and UX that is easily indexed, and works well with assistive technologies. Ok, at this point the hypermedia folks want to kick my ass--bring it! ;-) Kidding. What I am talking about should happen in conjunction with well designed, hypermedia fueled clients, not instead--both camps should be addressing making sure all clients or SEO and 508 friendly.
<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a note on the opportunity here. There is huge potential to develop an open source API UI component that can use Swagger and API Blueprint as the core definition, implementing a more SEO and 508 compatible experience, something akin to <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate from Trippit</a>. I&rsquo;m thinking rather than a pull technology like Swagger UI does with its JS interface pulled from a Swagger definition, and I&rsquo;m guessing Apiary does a similar pull from API Blueprint docs?? A more of an HTML, CSS push or publish of functional, static API documentation, that uses JavaScript and APIs to operate&mdash;just some raw thoughts on how to take next steps, its now up to you.
<p>I guarantee if you made an open source set of tools to support this, you'd get the attention of government at all levels, around the world, something that would open up significant other opportunities.&nbsp;

<p>I was just doing on of my regular check-ins with Pratap Ranade (<a href="https://twitter.com/pratapranade">@pratapranade</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono</a>. We try to make time to catchup on what each other are up to, and find where we can work together to incite API evolution. Pratap sees the space like I do, that APIs are more than tech, possessing huge potential when it comes to empowering folks to make change within their companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and the wider industries and countries they exist in.
<p>Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t go into too much detail about the projects we are working on until they are ready, but I just spend over an hour talking through some pretty interesting use cases that have occurred via Kimono Labs, in which Kimono users are scraping data and content from existing websites, and crafting some pretty interesting APIs. I&rsquo;m not just talking about the fun things like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/marchmadness/explorer">March Madness</a> or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer">World Cup</a> going on over at Kimono, I&rsquo;m talking about influencing elections, addressing disaster recovery issues, and providing timely data that can influence how financial markets are working (or not).
<p>The best part about these stories, is the work is being done, in many cases by people who don't have traditional programming skills, they are more hackers who have identified a problem, and <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">used Kimono to scrape the data, and generate simple APIs</a>, that help provide a new way of delivering API-driven solutions to the problem being targeted. Pratap said they are quickly becoming a big data company as well as a structured data API solution, because of the number of folks stepping up to address the long tail of data.
<p>I just wanted to provide a taste of what we are working on. I&rsquo;m always left pumped up about potential of APIs, after hearing what Kimono is up to. If you want a taste of some of the stories I'm talking about, check out the <a href="http://blog.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono blog</a>.

<p>This is another story that came to mind while listening to the last episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>. As John and Steve were talking about the API definition format Swagger switching from Reverb to SmartBear (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">thanks for shout-out about my Swagger post</a>), they were discussing how Microsoft is using Swagger as part of platform operations, and made sure and reminded us listeners that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all this has been done before</span></strong>. Bringing up a never-ending theme &nbsp;in the world of APIs, that we just can't seem to shake loose.
<p>When people bring this up, what do they mean? Yes, modern API definitions like Swagger, are very much like earlier incarnations of WSDL and WADL. Ok. What now?
<ul>
<li>We shouldn&rsquo;t do it? It won&rsquo;t work? Don&rsquo;t even bother with Swagger?</li>
<li>We should learn from history, and earlier efforts, and make sure we don't same mistakes?</li>
<li>We should be scared of Swagger, and run for the hills, hide in a bunker?</li>
<li>We should all switch back to SOAP and use WSDL?</li>
<li>You just like to tell me I'm wrong, and has nothing to do with technology?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why I bring this up, is because more often than not, most of these conversation lean towards the first response &mdash; don&rsquo;t even bother, except you don&rsquo;t really know because people who state &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve already done this&rdquo;, often leave it open ended, offering no constructive criticism. Some even close it with, this is nothing new! Ok, so what then? How does that impact my decision making, now.
<p>I guess, for me, I step back at look at how this applies to the rest of my world. Do we do this with all other trends in our lives? We already did short skirts, why do we gotta do them again? I heard on NPR the other day that open office plan was invented by the Germans in the 1950s, and proven in-effective by the 1970s, and here in this decade we are doing again. Don&rsquo;t you know we&rsquo;ve already done that?  C&rsquo;mon. Sheesh. Aren't there endless things we've already done in the past that didn't work, and we try them again in a different context, with potentially different results?&nbsp;
<p>In the end, the argument holds no weight for me. So what if we&rsquo;ve already done this, or it is nothing new. I had a shitload of WSDLs laying around in 2003, and now in 2015 I have a butt-load of Swagger laying around--in the end I'm optimistic for more meaningful tooling to emerge. Tell me some practical tip that was applied back in the good ol SOA days that I can use today, don&rsquo;t tear down what I do today. If Swagger isn&rsquo;t for you, cool, tell me what is. Tell me how you are solving defining your APIs, mocking servers, collaborating and iterating around the API designs in your world, how you generate server side code, or client side code, and setup your testing, monitoring, and QA, or maybe providing a discovery service, visualization, and IDE tools &mdash; the fact that we&rsquo;ve already done this, means nothing. We&rsquo;ve already done a lot of things.
<p><em>P.S. I really wish I could import my shitload of Swagger 2.0 specs I having laying around in Runscope, but I have to generate Swagger 1.2, import into Postman, generate post man collections, and then import into my Runscope account. Sheesh! ;-)</em>

<p>Yay! Another story generated by listening to <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>&nbsp;(blame John and Steve). I do enjoy sharing my random thoughts while listening to those two. This one is around the SDK discussion during the latest episode, but as they noted, they&rsquo;ve talked about SDKs a lot in the past. This particular reference was again, during the their discussion about Microsoft using Swagger to generate code&mdash;a topic which brought up the usual grumbles from John about SDKs. He loves to hate on SDKs, obviously suffering from severe SDK PTSD.
<p>I agree with his feelings about SDKs, they are well founded, but auto-generating code from Swagger doesn&rsquo;t always involve with the generation of full-blown SDKs. I save a huge amount of time, auto-generating different types of code and scripts from Swagger, which I further clean up and make work for my specific needs. My experience with generating code from Swagger, is more about saving time, than it is about producing production ready SDKs.
<p>Maybe my development world is unique, but I find I still have to get my hands dirty, even when I generate server or client side code using Swagger, requiring me to still play with HTTP and understand response / request details. I get what John is saying, and he is right. I'm increasingly frustrated by companies producing platforms that are more SDK than API, something IoT engineers excel at.
<p>I just wanted to point out there are many layers to the discussion, and that there are no perfect solutions when auto-generating code from API definitions, but it can sure save time in both API deployment, as well as API consumption, and unlike SDKs I still understand the inner working of my apps, integrations, and the APIs they are depending on.

<p>I had one of my followers ask me if there as a &ldquo;gold standard for API deprecation policies&rdquo; out there. I&rsquo;d say that deprecation policies are a little different than some of the other legal building blocks of an API, where the legal is a small portion of it, with the majority really being all about communication.
<p>To answer the question, I recommended Google. Not cause their deprecation policy itself is all the great, it is just because their overall approach to API deprecation is pretty robust&mdash;something I&rsquo;m sure is derived from their experience so far. (wink wink)
<p>API deprecation at Google starts with some pretty clearly stated policies, but goes much further with:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/terms">Deprecation Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-publishers/docs/deprecation">Deprecation Schedule</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v2/data-deprecation">Data Deprecation Details</a></li>
<li><a href="https://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/12/announcing-deprecation-of-google-earth.html">Blog Communication</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the building blocks that Google employs as part of their approach to API documentation. This post is just result of a 15 minutes of Googling around, to respond to the question. Now that I have written this post, and put the topic of API deprecation back on my radar, the next step is to dive deeper and develop a complete picture of how Google approaches API deprecation, as well as other leading players in the space.
<p>At first take, it appears to me that the legal details of API deprecation that are present in terms of use, or as standalone documents is only the start. The winning examples of API deprecation involve making sure deprecation details are always readily available, regularly communicated, and are comprehensive enough to cover the API, data, and other things that matter to developers and end-users.

<p>If I find a new company during my research, it takes me about a minimum of 15 minutes to lightly profile what they are up, and add to my system, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/">if I do a full profile</a>, it can take several hours. All of this adds up to a lot of work, time that would be better spent on actually writing stories, hacking on the APIs, and publishing of the longer form research papers on what I&rsquo;m seeing.
<p>In an ideal world, <a href="http://apisjson.org/">each of these APIs would have an APIs.json in the root of their domain</a>, with details about the company and people responsible for API operations, and as much information about each API as possible. With a single click, I could import the entire profile of a company, and its valuable API resources into my monitoring system, ready for publishing to relevant areas of the API Evangelist network, as well as some of my partner sites like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>--the beauty is, so could anyone else. ;-)
<p>If API providers used <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, I could be connected to their Blog via RSS, their platform Twitter account via the Twitter API, and their Github profile or organization using the Github API. Not only would I have relevant metadata about a company like their name, description, logo, and details about APIs, I would also be connected to a real-time heartbeat of API operations via the platform blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. This is just the start--there are numerous other building blocks you could wire up with an APIs.json file, to keep potential consumers up to speed.
<p>I know it can be hard to se the potential for APIs.json, because there is limiting tooling available currently, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">beyond the open source search engine APIs.io</a>, Even before the next wave of tooling like the internal enterprise search engine, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">visualizations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/apispots">browser plugins</a>, and other tooling are available, you can realize the benefit of being listed on <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and make sure you are fully plugged into my regular monitoring of the API space, which means the chances are much, much higher that I will write a story about what you, and your developers are up to. ;-)

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-feedback-loop.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>This story is derived from listening to the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">API podcast, Traffic and Weather</a>. One of the things John Sheehan (<a href="/admin/blog/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), and Steve Marx (<a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>) discussed during the recent show, was a post Steve wrote as part of his role as product manager, called "<a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2015/04/how-many-http-status-codes-should-your-api-use/">How many HTTP status codes should your API use</a>"? I think the story is extremely useful to read, helping us all think through how we use HTTP status codes in our own platform, but personally I think the real story, is Dropbox talking out loud about their strategy.
<p>John and Steve pointed out on the podcast that someone had tweeted that the story was not in sync with the way Dropbox actually did their HTTP status codes. To which Steve replied, that is why he wrote the story, to talk it out, and solicit feedback. This is how you should be thinking through your API road map, out loud, on your platform blog. When I mention to API providers that the blog is the most important tool in their toolbox, this is what I mean. Your blog isn&rsquo;t just for broadcasting your platform message, it is also about you thinking through thoughts, sharing those thoughts with your API consumers, and potentially getting feedback, which you can consider as part of the overall decision making process.
<p>I am addicted to thinking through my ideas publicly on my blog. For me, a thought isn&rsquo;t fully formed, until its published. I also depend heavily on the feedback from my audience to my stories, in their public comments on Disqus, and Twitter, as well as privately via email and DMs. Talking things through, publicly on your blog, teaches you to think outside the box, let the sunlight in on your thoughts, and forces you to (potentially) properly form your ideas (not always), at least enough to share with the public--even if you don&rsquo;t end up getting feedback, that process alone, is highly valuable.
<p>The best part of this, is after you&rsquo;ve thought through your stories, received feedback from your API consumers, the story also has the potential to live on as a marketing vehicle, which is what I feel most people think of when I mention a blog for API operation. All of this creates a potentially virtuous cycle, that is essential to API evangelism and the overall road map. If you do this type of storytelling regularly, thoroughly thinking through your ideas, and opening them up to public comment before you finalize your road map, eventually you will find that you have momentum in some very positive directions, and are generating some extremely valuable exhaust from your efforts that also brings in new API consumers, and helps keep the existing API consumers engaged.

---

<p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/home-2014/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-drone.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>As my Internet of Things (IoT) research continues, I&rsquo;m applying much of my API thinking from the mainstream API space to the world of IoT. A couple weeks ago I stumbled across the <a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/">3D Robotics Drone API</a>, which to my surprise, was documented using a Swagger specification, providing a machine readable definition of the API, which helped me quickly get up to speed on what the Drone API delivers.
<p>I haven't put much thought into the detail for any drone APIs, something that has been adjacent to my mainstream research for over a year now, but I did have some basic opinions about what a drone API could have. So, when it comes to potential resources, I have to say the  3D Robotics Drone API delivers in all earlier areas I had been considering--with five main endpoints:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Vehicle API </strong>- Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of vehicle, and retrieving single vehicle, including airspeed, ground speed, and battery.</li>
<li><strong>The Mission API -&nbsp;</strong>Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of mission, and retrieving single mission.</li>
<li><strong>The Administrator API </strong>- Access to administrative resources including debugging, logging, and flight simulation.</li>
<li><strong>The User API - </strong>Access operations for browsing and searching lists of user, and retrieving single user.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication </strong>- Session operations for logging in and out, and identifying user.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vehicle stuff I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the resources around logging, and specifically the mission API. When it comes to transparency, and accountability around drone activity, I feel pretty strongly that these types of resources will be essential, and eventually will be mandated by government entities. I&rsquo;m glad that 3D Robotics is ahead of the game, in providing API driven resources that deliver in this way.
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect, when I stumbled across the user and mission management APIs, was the social, online layer. As part of the 3D Robotics Drone API platform, the company offers <a href="http://www.droneshare.com">DroneShare</a>, where you can publish your user profile, and your <a href="http://www.droneshare.com/mission">missions</a>. I was coming at this from the angle of a potential industry regulation tool, or possible drone pilot resource management&mdash;I didn't think it would be done as social, and potential entertainment platform.
<p><a href="http://www.droneshare.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/Droneshare-Screnshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>Here is the description from the site:
<blockquote><em>"This is the beta release of Droneshare. Droneshare is a mission viewing and sharing application that works with ground control applications to let you share your mission data. This project is open source, if you would like to improve it, it is probably best to start at our github repo."</em></blockquote>
<p>This is why I thoroughly enjoy doing my research, because it expands my understanding of specific business sectors that APIs are touching. While I was discovering DroneShare, I also learned about the existence of the "<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/drone/no-fly/">Don&rsquo;t Fly Drones Here</a>&rdquo; project, from Mapbox, which provides a database resource of restricted zones, where you can&rsquo;t fly drones. Which brought me back to my original thoughts, regarding what resource we will need to keep the drone industry sane, rather than just focusing on social and entertainment.
<p>Ultimately I see a lot of patterns here, that reflect several possible drone futures we are potentially crafting. I see social networks, where drone pilots compete for the best jobs, based upon their missions, and equipment usage. I also see potential for entertainment--think about the networks that have arisen for watching people play videogames, and competitive gaming platforms, but apply that to the world of drones. I also see potential elements of government regulation, where the FAA and other agencies, require drone pilots to log their equipment, and activity, logging all drone flights, and potentially sharing publicly via drone social networks to increase accountability.
<p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/home-2014/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m thinking that the <a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/">3D Robotics Drone API</a> provides  a potential blueprint that could be used by other drone manufacturers, and cloud platforms that serve the drone industry. The 3D Robotics Drone API pattern could be held up as an open specification, that the government could weigh in on, making sure the proper regulatory resources are available, and that drone activity can be accessed, and audited via a secure API, available via the Internet.
<p>The world of drones is fascinating to me. On one hand, the security and privacy considerations scare the shit out of me. On the other hand, they are endlessly fascinating to me, and ultimately I&rsquo;m going to be purchasing a drone, so I can play with more, and understand better&mdash;its a business expense you know!
<p>Man, I have a great career. I'm so privileged to be doing what I do&mdash;even if our world is under a threat of attack by drones!

<p>I was dedicating some time to researching APIs in the Internet of things (IoT) space, and stumbled across the <a href="https://api.myfox.me/">Myfox API</a>, serving the <a href="https://www.getmyfox.com/us_en/">Myfox home security products</a>. While the developer portal for the Myfox API doesn't have everything I'd like to see in an IoT developer portal, it is one of the better one's I've seen.
<p>If you think web or mobile app developers suck at providing a simple, and a coherent developer portal and experience, device platform providers are even worse. The Myfox API, has the essential building building blocks, with a simple overview, authentication info, simple Swagger driven API documentation, application management tools, and a clear terms of service for the platform.
<p>Additionally, there is a clear link between the primary Myfox website, the developer portal, and a <a href="https://myfox.me/">myfox.me user portal</a>, for device consumers and would-be developers to easily on-board with everything. I haven't fully profiled that Myfox platform, but at first glance it is clean, well laid out, and most importantly the link between the website, API, and user accounts is clear, and easy to navigate.
<p>As I think this through, and after recently finishing a white paper called <a href="https://research.gigaom.com/report/building-an-api-driven-ecosystem-for-the-internet-of-things/">Building an API-driven Ecosystem for the Internet of Things</a>, for the now defunct GigaOm, I can't help but think the IoT space is going to need to agree on some sort of standard approach for not just managing how they design, deploy, and manage APIs, but also how they deliver developer and user portals. To help you visualize what I mean, consider the number of Internet connected devices any single household will own, all with their own portal, and on-boarding process. #FUN
<p>In short, developers, and end-users will get IoT account fatigue pretty quick. I don't think that we are going to standardize everything across the space, I am not delusional, but I can't help but think that the sharing of some common blueprints, could go a long ways in reducing friction for developers, and device consumers. I'll take my research from the GigaOm white paper and produce a blueprint, that IoT device makers can use, to to hopefully be more successful in deploying their developer portals, platform accounts, and maybe help influence a tiny bit of consistency in how IoT platforms function.

<p>API design service provider Apiary, <a href="https://blog.apiary.io/2015/03/26/ApiBlueprint-button/">quietly launch a new sharing button for API Blueprints, in their interactive API documentation</a>, the other week.

<blockquote><em>"Start sharing your API blueprint with other API enthusiasts, by enabling this feature within your API settings. Simply toggle the &lsquo;Public Blueprint&rsquo; setting on and you&rsquo;re ready to start sharing your API blueprint.&rdquo; also stating that, &ldquo;this is just the beginning of being able to socialize and learn from other public API blueprints."</em></blockquote>

<p>The machine readable API Blueprint definition, driving the documentation now has the potential to be accessible. This may not seem like much, but it is actually fundamental to the health, and growth of the overall API industry. Developers cannot learn from other developers, and from leading API platforms, and share best practices for API design across the space without it&mdash;we need this to grow, and evolve.
<p><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-blueprint/apiblueprint-logo-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>This is one of the reasons <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">Swagger has seen such wide adoption</a>, because it isn&rsquo;t just an open format, it is also because the API definitions that these public platforms generate are also available to share, and learn from. You can still lock down the valuable resources made available via an API, but the interface patterns we apply to our APIs should be shared as widely as possible, for everyone to see. This is why I&rsquo;ve been fighting so hard <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-computer-scientists-scotus">to push back against Oracle in their API copyright case against Google</a>&mdash;API designs do not need to be locked up.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to find API Blueprints on the open web, and on Github for some time now, but this opens up the playing field to be able easily discovery, and engage with existing Apiary, and API Blueprint driven APIs at a new level. Much of what I&rsquo;ve learned about Swagger and API design has come from being able to click on the raw link on Swagger UI, and reverse engineer the Swagger definition behind the curtain. I&rsquo;ve never been able to do this with API Blueprint, or Mashery I/O docs. I have been able to get at the WADL behind the Apigee Explorer, but it is a pain in the ass, and the definitions are usually out of date by the time I get to it.
<p>The effects of Apiary&rsquo;s move won&rsquo;t be some immediate thing, it will take time, but the more API Blueprints that are shared, the more users will learn about the powerful API definition format driving many public APIs&mdash;this is good for Apiary, good for API providers, and good for API consumers. Thanks Apiary for doing this, it makes me happy. It also gives me a head start on making sure <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a> is API Blueprint fluent, and that more API Blueprint driven APIs are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">present in my research</a>.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my travel in 2015, and focus on some important research, coding, and writing. I apologize to all the events I&rsquo;ve said no to over the last couple months, but I hit a wall last year with speaking, and trying hard to make 2015 a much more healthier, and balanced year.
<p>With that said, here is where you can find me this spring. I have three places you can find me in April and May:
<ul>
<li><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>&nbsp;- You can find me in Berlin, putting on <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDays / @APIStrat, April 24th &amp; 25th</a></li>
<li><strong>Barcelona, Catalonia</strong> - I will be speaking at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th, in Barcelona</a></li>
<li><strong>Broomfield, CO</strong> 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apistrat.com/2nd-annual-api-strategy-practice-tech-un-workshops-gluecon-2015/">@APIStrat Tech Un-Workshops @ Gluecon May 19th</a> (1:00-5:00 PM)</li>
<li>Leading the Swagger conversation at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Swagger-API/events/221572540/">Swagger API Meetup @ Gluecon May 19th</a> (7:00-9:00 PM)</li>
<li>Gluecon - I will be at <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon 2015, May 20th, and 21st, speaking</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is all the speaking I&rsquo;m doing this spring, with one tentative date early in June at BYU. I won&rsquo;t be traveling again until the fall, when we do @APIStrat again, and of course @DefragCon!
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be in Berlin and Barcelona, two of my favorite European cities, and of course Broomfield, CO (specifically the Taproom). I am also excited to not be traveling as much, and able to focus on my wider research, coding, and writing. #thanks

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-portal-developer-github.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the developer portals of API providers. I see a lot of things, both the good and bad, while navigating these  portals, and while some of the bad stuff I see are way too big for me to doing anything, there are many little things I see that I could help do something about. Sometimes it is just spelling mistakes, sometimes broken links, and other times I want to rewrite API descriptions, and add to the resources that are available for an API.
<p>During these travels, I got to thinking...what if API providers published their developer portals to Github? Just like I do with my API Evangelist sites. Then I could fork their portal, and submit pull requests with rewrites of the description of what your API does, adding little tweaks, here and there, helping polish the portal--potentially making things easier for developers. I&rsquo;m sure this thought scares the hell out of some companies, who can&rsquo;t imagine, allowing outside input like this, but if you sit down and think about it for a while, it just might make sense.
<p>When I was in Washington D.C., <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/dev-hub/">I created a default portal template that runs on Github</a>. I might upgrade this, and make it available for API providers to use as a forkable template, to seed any API developer portal. Doing this makes it easy to provide a base set of building blocks that every API provider should start with, allowing them to delete the elements that they don&rsquo;t want. I am also considering making a default one, that can be used as a starter developer portal for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms.
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the pull requests that I get for spelling and grammar mistakes I made on API Evangelist, from some of my favorite grammar trolls. Running all of my websites on Github Pages has changed the way I tell stories, and interact with my audience. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">I&rsquo;ve always encouraged API providers to use Github for an increasing number of API management tasks</a>, but actually running your entire portal as a Github repo, would this to a new level. This approach could be used for larger, or smaller developer platforms, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/11/16/public-frontend-and-private-backend-for-my-sites-on-github/">I even use Github pages as a front-end for private API developer portals</a>--ask me how.
<p>It is just a suggestion for you API providers, and soon to be API providers. Github provides a very low cost, scalable way to launch your portal, and you never know, people like me who spend a lot of time in your developer portal, might actually help make it a better place. I wish more API providers would publish their portal as a Github repository, as well as graphic designers in the space help craft template portals, that providers can put to work. My portal definitions will always reflect best practices that I see across the API landscape, but they won&rsquo;t always be the slickest looking when it comes to graphic design&mdash;just not my core competency.

<p><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>The one thing I've learned in five years as the API Evangelist is that us technologists and developers don't always see the world like everyone else. We focus on the perfection of the technology, our own desires for the future, and often miss the mark on what end-users actually need. This is one of the hallmark success of APIs over SOA, is that by accident, APIs jumped out of the SOA petri dish (thanks Daniel Jacobson - <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), and was use solve everyday problems that end-users face, using the technology that is readily available (aka HTTP).
<p>While I think us API folks have done a great job of delivering valuable resources to mobile applications, and a decent enough job at delivering the same resources to web applications, and I guess we are figuring out the whole device thing? maybe? maybe not? Regardless, one area we have failed to serve a major aspect of the business world, is delivering valuable API resources to the number #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet.
<p>We have done a decent job of providing resources to data stewards, <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">helping them deploy APIs using spreadsheets using services like API Spark</a>, but other than a handful of innovative implementations from companies like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">Octoparts</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio</a>, there are no solid API consumption resources that target the spreadsheet environment. Meaning there is no easy way for mainstream spreadsheet users to put common API driven resources to work for them within the spreadsheets that they live in daily--that is until today, with the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://api.blockspring.com/blog/blockspring-for-google-sheets">Blockspring launched their Google Spreadsheets Add-On</a>.
<p>Yeah I know, making APIs work in spreadsheets has been done for a while, via Google Spreadsheets and Excel Spreadsheets, but nobody has standardized it like Blockspring just did. So let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the implementation. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockspring/aihldeahgcpbpmimkdpkafaedhbmfhoh">I went to the Google Chrome App Store, and downloaded the add-on</a>.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" />
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Then using a new spreadsheet, I click on add-ons &gt; Blockspring, and logged into my account. After giving Blockspring access to the Google Spreadsheet via my Google Account oAuth, I was given an API console in the right hand sidebar of my spreadsheet interface. The API options I&rsquo;m given aren't the usual geek buffet, they are everyday use scenarios that would attract the average spreadsheet users.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-console.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" />
<p>&nbsp;
<p>I select the IMDB movie search, which once chosen, I&rsquo;m given the option to populate my spreadsheet with results, providing me with API driven resources, right in my worksheets. The best part is it is complete with one cell as a search term, allowing me to customize my IMDB search.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-imdb.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" />
<p>Using Blockspring, I&rsquo;m given easy to use, API driven resources, that anyone can implement, like visualizing the recent news:
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-tools.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" />
<p>Or possibly evaluate stock volatility clustering, using stock market data APIs (cause you know we all do a lot of this):
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-tools-2.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" />
<p><br />Blockspring gives me over 1000 API driven functions that I can use in my Google Spreadsheet&mdash;kicking everyone&rsquo;s asses when it comes to potential API client delivery. While us technologists are arguing over whether or not we can automatically generated Swagger driven SDKs, and the importance of hypermedia APIs when deploying the next generation clients, someone like Blockspring comes along and pipes in APIs to the #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet. #winning
<p>Now the game will be about getting the attention of Google Spreadsheet users, and developing comparable Microsoft Spreadsheet tooling, and getting mainstream Excel users attention as well. The rest of you will have to get the attention of Blockspring, and make sure your API resources have simple, meaningful endpoints that can be piped in as Blockspring Google Spreadsheet functions. Spreadsheet driven business units should not have to learn about APIs and go look for them, at each individual API portal&mdash;APIs providers should find and education business users about their resources, via one of the most ubiquitous tools in business.
<p>Nice work Blockspring, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/going-beyond-excel-as-a-data-source-for-api-deployment-and-focusing-on-it-as-an-api-client/">helping ensure the space move beyond excel as a data source for API deployment, and focusing on it as an API client</a>, delivering vital API resources to the business users who can potentially benefit the most, and are willing and able to pay for API access in my opinion.
<p>P.S. As soon as I finished this I remembered this story from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/">last weeks API.Report&nbsp;</a>-&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/25/the-api-briefing-free-federal-energy-and-economic-information-delivered-straight-to-your-spreadsheet/">Free Federal Energy and Economic Information Delivered Straight to Your Spreadsheet</a> - not an standardized approach, but definitely an important implementation to showcase.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/streamdata-io-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>I was introduced to <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> the other day, by Gabriel Dillon (<a href="https://twitter.com/gjdillon">@gjdillon</a>) of <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme.io</a>. StreamData.io provides a caching, and push layer for apps to take advantage of, that can be deploy on top of existing APIs. I haven&rsquo;t implemented StreamData.io yet, I am still evaluating it, and at first glance it looks like an interesting new real-time layer, that you can use on top of APIs, to improve application performance and user experience.
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add StreamData.io to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a> right now, however once I start playing with I may add as an API deployment resource as well. I have some verification to do, but I&rsquo;d love to test out the potential for StreamData.io to deliver cache and sync layer for common APIs, doing for APIs, what StreamData.io is doing for apps&mdash;delivering on one of my ongoing ideas for caching high use APIs.
<p>When I was working in Washington DC, I had the pleasure of working during the federal government shutdown, where I wrote a piece <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/01/can-we-depend-on-federal-government-apis/">asking if we can depend on our federal government APIs</a>, and talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/12/caching-apis-with-cloudformations-or-openshift-/">caching APIs with AWS cloud formations, or Open Shift</a>. My objective is to ensure there redundant sources for APIs coming out of government, providing developers with a more stable solution, they can depend on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/multiple-types-of-apisjson-for-discovery/">I even added this thinking into the early APIs.json design, allowing you to define cached indexes of APIs</a>.
<p>I&rsquo;ve added <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a>, and I&rsquo;ll get in there and play with more, as I have the time. Then I&rsquo;ll get a better understanding of what you can do with the API caching and syncing, seeing if it is possible to deliver this layer for my APIs as well as my apps&mdash;something that is even more appealing in this age of Docker containers. #FoodForThought

<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.bizcoder.com/are-you-or-your-customers-leaking-your-api-keys">Are You Or Your Customers Leaking Your API Keys?</a> from Daryl Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) the other day, which spurred me to float up a story in my Evernote, from a couple months back. My thoughts are only related to Daryll&rsquo;s because it is about API keys, and their accessibility&mdash;the similarities stop there. Daryl is talking about a very different layer of key management, which we should all be thinking deeply about.
<p>API key management is an API provider issue, as much as it is an API consumer issue. As an API provider I need to have an easy way to manage all the keys I provide to developers. As an API consumer, I need to have an easy to manage all the API keys I get across the API providers that I depend on. In short, key management isn&rsquo;t easy, and there are no clear solutions that serve both ends of the key management coin.
<p>As an API provider, I use <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure to manage my API keys</a>. Using my API portal, developers can sign up for their own accounts, manage their apps, and the keys that are issued. 3Scale does all the heavy lifting for me, all I have to do is manage my API service composition, and keep an eye on dev usage, as well as keep an eye on my own app usage. I use all my own APIs for my apps too! Sometimes my apps are the bad actors, it not always the developers who abuse API access.&nbsp;
<p>As an API consumer, I&rsquo;m working hard to pull my API key world together, using a <a href="http://api-keys.apievangelist.com/">home brew format I&rsquo;m calling simple api-keys</a>. I&rsquo;m am using Github for all of my API and microservice related projects, so I&rsquo;m beginning to centralize how I store keys, and how I manage them across all my apps. With a central storage, and management process, I&rsquo;m hoping to get a better handle on which APIs I use, and introduce more regular cycles of key management, where I refresh API keys on a strict schedule.
<p>With the work I&rsquo;m doing on the API consumption front, and reading Daryll&rsquo;s post got me thinking about keys. If our API management house is in order, and we can manage different groups of API keys, monitor their usage, and revoke them at will, why can&rsquo;t we just have a pool of API keys that we can just leave laying around? I&rsquo;ve seen many APIs provider default keys, embedded in URLs available in API documentation, allowing you to make sample calls, why can&rsquo;t we apply this a little bit wider? It seems like we could have a rolling pool of API keys, that we leave laying around in code snippets, how-to guides, and stories, which allow instant access to APIs&mdash;which we monitor, and if we see abuse we can revoke, and refresh with new set--easily done if you use Github Gists for storytelling (snippet centralization).
<p>I&rsquo;m going through my entire API stack, and generating Postman Collections, and I&rsquo;m considering generating some API keys that are designed for use in specific stories, 101 resources, and other public and private evangelism efforts. It is just a thought at this point, that I wanted to put out there for discussion. Seems to me, if we really want to reduce any friction in on-boarding, we could start using &ldquo;some&rdquo; API keys in conjunction with SEO, SMM, and other existing evangelism metrics and analysis tools that are in our toolbox.

<p>This post is extracted from a deep dive I've been doing into the Swagger ecosystem, as part of regular conversations I have been having with Tony Tam (@fehguy), trying to understand how we can better tell stories about Swagger. I've been tuned into things for a while now around the Swagger community, and there is a lot going on, but from the outside, some of this can be hard to see. Seeking a better understand what is the Swagger community, I wanted to take a walk through the sites, forum, and Github repositories.
<p>First let&rsquo;s start with the basics, what is Swagger? Merriam Webster defines Swaggers as: : to walk in a very confident way : to walk with a swagger. ;-) Seriously though, Swagger is a machine readable format (either JSON or YAML), for describing an API, providing a description of API operations, in a way that other applications can read, and understand. Even though Swagger is machine readable, and designed for other applications, it has also become a language for humans to describe and collaborate, around a shared, quantifiable, vision of what an API can do, throughout all stages of the API life cycle.&nbsp;
<p>If you want to learn about Swagger yourself, you can tune into these channels to learn more:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/">Website</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SwaggerApi">Twitter</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api">Github</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swagger-swaggersocket">Google Group</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal with this post is evolve my understanding and awareness of what Swagger is, and hopefully along the way I can help increase yours as well. In my experience, many people have a very distorted, and limited understanding of what Swagger is, and I&rsquo;d like to take some time to evolve that. When I started this research, my objective was to help Tony deliver a new website, and on-boarding materials for Swagger, assisting people of all skill levels in finding all things Swagger. I am just taking this moment to walk through what at I have so far, and craft a more robust version 1.0 narrative about what Swagger is, something that blogging helps me work through.
<p>One of the biggest misconceptions I find when I talk with folks about Swagger, is that it is interactive documentation, when that is actually Swagger UI--when it comes to Swagger all roads start with the Swagger specification:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec)">Swagger-Spec</a> </strong>- The goal of Swagger is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md">You can find version 2.0 of the spec here</a>, which is the current active version in use. The Swagger spec lets you describe all the essential aspects of API operations, with information about the operator, the host and basePath for the API, details about what type of content it produces or consumes, like JSON or XML. Most importantly it lets you describe each of the paths for an API, with details on parameters, responses, and other details of each specific API path. Swagger also provides you with the ability to describe the underlying data model definitions, describing the valuable resources being served up via APIs.
<p>To grasp the last paragraph, you have to have a pretty solid understanding of the moving parts of an API, but in short the Swagger spec gives us a language to potentially map out all of the common parts of an API. It also allows me to describe the security for each API, and tag to organize APIs into specific buckets. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">I use Swagger to describe the almost 20 APIs my business uses daily, with varying amount of detail about each resource, and the information it serves up</a>. All the 20 of the Swagger definitions provide me with a machine readable map of my own IT infrastructure&mdash;as well as a common language that almost any other developer, or potentially not developer can learn to read, and work with.
<p>With Swagger we now have a common way to communication around the APIs we develop, and also map out the public APIs we also depend on like Twilio, SendGrid, or even Twitter. Now what? Why do we do this? <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">There are an increasing number of incentives emerging for why you generate machine readable API definitions like Swagger</a>, which is part of the reason I&rsquo;m looking to further quantify the Swagger community, so I can add to the master list.
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what I&rsquo;d consider to be the primary building blocks of Swagger, developed by the Swagger team, as part of the core offering:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">swagger-ui </a>- </strong>Generation of interactive API documentation, which Swagger is often known for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger-codegen</a> -</strong> Generation of client code in a variety of languages using a Swagger definition.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js">swagger-js</a> -</strong> A JavaScript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or Node.js.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-socket">swagger-socket </a>- </strong>A REST over WebSocket tool for creating real-time integrations with Swagger.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node-express">swagger-node-express</a> -</strong> Swagger module for Node.js w/express module</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-scala-module">swagger-scala-module</a> -</strong>&nbsp;Swagger support for Scala.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor">swagger-editor</a> -&nbsp;</strong>A visual editor for Swagger.      
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those six repositories represent the core tooling that the Swagger team has evolved around the specification, providing what I&rsquo;d consider to be three stops along the API life cycle:
<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Server Code</li>
<li>Client Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Swagger is often known for its interactive API documentation (aka Swagger UI), but there has also been a lot of work done on the codegen platform, and editor, taking things well beyond just API documentation. This is just the beginning of what is possible with Swagger. In an effort to find out what else is being done with Swagger, and what is being built with the specification, I wanted to see what the community is up to, which platforms they are integrating it into, and what other standalone tooling is being built using Swagger.
<p>I want a better understanding of the core group of companies who have embraced the Swagger specification, and baked it into their own platform. I know there are hundreds of them out there, but finding them can be easier said than done, especially when I'm looking some sort of public announcement, blog post, press release, service description, to use as my reference. So far I have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">49 companies</span></strong> that I&rsquo;m tracking on, who have pulled the Swagger spec, and incorporated into their own platform and infrastructure.

</table><p>Finding websites that have implemented Swagger UI is harder than you think. There are only three search engines I could find that let you search the source code of websites for JavaScript files and code. Ultimately I ended up mostly depending on my own ability to find new APIs, and manually uncover whether or not Swagger was actually in use. I&rsquo;m working on a stack of Swagger and API Blueprint discovery search engines, but they aren&rsquo;t quite ready for this dive.<br /><br />Next I wanted to look through some of the tooling that has evolved as part of the Swagger community, which Github is definitely the place to begin this journey. <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=swagger">When you search Github for the word Swagger, you get almost 1000 repositories</a>. I was going to programmatically explore these results, but found that manually browsing through them was the best path to take, allowing me to make a decision on what each developer was up to.<br /><br />The one thing I learned doing through this process&mdash;Swagger means many different things, to many different people. Most refer to Swagger, and mean Swagger UI, while others refer to it as generating server side code, or maybe client side code. Moving forward, there needs to be a lot of work done helped educate people about first, what Swagger is, a specification, and what are&nbsp; each of the areas of tooling that are built on top of the Swagger specification.<br /><br />Even after looking through the almost 1000 Swagger related Github projects, things are still very hazy for me, but I did learn a lot along the way, about what languages, frameworks and platforms developers are using Swagger, and the types of tools and integrations they are developing.
<p>The best way to look at all of these projects is by language&mdash;here is the Github breakdown.
<ul>
<li>411 JavaScript</li>
<li>135 Java</li>
<li>61 Ruby</li>
<li>41 Python</li>
<li>32 PHP</li>
<li>31 Scala</li>
<li>22 C#</li>
<li>17 Shell</li>
<li>13 Clojure</li>
<li>8 Groovy</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t accurate, because many of the JavaScript repositories are actually other languages. I forget to make sure Github knows what language a repo is sometimes too. Regardless, it gives you an idea of which programming languages developers are using to work with Swagger&mdash;one layer to look consider.<br /><br />Beyond the programming languages I want to know which platforms and frameworks developers are applying Swagger. Here are 36 frameworks and platforms I&rsquo;ve identified so far.

<p>I've been tracking on the potential for voice APIs since Siri was first announced, a topic that often meant telephony like from Twilio, or audio transcription from Popup Archive and Clarify. When I close my eyes and think about the the future of APIs and voice enablement, it is more akin to the Siri example, where the digital world is (supposedly) just a voice command away.
<p>Imagine making all your employee directory, company calendar, or product catalog available via voice commands. How do you do this? You do it with APIs, and a voice enablement platform in-between the application developers, and the available API resources. Much like all other voice enablement, I think we have a huge amount of work to get anywhere close to the pictures we all have in our head, when if comes to voice enablement.
<p>It is my mission to find these signs across the API landscape, and keep an eye on what they are doing. One platform that is now open for beta is <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK">Amazon Echo</a>. Amazon says, <em>"Echo is designed around your voice. It's always on&mdash;just ask for information, music, news, weather, and more.&rdquo; </em>APIs are how we will deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of this equation. The difference between Apple Siri, and Amazon Echo at this point, is Amazon will let you (API providers) help deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of Amazon Echo discovery equation.
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK">signing up for the beta</a>, and if I get access, I will share more stories. I encourage you to sign up as well, and if you have any work your doing with Amazon Echo, or know of other API driven voice-enablement platforms I should be paying attention to, let me know.

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-micro-definition.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I am evolving <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">my own personal microservices definition</a>, something that is constantly changing, as I work on my infrastructure, read other people&rsquo;s own definitions (no shortage these lately), and continuing having conversations with smart folks across the space. I had the pleasure of having Mike Amundsen over the other night for dinner, and after having some interesting discussions about community, and potential micro services design, I&rsquo;m adding a couple of elements to my microservice definition list.
<p>In my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">last post</a>&nbsp;on this, I listed seven criteria I congress as part of my micro services definition:
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to add two elements to my list, considering some of the other elements I&rsquo;ve noticed at play when it comes to API bloat:
<ul>
<li>minimal ownership</li>
<li>minimal dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimal owners is a pretty easy one for me, as I&rsquo;m the owner of all my microservices&mdash;the buck always stops with me. However, It is a good reminder to make sure all of my services have a vCard applied to their <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son file index</a>. It is important to easily known who is responsible for any public or private API, and with APIs.son and Swagger, this is easy to do.
<p>When it comes to minimal dependencies, this gets a little tougher for me. My world isn&rsquo;t too bad, because my systems are small, and I&rsquo;ve been the only developer.  The down side is I&rsquo;ve been the only developer, and I&rsquo;ve bee lazy about how many dependencies an API might have, and also been fairly sloppy about how I integrate with 3rd party APIs. Adding this item to my list will help me keep an eye on how I establish dependencies between services, keeping them minimal, and well documented.
<p>That is it, I just wanted to add ownership and dependencies to my list of considerations&mdash;I just like making a production out of everything.

<p>There are many areas I track on as part of my research. Things that do not show up on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/23/weekly-apireport-for-march-23rd-2015/">weekly API.Reports</a>, or in my analysis on API Evangelist. One of these is the area of drones. I&rsquo;m fascinated by this potential area in the area of Internet of Things, but until now it was more of a side note, or one possible path for APIs and the Internet of Things.
<p>Amongst the numerous drone stories I curate, I'm seeing more shift in the space towards a developer focus. It isn't just about the drone itself, its about customizing, developing and using the drone as a platform. One recent story I noticed was <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/26/drone-maker-3d-robotics-debuts-open-source-development-platform-to-advance-public-app-innovation/">3D Robotics (3DR), one of North America's largest consumer drone manufacturer, announcing the release of a new DroneKit, which includes an API for drone app development</a>.
<p><a href="http://dronekit.io/">DroneKit</a> has a <a href="https://developer.3drobotics.com/docs">web API defined using Swagger</a>, which is the first Drone API I have actually added to my system. I am sure there are more out there, and now that I&rsquo;m tracking on closer, I'm sure I'll find them. The number of drone related stories that flow through my feeds is getting pretty out of control, and I'm thinking the space needs some standard approaches to APIs identified, to help develop better drone solutions, but also potentially inject some transparency into this growing layer of IoT.
<p><a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/"> </a>
<p><a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/"></a><a href="http://3drobotics.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/drone-kit-air-ground-cloud.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a>
<p>Now that I have an API blueprint for a drone API, in Swagger too! ;-) I will be able to start thinking about what some of the API patterns for drones might look like, and what some of the common building blocks might be for managing the technical, but also business, and political side of drone operation. I&rsquo;m thinking that when it comes to drone operations, APIs might not just be a nice to have, they might be something that becomes mandatory in trying to bring this fast growing, not well defined space, under some control.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/whatsapp/whatsapp-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>There was a quick post from Mashable the other day about a conversation with <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> cofounder Brian Acton, called WhatsApp cofounder: <a href="https://mashable.com/2015/03/25/whatsapp-developers-api/">Sorry developers, no API for you</a>. Its pretty common argument you hear from business leaders, regarding why they won&rsquo;t open up APIs. It has been a while since I railed on this line of thinking, so I am taking the opportunity to share why this is such an un-informed, short-sighted view of APIs.
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t at the conference, so I a completely dependent on Mashable for this, but apparently someone in the audience asked:
<blockquote><em>"We have done a lot of transactional messaging using traditional email and SMS, and we've recently moved into the international market," the engineer explained to the audience, who clapped and hollered. "We're desperate to communicate with our members where WhatsApp would be a wonderful platform. We're good developers."</em></blockquote>
<p>Acton stated that they had no current plans to, adding:
<blockquote><em>"We don't want to inundate users with messages they don't want," Acton explained of the choice. "I am very empathetic to your cause. I receive emails on a regular basis from people who want to run their business or want to run something using WhatsApp as the backbone for communication, but we're balancing that with the user experience."</em></blockquote>
<p>Before I point out how narrow this thinking, let&rsquo;s focused on why I use the word un-informed to describe this perspective. Let&rsquo;s say the motivation for not opening up an API at WhatsApp is purely about UX, let&rsquo;s explore some of the options on the table, for API providers to strike the balance they are looking for in this area.
<p><strong>API Management Service Composition</strong> <br />With modern API management services, you have a critical concept called "service composition", where you the API provider, can carve up different levels of access to valuable API resources, deciding exactly who has access to what. API do not equal firehose to the public, where anyone can build whatever they want. If you still see APIs in this way, spend some time playing with the more successful APIs out there like Twilio, SendGrid, and expand your definition of just exactly what an API is, and the role service composition plays.
<p><strong>oAuth For Platform Access &amp; End User Control </strong><br />oAuth is a pretty proven way for managing who is accessing API resources, in a way that the end-user has a say in operations. An API does not automatically open access to all users, when a developers signs up for API access. In the beginning, you have access to your own account as a developer, that is it. It is up to end-users to find these applications, and using oAuth, give (or revoke) access to whatever application they choose. As a platform owner you should consider giving end-users oversight, via oAuth, into how you the platform provider is accessing their data, and require <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> partners to follow this path. If you need example of this in action go look at your Google Account profile, you&rsquo;ll see Google Apps in the oAuth list.
<p><strong>Branding And Design Guidelines</strong><br />What are the official internal branding and design guidelines you use to direct your own WhatsAp development teams&mdash;you have them right? So share these with developers, and give them a chance to share in your master UX vision of how the WhatsApp UX vision, is the one to rule them all. You should be able to articulate the platform UX vision as a set of professionally crafted, publicly shared, design guides, that everyone can see, and use to understand the vision--you never know maybe here would be someone out there in the world that could iterate on them in a meaningful way, that even you might even agree with.
<p><strong>Starter Kits and UX Frameworks<br /></strong>Additionally, go beyond just design guides, and provide developers with HTML, CSS, Images, and JavaScript goodies that will demonstrate how visionary the WhatsApp UX vision is. Think <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.  I&rsquo;m not saying that Twitter nailed it on this front. They did well, but their overall timing and execution left a lot to be desired. As a platform provider who possesses a UX vision that works, open up the platform, provide developers with the proper starter kit, or UX framework that they need to succeed. As a developer, I fail to deliver on your UX vision, it is more a failure of your platform to provide me with proper tooling, than it is my fault as a dev.
<p><strong>Developer Sandbox &amp; Simulation Environments </strong><br />A common approach to managing developer on-boarding, and overall quality control through an API and resulting app lifecycle, is done by providing developers with a sandbox. When nothing is live, and developers do not have any access to actual end-users, what harm is done? What harm to the overall UX experience is there, when developers are only building in sandbox and simulation environments? Until they prove themselves, no developer should move to a production environment, until their solutions is proven to meet WhatsApp strict UX guidelines.
<p><strong>Application &amp; Developer Certification</strong><br />Now let&rsquo;s talk about how WhatsApp could certify developers, giving them access to more resources, or possibly investment from the WhatsApp platform. Many leading platforms require developers to get certified, and / or their applications certified before they get full access to production environments, and end-users. How you craft your developer and application certification is a reflection of your overall UX requirements, and platform goals.
<p><strong>Application Showcase</strong> <br />When you have proper branding and design guidelines, starter kits and supporting UI / UX frameworks, proper developer environments, and official application and developer certification, you should end up with a handful of apps worth showcasing. Maybe its not just a single, competing application, it could be integration with an existing platform (SalesForce, ZendDesk, etc.), or just providing access to valuable messages and conversations. With proper API ecosystem management, an application showcase provides an incentive for developers to build applications that work properly, and reflect the well defined UX vision of WhatsApp.
<p><strong>Partner Program </strong><br />With a robust ecosystem of certified developers, and applications that meet the strict UX guidelines of WhatsApp, surely there will be the cream on top of what is developed on the APIs. Which apps, and platform integrations are the best designed, and provide the most value to WhatsApp end-users? These are the ones that WhatsApp should be investing in, bringing them closer to internal operations, and providing them with additional access to resources, investment when it makes sense. What does the WhatsApp partner program look like currently? I'm sure there is one, just not a formal approach, which includes any transparency, or public involvement.
<p><strong>Zooming Back Out </strong><br />That represents just a handful of the common API management building blocks that are commonly put to work by API providers to help manage their API ecosystems. It doesn&rsquo;t just take technology to make APIs work, it takes a healthy business, and political approach to make sure any API actually works as an ecosystem. I could go on for days about how proper support, communication, and other proven elements, could also be used by WhatsApp to strike the API developer balance system they are looking for, and even possibly create a positive feedback loop with the community, that could be applied to the roadmap.
<p>Now that we are paused, and zoomed out a little bit, let&rsquo;s talk about the narrow perception demonstrated by WhatsApp current stance on APIs. If you open up APIs, developers will just come and mess with your UX version. Nothing else will happen? This is where we shift from being educated about common building blocks, to the limited perceptions that results from this lack of awareness&mdash;you just don't know, what you don&rsquo;t know.
<p><strong>You Have APIs, You Just Aren&rsquo;t Open </strong><br />WhatsApp uses APIs. This is how the mobile app works. The company just does not want to share these resources with developers, because they fear losing control over the UX experience. I guarantee that WhatsApp is sharing data and resources with 3rd party provider, they are just very picky about who these are, and they don't have a formal process for doing so, so they keep their cards very close to their chest&mdash;aka, not open.
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore the darker side of the WhatsApp API conversation. I&rsquo;m not alluding that WhatsApp has less than honorable intentions, my goal is to shine a line into the dark areas that exist, regardless of WhatsApp lack of education of modern API practices, and missing the wider picture of how APIs are actually put to work. This moves into the area of responsibility I feel that platforms assume, when they step up and invite end-users to sign up, depend on, and stay engage with any online, public, API driven web, mobile, or device based application.
<p><strong>Data Access &amp; Portability </strong><br />WhatsApp end-user deserve access to their accounts, and their messages. APIs are not just about developers building the cool app that will compete with WhatsApp, or mess up the WhatsApp UX vision. APIs provide basic data access and portability to the information end-users generate via the WhatsApp platform. Platforms that do not empower end-user data portability, do not operate in the best interest of their own customers, removing from the overall user experience. Something you don't see, because your UX vision is so narrowly aligned with your business goals, not widely aligned with your end-users needs.
<p><strong>Platform Reciprocity </strong><br />Using services like IFTTT and Zapier, API driven platforms are enabling users to to migrate their information between the services they depend on, and add to their own user experience on each platform they depend on, and most importantly between them. APIs, and oAuth enable the flow of information between cloud platforms in a way that protects the interests of users, as well as that of the platforms. APIs aren't just about developers building apps, they are also about users enhancing their own overall experience, on their terms&mdash;moving beyond the platform owners single UX vision.
<p><strong>Diversity &amp; Platform Balance</strong> <br />I just can't imagine any single company, in 2015, thinking they have single UX vision, and nobody could possibly contribute to that, from an outside perspective. As a product owner, I would love to get as much input from my community regarding the next generation UX, because in the end, it is ultimately up to me what I incorporate into the roadmap, what are best practices in the API community, and ultimately which apps get certified, showcased in the application gallery, and pushed to end-users. When you operate a global platform like WhatsApp you can't address the diverse needs of end-users over time, around the globe, without the help of users augmenting and evolving exactly what is the WhatsApp UX vision. When you are a white dude in the U.S., you just aren't going to understand the UX for women of color in Africa, I don't care how much vision you think you have.
<p><strong>In Conclusion, Just Shy of Innovation </strong><br />I&rsquo;m going to end this there. I&rsquo;m not even going to pull out the innovation card and talk about all the potential for new ideas, a WhatsApp API could generate. I&rsquo;ll stick with talking about a handful of common building blocks used across the space to mitigate the UX concerns that API driven platform providers have, and pointing out how narrow the UX concerns are. There are plenty of other reasons for having an API, beyond just developers building apps, that will mess with your UX vision.
<p>Users should have a choice to use their preferred messaging channel (WhatsApp) in any platform they depend on, and be able to manage their experience using 3rd party services of their choice. With an informed&nbsp;approach to API management, you can do all of this, giving end-users more, without compromising the overall WhatsApp UX&mdash;you can carefully craft and evolve it, with the help of your community. As it stands, WhatsApp has an API, it is what the mobile app uses, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that WhatsApp does provide access to 3rd party partners of their choice, they just don't open that up to public knowledge&mdash;they are already doing what they say they don't do, they just aren't open and transparent about the process.
<p>It doesn't take much to launch a proper developer portal, with the essential building blocks like documentation, code samples, and self-service registration. You don&rsquo;t have to give production access to every new developers&mdash;make them build something cool, and prove themselves first. That way you only deliver only the best to WhatsApp users. People are already building unsanctioned apps on WhatsApp (just Google WhatsApp API), not having an API isn&rsquo;t stopping these potentially bad seeds from entering the UX paradigm, there is just no sanctioned place for users to go, when they are looking to extend, augment, or make their WhatsApp work with other services they use, or assume control over their own account and data.
<p>Alright, I'll stop ranting there. I know I&rsquo;m biased, but if you have a popular public mobile application in 2015, there is no reason you shouldn't have at least a public face of your developer program, to answer these question. In the end you are just hurting your own operations, as well as the overall experience for your users. Additionally, I just can't see how the leading position of any mobile is defensible for very long without an API. Things are just too volatile, and end-users are just too picky, someone will always come along and disrupt you, unless you can shift to deliver the UX consumers are demanding.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>When I started API Evangelist, I was all about the Business of APIs, something I still focus on, but increasingly over the last couple years I am focusing more on what I call the politics of APIs. In my opinion, the politics of APIs can be anything from terms of service and privacy policies, to rate limits, pricing, and security, all the way up to court cases, <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com">patents</a>, and government regulation.
<p>Today I want to focus on the very top of that spectrum&mdash;government regulation. The government isn't just getting into the API game, by deploying their own APIs, they are going to also increasingly be getting more involved with private sector APIs. In my weekly monitoring I'm seeing more chatter across several industries, like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382327/44695_Accessible.pdf">the UK treasury getting involved in banking API standards</a>, and <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/03/25/the-final-stage-of-meaningful-use-rules-will-ehrs-finally-pay-off/">a push in the healthcare industry for more interoperability via APIs</a>--just to highlight two recent stories.
<p>This isn&rsquo;t anything new, governments been defining API standards and pitching them to industries for a while now. I personally have been involved in healthcare and energy related standards, as part of Blue Button and Green Button data services. In coming years, what is going to increase, is the number of industries that the government is helping define standard, as well as beginning to get a little more heavy handed about mandating APIs as part of the regulatory process..
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of government regulation, something I feel gets abused on both sides of the tracks, but I understand it is a necessary actor when it comes to balance in markets. To help address some of the abuse that occurs, I think APIs could significantly help bring much needed transparency, and self-service access to the process, for both the public and private sector. I feel the conversation in coming years will move beyond the government just defining industry API standards, but also pushing for real-time interoperability, and execution by companies who operate in heavily regulated industries.
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to keep track of the patterns I see emerging when it comes to API driven regulation, and try to stay informed regarding what is coming down the pipes across business sectors. At various points along the way, I&rsquo;ll do roundups of regulator related news, analysis, and API definitions, or platforms that focus on industry regulation. When it comes to API driven regulation, there will be no black or white, just high a high frequency blur, which will need transparency, and a machine readable interface to make any sense of.

<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/24/reflecting-on-api-management-and-the-apigee-ipo/">reflecting on API management and the Apigee IPO</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking deeper on how the API space has come to be a &ldquo;thing". To kick off this story, you have to start with the API itself, something very abstract, hard to see, let alone convey to the average person. A single API is difficult to quantify, let alone an entire sector, or the companies rising up to service this perceived sector&mdash;think of the argument from early API management service providers like Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee had to make to their VCs.
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the API space has always been a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to me, but along the road from 2010-2015, there has been plenty times, where I question the way things are. I have to give it to Mashery, they saw it early on, then 3Scale and Apigee joined in, and in 2015 we have a real industry, with <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">35 API management service providers</a>, in addition to the expanding number of service providers catering to API design, deployment, management, discovery, integration, and other evolving layers of the API lifecycle.
<p>In 2015, I feel like the API sector is a real thing. Not because 3Scale is still growing, Mashery was acquired by Intel, Apigee is IPOing, or that there is over 35 API management service providers, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">including a number of open source solutions</a>. The API sector is a real thing because there are many other companies, in many supporting area who have emerged, and the overall awareness around the potential of API, by business leaders has grown significantly. How did this happen? It happened because people were telling the story of APIs, whether it was marketing for their products services, or stories on ProgrammableWeb and API Evangelist&mdash;working in concert to create an industry (something).
<p>Within the same thought, I try to grasp how it was that I created API Evangelist. There sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t any strategy to do it. Early on I had a vision in my mind, but five years later, that vision is radically different. I did what I had to do, when the time came, and told the stories that mattered (at least I tried). I am not trying to connect API Evangelist to the overall existence of the API management space, I&rsquo;m trying to work through the details how you define something to a wide audience, in this very abstract world of APIs. I think this applies at the highest levels of industry like API management, to the lowest levels, at the microservice level (soon to be nanoservice, trust me it will be something ;-)&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t something, until it is something, and people believe.
<p>I know. All of this sounds like bullshit. If you think about it though, it begins to make sense (hopefully). Web APIs weren&rsquo;t a thing until John Musser aggregated them together into a directory in 2005. API management wasn&rsquo;t a thing until Mashery, 3Scale, and APigee made it into something. API evangelism wasn&rsquo;t a thing until API providers like Twilio and Sendgrid started sending out armies of evangelists to hackathons. API design wasn&rsquo;t a thing until Tony Tam gave us Swagger to help us visualize our APIs, and Jakub Nesetril of <a href="https://apiary.io">Apiary</a> allowed us to design, mock, and collaborate around an API Blueprint. None of these things were things, until people stepped up and worked really hard to convince others, that they were a thing.
<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand this in action across the API space. The Apigee IPO, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/26/swagger-shifts-hands-from-reverb-to-smartbear/">Swagger changing hands</a>, and other shifts in the landscape are making me think a little deeper about how we got where we are at.  How did we all build momentum in API management, design, or now apply to world of API discovery? How do you make government APIs a thing? How do we ensure hypermedia becomes / is a thing? I mean, not just one possible design constraint, but well understood by all developers, and when it makes most sense to put to use. How has Swagger evolved? What is next for Swagger?  These are all things that make me curious for what the future holds, and how I can help get us there safely, with as few scratches as possible.

title: 'Swagger Shifts Hands From Reverb to SmartBear'

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-highway-open.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><!--,p-->
<p>The news came out yesterday that <a href="https://smartbear.com">SmartBear</a> was taking over ownership of <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, from Reverb. Swagger has been outgrowing its home at  Reverb for some time now, becoming much more than I think even Tony originally imagined. You can find the <a href="https://smartbear.com/news/news-releases/">official announcement from SmartBear on their site</a>, and <a href="http://blog.helloreverb.com/swagger-smartbear/">Tony&rsquo;s thoughts over on the Reverb blog</a>. No need for me to recap, but I did want to provide some of my personal thoughts on the shift in this very important project.
<p>I feel like we are embarking on the next stage in the evolution of Swagger. Over the last couple of years, the Swagger community has see growth, adoption, and investment at an unprecedented pace, culminating in version 2.0 of the spec and now its transfer SmartBear. The scope and passion of the Swagger community and the investment that Tony Tam specifically and also the API community have made -- these have all brought us to this moment.
<p>I've known the SmartBear team for years, and after speaking with them about this transition of the Swagger specification, I believe SmartBear is the right steward for Swagger, during its next stage of its evolution. SmartBear understands the gravity of what they are now taking charge of: the Swagger specification representing a central truth throughout the entire API lifecycle.
<p>SmartBear fully understands too that it was organic growth that made Swagger the force that it has become, and SmartBear is aware that a unique balance of leadership, open governance, and a strong community pull will be just as essential during the next stage of growth. I look forward to working with the Swagger community and SmartBear team to ensure Swagger continues playing a vital role across the API space, meeting the demands of the fast-growing API economy.
<p>As I mentioned, I see Swagger as a central truth in the API economy, something I&rsquo;m invested in beyond just my own IT infrastructure, as Swagger is also the cornerstone of the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a>, that Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I created to assist in the next generation of API discovery. I am behind Swagger because I believe in Tony&rsquo;s vision, and I also believe that the Swagger community will make this transition more about shifting gears for the Swagger spec and tooling, than it is about who is in charge of the project.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tuned into the Swagger community since its inception, and the community support, contributions, and chatter has become pretty loud over the last year. I trust that SmartBear has experienced this scope as well, and understands the importance of Swagger having an open governance model, which would make this current transition all about shifting Swagger into 2nd gear,  and setting up of open governance representing about shifting into 3rd gear, putting the ability to shift into 4th and 5th gear up to the Swagger community itself.
<p>I am looking forward to what SmartBear and the Swagger community can achieve out on the open API highway!
