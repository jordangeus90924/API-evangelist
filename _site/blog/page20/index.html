        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/17/api-definitions-influencing-api-design/">API Definitions Influencing API Design</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-two-arrows.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I was having a conversation about whether I should be putting my API definition or my API design work first--which comes earlier in the lifecycle of an API? The conclusion was to put definition first because you need a common set of definitions to work with when designing your API(s). You need definitions like HTTP and HTTP/2. In, 2017 you should be employing definitions like OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema. These definitions help set the tone of your API design process.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the biggest benefits of designing, developing, and operating APIs on the web has been forcing developers to pick up their heads and pay attention to what everybody else is doing and wanting. I suffer from this. Doing web APIs, providing my own, and consuming 3rd party APIs forces me to pay attention to providers and consumers outside my bubble--this is good.</p>
<p>Common definitions help us elevate the design of our APIs by leveraging common concepts, standards, and schema. Every time you employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>, you have to think about folks in another time zone. Every time you use ISO 4217, you have to think about people who buy and sell their products and services in a different currency than you. When you use <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>, your <a href="http://schema.org/PostalAddress">postal addresses considers the world beyond just US zip codes,</a> and consider a world wid web of commerce.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">I am placing definitions before design in my API research listing</a>. In reality, I think this is just a cycle. Common definitions feed my design process, and the more experienced I get with design, the more robust my toolbox of API definitions gets. Ultimately this depends on what I'm calling a definition, but for the sake of this story <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">I am considering the building blocks of the web as the first line of definition</a><a href="http://webconcepts.info/">s</a>, then secondarily the definitions that are using OpenAPI Spec and JSON Schema as the next line of definitions. Definitions influence my design process, and the design process is refining the definitions that I am putting to work. </p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_light_bulb_bright_api.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a regular call with a really smart API person who is trying to move forward a really cool project for the API space. It is some thought provoking voodoo and I need to be able to write about it--this is how I flush out my thoughts and move forward. He is not quite ready to talk about his project publicly, so I will just talk about and explore in terms of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist research</a> and how it applies to the area(s) of the API space he is looking to make an impact.</p>
<p>This topic spans several areas of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API research</a>, but if I had to give it a single label I would call it API awareness. When you hear me talk about my monitoring the API space, API awareness is the result. I wanted to try and communicate this from my vantage point but also share with other analysts, practitioners, and even the average individual online today. This is my attempt to distil my approach to monitoring the API space and establishing a sustained awareness of APIs at any level.</p>
<p><strong>Individual ("Normals")</strong><br />It may sound crazy to you, but everyone should be API aware. No, they should be paying attention to APIs like I do, or even at the level of the average individual working in the tech sector, but they should have a baseline awareness, and here is my attempt at quantifying that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs Exist </strong>- Everyone should be aware that APIs exist, and hopefully have one or two examples of what they can do in their business or personal lives -- even if it's' just pulling tweets, photos, or getting news updates via an RSS feed.</li>
<li><strong>API Integration</strong> - Everyone should be aware that they can move data and content between the online services they use and depend on. If you know APIs exist and are aware of services like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> or <a href="http://datafire.io">Datafire</a>, you will be more successful in what you do online.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability -</strong> All online services should allow for the downloading of their data, allowing for the portability of all users data and content.</li>
<li><strong>API Discovery - </strong>With a low-level awareness of APIs and what is possible, the average individual should regularly be introduced to new APIs, and be given simple tooling and services for helping them in their discovery.
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Everyone should get exposed to what other people are doing with APIs, and be informed about new and interesting ways to get things done for fun or business.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals</strong> - Individuals within a company, institution, or online that can help with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong> - Organizations that can help individuals with API needs.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong> - Meetups, conferences and other events to learn about APIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The more we expose the average person to APIs, the more they will be able to absorb and understand. I've turned hundreds of average, non-technical folks on to the concept of APIs, and have seen them become evangelists and even API practitioners. Some move into API focused roles, but many are just are more successful in what they are already doing, from social media work to sending out their weekly newsletter.</p>
<p>I've always put API awareness for individuals into the same bucket as financial awareness. You shouldn't have an awareness of the inner workings of banking and credit industry, but you should have an awareness that you have accounts, who has access to them, and that you can move money around, and have different accounts for different purposes, with different providers--the same applies to the world of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>API Practioners ("Not Normals")</strong><br />When I first started writing this post, I had this section broken up into three groups: 1) Provider, 2) Service Provider, and 3) Analysts. Much of it ended up being redundant, so I'm going to share the complete list of what contributes to my API awareness, and depending on where you exist in the API spectrum (gonna have to use this one more), what matters to you will vary. </p>
<p>This is a master dump of my research, and the approach I have used to track on in the world of APIs since 2010--an analyst 100K view. However, API providers, service providers, evangelists, and analysts should possess a similar level of awareness--maybe not at the scope I pay attention to but employing some of the same tactics, applied to a smaller group of APIs either internally or externally. Here is what I'd consider a comprehensive definition of my API awareness stack.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exist </strong>- Everyone should be aware that APIs exist, and hopefully have one or two examples of what they can do in their business or personal lives--even if you are in a business unit, you should know about APIs.</li>

<p>API awareness spans many stops along the API lifecycle, and across a variety of the most common, and critical building blocks of what drives API ecosystems. Awareness doesn't come easy. It takes time, and have access to the right information, and signals, potentially across many different entities and domains--aggregating, filtering, and ranking is essential developing and strengthening your awareness. In the end, even with the same signals and information available, there will be many definitions of what is the necessary awareness.</p>
<p>I am glad I didn't break this into different buckets for different people. I think that is a dangerous thing for us to do. I think people should be curious and have agency the decisions regarding which signals should feed their awareness. How many APIs. Which APIs. Which companies, news, events, and other areas. Investment, patents, and other legal aspects. I don't think that all individual should be bombarded with the more complex inner workings of the API industry I pay attention to, but they should be able to make the decision to move beyond a basic level of understanding, and become an evangelist, or analyst--quantifying and developing the awareness they desire or need to achieve.</p>
<p>I'll stop there. This is a good first draft of what I consider API awareness. At the individual API level, across a collection or industry of APIs, and even at the analyst levels, potentially paying attention to many different APIs across a variety of different industries. Before I put this definition down, I am going to take it and apply it in two other ways: 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">Observability, "measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs"</a>, and 2) Rating, "establish a rating system that articulates where an API or provider exists on awareness and observability spectrum". We'll see where it goes. Thinking about this voodoo is helping me better organize some of the existing parts of my research, and hopefully help my friend out in his work as well. </p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/api-lifecycle-service-providers-instead-of-walled-gardens/">API Lifecycle Service Providers Instead Of Walled Gardens</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/walled_garden_blue_gray_circuit.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>It is a common tactic of older software companies to offer open source, services, and tools in a way that all roads just lead into their walled garden. There are many ways to push vendor lock-in and the big software vendors from 2000 through 2010 have mastered how to route you back to their walled gardens and make sure you stay there. Web APIs have set into motion a shift in how we architect our web, mobile, and device applications, as well as providing services to the life cycle that are behind the operation of these web APIs. While this change has the potential to positive it often it can be very difficult to tell apart the newer breed of software companies from the legacy version, amidst all the hype around technology and startups.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/14/api-lifemiddlewarecycle-api/">I've been having conversations recently which are pushing me to think more about middleware</a>, or what I'd refer to as API life cycle tooling. In my opinion, these are companies who are selling services and tools to the API life cycle, which in turn is fueling our web, mobile, device, and other applications. In my opinion, as a server provider, you should be selling to a company and API provider's life cycle needs, not your walled garden needs. I understand that you want all of a companies business, and you want to lock them into your platform, but that was how we did business 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The API service providers I'm shining a light on in 2017 are servicing one or <a href="http://apievangelist.com">many stops along the API life cycle</a>, supporting API definitions, and providing value without getting in the way, or locking customers in. They do this on-premise, or in the cloud of your choice, and allow you to seamless overlap many different API service providers providing a variety of solutions across the API life cycle. You will notice this patterns in the companies I partner with like <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a>, and <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">Dreamfactory</a>. I find I have a lot more patience when it comes to the whole startup thing if your service is plug and play and us API providers can choose where and when we want to put your tools and services to use.</p>
<p>I want my API service providers to behave just like they recommend to their customers--modular, flexible, agile, and providing a mix of valuable API resources I can use across my own API lifecycle. You'll find me doing more highlighting of what I consider to be API life cycle service providers who bring value to the API life cycle, with API definitions like the OpenAPI Spec as the center of their operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://box-api-navigator.com/files?init=true"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_13_at_10.20.02_pm.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://box-api-navigator.com/files?init=true">The document platform Box updated their developer efforts recently</a>, helping push&nbsp;forward the definition of what API documentation can be. I've long been advocating moving APIs out from the shadow of the developer portal, and make it more seamless with any UI, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/24/the-api-behind-every-feature-in-the-user-interface/">kind of like CloudFlare does with their DNS dashboard</a>. There is no reason the API should have to be&nbsp;hidden from users--it should be right behind the UI for everyone to discover.</p>
<p>Box does this. You can interact with files just like it is the regular interface. When push the get the folder items, upload file, or other option available to you in the documentation--you get example API request and response in the right-hand column. It is a blend of a regular UI, and some of the attractive and interface documentation we've seen emerge lately like <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc">ReDoc</a>. Making it easy to see and understand what an API does, while speaking in the context of solving a relevant problem for a human.</p>
<p>API documentation doesn't have to be overly technical and boring. It can look like a regular user interface, and the API can be right behind the UI curtain, providing a snapshot of the requests and responses that are doing the heavy lifting behind. I'm finally seeing the movement I have wanted to see with API documentation in 2017. I'm feeling like this is going to be common theme with the world of APIs for all of us--we will never see things move as fast as we want, but eventually the world evolves, and we will see investment in the areas that make a difference on the ground at API operations, and for the consumers who are putting APIs to work in their regular world.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/14/api-lifemiddlewarecycle-api/">API Life(middleware)Cycle API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_gear_life_cycle.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I have had a series of calls with an analyst group lately, discussing the overall API landscape in 2017. They have a lot of interesting questions about the space, and I enjoyed their level of curiosity and awareness around what is going on--it helps me think through this stuff, and (hopefully) better explain it to folks who aren't immersed in API like I am. </p>
<p>This particular group is coming at it from a middleware perspective and trying to understand what APIs have done to the middleware market, and what opportunities exist (if at all). This starting point for an API conversation got me thinking about the concept of middleware in contrast to, or in relationship to what I'm seeing emerge as the services and tooling for the API life cycle.</p>
<p>Honestly, when I jumped on this call I Googled the term middleware to provide me with a fresh definition. Middleware: software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. What does that mean in the age of API? Did API replace this? There is middleware for deploying APIs from backend systems. There is middleware for brokering, proxying and providing a gateway for APIs. Making middleware as a term pretty irrelevant. I think middle traditionally meant a bridge between backend and the frontend, where web APIs make things omnidirectional--in the middle of many different directions and outcomes.</p>
<p>The answer to the question of what has API done to middleware is just "added dimensions to its surface area". Where is the opportunity? "All along the API lifecycle". Middleware (aka services & tooling) is popping up through the life cycle to help design, deploy, manage, test, monitor, integrate, and numerous other stops along the API life cycle. All the features of our grandfathers API gateway are now available as a microservices buffet, allowing us to weave middleware nuggets into any system to system integrations as well as other web, mobile, and device applications. </p>
<p>Middleware as a concept has been distilled down into its smallest possible unit of value, made available via an API, deployed in a virtualized environment of your choosing, on the web, on-premise, or on-device. This new approach to delivering services, and tooling is often still in the middle, but the word really doesn't do it justice anymore. I wanted to go through all the areas of my research and look for any signs of middleware or its ghost.</p>
<p>Some of the common areas of my research that I think fits pretty nicely with some earlier concepts of what middleware does or can do. I would say that <a href="http://database.apievangelist.com/">Database</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">Deployment</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com/">Virtualization</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">Management</a>, <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/">Documentation</a>, <a href="http://change-log.apievangelist.com/">Change Log</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">Testing</a>, <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com/">Performance</a>, <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com/">Authentication</a>, <a href="http://encryption.apievangelist.com/">Encryption</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">Security</a>, <a href="http://command-line-interface.apievangelist.com/">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com/">Logging</a>, <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">Analysis</a>, and <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">Aggregation</a> are some pretty clear targets. Of course, this is just my view of what middleware was to me, from say 1995 through 2007--after that, everything began to shift because of APIs.</p>
<p>As web APIs evolve the reason you'd buy or sell a tool or service to be in the middle of some meaningful action when APIs started being about <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">Software Development Kit (SDK)</a>, <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/">Embeddable</a>, <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">Visualization</a>, <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com/">Webhooks</a>, <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com/">iPaaS</a>, <a href="http://orchestration.apievangelist.com/">Orchestration</a>, <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">Real Time</a>, <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">Voice</a>, <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">Spreadsheets</a>,<span> </span><a href="http://communication.apievangelist.com/">Communication</a>, <a href="http://support.apievangelist.com/">Support</a>, <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">Containers</a>, <a href="http://serverless.apievangelist.com/">Serverless</a>,  and <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">Bots</a>. This is where things really begain working in many different directions, making the term middle seem antiquated to me. You are now having to think beyond just any single application, and all your middleware is now very modular, API-driven, and can be plugged in anywhere along the life cycle not just any application, but also any API -- mind blown. </p>
<p>The schism in middleware for me began<a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/13/the-reasons-why-we-pull-back-the-curtain-on-technology/"> when companies started cracking open the SDK and were using HTTP to give access to important resources</a> like compute with storage with AWS, and SMS with Twilio, offering a peek behind the curtain for developers. Then further expanding to regular humans with embeddable tooling, iPaaS with services like Zapier, and other services and tools that anyone can implement, no coding necessary. All of this was fueled by mobile, and the need to break down the data, content, and algorithms for use in these mobile applications. Things have quickly gone from backend to frontend, to everywhere to everywhere. How do you get in the middle of that?</p>
<p>Anyways. I'm guessing this story might be a little incoherent. I'm just trying to find my words for future conversations on this topic. As the regular world is confronted with this API thing, they have a lot of questions, and they need help understanding how we got here. Honestly, I feel like I don't fully have a grasp on how we got here. So writing about it helps me to think through this stuff, and polish it a little bit for the next round of conversations.</p>

<p>I am spending a lot of time studying how companies are using Github as part of their software and API development life cycle, and how the social coding platform is used. More <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2017/02/introducing-hubcommander.html">companies like Netflix are using as part of their continuous integration workflow</a>, something&nbsp;that<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/05/evolving-the-api-sdk-with-apimatic-dx-kits/">&nbsp;API service providers like APIMATIC are looking to take advantage of with a new wave of services and tooling</a>. This usage of Github goes well beyond just managing code, and are making the platform more of an engine in any continuous&nbsp;integration and API life cycle workflow.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">I run all my API research project sites on Github</a>. I do this because it is secure&nbsp;and static, as well as introduces a very potent way to not just manage a single website, but over 200 individual open data and API projects. Each one of my API research areas leverages a Github Jeykll core, providing a machine readable index of the companies, news, tools, and other building blocks I'm aggregating throughout my research.</p>
<p>Recently, this approach has moved beyond the core areas of my API research&nbsp;and is something I'm applying to my API discovery work, profiling the resources available with <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">popular API platforms like Amazon Web Services</a>, and <a href="http://gsa.index.apievangelist.com/">across my government work like with my GSA index</a>. Each of these projects managed using Github, providing a machine readable index of the disparate APiI, in a single APIs.json index which includes OpenAPI Specs for each of the APIs included. When complete, these indexes can provide a runtime discovery engine of APIs&nbsp;used as part of integrations, providing an&nbsp;index of single APIs, as well as potentially across many distributed APiI brought together into a single meaningful collection.</p>
<p>I've started pushing this approach even further with <a href="http://adopta.agency">my Knight Foundation funded Adopta.Agency work</a>, and making the Github repository not just a machine-readable index of many APIs, I'm also using the _data folder as a JSON or YAML data store, which can then also be indexed as part of the APIs.json&nbsp;and OpenAPI Spec for each project. <a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/">I've been playing with different ways of storing and working with JSON and YAML in Jekyll on Github for a while now</a>, but now I'm <a href="http://jekyll.open.referral.adopta.agency/">trying to develop projects that are a seamless open data store, as well as an API index, providing the best of both worlds</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a model for delivering high performance and availability APIs. This is a model for publishing and sharing open data so that it is highly available, workable, and hosted on Github for FREE. Most of the data I work with is publicly available. It is part of what I believe in, and how I work on a regular basis. Making it available in a Github repo allows it to be forked, or even consumed directly while offloading bandwidth and storage costs to Github. The GET layer for all my open data project is all static, and dead simple to work with. Next, I'm working on a truly RESTfully augmented layer providing&nbsp;the POST, PUT, and DELETE, as well as more advanced search solutions.</p>
<p>I am using the Github API for this augmented layer. I am just playing with different ways to proxy it&nbsp;and deliver the best search results possible. The POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE layer for each Github repository data store in the _data folder is pretty straightforward. My goal is to offload as much of the payload to Github as possible, but then augment what it can't do when it comes to more advanced usage. I'm looking for each API index and data store can act as a forkable engine for a variety of stops along the API life cycle, as well as throughout the delivery of the web, mobile, and device-based applications we are building on top of them.</p>

<p>I was trying to explain to a business analyst this week the difference between SDK and API, which he said was often used interchangeably by people he worked with. In my opinion SDK and API can be the same thing, depending on how you see this layer of our web, mobile, and device connectivity. The Internet has been rapidly expanding this layer for some time now, and unless you are watching it really don't see any difference between API and SDK--it is just where the software connects everything.</p>
<p>For me, an SDK is where the data, content&nbsp;and algorithmic production behind the curtain is packaged up for you -- giving you a pre-defined&nbsp;look at what is possible, prepared for you with a specific language or platform in mind. Most of the hard work of understanding what is going on has been translated and crafted, providing you with a set of instructions of what you can do with this resource in your application--your integration is pretty rigidly defined, not much experimentation or hacking encouraged.</p>
<p>An API has many of the same characteristics as an SDK, but the curtain is pulled back on the production a little bit more. Not entirely, but you do get a little more of a look at how things work, what data and content are available, and algorithmic resources are accessible. You still get the view which a provider intends you to have, but there are&nbsp;fewer assumptions about what you'll do with the resources put on the interface, leaving you to do more of the heavy lifting with how these resources will get put to use.</p>
<p>Most of the early motivations behind choosing an open approach to web APIs over more closed and as proprietary SDK, pulling back the curtain on how we develop software, weren't entirely intentional. Companies like Flickr and Twitter weren't trying to make their mark on the politics of how we integrate software, they were busy and looking to encourage 3rd party developers to do the hard work of crafting the SDKs, and other platform integrations. The reasons for pulling back the curtain on how the sauce is made was purely about furthering their own needs, and not necessarily about moving the needle forward regarding how we talk about software integration--it was just business, enabled by tech (HTTP), and the politics came later, as a sort of side-effect.</p>
<p>Many traditional software developers&nbsp;and software-enabled hardware manufacturers have a hard time seeing this expansion in how we integrate with software&nbsp;and are usually still very SDK oriented, even if there are many APIs right behind their SDK curtain. They do this for a variety of technical, business, as well as political reason. It is my personal mission to help these folks understand a little more about this expansion in the software connectivity layer, and the benefits brought to the table by being more open. We need the client integration (SDK) and API to be loosely coupled from a technical, business, and political stance--to make things work in a web-enabled environment.</p>
<p>It isn't easy to help business folk see the importance of leaving this layer open. This is the damaging effects of the Oracle vs. Google Java Copyright, is it gums up and slows this expansion, something we need to encourage&nbsp;and keep open, even if the&nbsp;bigtechcos&nbsp;don't fully get it. We are going to need this momentum to not just keep the web, mobile, and device integration accessible and loosely coupled, but we will also need to help make sure the growing number of algorithms that are impacting our worlds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">are more observable as well</a>. Providers aren't going to be willing to pull back the curtain on the smoke and mirrors that are&nbsp;AI, machine learning, and other algorithmic varietals infecting our lives.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why we pull back (or don't) the curtain on technology, at the application, SDK, API, or&nbsp;algorithmic levels. I don't count on companies, institutions, and government agencies to ever do this for the right reasons. I'm counting on them doing it for all the wrong reasons. I am looking at incentivizing their competitors to do it, helping influence policy or law to direct the systems to behave in a certain way, and encourage companies to be lazy, and keep the curtain pulled back because it's easier. Getting a peek behind the curtain, or convincing some to pull it back is never a straightforward conversation--you often have to use many of the same tactics and voodoo employed by tech providers to get what you want.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/01/amazon-dash-ok-idea-dumb-implementations/">I have been kvetching about the quality of embeddable tooling out there</a>, so I'm working on&nbsp;discovering anything interesting. I started with bookmarklets, which I think is one of the most underutilized, and simplest examples of working with APIs on the web. Here are a couple of interesting bookmarklets for APIs out there:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/bookmarklet">Twitter</a></strong> - Probably the most iconic API and bookmarklet out there -- share to Twitter.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://pinboard.in/howto/">Pinboard</a></strong> - An API-driven bookmarklet for saving bookmarks that I use every day.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://jonudell.net/h/">Hypothesis</a></strong> - A whole suite of API-driven bookmarklets for annotating the web.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/bookmarklet.html">Socrata</a></strong> - A pretty cool bookmarklet for quickly viewing documentation on datasets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://tincanapi.com/bookmarklet/">Tin Can API</a></strong> - A bookmarklet for recording self-directed learning experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you search for API bookmarklets you don't get much. Nothing stands out as being innovative. I will keep looking when I have time, and I'll keep curating and understanding any new approaches, and examples, and tooling when possible.</p>
<p>Ultimately it just confounds me, because a simple JS bookmarklet triggering one or more API interactions is a no brainer. We have examples of this in action, making an impact on login, sharing, annotation, and more, so why don't we have more examples? IDK. It is something I'll explore as I push forward my embeddable API research.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just missing something...</p>

<p>When you Google for Schema.org logo you don't get the logo for Schema.org, <a href="https://schema.org/logo">you get the schema for a logo</a>, which is the image property of a thing&nbsp;and is used by brands, organizations, places, products, and services.

Amazon Web Services provides a comprehensive tool kit for sharing and analyzing data at any scale.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon helps researchers by providing them with cloud resources for doing their research, assisting them with the budget of it all, while also opening you up to other grant opportunities, as well as can provide you with a place to publish and share your open data, and put data from other researchers to work in your research. It sounds like a pretty fine start to a more formal API researcher &nbsp;blueprint that other API providers can consider as part of their own operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I have a base definition crafted (thanks, AWS!). I'll spend time looking for other implementations in the wild. Once I have a strong enough blueprint crafted, I want to start lobbying Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other leading social data platforms to consider. The data on these platforms&nbsp;provides an important look at the world around us, one that researchers should have access to, without costs, rate limits, or other obstacles in their way. Amazon's motivations in offering this type of package are clear--they want researchers to become customers. When it comes to other providers, I'm going to have to experiment with other incentive models--I am guessing they won't always be happy to get on board.</p>
<p>I will keep polishing the building blocks of my API research program as I find other examples of this. Once I have it refined a little more I will publish as one of my industry guides. Providing a basic blueprint that any company can follow when setting up their own API program for research, but also make it something any individual looking to lobby for this kind of change can use as well. Amidst all the capitalist frenzy within the tech bubbles, it isn't always easy to convince folks of the importance of this type of access--especially when it costs them money.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/tyk_io_logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a>I've been keeping an eye on the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management</a> space for about seven years now, and I actually have to say, even with all the acquisitions, IPOs, commoditization, etc, I am actually pretty happy with where the sector has evolved. API management always resembled its older cousin the API gateway for me, so <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">when companies like 3Scale</a> started offering a freemium model, that I could deploy in the cloud&nbsp;with a couple lines of code---I jumped on the API management bandwagon. It was easy&nbsp;and gave you all the service composition, onboarding, analytics, and metering tools you needed out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">I have been pushing on providers to provide an open source API management solution for quite some time</a>, and providers like <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> finally stepped up to bring an enterprise-grade solution to the table, then solutions like <a href="https://apiumbrella.io/">API Umbrella</a> also emerged for the government. Now in 2017, we have several open source solutions available to us, which makes me happy, but what I really like is how modular, versatile, and API-driven they are. I'm spending time learning more about my partner's solutions, and today <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">I'm working my way through what is possible with Tyk</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tyk.io">Tyk is what API management should be</a>. It has all the user and organization management and assists you with the onboarding, authentication, service composition, rate limiting, and analytics that are core to any API management solution. However, what is really powerful for me is that you can deploy Tyk anywhere in the cloud, on-premise, on-device, and all of its features are API-driven, and interconnected because of it's APIs, webhooks, and other orchestration features. APIs aren't just about deploying a web API on a server, and making it available through a single base URL--they are everywhere, and our management tools need to reflect this.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/tyk_variants_1200px.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>We don't just have a single API stack anymore and we use a handful of 3rd party APIs. We are weaving together many different internal and partner stacks, as well a mess of 3rd party solutions. Tyk is your simple API management on a device, in your data center, or in the cloud. Tyk is also part of your API stack--the API management layer portion. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/28/the-lack-of-an-api-and-healthy-partner-integrations-is-an-early-warning-system-for-service-providers/">I am constantly pushing on API providers to practice what they preach and make everything they do API first</a>--Tyk is that. All the resources for the applications you build should be APIs, and all the infrastructure you use to design, deploy, manage, and orchestrate those APIs should be APIs--if you are a service provider in the space without an API, you will not be competitive.</p>
<p>Anyways, full disclosure and all -- Tyk is my partner. I'm writing about them because they give me money. However, I am not in the business of taking money to write about products that don't offer a real solution. All four of the logos you see on the left hand of my site are companies with products that I believe in, otherwise, I wouldn't take money from them. Tyk's approach to API management&nbsp;represents where I think things should be. Open source. Modular. Composable. And, you pay for complexity and scale. API management being commoditized&nbsp;is a win for everyone in my opinion, but it's been a long road to get here, with a lot of casualties along the way. ;-)</p>

<p>It was an interesting journey getting the API specification formerly known as Swagger into the Linux foundation last year. After SmartBear donated the spec to the newly formed <a href="http://openapis.org">Open API Initiative</a>, I was considering joining the governing body behind the spec, but with all I had going on last year, I didn't feel it was the right time. Participating in governance groups hasn't really ever been my thing, and there are a handful of large organizations involved, and who am I really? I'm just a single person ranting about APIs. However, in 2017 I am changing my tune and will be joining the Open API Initiative (OAI)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/19/focusing-on-common-api-definitions-schema-scopes-and-specifications/">It is an important time for API definitions</a>, and there is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/what-is-at-stake-with-api-definitions-at-the-moment/">a lot riding on the success of OpenAPI, as well as API definitions in general</a>. I feel like we need as many voices at the table as we possibly can. We need government agencies, enterprise, small businesses, startups, and individual analysts like myself. I feel pretty strongly that API definitions should be openly licensed, accessible, and following the most commonly used patterns available to us across the API sector. We don't need to all be speaking a different language when it comes to deploying compute resources or working with images, and API definitions are how we get there.</p>
<p>After a ramping up period, I will work with OAI on their marketing strategy, helping tell stories, and learn about interesting implementations and use cases when possible--dovetailing nicely with what I am already doing. I'll be tuned into the conversation about the spec, but will definitely be standing off to the side as an observer for quite some time. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">I'm pretty stoked with what they've done with version 3.0 of the spec</a>, and at this point, I have a lot to learn before I open up my mouth and chime in on anything. I'm just enjoying watching the personalities play out in the Slack room--this stuff should be a reality TV show, but that is another story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes me happy to be part of the Open API Initiative (OAI). As I work on my regular API Evangelist research, and move forward projects like <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral,</a> and their Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), the OpenAPI Specification is critical to everything I am doing. The OAI is extremley important right now, and I'm pleased to have a seat at the table of such an important organization, and learning from the other smart folks moving the specification forward. 2017 will be an interesting year for not just the OpenAPI Spec, but for all the services and topen tooling that is being built on the spec, as well as the wide range of industries being touch by APIs, and putting common API specifications, and schema to work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/apimatic_dx_kits.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I was a regular check-in&nbsp;with one of my favorite API service providers this week, talking about some of the new features they are rolling out in coming weeks, and they demonstrated for me why API definitions are so important in 2017. &nbsp;<a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> got their start deploying SDKs for your API, but have quickly moved into providing API documentation, testing, continuous integration, and some additional stops that they have planned for release in coming months.</p>
<p class="p1">As I was sharing how happy I was with their movement into new areas of the API life cycle, and praising their agility&nbsp;when it came to rolling out new features, they responded with:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The credit goes to machine-readable descriptions. Once you have them then there are endless possibilities. Thanks for motivating us to support all the description formats in first place :-)"</em></p>
<p class="p1">This is why being fluent in API definitions is so important to operating your API, or in APIMATIC's case, operating as an API service provider. There are an increasing number of API providers who support the importing and exporting of API definitions, but nobody has gone full API definition as APIMATIC as. They didn't just center their SDK, documentation, testing and continuous integration solutions around API definitions, they <a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">exposed their API definition translation engine as a service called API Transformer</a>, allowing anyone else to follow their lead.</p>
<p class="p1">When people first learn about API definitions, the 101 lessons usually center around API documentation, and maybe secondarily the generation of the server or client-side&nbsp;SDKs. However API definitions are rapidly being used for every other stop along the life cycle from design to deprecation, as well as the unknown future stops along the way that only&nbsp;become possible because all your API resources are well defined, and machine-readable. It is this agility and flexibility that I want to incentivize, helping companies be as effective as APIMATIC has been when it comes to delivering new API-driven solutions.</p>

It is an interesting way to shift the burden of paying for the hard costs around API operations.</p>
<p>Another interesting approach I extracted from a story I wrote yesterday is from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/open-data/">Amazon Web Services (AWS) with their approach to open data</a>. Amazon Public Datasets are available as <span>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots and/or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. AWS hosts the master copy of the dataset, and when you want to use, you fire it up in your AWS account, and get to work.</span></p>
<p><span>I find some of these approaches to managing, and offloading the heavy costs of working with algorithms, datasets, and other resources interesting. I especially find this approach interesting because it is in the service of public data, providing an option for how the private sector can help share the load in managing government, research, and other public data, and offloading the heavy costs to those who are going to put the data to use. </span></p>
<p>I will figure out how to add this into my API <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a> and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">plan</a> research. Providing a list of these types of approaches to providing on-premise, wholesale, and containerized or virtualized approaches to making data, content, and algorithms available. I will definitely keep looking for unique approaches to API deployment like this--after a couple of these grabbing my attention, I'm feeling like I am seeing another shift in both the technology and business of how we deploy and consume APIs.</p>

<p>I would say that <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddable tooling</a> is one of saddest areas of the API space for me in recent years. When it comes to buttons, badges, widgets, and other embeddable goodies that put APIs work, the innovation has been extremely underwhelming. Login, like, share, and a handful of other embeddable tooling have taken hold, but there really isn't any sort of sophisticated approach to putting APIs to work using web, mobile, browser embeddables.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/11/ipaas-in-your-browser-with-push-by-zapier/">The only innovation I can think of recently is from Zapier with their Push by Zapier solution</a> -- allowing you to orchestrate with the zaps you've&nbsp;creative, putting APIs to work using the variety of recipes they've cooked up. I'm thinking that I will have to step up my storytelling around what is possible with Push by Zapier, helping folks understand the possibilities. Push by Zapier is a Google Chrome extension, making it more browser than embeddable, but the approach transcends embeddable, browser, and even into the conversation (bot, voice, etc.) for me.</p>
<p>It's all about getting users frictionless access to API driven actions. Whether you are building Zapier pushes, Alexa Skills, or a Slackbot, you need to trigger, and daisy chain together API driven requests and responses ending in the desired location. I'm just looking for dead simple ways of doing all of this&nbsp;in my browser, embedded on web pages, and anywhere I desire. I'm just looking for a way to embed, link, and display the doorway to meaningful actions that anyone can implement, from wherever they want--where the action takes place is up to the API provider.</p>
<p>I want a vocabulary of simple and complex embeddables,&nbsp;either just HTML, some JS, and maybe a little CSS magic to round off. When I explain to someone in a Tweet or email explaining that they can publish a news article to a Google spreadsheet, I want my sentence to accomplish what I'm trying to articulate. I want to be able to speak in API--I want to be able to develop an IT operational outline&nbsp;and make it executable using <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">the wealth of API resources available to me over at AWS</a>. I want to be able to craft meaningful tasks, and easily share with others, replicated it for them, in their environment, using their credentials, without confusing the hell out of them.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am just ranting of this collision of these worlds as I am seeing unfold. I suspect the lack of innovation around embeddables&nbsp;is more about proprietary stances on APIs, and a platformification of things--meaning folks are investing in speaking in these ways via their channel, on their platforms, not an open web approach for everyone. I think Zapier has the strong lead in this area, with Slack, and Alexa trailing behind. The problem is that all the players are just to focused on their ow implementations, and not a wider web edition of their conversational interfaces. I'll rant in a future post about how this politics of API operations&nbsp;and closed views on API IP are stunting the growth in meaningful communication using API resources. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The "cloud" has done some very interesting things for individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government&nbsp;agencies, and is something that shouldn't be ignored. However, I watch organizations of all shapes and sizes make a similar mistake when it comes to outsourcing too much of their operations to vendors, and cloud services. Each organization's needs will be different, but technology leaders should be mindful of how they invest in talent, alongside how much they invest in external services.</p>
<p>I struggle with this in my own business on a daily basis, but I've also seen small businesses make the same mistake, as well as witnessed the damage of this all the way up the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in the federal government. The VA has outsourced it's technological soul to vendors, leaving the ability to make sound architectural choices to those who control the puppet strings outside of the agency. I'm seeing a lot of smaller organizations doing this same thing, but with cloud services (outsource 2.0), instead of the traditional software vendor (outsource 1.0)--outsourcing their technological soul to the cloud.</p>
<p>Outsourcing capacity is something I struggle with constantly. There is only so much I can do as a one-person shop, but there is also a limit on what I can spend on services in the cloud, creating a naturally occurring balancing effect. In addition to this natural effect, I am also constantly evaluating what I should be learning myself, and investing in my own internal capacity, as opposed to outsourcing it. I have to be extra careful regarding who I depend on because if service changes, is shut down, or maybe prices me out of range -- it could be pretty damaging to my operations. I am hyper aware of this vicious&nbsp;cycle when it comes to my dependence on the cloud or any single service.</p>
<p>I was just having a conversation around the hard decisions that a school district was having to make in this area. They have to make the big contract purchase, hire the talent&nbsp;or invest in talent locally. These are tough decisions to make, but in the end I always lean towards investment in on-premise capacity, working to be as critical as possible when it comes to adopting cloud services, and investing in only external expertise -- while there is no perfect answer, and investing in internal capacity might be costly, but this will help get you through hard times, that depending on the cloud services will not.</p>

<p>I have long been a proponent of the private sector sharing the load when it comes to managing public data and APIs. After leaving DC during the 2013 federal government shutdown I began evangelizing the importance of individuals and companies stepping up to help with the heavy lifting of making sure public data is available when we need it most--resulting in my Adopta.Agency work.  I feel pretty strongly that the federal government has an important role to play in this conversation, but I also feel that the private sector needs to step up and help--additionally, I also feel that is important that individuals step up and be present in the discussion.</p>
<p>Github plays a central role in my Adopta.Agency work. Any government data I turn into an API lives on Github as JSON, CSV, or other machine-readable format--taking advantage fo the Github platform for managing, as well as helping me eliminate or completely reduce the costs of managing public data. I spend money each month on hosting my public data work (it's my addiction), but I couldn't do it without a place to park it and offset storage and bandwidth costs. With this in mind, I'm spending time trying to find other services that public data and API folks can put to work for them, either eliminating or reducing the cost of managing open public data on the web.</p>
<p>My Adopta.Agency toolkit starts with Github and extends to <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/adopta-blueprint">the open source blueprint for adopting government data</a> (which lives on Github) - now I want to add some additional resources that folks can consider. First on my list is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/open-data/">AWS Open Data</a>, where organizations can publish their open data sets, and consumers can deploy datasets for use in their own AWS infrastructure--smart. Next up is <a href="https://www.google.com/publicdata/admin">Google Public Datasets</a>, where you can browse existing datasets and add your own. That is my list so far. I'm spending some time looking for other services that users can use for free or extremely low costs as part of their public data work, and need your help.</p>
<p>If you know of any other services that users can use let me know. I'm not just looking for storage solutions. Ideally, it would be a full stack services that public data advocates could use to acquire, store, management, and deploy public data as an API--additionally, any services that would help them throughout throught the API life cycle. I'm looking for a more formal and established approach, specifically something with a URL, logo, description and landing page that I can add to my Adopta.Agency Toolbox. If you have any questions let me know, you can leave <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/master/issues">any thoughts, issues, or suggestions to the Adopta.Agency Github issues</a>.</p>

<p>Telling the story of what your&nbsp; API accomplishes may seem like a pretty simple, straightforward thing, but you'd be surprised how many API providers DO NOT do this on a regular basis, or do not have dedicated stories, showcase, or similar section to their website. This is why I beat this drum on a regular basis -- if you do not tell the story of the cool things people are doing with your API or your API services, they will never know how your solution works, and will probably never think of your service again--even with they actually have that specific problem that you solve.</p>
<p>To help demonstrate this in a very meta way, I am going to showcase how my clients, showcase their clients. Deep man. Next up is my partner DreamFactory, <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/stories">providing six very compelling stories about how their API deployment and management platform is being put to use</a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>Honestly, this type of blog posts makes for easy content for me, and obviously, it makes my partner DreamFactory happy, but more importantly, it is yet ANOTHER reminder for you to tell the story of the people who are using your APIs and services. Telling stories is essential to you obtaining new customers, but it is also essential for analysts like me to understand the real things being done with your APIs, allowing us to cut through the hype of the tech space.</p>
<p>Take another look at your API storytelling apparatus. Do you have an engineering blog or a blog dedicated to your API? Do you have stories, testimonials, customer showcase, or other dedicated areas for telling stories about your customers? Do you actively share these stories via your company's social channels like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more? Just a few of the questions you should be asking.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_05_at_1.14.24_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm putting some thought into the what a public analytics layer might look like for federal, state, county, and city governments. Something that looks like <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/">analytics.usa.gov</a>, but for APIs. This is one of the things I really like about government is that you get to push forward ideas that you just can't convince folks to do in the private sector. There is no way companies will share their web or API traffic numbers publicly because there are too much smoke and mirrors involved in the process--for some reasons folks like accountability in government, but not in private sector???</p>
<p><a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">API analytics</a> are a slightly different beast than web analytics, so I wanted to step back and think about what is important to me, an API consumer, or potential API consumer when I am looking at what API does, or a group of APIs actually&nbsp;do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Depending on how APIs are grouped, if there are many APIs across the different organization, groups, or event external agencies, help me understand which APIs are available, giving me a quick snapshot of which are most used, and how they compare against each other.</li>
<li><strong>Paths</strong> - Within each API, which individual API paths are the most used, showing me the most used aspects of any available API. Not always a sign of popularity, as the API design may be a factor here, but it will help me see how others are using.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Which applications&nbsp;are making the most use of an API. This may be a number of calls or the number of APIs they are putting to use as well. Are these applications web, mobile, analysis, visualization, a system to system integration, or something else--details about what the app accomplishes and delivers helps a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Industries</strong> - Which industries are applications that put an API to work servicing? Would be helpful to understand which industries are finding API resources useful, and actually getting traction.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - I am going to add users here, but I think we need to be careful here. I'd like to see trends and spikes in new user signups, but if these aren't translating into active applications, there really isn't much value. I also have privacy concerns, but I'm sure providers will think deeply about this.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a potential API consumer seeing this data would help me understand what is possible, based upon what other people are already doing, and possibly light the fire under my imagination. This is where I would start based upon some of the most common analytics I'm seeing behind the scenes from API providers. I wish ALL API providers had the balls to publish their analytics publicly, but sadly many are too concerned with obfuscating their successes and failures, to be this honest.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful with the precedent that analytics.usa.gov is setting with web analytics, and the fact that <a href="https://github.com/GSA/analytics.usa.gov">the code behind it is open source on Github</a> for any federal, state, county, or city government to put to work. I'm also optimistic about this same practice being put to use when it comes to the API layer of the public sector, and something I'm hoping that open source API management providers will help incentivize their users to publish on GitHub. I'd love for a few honest and brave API providers in the private sector to follow the lead, but after getting to know the space so intimately I am not holding my breath.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2017</span>
        <p>I hate how technology dehumanizes things and went you bundle that with the current model for how things get funded, it tends to do this at scale, and with troubling efficiency. I'm the API Evangelist. I am not selling APIs as a technology solution, I am fighting to keep this sliver of our increasingly technical worlds open, and serving humans--otherwise I feel there is no hope for any of this to work with any kind of equity and compassion for the people it should be serving.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I blog is to help me refine the stories I tell in the API space, both virtually and in person. In an effort to make the API acronym more accessible to the masses, and also a reminder to the technorati that all of this is about doing meaningful things for the tech sector, I'm continuing to push my definition of API on the world. So, what does API stand for? Application Programming Interface. Historically application meant the&nbsp;web, and then in 2010 that started shifting to be more&nbsp;about mobile, and now it's being dominated by discussion about connecting other devices to the web, aka Internet of Things.</p>
<p>When I hear the word&nbsp;application, I think of the more non-technical definition of it: the action of putting something in operation. While this definition isn't perfect, it is better than simply thinking about web, mobile, and devices. It moves us closer to actually doing something useful, meaningful, functional, and actually serving humans. Sure, that operation could be in the service of systems and mechanisms that exploit and hurt people, but I feel like it gets us closer to having a conversation about why something is in operation, and not just simply about tech for tech's sake.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/swingingbridge_blue_circuit.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/what-is-at-stake-with-api-definitions-at-the-moment/#comment-3128000440">I wrote about what is at stake with API definitions currently and someone made a thoughtful comment on the importance of continuing to discuss hypermedia amidst all of this</a>--I agree. I've long been an advocate for OpenAPI Spec and API Bueprint as a bridge from where we are, to where we need to be, getting us closer to the world hypermedia folks think we should have. I'd love it if every API allowed for content negotiation using one of the major hypermedia formats like HAL, Collection+JSON, or JSON-LD, but unfortunately, we have a lot of education and training ahead of us before we'll get there.</p>
<p>A combination of APIs.json for discovery, and OpenAPI Spec for defining the request and response structure of an API can seem clunky compared to the elegant (hopefully) design of a hypermedia API, but not every API architect has the know-how, or the time and resources to always do things properly. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't strive for a better future, but it just isn't always a reality on the ground, and as easy to achieve as many hypermedia believers might envision.</p>
<p>As the momentum picks up with API specification formats like OpenAPI, as well as the services and tooling popping up in the ecosystem we must have to keep an eye out for opportunities to make sure the bridge continues being extended to accommodate linking, relationships, and the other benefits hypermedia design patterns bring to the table. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">OpenAPI Spec 3.0 gives a slight nod towards what I'm talking about with the ability to add some basic linking</a>--it falls short of true hypermedia flows, but it is one more step on the bridge I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Technology has this amazing effect on us, that we either get too caught up in the future and forget the past, or even ignore the present, but I feel like OpenAPI Spec and other definitions are having the opposite effect where we forget the future, as well as the past in favor of the present, and what is going on now. I'm a fan of making sure we address the world we have, but I'm also going to be working to pull my head up and keep thinking about how we keep weaving in the benefits of hypermedia into the definitions, and tooling we are developing to meet the current demands of the API space.</p>
<p>I know that many folks feel that APIs do not need documentation and some of the other common tooling being developed on top of OpenAPI Specs, but think we underestimate peoples ability to grasp what an API does, and their ability to go from discovery to integration. I am playing with different ways to think about interactive documentation using OpenAPI Spec, and some of these docs apply to APIs that have multiple media types available, including some Siren editions--I am going to take a look at what possibilities there are for bridging this current divide, especially as I'm playing with OpenAPI Spec 2.0 some more.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time thinking about the Amazon Web Services ecosystem lately. <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">I've gone through and generated OpenAPI Specs for the majority of their APIs, as well as an APIs.json&nbsp;index for the collection of valuable services</a>. I have also written about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/05/what-i-learned-crafting-api-definitions-for-66-of-the-amazon-web-services/">the relationship between the Amazon API and CLI</a>, and while doing this research I had jotted&nbsp;down thoughts about their approach to the Amazon Console.</p>
<p>For most API providers the API is a secondary thing, implemented after their website, applications, and even mobile applications in many situations. When AWS launched in 2006 they were only API and CLI, and after a couple of years, they got to work on providing their AWS Console, which plays a pretty significant role in working with the platform. The AWS console is pretty utilitarian, and lacking in a lot of UI / UX polish, but it plays an important role in working with the platform&nbsp;and is generally in sync with what features are available via the API and CLI.</p>
<p>I don't think there are any major lessons here, I just think it is interesting what has unfolded at Amazon, compared to how many other companies invest so much in the SaaS, and user interface portions of their operations, where AWS has definitely focused more heavily on the CLI and API, with the console only recently coming into focus. I do not think there is any 100% right way to do this, but I think making sure there are parity and consistency between what is available via a UI, and the API and CLI are important.</p>
<p>AWS doesn't always accomplish keeping all of this in sync, but you can see they work hard at it. Most times the CLI and API docs are side by side and even interlinked, and with some of the services, they provide you with a link in the developer area to the AWS Console portion for a specific service. I think whichever comes first for your company, the most important part of this is that you are constantly stepping back, and thinking of the relationship between your human interfaces and your programmatic interfaces, and considering where the gaps are, and how you can better weave all of your offerings together into a more coherent solution.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conversation-bubbles.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/19/focusing-on-common-api-definitions-schema-scopes-and-specifications/">I am focusing heavily on schema, definitions, and scopes in 2017</a>, because it is the most important layer in the tech sector, the API space, and is something that touches almost every industry, while also reaching into our personal worlds. I'm working on refining my argument in 2017 that I'm not selling APIs as a solution all by themselves, I'm pushing APIs to help us tame this insane beast that we've let out of the closet, and will never be able to put back in.</p>
<p><strong>Schema</strong><br />Whether it is JSON schema, MSON or Data Packages, current approaches to defining the data used as part of each API request or response are defining what has become to be known as the API economy (for good and bad). The schema describes the digital bits that are being created and moved around online today. They are the videos, images, blog posts, messages, and other digital elements that make up our online business and personal worlds. </p>
<p>Defining schema are critical to platforms working properly, and having them in a machine readable way allows for them to be shared between platforms, providers, and applications. Defining these bits allows us to have a conversation about these bits, which can also open up the conversation about whether or not we should be collecting, storing, and sharing these bits in the first place. I know many tech people don't want to have these conversations outside their inner circles, but we should--it is important for all of this to work for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong><br />API specification formats like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint have emerged to give us a way to define the surface area of APIs that are used across web, mobile, and device applications. These specification formats are allowing us to define, describe, and have a conversation around the valuable data, content, and algorithmic resources being made available via APIs using the web. The resulting API definitions are currently being used by companies as part of every stop along the application and API lifecycle, from design to deprecation.</p>
<p>API definitions allow us to describe the access available with the data, content, and algorithmic resources that we are depending on in our daily business and personal worlds. API definitions describe the request and response model for each API resource but also describes whether it is just readable, writeable, as well as updated, and able to be deleted. These definitions are being used to quantify what access is available in almost every aspect of our increasingly digital lives.</p>
<p><strong>Scopes </strong><br />"OAuth is an open standard for authorization, commonly used as a way for Internet users to authorize websites or applications to access their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords." OAuth scopes are the negotiated definition between each platform provider, end-users whose data that is being made available, and the 3rd party developer, application, and systems that will be putting the content, and data to work. In 2017, platforms like Slack are getting better at sharing their OAuth scopes in the same way that schema and definitions are being shared, making them an important part of the conversation.</p>
<p>I have sat with the Department of Energy and power companies, Health & Human Services and healthcare software manufacturers, negotiating the OAuth scopes for energy and healthcare data. The most familiar examples of this in action is when it comes to access your Facebook or Twitter social data, but it is a model that works across any content, data, and algorithms being made available on the web, in a secure way. OAuth scopes determine the 3-way relationship between providers, developers, and end-users, and make the process of sharing more secure, while also making sure all participating parties have a voice in the conversations, potentially at a granular level.</p>
<p><strong>Schema, Definitions, and Scopes</strong><br />I do not evangelize APIs because the technology fixes things. I do not believe in techno-solutionism. Internet technology is here, and we have to deal with it. My objectives around APIs is to make things more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">observable</a>, and I feel that schema gives us the opportunity to define what bits are being collected, stored, and moved around the web. API definitions give us the opportunity define what access there is to these bits, and where you GET this access, and when the opportunities for reading and writing are as well. Finally, scopes allow us to define exactly who has access to these bits, and most importantly, we are doing it in a way that gives the owners of the bits (end-users) a voice in the conversation.</p>
<p>This is why I'm focusing on the schema, definitions, and scope so heavily. They alone aren't a solution by themselves, but when you properly define, share, and them up to all stakeholders involved, the potential for equity is greater. The problem is that platforms do not always want to share, as the resources being made available are key to their revenue generation, and developers often see these bits in a similar light, and all of this happens in such a technical way, behind the scenes that end-users are often left out completely. When APIs are done right, and schema, definitions, and scopes are properly defined, and available to everyone in an easy to follow, yet machine readable way, things have the possibility to work out much better for everyone involved.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-charge-2-healthcare-integration/">Fitbit recenttly announced a program to pay their wearable users up to $1500 for&nbsp;integrating</a> their Charge 2 into the&nbsp;<span>UnitedHealthcare Motion</span>&nbsp;program powered by Qualcomm Life&rsquo;s 2net Platform. The "UnitedHealthcare Motion is an employer-sponsored wearable device&nbsp;<span>wellness program</span>&nbsp;that offers financial incentives for enrollees who meet daily step goals". Pulling back the curtain just a little bit on the value of your Internet of Things data, and specifically the devices you strap to your body.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of corporations strapping devices to their employees as part of these wellness programs (or for any reason), and using cash incentive to achieve the desired behavior. I feel this is a doorway to some pretty dark human resources strategies, but I do think these events pull back the curtains on what is going on, even just a little bit for users. I am sure it's not Fitbit's intention to include end-users in all of their monetization of their data, but I see this as an opportunity to educate end-users in these situations.</p>
<p>Most Internet users are not aware of the amount of information being gathered, bought and sold when they use the Internet, and their mobile phones. This lack of awareness is translating pretty nicely to the world of connected devices, adding some valuable demographic dimensions, to an already valuable user profile. While insurance companies are interested in improving their margins with this data, they are also interested in the new revenue streams they can create by selling data to other brokers, hedge funds, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the only hopes I have in this area is that startups will continue to pull back the curtain on this behavior either intentionally or unintentionally with products, services, and programs like the wellness program that Fitbit is offering. Showing users that there is value in their data, and this can be a positive first step in educating them about what is happening in the tech world. Once they get a taste of making some actual cash from their data, I'm hoping that more users establish an appetite for understanding the value of their information.</p>
<p>I'm counting on future waves of startups blindly disrupting industries by continuing to pull back the curtain, as well existing companies looking to gain a competitive advantage by operating this way. Leveraging market forces against industry leaders is one of the most important tools we have in our toolbox to combat exploitation of our data. You will find me encouraging companies to do this as a disruptive tactic, and as a competitive edge, not because I want to help them, but because I want to help end-users with each wave. It is my way of using their quest for startup success against the practices of the wider&nbsp;industry&nbsp;and leveraging it to help end-users in any way that I can.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iotbutton/">The AWS IoT Button</a>, based on the Amazon Dash Button hardware, was kind of sorta an interesting model, allowing you to trigger virtual things with a physical click of a button, but now they've virtualized their approach, which I guess is a decent enough of an idea (not new), but their implementation is just not that smart. I think they just went from virtual to physical, and back again that they kind of got whiplash, and didn't really think it through before launching.</p>
<p>I'm not big on bashing people's technology implementations, as I would rather focus on shining a light on what is progressive in the space, but the area of <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddable tooling built using APIs</a> has suffered so much in the last couple years, I'm not keen on big providers further sucking the oxygen out of the room--AWS can do better. Having a big branded virtualized button with a&nbsp;click for more info on one side, and purchase if you click on the other side seems like something your brands suggested, and not your actual consumers or developers.</p>
<p>I can see the physical AWS IoT button getting some traction, even though the majority of the implementations will be cheezy. Making virtualized buttons should behave like the physical thing seems kind of useless. It seems like AWS could have designed a suite of well-designed HTML + JS button and bookmarklets that engineers can make very useful on the web as well as in a mobile environment. The branding, analytics, and overall experience could make things much more interesting&nbsp;than what you have now, and brand partners could get to work wiring these experiences up to make some pretty valuable API calls, and even daisy chain together multiple API calls across providers.</p>
<p><a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">API powered embeddable buttons is one of the areas of the API space that has left me underwhelmed</a>. After we saw significant movement from Twitter and Facebook with some of their embeddable social buttons, there wasn't much else. This seems to common in the wake of big tech companies doing stuff like this, sucking the innovation out of the room--which is why AWS implementation concerns me.

<p>One of the deciding factors of whether or not I put a new online service to use in my business depends on whether or not they have an API. Sometimes I have no&nbsp;choice in the matter, but if I have any say, a service must allow me to move data in and out of their system programmatically, keeping in sync with my own systems, otherwise I will not adopt the service as part of my regular operations.</p>
<p>One platform I have integrated into my operations is the blogging platform Medium. I handpick some of my content for publishing to Medium, pushing to my account from my own management system using their publishing API. This works well for me, as I require that all of my content, images, and videos are created and originate in my own systems, and then syndicate to other platforms secondarily via APIs--the only downside is that I can't actually pull data from Medium via their API into my management system.</p>
<p>The lack of a read API for Medium content doesn't really hurt me, as I <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">employ a POSSE philosophy</a>, but it does hurt other publishers to the platform because I do not curate their content on Medium on a regular basis. I have to manually go to the Medium.com domain to read API related posts (unless it's a known blog RSS feed), which is something I do not always have the time for. I'm will always prioritize content from platforms that allow me to pull into my news curation systems via RSS, Atom, and APIs, and when I have time I will visit siloed platforms like Medium.</p>
<p>I understand that Medium is concerned about control and monetization of their platform, but a more complete and thoughtful API strategy that involves read and write APIs, embeddable solutions, and considering other leading content API strategies would actually benefit them, as well as their publishers. Not doing this will actually hurt publishers like me. The badly behaved folks will still just scrape what they need, and not having a read API will do nothing to stop this.</p>

<p>APIs are playing an increasing role in all aspects of our public life. Our current president has set the precedent that he will be using Twitter as a primary communication channel, cutting off traditional media and other channels--amplifying the importance of the Twitter API when it comes to doing your job as a journalist.</p>
<p>Journalists don't just need to be plugged into to major platform channels like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others, they also need to be able to conduct research using these platform APIs. Journalists should be fluent in synchronous, and asynchronous pulling of social media and other data via leading APIs. Whether it's pulled through custom programming or using existing tools and services, successful journalists will have a robust toolbox for meeting their needs in this area.</p>
<p>Inversely it will be increasingly important that API platforms consider journalist access to APIs, and consider crafting specific service composition, rate limits, and plans for this level of access. Platforms should also be investing in and incentivizing their 3rd party developers to help develop tooling that aid journalists in their work. Ideally, these solutions would be open source&nbsp;or at least think deeply about monetization strategies in the context of access in support of these activities.</p>
<p>The current political climate should remind us in the API sector that APIs are not just about developing the next generation of startup applications, and are also about enabling end-users, as well as power users like journalists. If you need help thinking through journalist access to a platform, feel free to reach out, and I'm happy to help you think through this level of access from onboarding, to rate limits and the design of your APIs. This stuff is important, and I'm happy to help.</p>

<p>I wish I could write about everything interesting that is going on in the API space, but as a one man show, I struggle to keep up with discovering, reading and understanding what is going on, let alone carving out the time to write something thoughtful about it. Many interesting things get added to my notebook, but I simply do not find the time to finish and publish a story--sadly.</p>
<p>I'm always appreciative of folks who email me ideas for stories based upon interesting things with APIs, but it still doesn't always mean I will find the bandwidth to craft a post. What I really enjoy is when folks ping me about something interesting, but they also write their own story on their own domain, and share via multiple channels like Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. When you do this, it allows me to more easily amplify what you are doing--the chances i will see it are greater.</p>
<p>Even when a company writes about something, I can still choose to augment and add to what has already been written about a subject, via my own blog. Then if I don't have time to craft something I can still amplify what has already been written by a company on Twitter, LinkedIn, and other channels I publish on regularly. I know many companies rely on PR channel to distribute their message, but I don't think this should be instead of publishing on their own blog. Telling stories on your companies blog, reaching out via PR channels, and relying on analysts like me to amplify what you publish makes for&nbsp;a more complete storytelling strategy for your API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_01_26_at_10.26.12_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am pushing forward my security research, and profiling what threat information APIs and platforms are up to. I rarely ever dive into any API without actually signing up for an API, getting some keys, and actually get to work making API calls. I have come across a number of APIs that are just fronts&nbsp;so that they can get in ProgrammableWeb directory, or just issue a press release that they have an API, so I usually prefer to fire things up and validate an API does what is being advertised.</p>
<p>There is no better way to truly get to know an API than to actually make API calls against it and get to work doing some integration. While <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/16/profiling-facebook-threatexchange-api/">profiling the Facebook ThreatExchange API</a> I did what I normally do--requested some keys. The platform doesn't allow for self-service access, so I had to wait for a response, which came as an email a couple days later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Kin,<br /><br /> Thank you for applying to ThreatExchange! Currently, we are in beta and focused on solving the challenges of companies with dedicated abuse detection or incident response teams seeking to share threat intelligence.<br /> At this moment, we don't feel the product is ready for your use-case, but we hope it will be in the near future and will reach back out once it is. We appreciate your patience and understanding.<br /><br /> Please reach out to us if you feel this message is in error or if you have ideas on how we can best support your interest(s).<br /><br /> Best,<br /><br /> Facebook ThreatExchange Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not fault companies for not giving away instant self-service access to their API resources. There are plenty of badly behaved 3rd party developers out there. I do encourage them to try and consider other uses cases beyond just their partner implementations, and 3rd party developer integrations. Journalists, researchers, regulators, and analysts&nbsp;like me all need access&nbsp;and can bring a variety of benefits to the platform beyond integrations.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Facebook ThreatExchange API I am looking to drum up more attention and interest in what they are up to. I really think that if we are going to do this correctly, it will need a lot of attention, a lot of companies at the table, especially leaders like Facebook who have a significant portion of the threat data. I guess I will take what I've learned and educate myself about other threat information exchange platforms, and focus on those efforts (which seems silly), but without access, it is about all I can do.</p>

This is a topic I have folks reach out to me about regularly, wanting to create such a rating system, for a variety of business and political reasons. It is something I'd like to continue to get ahead of before someone who is&nbsp;eviler than I am (I am pretty evil), decides to set something in motion that doesn't include me (ego).</p>
<p>I may sound elitist saying this (I am), but there are very few people who get the API landscape at this level, understand the scope of this challenge, and can have a productive conversation about how to do this. Within 60 seconds of each Skype (yeah Skype)&nbsp;call I have with individuals about an API rating system I can tell which industry they come from&nbsp;and their understanding of what actually affect the quality of APIs--across the technical, business, and politics layers of operations. You have to have been in the space a while, and seen the positive and negative outcomes of API operations to really get the nuance of how you rank and rate API operations in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Developing an API rating and ranking system will take a lot of work, the involvement of the right folks, money, and time. This is an area that is floating higher up on my priority list and will be actively working to solidify&nbsp;a vision, before some of the folks I have talked with, ever get their way. The only existing model for this out in the open currently is from my friends at <a href="http://api500.tumblr.com/">the API Rating Agency</a>. They are some fo the handful&nbsp;of folks who I actually trust to execute on a vision of this importance and scale, but alas they ran into some of the common challenges around the scope of making something like this a reality.</p>
<p>I will be continuing to formalizing my definition of API ratings, but will also be soliciting funds to bring together the smart folks in the space who I feel should be contributing to such an important project. If your company, organization, institution, or agency would like to invest in the existence of an API rating and ranking system please contact me directly. I'm looking to fund the crafting of a formal plan in 2017, and need the money to bring folks together to a single location and discuss. Thanks for your support.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2017</span>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/19/oracle-acquiring-apiary/">I wrote angrily about Oracle's acquisition of Apiary last week</a>, and this week I find myself deeply considering the API definition landscape, so I wanted to take another look at this event from the 100K view. In 2017, API definitions are touching every aspect of the API lifecycle, from design to deprecation,&nbsp;and are becoming key to defining, automating, and evolving many different industries from <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">cloud computing</a> to <a href="http://developer.switchboard.miami.adopta.agency/">human services</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I define API definitions as the specifications, schema, and scopes that are being used to map out the world of APIs. Specifications for describing APIs are nothing new, and approaches to defining data schema are well established as well. However by 2012 things were changing and Swagger emerged as an important tool for describing APIs in JSON, then YAML, using JSON Schema to define the underlying data definition. Around the same time, Apiary got to work on their own API Blueprint for describing APIs, and MSON for helping define the data and the relationships in play. Then, not to be left behind, Mulesoft "jumped" into the game with RAML as well--there are others, but this represents the top three.</p>
<p>In 2016 Swagger was put into the Linux&nbsp;Foundation, under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openapis.org">Open API Initiative (OAI)</a> and was reborn as the OpenAPI Spec, something that in 2017 is beginning to bear fruit with version 3.0 of the specification. Adding another dimension to this shift over the last year, we just saw Oracle purchase Apiary, and since Apiary is currently in the OAI, this means that Oracle is now in the OAI. I'm sure it is just a matter of time before Mulesoft also makes the move to join the OAI, but I'm not sure what this would mean for RAML--or what it means for API Blueprint. I do know OpenAPI Spec is the dominate format right now, and OAI is the leading group.</p>
<p>I want to pause for a moment and also point out that Oracle is the company that recently set the precedent that the naming and ordering of our APIs are copyrightable. You know, the naming, ordering,&nbsp;and mapping out of APIs that we are trying to get on the same page within the OAI, with the OpenAPI Spec? Granted, the precedent was set with the Java API, but it won't be long before another company test this theory out on web APIs. With the current views on patenting APIs, I'm guessing that many API providers already see their APIs as something that copyright applies to.</p>
<p>Just as we are all coming together to hammer out a language to describe how we create, manage, and move around the bits that define us as individuals, the companies we operate, our institutions, and even public spaces, the biggest tech companies are positioning for their role at the table. I'm not saying this is good or bad, black or white, I am just pointing out that companies are taking their positions, and that there are some very different opinions on what intellectual property is, and what needs to be openly defined, and licensed so that the web remains interoperable, reusable, and working for everyone equally.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/the-api-driven-marketplace-that-is-my-digital-self/">I am mapping out all the APIs that are increasingly defining us as individuals</a>. I am also <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">mapping out the API resources that are increasingly defining our small businesses, enterprises, institutions, and government agencies</a>. I am doing all of this with OpenAPI Spec. &nbsp; These API definitions will the be used to design, deploy, virtualize, manage, test, monitor, generate SDKs, integrate, and automate almost every aspect of our personal and professional worlds in 2017. The value of these definitions is only going to increase. The importance that these definitions are openly licensed, accessible, shareable, and reusable is only going to increase. We need this API thing to work, and we don't need unhealthy and greedy views on intellectual property jamming up the gears.</p>
<p>I wish I could help folks who view API definitions as yet another intellectual property see that there is more money to be made when these things are left open. In addition to helping folks understand what API definitions are, and the important role they play, I'm going to invest significant resources helping demonstrate how business, institutions, and government can work more smoothly when API definitions are accessible, and openly licensed. I'm optimistic about the OAI and OpenAPI Spec at the moment, but this optimism can't help but feel overshadowed by other movements on the horizon--we'll see how it all goes.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3insights"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/openapi_spec_structural_improvements.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am impressed with the work that the Open API Initiative (OAI) working group has accomplished with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3insights">version 3.0 release of the OpenAPI Specification</a>. I have had zero involvement in moving the specification forward (something I'm changing), and after coming back to the effort I am impressed with what they've prioritized, and accomplished for this release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlights in version 3.0 of the OpenAPI Spec for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Components</strong> - The new components architecture&nbsp;really reflects "APIs" in my opinion, making things modular and reusable.</li>
<li><strong>Body</strong> - Catching up when it comes to allowing the body to be defined separately from the headers&nbsp;and parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Content Negotiation </strong>- You can now define content objects to define the&nbsp;<span>relationship between response objects, media types, and schema.</span></li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong> - It isn't hypermedia, but it is definitely a nod towards hypermedia, allowing the linking of objects.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - You can now define callbacks that can be attached to a subscription operation describing an outbound operation.</li>
<li><strong>Schema</strong> - Increased investment in JSON Schema, including support of `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `not` support, as well allowing for alternative&nbsp;schema now.</li>
<li><strong>Hosts</strong> - You can now have multiple hosts, allowing you to more narrowly define the host for each path.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong> - Allows you to better describe, and provide examples of APIs responses and requests.</li>
<li><strong>Version Identifier</strong> - Not a big one, but removing the swagger: "2.0" identifier--it will now just be&nbsp;openapi.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong> - I'm not a big fan of this being introduced, but it makes sense, and I'm sure is usable for many API operators.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3insights">The OAI blog provides a five-part series covering the version 3.0 release</a>. These ten areas are the highlights for me. I think they nailed it as far as what was needed, while also pushing into areas like linking and webhooks that I hadn't anticipated. I am looking forward to playing with converting some of my 2.0 specs to be 3.0 compliant--once I am a little more intimate with it, I can do better to estimate how long it will take for me to evolve my platform from 2.0 to 3.0.</p>
<p>I am impressed with what the OpenAPI Spec working group has gotten accomplished. I am optimistic about what is possible with OpenAPI Spec in 2017--something I'm going to be investing in heavily.</p>

<p>Over the holidays <a href="https://github.com/gsa-data/data-gov-dump">I pulled the data.gov index of federal government data</a>, and the next item on my list was to cache the results of the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov/">US Digital Registry API</a><span>&nbsp;, providing me with a list of agencies, and their social media accounts. I pulled the JSON from the API, and then published to the Github repository for this site, so that I could use for several different applications.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Drive Listings Of Federal Agency Social Media</strong><br />I wanted a quick way to get at the Twitter and Github accounts for the federal government, and have in a single location (Github). I've published YAML data to Github, and using Jekyll I've created listings for the Twitter, Github, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts, making them easier to browse when I need them.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Accessible In Machine Readable Format For Others</strong><br />I have several uses for the listing of government agencies and their social media accounts. I needed the data in a machine-readable format on Github so that I could pull remotely, and even check out the Github repository if I need to. This approach also makes the data available for anyone else to fork and put to use in their own way using Github.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Profile The Agencies Using Each Of The Social APIs&nbsp;</strong><br />Now that I have the social media account for these federal gencies&nbsp;pulled using the US Digital Registry API, I'm going to take each of the accounts, and pull their profile details, and any other relevant information using the APIs for each of the social media services. APIs for the win--providing me with a way to quickly profile the US federal government at scale, and stay in tune either real-time or when I think a checkup is required.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm not sure what I'll do next on this project. I'd like to take a look at how active each account is, and maybe check in each week to see if any accounts have gone dormant, picked up in activity, or possibly publishing anything interesting. At this point I just wanted to have the social media landscape for these federal agencies mapped out. I have other social media data beyond what I have displayed on the project site. I just wanted to get going pulling the landscape, then I'll evaluate using the index as an engine for monitoring and tunining in to what government is up to (or not). Once that is done, I'll consider expanding to other social media channels.</span></p>

I do not want this landing page to just speak to developers, I would like it to speak to as wide of an audience as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular API portal is meant to support the development of human service websites, mobile, and other applications in the Miami area. I do not want to scare off the "normals" with the home page. I want to make sure the language I use speaks to API newbies, while also giving experienced developers what they need to get up and running&nbsp;and solve any problems.</p>
<p>While not all APIs will be targeting this wide of an audience, but when it comes to human services at the municipal level, we need to be reaching as many people as we can. I am looking for the developer area to speak to journalists, policy makers, analysts, interns, and even just data curious citizen activists. I think I have all the essential building blocks of an API portal present, things like getting started, documentation, and support, now I just need to polish the titles, text, and other elements so that they are as plain English&nbsp;as they possibly can.</p>
<p>As I do this I shouldn't be assuming that a user will ever be actually integrating with an API, they might just need to understand the concept, what is possible with the API, and then engage with someone else who will actually be doing the technical heavy lifting. I'm going to have to put down the technical work on this project for a day or so&nbsp;before I can write content that speaks to non-developers--I am just too close to the code right now. I want to be able to craft a coherent explanation of the importance of this particular API&nbsp;and incite someone to walk way thinking about what is possible with a human services API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_database_relationships.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am keeping a version of an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> in sync <a href="http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/">with a Data Package</a>. It's not a perfect sync because the Data Package doesn't describe the surface area of the API, just the underlying data schema used on the backend. During project discussions, one of the concerns that was brought up focused on the loss of primary and foreign key references. During our next discussion, I wanted to have a more coherent explanation of why this was ok, and this post will help me do that.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-miami/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi-spec.yaml">OpenAPI Spec I've created</a> has each resource in the <a href="https://github.com/openreferral/specification/blob/master/datapackage.json">Data Package</a>&nbsp;represented but leaves out the database relationships represented by those keys in the backend. The API defines the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for each resource represented, but allows the relationships&nbsp;to be expressed using the URI. Each item in the Data Package has a corresponding path, and each relationship is available as its own path as well--in this case an example might be /locations, and /locations/services/.</p>
<p>All the relationships are defined and enforced in the URI given for each API requests, and HTTP takes care of the indexing, performance, and other considerations using caching, and other basic building blocks of the web. My friend James Higginbotham (<a href="https://twitter.com/launchany">@launchany</a>) compared this to the concept of views in database backend speak, and OpenAPI Spec describes the HTTP version of&nbsp;OCI (oracle), or TSQL (MS SQL)--depending on what you speak. As an old database guy I like that, "web views", but relying on the request and responses employed as part of the API design.</p>
<p>My explanation isn't as coherent as I'd like, but this gives me a start. I'm trying to help database folks who are keepers of the backend, and the schema better understands that what I'm doing with OpenAPI Spec augments and evolves their work. I do not want them to think I am looking to replace or compete with what they are bringing to the table. I'll keep working on this argument because I want to be able to be able to better articulate why API design is an important part of the process, and that&nbsp;defining the API surface area using OpenAPI Spec, as well as the data model in play using specifications like JSON Schema and Data Package is an important thing.</p>

<p>I track on the different approaches used by API providers so that I know where to find examples of leading approaches to API design and deployment. Then I write about them so that I have something to reference across my research. I keep an eye out for <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/apis/">API providers who employ hypermedia as part of their API design</a>, as well as companies who are putting HTTP/2 to work as part of their design and deployment.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/managing-an-http-2-connection">The Amazon Alexa Voice Service API employs HTTP/2 as part of their voice-enablement platform</a>. I'm still learning about HTTP/2 so I was pleased to see the amount of education they provide in their documentation, outlining some of the key terms and concepts at play;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame:</strong>&nbsp;The basic protocol unit in HTTP/2; each frame serves a different purpose, for example, HEADERS and DATA frames form the basis of HTTP requests and responses.</li>
<li><strong>Stream:</strong>&nbsp;An independent, bi-directional sequence of frames exchanged between a client and server within an HTTP/2 connection. For detailed information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5">Streams and Multiplexing in RFC 7540</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Interfaces:</strong>&nbsp;AVS exposes interfaces (SpeechRecognizer, AudioPlayer, SynchronizeState, etc.) that provide your product access to Alexa&rsquo;s built-in skills.</li>
<li><strong>Downchannel:</strong>&nbsp;A stream you create in your HTTP/2 connection, which is used to deliver directives from the cloud to your client. The downchannel remains open in a half-closed state from the device and open from AVS for the life of the connection. The downchannel is primarily used to send cloud-initiated directives and audio attachments to your client</li>
<li><strong>Cloud-initiated Directives:</strong>&nbsp;Directives sent from the cloud to your client. For example, when a user adjusts device volume from the Amazon Alexa App, a directive is sent to your product without a corresponding voice request.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also provide details on crafting the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#headers">HTTP/2 Message Headers</a>, how to construct the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#messages">HTTP/2 Multipart Messages</a>, and what to expect with&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#responses">HTTP/2 Responses</a>. They have language SDKs in C / C++(<a href="https://nghttp2.org/">nghttp2</a>), C / C++(<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl and libcurl</a>), Java (<a href="https://github.com/square/okhttp">OkHttp</a>), Java <a href="http://netty.io/">Netty</a>), Java(<a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.project.git/tree/?h=master">Jetty</a>). I am particularly interested in learning more about how the "Cloud-initiated Directives" works, allowing actions to be sent as part of each connection.</p>
<p>I'm tracking on the moving parts so that I can evolve my own understanding of HTTP/2 in action, and start building a list of APIs who are taking a step forward when it comes to their HTTP infrastructure. It helps to have several different providers to point at when I'm talking about new approaches. I also like to aggregate the common elements that are&nbsp;present, and hopefully, begin to establish a common set of building blocks present when HTTP/2 is put to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is common for an API to just be a facade for a database. Meaning the data, and content served up via the API is read from and written to a database backend. This is probably the most common way to deploy an API, but increasingly I'm working to eliminate the database behind, and storing the content or data being served up via Github repositories.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/providing-yaml-driven-xml-json-and-atom-using-jekyll-and-github/">I find it easier to store individual YAML, JSON, and other machine readable files on Github</a>, and just check out the repository as part of each API deployment. Each API has a different refresh rate determining how often I commit or pull a fresh copy of the content or data, but the API does all of its work with a locally checked out copy of the repository. Eliminating the need for a database backend from the required components to make the API operate.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this? It helps me solve the database challenges when it comes to deploying in containers, and other more modular approaches to deploying APIs as microservices. The API provides a (hopefully) well-designed&nbsp;facade for the data and content stories, and allows me to use my verbs when reading, writing, and managing resources behind. It also injects the benefits of version control, and user and organizational engagement that Github brings to the table.</p>
<p>I'm also using it in on-demand approaches to working with data. I have&nbsp;a lot of government, and other open data stored in Github repositories (free if public), and when I want to work with it, I can spin up a new instance or container, which checks out the latest Github repository, and provides access for reading and writing using a Github OAuth token. When done, the API can be terminated, committing&nbsp;any changes back to the repository, reducing the need for dormant compute resources.</p>
<p>This approach also centralizes the data publicly on Github, allowing anyone else to check out and integrate with the JSON or YAML data and content sources--leveraging Git as the broker. Going down this road I have lost some of the indexing, search&nbsp;and other common database features I enjoy, but I'm slowly evolving the backend API code to work with the YAML or JSON file stores more efficiently. I actually find going back to working with simple static machine-readable files to be refreshing, and using Github makes it even more usable. I will keep writing as I evolve this approach, and provide more open examples of it in action.</p>

<p>I am going through <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">the Amazon Alexa platform</a>, profiling it as part of <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">my voice API research</a>, and also thinking deeply about the impact voice-enablement, and conversational interfaces will or will not make in our lives. I've been pretty vocal that I am not too excited about voice-enablement in my own world&nbsp;but it is something&nbsp;I understand other folks are, and I'm also interested in Amazon's approach to operating their platform--making it something I'm digging deeper into.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not own any of the voice enabled&nbsp;Amazon devices, but I am playing with <a href="https://echosim.io/">their simulator Echosim.io</a>. I'm not interested in building any skills&nbsp;or applications for Alexa, but I am curious to learn how the platform functions, so I will be developing prototypes&nbsp;so that I can understand things better. One of the things I'm looking to understand as I'm getting up to speed is how the logging for the platform works, so I can evaluate the observability of the voice platform&nbsp;from developers, as well as an end-user perspective.</p>
<p>From a developer perspective, I see that you have access to device&nbsp;synchronize state, user inactivity, and exceptions encountered via the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system">Alexa Voice Service System Interface</a>, and from an <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#settings">end-user perspective, there is a history section under device settings</a>. It is a decent start from a logging perspective, but I'm thinking that transparency and observability at this level are going to be important to establish trust between end-users and the platform. With a lot of the speculation around the ambient capabilities of these devices, I'm thinking a robust logging, reporting, and auditing layer to Alexa will be critical to making folks feel like it is something they want in their homes.</p>
<p>I'm thinking through the logging layer of my drone platform usage, and what is available to me as end-user, and developer. Alexa provides me another dimension of this logging layer, but this time in the service of voice-enablement. Further rounding off my view of what should be available when it comes to logging, reporting, and observability of the different types of devices we are connecting to the Internet. As I push forward in both these areas of my Internet of Things (IoT) research I will publish my work here on API Evangelist, as well as the individual <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a>, <a href="http://drones.apievangelist.com/">drone</a>, and <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com">logging</a> research areas.</p>

<p>I have been looking for a decent search engine API to help me uncover new sources of information across the API space. I've always been frustrated with the APIs in this category since all of the good Google search APIs went away. I need to search the web, and specifically for blog and news posts with API related insights. In an effort to find a suitable solution I recently came across and spent time digging into one called&nbsp;<a href="https://webhose.io/apis.json">Webhose.io, primarily because they had an APIs.JSON file</a>.</p>
<p>Webhose.io integrates data from hundreds of&nbsp;thousands of global online sources in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/social-media-data">Social Media Data</a>&nbsp;-</strong> Structured data from top social media sites.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/forum-monitoring-api">Forum Monitoring</a>&nbsp;-</strong> Post data from across many forums.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/blog-search-api">Blog Search</a>&nbsp;-</strong> Pulls the latest from blogs even if no RSS feed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/news-search-api">News Search</a>&nbsp;- </strong>Access to news from PR sites that don't usually have a feed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/web-search-api">Web Search</a>&nbsp;-</strong> Gives me access to the latest content from many domains on the&nbsp;web.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not a big fan of forum monitoring (too much noise), but access to social media, blog, news, and web&nbsp;data and content is extremely valuable to me. Webhose.io indexes quite a few domains, and I was able to find <a href="http://apievangelist.com">#mce_temp_url#</a>apievangelist.com, and my girlfriends <a href="http://hackeducation.com">hackeducation.com</a> in there. Webhose.io allows you to query across categories, using a keyword, and by domain, and they also allow you to set how many days back you'd like to search (up to 30 days)--making it great for staying in tune with the latest content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the API mostly because it gets straight to the point, allowing you to quickly sign up for an account, easily craft API calls, then provides valuable, relevant data and content, enriched with tags, sentiment, and other goodies. They also provide a straightforward business model, allowing you to get 1000 free API calls per month, and incremental&nbsp;monthly packages with different quantities from there. I will be wiring up the API to my monitoring system, adding Webhose.io to t<a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">he stack of APIs I use to run API Evangelist</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-fist.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I'm thinking about cloud pricing after <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">my profiling of over 60 of the AWS API resources</a>, as I play with <a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2016/12/05/algorithmic-rotoscope/">building tools on Algorithmia</a>, and evaluate a variety of serverless options. As someone who is regular blindsided by the devious undercurrents of business, while I'm busy focusing on shiny technological objects, I can't help but feel like us developers are contributing to the commoditization of our (currently) valuable skillset when it comes to APIs, microservices, devops, and serverless.</p>
<p>This isn't exclusive to these areas of technology, and I think it is something we've all set into motion with APIs and microservices over the last decade. We are decoupling some very complex, and often large codebases and dependencies that take a certain amount of experience and skills to tackle, and reducing down to individual reusable resources that are automatically scaled, and may not require as many advanced skills to daisy chain and connect together. I'm all for doing this in the spirit of enabling the average business person to accomplish what they need on a daily, but from my experience in the savviness, and deviance of business leaders, I can't help but feel that eventually developer's labor will be devalued in this environment. </p>
<p>If we succeed, all company resources are available via APIs and microservices and all events and actions are present as "serverless" technology, and each individual resource will have a price tag, opening everything up for commoditization and extreme competition--this is good right? There will still be room for a handful of high paid architects in this environment, but new pieces of code will be able to be developed in isolation, at a very reduced price, with a huge amount of competition driving what developers will be paid way down. We are ultimately working against ourselves in this environment, and our best interest by achieving the current vision of "scale". </p>
<p>I do not think that the technology being employed (API, microservices, devops, and serverless) will be entirely responsible for this. Business elements will be a driving force, the constant push for efficiency, scalability, lower costs, and a quest for profits will significantly fuel things. Also, political force like a lack of awareness of the history of labor, and the toxic views of unions in Silicon Valley, set in motion by libertarian white male dominance in venture capital is establishing an extremely rich environment for this to rapidly move into realms that are out of control of the average technology worker--it will happen so quickly we won't even notice it. </p>
<p>This is an area I am just getting started thinking on. It is a feeling that kept bubbling up as I was reviewing Amazon Web Services, and thinking about APIs, microservices, devops, and serverless at a high level. I'm not as knowledgeable on the history of labor as some folks around me, but I know enough that automation sounds good to us in theory, but is something that often benefits those in power, and rarely benefit those in the middle, and at the bottom. I think many of us predominately white male technologists are willfully blind to the role we are playing in our own commoditization and reducing our hard work to something that will barely sustain a living wage in the near future. </p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/gorilla_red_circuit.jpg" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/oracle-boosts-cloud-offering-with-apiary-api-management-tool-acquisition/">Oracle has purchased API design provider Apiary</a>. I'm a big fan of what Apiary does, and what the team has accomplished. I don't trade in Silicon Valley currency, so I'm not going to congratulate the team on their exit. For me, it is just a reminder of how we can't have anything nice in the space. No matter how good your team is, or how good your product or services are, the thousand&nbsp;pound gorillas will always come in the room and fuck things up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am bummed about the acquisition of Apiary because they are essential to my API design origin story. Jakub, Z, and the Apiary team made API definitions to be more about API design&nbsp;than just API documentation. Pushing the conversation earlier on in the API lifecycle, opening up the concept that API definitions could be used for not just documenting your APIs after they are live, and all about design early on in the process, something that opened up for use across every stop along the API life cycle. This resulted in API definitions being core to mocking, deployment, management, SDKs, testing, monitoring, and much, much more. #thankyou</p>
<p>Apiary was something I was proud to support in the API sector--Oracle is not. The negative mark this company has left in the space far outweighs anything good they could possibly do through acquisitions or any new solutions. With this post, I will get the usual waves of people telling me this is "just business", which is code for how people fuck each other over under their capitalist religion. So, go ahead and tell me how I live in a fantasy world, when in reality it is you who live in a fantasy world where it isn't about producing a good product, or service, it is just about your love of money, quest to be rich, and your willingness&nbsp;to allow for good things (and people) to be screwed over along the way.</p>
<p>Over the last&nbsp;decade, I've often been pretty naive about how money works, allowing myself to get overly excited about good people, products, interesting&nbsp;technology, and tooling. You won't find me making these mistakes in the future, even if I have to be a grumpy&nbsp;fucker to new startups that come along. I hate being in the business of telling energetic young startup founders of the realities of the world, throwing a wet blanket on their enthusiasm, but when I do jump on a call with new entrants I will be reminding them of the realities of how all of this works, and that at some point they will be fucking over their end-users and developers--it's just business.</p>
<p>I will be rewriting my history of APIs&nbsp;and will be&nbsp;removing emphasis on Apiary's role in the API design world. Isn't this what white dudes do? It is why it's called "his"-story. The impact they made will remain, and I will always be thankful for, but I'll be damned if I give Oracle any traffic and exposure in my research. Another sad day for the API space, leaving me believing more and more in my <a href="http://techgypsi.es/">Tech Gypsy philosophy</a>&nbsp;that there is no way to have anything nice in the world of technology, and that we will all just have to learn how to survive in the cracks, because power will always creep in and ruin the platforms that we love. :-( ;-( ;-(</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>The API universe is rapidly expanding as more companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are sharing data, content, and algorithms using web APIs. It has expanded so much in the last year that I can't keep up with everything that is going on. I can't test new APIs, and the emerging services and tooling from providers who are targeting the space fast enough--that is ok, I'm not sweating it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I do have to prioritize and focus on the areas where I can make the biggest impact when it comes to my understanding, and when it comes to helping the API community. While I will still be maintaining a general awareness of all technologies in 2017 I'm going to be heavily focused on three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definition - </strong>The machine-readable definition of an API interface, security and data models.</li>
<li><strong>Data Schema -</strong> A JSON schema, MSON, or other machine-readable description of data schema.</li>
<li><strong>OAuth Scope </strong>- Shared definitions of OAuth scopes in play for an API and it's resources.</li>
<li><strong>Web Specifications</strong> - Web concepts and specifications that make the web go around.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code plays a significant role, and specific implementations are important, but for me, these four areas represent the core of the API space. Defining, employing, discussing, and sharing in these areas is how the API space will scale, and meet the needs of specific industries. Investing in these areas will make the API sector healthier, stronger, and make an impact when it comes to combatting much of the focus on investment, and proprietary of technology that works against things being truly interoperable reusable.</p>
<p>In 2017 I'm focusing the majority of my work in these areas. These are not the areas where the money will be in the future, but it will be what enables all the areas that do make startups money and make a difference on the ground at small businesses and the enterprise. Investment in common definitions, schema, scopes, and specifications will be the #2 challenge for API sector in coming years, right after security. I'm not sure what I can do on the security front, but I know I can make an impact when it comes to helping define common patterns of the API universe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-trust.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>What happens when we can't trust the numbers our service providers report to us? I personally do not stress over my analytics and traffic, views, and other numbers we are engineering our worlds to run by, but when you are paying for a service--I definitely have an opinion. <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/complete-list-facebooks-misreported-metrics-and-what-they-mean">Facebook recently had a series of misreporting events around their metrics</a>, leaving us questioning the numbers we are fed by our service providers on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There is no way that we can be 100% sure our service providers are telling us the truth--we have to trust them. However, there are ways that API providers can be more transparent when it comes to the data behind the numbers. It is easy enough to open up the log files, and other data that went into calculating the numbers when operating a platform. Many of the advertising and other service providers in questions have APIs to control the parts of the systems a platform desires you to perform--they just don't like pulling back the curtain, and showing what is truly going on.</p>
<p>If you do not fully trust your provider's numbers make sure and let them know publicly and privately that you would like access to the raw data behind. APIs can be designed to provide access to any data, as well as provide observability into the algorithms that driving any process. This is not a question of whether it's possible technically, it is a question of whether it is possible politically, and whether or not your service provider is willing to be transparent enough with you to develop the required trust needed for all of this to work properly.</p>

<p>I like to pick worrisome patents from <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">my API patent research</a> and share them on my blog regularly. Last week I talk about&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/10/patent-us9300759-b1-api-calls-with-dependencies/">Patent #US9300759 B1: API Calls With Dependencies</a> and today I want to talk about <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20150363171.PGNR.">patent #US</a><a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20150363171.PGNR.">09471283:&nbsp;Generating virtualized application programming interface (API) implementation from narrative API documentation</a>, which according to its abstract is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A virtualized Application Program Interface (API) implementation is generated based upon narrative API documentation that includes sentences that describe the API, by generating programming statements for the virtualized API implementation based on parsing the narrative API documentation and generating the virtualized API implementation based on upon the programming statements for the virtualized API implementation. The parsing of the narrative documentation may use a natural language parser and a domain-specific ontology for the API that may be obtained or created for the API. The virtualized API implementation may be generated using an API virtualizer.</em></p>
<p><span>I generally won't talk smack about folks filing patents, except I'm a pretty strong believer that the API interface and the supporting elements that make an API do the API thing should be left out. All the elements present in this patent like virtualization, documentation, and narrative need to be open--this is how things work. Just when we are all beginning to get good when it comes to crafting useful APIs, learning to speak in complete sentences with multiple APIs, we are going to patent the process of telling stories with APIs? Sorry, it just doesn't compute for me. I know this is what ya'll&nbsp;do at bigcos, but it's counterproductive.</span></p>
<p>Instead of filing this patent I wish they would have taken their idea and launched as open source tool, then also launch an accompanying service running in the cloud, and get to work letting us crafting narratives around our APIs. As I've said before, these patents really mean nothing, and it will all come down to <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/feed/search/?q=%22application+programming+interface%22&amp;order_by=score+desc&amp;stat_Precedential=on&amp;type=o&amp;">keeping an eye on the court filings using the CourtListener API</a>&nbsp;for any cases that are being litigated using API related patents.</p>
<p><span>It won't stop me from complaining, though. I just wish folks would spend their time on more productive things, instead of slowing down the world of APIs.</span></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/16/what-are-the-goals-behind-launching-an-api-portal/">What Are The Goals Behind Launching An API Portal?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/portal_screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was getting ready to do some work on a developer portal for a project I'm working on and I wanted to stop, step back and try to define what the goals in launching this portal are. As the technologist on this project, it is easy for me to impose my belief in why I am launching&nbsp;this portal (to publish documentation), but I feel it is important that we get the perspective of all stakeholders--so, I asked everyone involved what the goals were.</p>
<p>In the short term, the goals are to engage these groups around the API resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engage Third-Parties -</strong> Bring in new, and stimulate existing usage of data made available via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Departments</strong> - Ensure the internal groups are also engaged, and part of the outreach.</li>
</ul>
<p>While incentivizing the following things between engaged stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aware</strong> - Help make people aware of available resources, and what is being done with them.</li>
<li><strong>Conversations</strong> - Stimulate focused conversations&nbsp;among&nbsp;stakeholders around data and APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong> - Focus on solving tangible issues that actually make an impact in the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long term the goals to stimulate projects that matter, and can possibly bring in sustainable relationships and revenue that will help ensure the platform is up and running, and serving the target audiences. It takes money to do APIs properly, keeping the servers running, code evolving, active outreach and support in the community, and a passionate, engaged community to develop valuable projects.</p>
<p>I know all of this sounds overly simplified, but it is actually the thought process I'm applying to this project. I would say it is oversimplified to say that we are just launching a portal so that people will use our APIs. We need some basic goals about who we are reaching out to, and what we are trying to accomplish--we can evolve, and continue to define from there. When I lay out the outline for this project's portal I will make sure each element that I include speaks to these goals, or I will not put it in the version 1.0 of the portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I want to make sure <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">my minimum viable API portal definition</a> speaks to the widest possible audience, and not just to developers. Then I will get to work on setting up the first version of the portal for use in this API project, and we'll consider what's next.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_01_15_at_6.40.58_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm spending some cycles on discovering what "<a href="http://cybersecurity.apievangelist.com">cybersecurity</a>" or "<a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">security</a>" API solutions are out there, but specifically looking at threat information related to operating on the web. First up on the list is F<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/v2.8">acebook's ThreatExchange API</a>, and I wanted to go through and break down what they offer via their API as I work to define an <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI Spec</a>, and their overall API operations as I populate&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;file.This process helps me better understand what Facebook is offering in this area, as well as producing a machine readable definition that I can use across the rest of my research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what is Facebook ThreatExchange?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Learn about threats. Share threat information back. Everyone becomes more secure. Most threat intelligence solutions suffer because the data is too hard to standardize and verify. Facebook created the ThreatExchange platform so that participating organizations can share threat data using a convenient, structured, and easy-to-use API that provides privacy controls to enable sharing with only desired groups.</em></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<li>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Scale your intelligence -</strong>&nbsp;Threats like malware and phishing will often attack many targets. Safeguard yourself using shared intelligence from other&nbsp;</em>participants<em>.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>A better way to share -&nbsp;</strong>Utilize a structured platform to send and receive information about threats.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Join ThreatExchange -&nbsp;</strong>Learn about threats. Share threat information back. Everybody becomes more secure. *in beta</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm wanting to understand Facebook's motivations behind doing the ThreatExchange API, and better understand the technical, business, and political aspects of providing a platform like this. When profiling a platform I always start with the endpoints, as I feel like they give the most honest accounting of what is going on.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-analyses">/malware_analyses</a> </strong>- Search for malware samples by hash and other metadata.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-families">/malware_families</a></strong> - Search for malware families by name and other metadata.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-descriptors">/threat_descriptors</a> </strong>- Enables searching for indicators of compromise descriptors.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicators">/threat_indicators</a> -</strong> Enables searching for indicators of compromise.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-tags">/threat_tags</a> -</strong> Enables searching for threat tags.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-exchange-members">/threat_exchange_members</a> -</strong> Returns a list of current members of the ThreatExchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I look at the underlying data and object model, and since Facebook uses their Graph model for their ThreatConnect API, it is pretty easy to pick up and get running with things--here are the graph objects used as part of the ThreatExchange:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware">Malware</a> </strong>- A sample of the malware.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-family">MalwareFamily</a></strong> - A group, cluster or similar type grouping of&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware">Malware</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-descriptor">ThreatDescriptor</a> </strong>- The subjective context provided by a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-exchange-member">ThreatExchangeMember</a>&nbsp;for a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-exchange-member">ThreatExchangeMember</a> </strong>- A participant within ThreatExchange.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a> </strong>- An indicator of compromise.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threattags">ThreatTags</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;A label to group threat objects together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook also allows for "types" to be applied across the ThreatConnect objects, adding additional dimensions to the objects available via the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/attack-type">AttackType</a> -</strong> The kind of attack a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a>&nbsp;object was associated with.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/privacy-type">PrivacyType</a></strong> - Defines who can access the threat intelligence.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/review-status-type">ReviewStatusType</a></strong> - &gt;A description of how the threat intelligence was vetted.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/severity-type">SeverityType</a></strong> - A description of the dangerousness of the threat associated with a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a>&nbsp;object. The order of the values below is ordered from least severe to most severe.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/signature-type">SignatureType</a></strong> - The kind or format of signature described by a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a>&nbsp;object with&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-type">ThreatType</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<code>SIGNATURE.</code></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/share-level-type">ShareLevelType</a></strong>&nbsp;(aka Traffic Light Protocol or TLP) - A designation of how any object in ThreatExchange may be re-shared both within and outside of ThreatExchange, based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.us-cert.gov%2Ftlp%2F&amp;h=wAQFD5gM2&amp;s=1">US-CERT's Traffic Light Protocol</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>I was pleased to see webhook infrastructure available, making things a two-way street, and a little more responsive and real-time. I would also consider a streaming technology at this layer eventually, making it easier to manage at scale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/webhooks">Webhooks</a></strong>&nbsp; - ThreatExchange Webhooks allow you to receive information in real-time for MalwareAnalyses, ThreatDescriptors, and MalwareFamilies.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was also good to see privacy considerations right out of the box. If you are going to get other companies to participate at this level and share real-world threat information, there have to be granular controls to help mediate the politics of all of this. The Facebook approach also doesn't just deal with identity, groups, and access, it also dictates the sharing of information--I am guessing a logging layer at this level will be needed in the future, with an API for it as well, to enable 3rd party auditing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/privacy">Privacy Controls</a> </strong>- All submissions to the ThreatExchange API allow for limiting the visibility of any Malware and ThreatDescriptor objects. Currently, ThreatExchange supports three levels of visibility: allow all members; allow a ThreatPrivacyGroup; &nbsp;and allow a whitelist of specific members. The desired privacy setting on an object is specified by the values at the time of a create or edit submission to the API. Privacy settings can also be changed retroactively for data you've already submitted.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/resharing">Reshare</a></strong> - All submissions to the ThreatExchange API allow for defining how the data can be re-shared by its recipients. The level of re-sharing is applied via the share_level attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where this API becomes an exchange. With the required privacy and sharing controls in place, the submitting of new data, connecting the dots between data, and evolving the history of everything in real time can occur, allowing trusted 3rd parties to not just access data, but confidently share it with the ThreatExchange.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/submitting/v2.8">Submitting New Data</a></strong> - You may submit data to the graph via an HTTP POST request the following URL: <em>https://graph.facebook.com/v2.8/threat_descriptors</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/submitting-connections">Submitting Connections</a></strong> - ThreatExchange supports creating connections (aka edges) between ThreatIndicator objects to express relationships. Examples of when this can be useful are for describing URL re-direct chains or domain to IP address relationships.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/editing">Editing Existing Data</a></strong> - The ThreatExchange API allows for editing existing ThreatIndicator objects. As with all Facebook Graph APIs, editing is performed via an HTTP POST request to the object's unique ID URL.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/deleting">Deleting Data</a></strong> - ThreatExchange currently supports true deletes only for connections between ThreatIndicator objects to express relationships. Examples of when this can be useful are for describing URL re-direct chains or domain to IP address relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, there are some more support level elements present. I track on these elements as part of my indexing with an APIs.json, so that anyone can easily find the code, examples, and other supporting resources without clicking around, and digging through the documentation.</p>

</ul>
<p>There are more general elements of the Facebook Developer community present as well, but this provides a nice roundup of all the elements that make up the Facebook ThreatExchange API, providing one possible blueprint for how we share threat information associated with operating any platform on the web. I'm going to be looking at other solutions in this same space, but I wanted to profile Facebook's effort in this area first, as they probably have the most insight and investment in this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Are Facebook's Motives With ThreatExchange?</strong><br />One thing I want to learn more about is why Facebook would want to do the ThreatExchange. I'm sure they truly want to share the wealth of data they have on threats they have there, but I'm sure they equally want incentivize other tech giants to share their data as well, sweetening the entire pot. I would add that they might also be doing this to alleviate any future regulatory pressures that may unfold around cybersecurity legislation. All we can do is monitor what is going on and see how much Facebook, and others invest into ThreatExcahgne before we will know the full extent of the motivations behind the platform.</p>
<p><strong>A Possible Blueprint For Wider Threat Exchange Model&nbsp;</strong><br />This post is part of my research into <a href="http://apievangelist.com">security</a> and <a href="http://cybersecurity.apievangelist.com">cybersecurity</a>. As with the other areas of my research I am looking for the common building blocks of how APIs are being used to understand, map out, defend, and share threat information. I'm happy to see Facebook being proactive in this area, but this feels like it needs to become an open standard and wider blueprint that can be operated by an independent party, with trusted arrangements from each provider regarding what is being submitted and shared--for it to work properly. I have a lot more research to conduct before I make this determination, but it is where I'm headed with my thinking in this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Researcher and Journalist Access To Data On Exchange</strong><br />I applied for access to the Facebook ThreatExchange API, but I'm unsure if I will be given access, being that I am just a blogger. This opens up a wider question, though, regarding opening up this valuable information to researchers, journalists, and 3rd party auditors. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/service-level-agreements-for-researchers-who-depend-on-apis/">I talked about the need for API access tiers and potentially service level agreements for research and journalists</a>&nbsp;previously, and threat information is definitely an area we need to deeply consider who has access to this important data, in a similar way. We need to be ensuring the privacy of companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are protected, but we also need to allow for a wider understanding of this problem to be established, with more eyes on the data.</p>
<p><strong>Further Assessment of APIs and Threat Information Solutions</strong><br />I am just getting going with this research, and it will take some time for me to paint a complete picture of the landscape when it comes to online threat data, and how APIs are being used. I'll publish each profile as I complete them, and eventually, I'd like to have a common definition of all the API paths, and underlying schema being employed as part of the leading threat data sharing platforms. If we are going to scale the effort to address this growing problem, we are going to need a wealth of APIs in operation, and ensure they are all speaking a common dialect. I need to develop a better understanding of the politics around the operation of a threat data API, but I'm guessing it is something we don't want in the hands of any single, leading tech provider.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Silicon Valley startups and entrepreneurs love to point out that they are trying to make the world a better place. Over a 25+ year career, I have fallen for the belief that I was improving a situation through technology. Hell, I still do this regularly as the API Evangelist, stating that a certain approach to opening up access to data, content, and algorithms can make things better, when in numerous situations it will not. I walk a fine line with this and I hope that I'm a little more critical about where technology should be applied, and focus primarily on making existing technology more accessible using APIs--not starting new ones.</p>
<p>When you are critical of technology in the current climate, there are plenty of folks you like to push back on you, leaning on the fact that they are trying to make the world a better place. Not sure where this line of bullshit first began but is something I should look into. I mean, when you hang out with enough entrepreneurs you really begin see through the bullshit and hype, and you know that this is all about them selling you something, and then selling you and your data as part of an exit via acquisition or going public. It rarely ever has anything to do with making the world a better place, what was promised as part of the marketing, and helping the average end-user.</p>
<p>This is where my entrepreneur friends have stopped reading&nbsp;and lean on the fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they actually believe they are trying to make the world a better place</span>, and their firm belief that Kin is an annoying hippie. You know I love you. You are a&nbsp;special snowflake. But, you are a minority, I am talking about the other 95% of the system you choose to be willfully ignorant of. If you want some evidence of this in the wild, take a look at all the world saving, innovative, revolution startups out there and how many are dedicated to terms of service?</p>
<p>You know, those little legal documents we agree to for our usage of every device in our life, and every single application we use in our professional and personal worlds. The terms of service touch ALL of our lives, and act as a central force throughout our days--kind of like gravity, except it's a corporate force, not anything natural--pushing down on everything we do. As important as terms of services are, and how big of a role they play in our lives, where is the innovation around these legal documents? You know, the kind that assists the average citizen make sense of all of this bullshit and makes their life better?</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;<a href="https://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>, <a href="https://www.docracy.com">Docracy</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://tosback.org/">TOSBack</a>, but they just don't have the resources to tackle this properly. There are some service providers who do a good job of helping users make sense of their own terms of service, but there is NO INNOVATION when it comes to terms of service. There is nothing that serves the end-users over the platforms. With all of the innovation going on out there why isn't there more investment, and solutions in the area of terms of service? I mean, if we are trying to make our user's lives easier with technology, and not more complicated, why isn't there more technology to make sense of this legalese that is governing our lives?</p>
<p>Hint, it is because we aren't out for the greater good. With all the money flowing around out there, I just can't believe there isn't the money to do this right. Provide a suite modern tooling and a wealth of legal resources to tackle this problem properly. If nothing else, let's throw TOS Didn't Read, Docracy, and EFF's TOSBAck more money. Maybe there should be a "guilt tax" imposed on every terms of service owner to pay for an English, human translation of the legal documents that guide their platforms. Maybe there should be a machine-readable schema enforced at the regulatory level, making sure a suite of tools can process, and make sense of TOS changes in real-time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe some day we will stop just saying we are trying to help the world with our technology, and actually invest in what truly does.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/13/requiring-ssl-for-api-all-calls/">Requiring SSL For API All Calls</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_11_28_at_9.58.49_am.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is one of those regular public service announcements that if at all possible, you should be requiring SSL for all your API calls. I recently got an email from the IBM Watson team telling me that they would be enforcing encryption on all calls to the Alchemy API in February.</p>
<p>SSL is something I've started enforcing on my own internal APIs. I do not have wide usage of my APIs by third-party providers, but I do have a variety of systems making calls to my APIs, transmitting some potentially sensitive&nbsp;information--luckily nothing too serious, as I'm just a simple API Evangelist.</p>
<p><a href="http://encryption.apievangelist.com/">Encryption is an area I research regularly</a>, hoping to stay in tune (as much as I can) with where discussions are going when it comes to encryption and API operations. Much of it doesn't apply to the average API provider&nbsp;but requiring encryption for API calls, and emailing your developers when and if you do begin enforcing, is what I'd consider an essential building block for all API providers.</p>
<p>I'll keep crafting a unique blog post each time I receive on of these emails from the APIs I depend on. Hopefully some day soon, all APIs will be SSL by default.</p>
