<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Mashery-Logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" />[Mashery][1] is an API management service provider that offers an API as a Software as a Service (SaaS). You can leverage Mashery's platform to get an API planned, deployed, and into operation quickly. Mashery makes a pretty compelling [buy versus build argument when planning for your API][2].

[Mashery][1] provides a wide array of tools in three distinct areas:

  * **API Management** building blocks like API registration, credential management, usage throttling and business rules.
  * **Metrics and Reporting** building blocks like API usage, developer activity, systems status, and real-time insights into API operations.
  * **Community Management** building blocks for blogs, wiki, general content management, change control, and forums.
Mashery is definitely the leader in this space. It has a robust set of API management features as well as a service level agreement and extensive API support portal.

Mashery also understands the [API developer network][3] to enable deeper integration of their API services.

Mashery's platform, collective experience, resources, and support makes it enticing to use them as a platform for launching and growing your API.
