		<p>API Evangelist is about making sense of the world of application programming interfaces, or simple APIs. APIs have become part of every layer of our Internet connected world over the last 20 years, and this is my research project into understanding what is happening. As of 2019 I am also the Chief Evangelist for Postman, but I still use this site in the same I have since 2010, as a scratch pad for what I am working on, and stories about I see APIs being used.</p>
		<p>This isn't meant to be a blog in the traditional sense of the word, and you should think of it as Kin Lane's personal notebook that he is fine with others reading. If you have any comments about my work feel free to take it to Twitter and engage with me there, or if you feel like you'd like to talk to me personally, feel free to email info@apievangelist.com.</p>
