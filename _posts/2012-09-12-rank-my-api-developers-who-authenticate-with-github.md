{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m updating the login and authentication for my content management system, APIs and other tools to provide authentication using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Github by default.I’m using Singly as an authentication provider, because their aggregation of API authentication, endpoints and objects across these providers is easy and most efficient way I know to get this accomplished.In addition to it being easy, I’m using Singly for another advantage.Each service Singly provides has a discovery endpoint, which provides me with metadata and the other endpoints each service provides.I want to use this meta data to derive a quick snapshot ranking of my authenticating user.</p>
