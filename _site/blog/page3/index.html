<p class="p1">I&rsquo;m obsessed with making my Postman collections more accessible and executable to developers and non-developers. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2019/11/13/why-is-api-onboarding-and-authentication-still-so-hard/">I&rsquo;m really frustrated that on-boarding with APIs is still so difficult</a>, and I&rsquo;m determined to reduce friction in this area in 2020. I&rsquo;m confident that Postman collections plus environments represent the next stage in API integration, automation, and orchestration, but we still have some sharp corners to round off when it comes to streamling the on-boarding of new users to each APIs being referenced within each Postman reference, workflow, capability, collaboration, walkthrough, and the numerous other types of Postman collections that are emerging across the API landscape.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">I&rsquo;ve been working hard to create a number of new Postman collections and even once you click on the Run in Postman button for each API collection, you still have to go signup for an account, create an OAuth application, and plugin in the OAuth details for API before you can make your first API call &mdash; this is dumb. We desperately need to redefine what an application is in the context of the API management layer for providers. As I&rsquo;ve said many times before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2019/10/04/personal-api-tokens-for-all-apis-please/">every API provider needs to provide personal OAuth access tokens by default as part of your account like GitHub does</a>. This should be the baseline for all APIs, but we also need more services and tooling that helps us generate and manage tokens for use across our low-code and no-code API integration solutions. I got frustrated enough recently that I just began hacking together what I am simply calling: <a href="https://environments.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist Environments</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://environments.apievangelist.com"><img src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_environments_screenshots.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s a pretty crude tool, but it represents a pretty good start. It helps establish a base OAuth application for a handful of common APIs, allowing anyone to click and generate a token which can be used to make API calls. If you put your Postman API key in the text box, it will also generate a Postman environment and place it in your Postman account. There are lots of other things to consider as part of this project--things like the scope of each token request, the naming of the Postman environment key, and which services do I add next. It doesn't do everything I need, but it is a nice start. It helps me quickly generate OAuth tokens for the services I&rsquo;m building collections for, and it gets me thinking about what is next when it comes to making my Postman collections easier to use out of the box.</p>
<p class="p1">I&rsquo;m going to work on adding more services to the list of APIs. It is hard to know which services to add, so I have added a link to GitHub issues so other people can suggest. There is no backend to this service, it just generates the tokens, and environment, the pushes the each environment to Postman via the API, and displays the token and name of the environment to the screen. I do log each time it is executed, including the timestamp, IP address, and which service was called, but beyond that I&rsquo;m not storing anything&mdash;I will leave it up to Postman to manage the environments. I was just looking for a quick and dirty way to generate tokens and put to use in Postman&mdash;I will work on expanding, refining, and polishing API Evangelist Environments more in the next couple of months.</p>

<p class="p1">I&rsquo;m creating more Postman environments lately. I&rsquo;m realizing the potential for using environments as a pivotal layer in defining and working with Postman collections. Environments are the missing ingredient from OpenAPI, and provide a powerful way to abstract away key value pairs, including keys and tokens from the Postman collections, allowing me to apply the same Postman collection over and over but in different contexts. As I&rsquo;m pushing the boundaries of working with API environments I&rsquo;m being pushed to think more deeply about how I name my variables so that they stay in sync with Postman collections, but more specifically work seamlessly across many different types of Postman collections.</p>
<p class="p1">An example of this shift has emerged while I am crafting&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/aws">Postman collections for AWS APIs</a>,&nbsp;and was defining a base environment for each collection with a handful of key / value pairs which I will need to actually fire up a collection and begin making calls to each AWS API I am targeting with each Postman collection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>baseURL</strong> - The baseURL for use across all the requests I have organized into collections.</li>
<li><strong>accessKey</strong> - One half of the keys needed for authenticating against any AWS API.</li>
<li><strong>secretKey</strong> - The other half of the keys needed for authenticating against any AWS API.</li>
<li><strong>region</strong> - The region where each of the APIs I&rsquo;m engaging with are operating within AWS.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">As I build each Postman environment I am naming each one with the same name as I am applying to the Postman reference collection I am creating for each AWS API. This works well in isolation, but the approach begins to break down as I begin crafting capability, workflow, and walk through Postman collections that will be putting multiple AWS from across multiple AWS services to work. This realization has made me aware that I am going to need to begin developing a more comprehensive and long term strategy for crafting my environments, as well as the variables I use across them, making my environments more flexible and adaptable to many different Postma collection scenarios.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">When defining access and secret keys I can increase or decrease the scope of keys across the AWS services I am using, but when it comes to baseURL and region I am going to need to get more precise when it comes to the service I&rsquo;m targeting within each collection. I am considering appending two namespace tags to each Postman environment key I am crafting.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provider</strong> - Using provider_ as a prefix for all baseURL and regions.</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong> - Using service_ as a prefix for<span>&nbsp; </span>all baseURL and regions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This will help me better define the baseURL and regions I am applying, allowing me to strategically targeting specific services within collections, and abstracting away the context of the services baseURL and which region it is operating in as part of each Postman environment&mdash;applying the following patterns to two of my AWS Postman environments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aws_ec2_baseURL </strong>- Making the baseURL specific to AWS EC2.</li>
<li><strong>aws_ec2_region -</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>Making the region specific to AWS EC2.</li>
<li><strong>aws_s3_baseURL </strong>- Making the baseURL specific to AWS S3.</li>
<li><strong>aws_s3_region -</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>Making the region specific to AWS S3.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I will use this approach within my AWS API reference Postman collections even though I do not have any collisions between services. It allows me to use my AWS reference Postman collections as the seeds for other workflow, capability, and walk through Postman collections without having to rename variables. Which then allows me to mix multiple services within a single collection, while preventing collisions between similar variables that will have different values.</p>
<p class="p1">Moving forward I am going to work to establish some guidance for naming of environments, variables and globals, considering how they&rsquo;ll be applied to requests and folders within collections, as well as across multiple types of collections across different workspaces. I&rsquo;m looking to begin laying the groundwork for how we can better manage the environments we apply manually or in automated ways across our API collections, being more thoughtful and intentional when it comes to how we define the environmental context we are applying&mdash;something that will affect both how APIs are implemented, as well as how secure and scalable our implementations are.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2019/11/17/api-copyright-heading-to-the-supreme-court/">I am gearing up for API copyright heading to the Supreme Court</a></span>, having another look at whether or not the naming and ordering of your API interface is copyrightable, as well as whether or not reimplementation of it can be considered fair use. To help strengthen my arguments that API should not be copyrightable I wanted to work through my thoughts about how APIs are similar to other existing concepts that are not copyrightable. One of the old concepts I had worked through back in May of 2014, and was used by Google as part of their argument, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">was the notion that your API is just a menu for your organizational digital resources</a>--I wanted to take a fresh look at this concept, and add it to the toolbox for when we head to DC.</p>
<p class="p1">The restaurant menu analogy is an important one to help people who really don&rsquo;t understand APIs, as well as those who do understand APIs, but don&rsquo;t understand the wider world of copyright. As I&rsquo;ve said before, the problem here is purely because people can&rsquo;t separate the interface from the backend, from the data, content, and media that flows through them. People simply see the entire things as an API. I want to keep making the argument that your backend code, and the data, content, and media that flows through can be copyrighted and patented&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m arguing that the interface to these valuable resources needs to stay open, in the public domain, and should not be subject to copyright, just like the menu of a restaurant.</p>
<p class="p1">Your application programming interface (API) is not your application, it is the programming interface to your application.<span>&nbsp;</span>Your API is the menu to the digital resources and capabilities you possess within your company, organization, institution, or government agency. APIs are how your digital resources and capabilities are made known, accessed, and baked into your partners technological solutions. You want your APIs to be as open, accessible, intuitive, known, and reusable as they possibly can. Restaurants do not sue other restaurants for having menus, and technology companies shouldn&rsquo;t sue other technology companies for having menus. If you want to get into arguments over the copyrighted and patented code, data, content, or media behind, that is another story, but don&rsquo;t get litigious over the menus.<span>&nbsp;C'mon!</span></p>
<p class="p1">So what if your competitor has messages, products, images, files, and other similar resources on their API menus. AWS has compute and storage, so does Azure and Google. McDonalds doesn&rsquo;t sue Burger King for having burgers and fries on their menu. Why is the naming and ordering of our menu of digital resources some how a creative unique expression, when everybody else has the same creative unique expression? The answer is, they aren&rsquo;t creative unique expressions. They are commonly known ways of defining and serving up digital resources that may seem new and novel one moment, but with just a couple months or years will be commodities that everyone is selling and exchanging across the web. The desire to apply copyright to these fast evolving digital resources is more about being able to lock up and capture value than it ever is about creative expression.</p>
<p class="p1">I recommend we all focus on standardizing how we define the menus for our digital establishments, and invest our energy in having the best quality ingredients and service&mdash;then people will flock to our platforms. If you notice the most successful digital platforms aren&rsquo;t hiding their menus under the counter, they have them displayed prominently on the front of their establishments using standardized API portals. If you still see the API as your secret sauce I hate to say you are woefully behind in this game, and the chances are you don&rsquo;t have what it takes when it comes to procuring the highest quality ingredients and talent for your products and services, and the process you employ to serve your customers are out dated and antiquated are pretty high. Copyrighting the menus to your organizational resources and capabilities is just going to make it so your establishment doesn&rsquo;t stand out as people are walking by, and the word of mouth about what you bring the table will disappear&mdash;handing your competitive edge over to the next generation of businesses who actually doget it.</p>

<p class="p1">I was talking with <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> CEO Chris Taggart (<a href="https://twitter.com/countculture?lang=en">@countculture</a>) while in Washington DC a couple of weeks ago, reminding me of a previous conversation we had about the current state of business registry submission and search for the State of California. He had asked me a couple months ago if I knew anyone working for the State of California on opening up data, or possibly specifically with the business registry&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t. Chris is wanting to talk with anyone in the know about evolving and modernizing the states approach to managing their corporate entity information. Clearly he has a desire to get better access to the data, but as our conversation in DC reminded me, he has some serious concerns about the importance of not just access to corporate data, but being able to keep up to speed what is happening at the business level in not just California, but other states as well.</p>
<p class="p1">There are many ways in which government can&rsquo;t keep up with the pace in the private sector, and corporate filings is definitely one of the more critical areas that is falling behind. Like many areas of government I&rsquo;m guessing this is by design. Not because of some grand government or corporate conspiracy, but just by the the ongoing suffocation of the resources government has to get things done. I&rsquo;m guessing the folks running the State of California business search are doing the best they can with the resources they have. I&rsquo;m guessing that the private sector has no real motivation to lobby and compel the State of California to do any better when it comes to filing, managing, and search for business data. The result is a business registry system that barely meets the needs of everyone involved, and leaving a lot of opportunities on the table when it comes to understanding and responding to change in the way business gets done in the state.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to business registry in the State of California, there are two primary interfaces to get at the information you need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/">Business Search</a></strong>&nbsp;- Free online access to corporate, limited liability company and limited partnership information. Available information includes the complete entity name, entity number, formation, registration or conversion date, status, jurisdiction, entity address, and the name and address of the agent for service of process.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ptsearch.sos.ca.gov/">Publicly Traded Disclosure Search</a></strong>&nbsp;- Free online access to abstracts of reported information for all publicly traded corporations that have filed a Corporate Disclosure Statement with the California Secretary of State.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There is no business registry API for the State of California (that I can find)--I have asked for more information. The search result pages are pretty easy to automate and scrape using scripts, but there are measures placed on the detail pages for business entities to counteract scraping of the valuable data present. It is something that isn&rsquo;t impossible to get around, but clearly efforts have been made to make it more difficult for the public to get at data within the system&mdash;if nothing else just to minimize the server traffic scraping data will introduce. You can find <a href="https://github.com/datadesk/california-business-entities">scraped versions of business registry data for the state of California</a>, and you can find <a href="https://portal.kyckr.com/live-company-data-api-details.aspx">businesses who claim they have it and will sell it to you</a>, but <a href="httsps://data.ca.gov/">there are no APsI or public data sets available as part of the State of California&rsquo;s open data efforts</a>. This leaves a pretty massive gap when it comes to providing access to trusted 3rd parties, researchers, and the general public when it comes to making sense of the business landscape in the State of California.</p>
<p class="p1">To keep up with the pace of business there should be a public API for the State of California business registry. It should employ a simple RESTful design for conducting searches, providing basic request and response access to data. You should be given a healthy number of API requests before you are required to signup and justify your usage for significantly higher access. If you are accessing on a regular basis for commercial usage, you should have to pay to your access, and establish a partnership arrangement. All of this can be managed using existing API management solutions. There should also be web hooks available for receiving pushes when something changes, as well as sustained connections using Server-Sent Events (SSE) or web sockets, allowing for consumers to tune into events as they occur across the platform.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">I have a lot of experience working with federal government agencies on data efforts so I know how tough these projects are to move forward. However, business registries for all states is one area that we need to find the will to invest in, and work to develop public / private partnerships to tackle. There is so much opportunity for the State of California to better understand business within their state, and identify missed revenue opportunities that exist. Opening up the data for commercial access would generate new revenues, and having easy, self-service access for reseachers and journalists would add to the brain power available to the state when it comes to making sense of what is going on. I wanted to just write an initial post to get my thoughts out there and see if I know anyone who is working in the State of California&mdash;if you are drop me a line, I&rsquo;d love to brainstorm on the possibilities. I want to also start poking around a little more, playing with the available business search tools, mapping out the underlying schema, and maybe scraping some more data to see if I can use in some sort of proof of concept to demonstrate some of my ideas around moving forward the conversation around the State of California business registry, and see what fires I can light when it comes to cooking something up.</p>

<p class="p1">One of the things I have been thoroughly enjoying as part of my work with Postman is the many different ways in which Postman collections are being work. If you&rsquo;ve followed my blog over the years you know I&rsquo;ve been a big supporter of OpenAPI&mdash;it has changed how we communicate about our APIs. Until I began working with Postman I viewed Postman collections as just another API definition like OpenAPI, where you can define the surface area of your APIs. My perspective began changing once I learned about Postman environments, but my world has been completely shifted once I began learning the different ways in which Postman customers are putting collections to work as part of their API operations.</p>
<p class="p1">Reference Postman collections is the most common approach you will find in the wild, outlining all of the API paths that exist for an API, but over the last couple months I&rsquo;ve seen entirely new types of collections emerge, including workflow, capability, maintenance, governance, and now walkthrough Postman collections.<a href="https://twitter.com/ShipEngineAPI/status/1197656248121987072"> I saw ShipEngine tweeting out about giving a live demo of their &ldquo;fancy new @getpostman docs&rdquo; tonight at the #AustinAPI meetup</a>, and after landing on <a href="https://www.shipengine.com/docs/postman/">the ShipEngine documentation home page</a> I found two types of Postman collections, with supporting documentation. Providing two distinct ways of communicating around the ShipEngine APIs, helping provide one set for on-boarding new users, and another for making sure every API path is documented and accessible.</p>
<p class="p1">First they provide <strong><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/305204/SW7XbA6V?version=latest">ShipEngine Walkthrough</a></strong>, which provides collection is a guided tour through ShipEngine's most popular features, reducing the overhead for any developer looking to quickly understand what the ShipEngine API provides&mdash;highlight the following capabilities.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/walkthrough_screenshot_4_zoom.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Create and download shipping labels</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Calculate shipping costs for any package</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Compare rates across UPS, FedEx, USPS and other carriers</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Track packages in real-time or on-demand</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Parse and validate mailing addresses for any country on Earth!</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Then ShipEngine provide with <strong><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/305204/SW7W5V6o?version=latest">ShipEngine Reference</a></strong>, which is a collection that contains sample requests for every ShipEngine API endpoint, providing a complete set of documentation for developers to put to work. Ensuring that if you want to dive into all the nitty gritty detail of the ShipEngine API and what it can do&mdash;you have what you need.</p>
<p class="p1">I really like this approach to API documentation. Especially for powerful APIs that have a lot of different API paths available. It makes learning about any API much easier, providing the most common resources developers are looking for, and keeping everything else just one click away. It really shows the versatility of Postman collections over OpenAPI, and pushes back on older notions that you just have one set of API documentation for all of your APIs. In this new Postman collection driven world you can develop many different versions of your API documentation designed for different audiences&mdash;helping reduce the cognitive load for your most common use cases.</p>
<p class="p1">I am working hard to learn about, and document the different ways in which Postman customers are using collections to communicate about what is possible with their APIs. It is this type of innovation with API definitions that really gets me excited. It moves us beyond the boring technical details of APIs and pushes us to communicate in new ways about what is possible. Moving the API conversation closer to real world business scenarios and use cases, making it easier to tell stories about what is happening. Making all of this API storytelling much more fun, and easier to craft stories that reach beyond technical circles, driving more meaningful traffic to my blog, and the Postman API universe.</p>

<p class="p1">API storytelling is the number tool in my toolbox, and this should be the same for API providers and service providers. I know that many folks, especially the more technical folks snicker every time I write about storytelling being so important, but this is just because of a lack of awareness regarding all the influence that stories have on our personal and professional lives. One hallmark of successful API operations is always a healthy dose of storytelling via blogs, social media, GitHub and the mainstream press. One example of this out in the wild is out of Capital One, who have embraced being very transparent in how they do APIs, both internally and externally, being very active when it comes to telling stories about what they are up to, and encouraging their employees do the same.</p>
<p class="p1">Being this vocal as a large enterprise organization isn&rsquo;t easy, especially one that operates within such a highly regulated industry. As with any enterprise organization Capital One is still very reserved in many ways, and has its official communication channels and overall narrative. With that said, they have a slightly more amplified voice out of technical groups, and they give more agency to its employees, as well as outside voices like me. I&rsquo;ve never had to sign an NDA as part of regular engagements with their API teams, leaving it up to me to be sensible in what I filter and what I do not. I wouldn&rsquo;t say that Capital One is wildly open with their storytelling like startups I&rsquo;ve worked with, but they are just one or two notches more open than many other enterprise organizations I work with, especially when it comes to the banking industry&mdash;I&rsquo;d say Capital One is the most visible bank in the United States when it comes to API, and related infrastructure storytelling.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/video-a-conversation-with-api-evangelist-kin-lane-311726984c8f">After doing my video series with Capital One about two years ago</a> I had people from competing banks reach out asking me if they could bring me to to discuss API strategy within their organizations. The conversations never saw the light of day because of challenges faced with getting legal approval to continue conversations and to share anything publicly. Capital One&rsquo;s competitors pay attention, and Capital One&rsquo;s customers and future customers are paying attention too&mdash;the stories being told matter, and play an important role in laying the foundation for how people view Capital One as a potential technology leader. This is an image you can&rsquo;t just issue a press release and set into motion, it is something you can only do with a sustained amount of storytelling and clear demonstration of technology leadership through open source tooling, artifacts, and tangible examples of the company &ldquo;getting it&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">You can see examples of the real world business impact of this kind of storytelling in the decision of Walmart to choose Capital One as their credit card provider, where in Doctor of Credit that <em>&ldquo;It was&nbsp;<span class="s1">down to Capital One</span>&nbsp;and Synchrony in the running, and ultimately Walmart chose Capital One with an eye toward a&nbsp;more tech-forward partner with broader banking capabilities and a digital future&rdquo;</em>, and in the Wall Street Journal, <em>"One thing working in Capital One&rsquo;s favor, according to people familiar with the negotiations, was Walmart&rsquo;s desire to move upmarket and further into digital payments and e-commerce. Facing intense competition from&nbsp;<span class="s1">Amazon.com</span>&nbsp;Inc., Walmart has been investing in self-checkout and mobile payments, pushing customers toward its own digital wallet, Walmart Pay".&nbsp;</em>Obviously Walmart had been tuned into the stories circling around what Capital One was up to, seeing them as more forward thinking, a foundation that has been laid over the last five years of active API storytelling come out of DevCentral and other groups.</p>
<p class="p1">Many companies I work with stress over every word, and every press release that goes out th door. Instilling fear amongst their teams when it comes to blogging, tweeting, and working out in the open on GitHub. Most see any public API effort simply as being about direct revenue from these very technical programs, missing the bigger storytelling opportunity that comes with operating APIs out in the open. Most do not understand their GitHub usage as being about evangelism, storytelling, and networking. Most companies don&rsquo;t realize how their cautious nature feeds into how they are seen by competition and potential customers or partners as not being progressive, innovative, and behind the times. Most of the teams I work with self-censor, and operate on the safe side when it comes to storytelling, publishing projects on GitHub, and amplifying the voices of anyone within the API community&mdash;something that is defined by the internal company culture established by leadership. Forcing me to anonymize most of the people and companies I include in my storytelling, even if they are compelling and relevant stories, as there is no getting thumbs up from official channels.</p>
<p class="p1">You hear me profile, rank, and showcase APIs on a regular basis. It is easy to think this is all just about APIs, when in reality it is a commentary on overall company culture. I&rsquo;m not saying companies who have successful API programs are all amazing hotbeds of innovation, making them the perfect places to work. I&rsquo;m just saying when it comes to moving these very large ships forward, keeping things evolving, and attracting the customers that matter, your APIs, and the storytelling around your API program will set the overall tone. And if done well, this tone will transcend the community of any single API, and the technology community in general, and beginning to define how a company is perceived in mainstream circles, and by &ldquo;the market&rdquo; in general. In short, your API storytelling matters. Not any single blog post, Tweet, or GitHub repository, but the sustained nature, honesty, and substance of your API storytelling which has the potential to become viral and more organic word of mouth&mdash;which is more powerful than any traditional marketing you can buy in today&rsquo;s API economy.</p>

title: 'Company Specific API Workspaces'
image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_api_collection_workspace_api_evangelist.png
---
<p class="p1">I have many different workspaces defined within my Postman team account. I&rsquo;m organizing a couple thousands APIs into different topical categories that help articulate the value they deliver. Once I&rsquo;ve sufficiently profiled a company and their APIs, producing a reference Postman collection, I&rsquo;ll share to, or create a workspace for each tag I have applied to each API as part of my profiling process. Depending on the company, I am looking to establish a complete (as possible) Postman reference collection, as well as some more specialized capability, workflow, and other relevant collects that are derived from, and compliment the reference APIs present, but go further towards accomplishing specific business objects with each API path available.</p>
<p class="p1">I am currently profiling <a href="https://docs.api.postman.com/?version=latest#99810ef3-3cc0-a6cc-06f5-d8e2ae9d84e4">the Postman API</a>, while also defining the capabilities present within the API that I depend on to conduct API Evangelist business. I have already added the Postman API to several other workspaces including design, mocking, documentation, testing, and client, but now I&rsquo;m going to create a company specific workspace for managing my API collections for Postman. My master copy of the Postman collection which I&rsquo;ve downloaded from the Postman API Network will act as the master API collection for Postman, and I will share the collection out to any relevant workspace, but I will also be creating some more specific workflow and capability collections that reflect how I use the Postman API to run API Evangelist.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_api_collection_workspace_api_evangelist.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">I&rsquo;m not sure this approach will scale, but I&rsquo;m purposely looking to push the number of collections and workspaces I&rsquo;m managing using Postman to see where the friction is. I&rsquo;m using the Postman API to help me organize and audit how I&rsquo;m managing APIs at scale, so I I can adapt and pivot based upon how I&rsquo;m breaking things up. If I had to manage everything through the Postman interface it would take me days to get things reorganized each time I change my strategy, but since I have the API I am confident that I can rapidly make changes at scale. The process should really harden the way I view collections, workspaces, and environments at scale, helping realize the pros and cons of different ways of organizing thousands of APIs, and derivative collections.</p>
<p class="p1">Next, I will consider how I want to sync my API workspaces to GitHub. I want to maintain a mirror image of each API workspace on GitHub. I&rsquo;m just not sure exactly the format, and how I will automate at scale. For now, I will just look to publish a copy of any collection within a workspace to the corresponding company GitHub repository with the API Evangelist organization. Then I will look at how I will keep it in sync with the OpenAPIs I also want to publish, as well as the overall APIs.json for the wider operations around each API. Seamlessly integrating Postman into my overall API discovery process, while using Postman as the ultimate truth for what is possible with each API, because it is where I&rdquo;m actually sending requests and saving request and response examples, which ultimately certify that an API is real or not in my world.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/azure_sdk_governance.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">Most companies I encounter who are doing <a href="http://governance.apievangelist.com/">API governance</a> are purely focused on API design, with a handful also thinking more deeply about documentation, testing, monitoring, and other stops along the API life cycle. API governance done well involves every stop, but since most organizations are only just getting started investing in API governance, the area of API design is a sensible place to start. Defining how APIs should be designed, helping introduce consistency in how APIs are developed, reducing friction for consumers when it comes to integrating them into applications. Anytime I come across examples of API governance in the wild I try to showcase it here on the blog, and for this story I wanted to shine a light on how <a href="https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/index.html">the Microsoft Azure team provides guidelines for how SDKs should be developed and delivered</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Azure provides the following scaffolding when it comes to their guidelines, answering many of the questions teams will have when it comes to crafting consistent SDKs for APIs across any product or group:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong> - Providing general information regarding what the SDK guidelines are for, and references the need to work with the Azure Developer Experience Architecture Board to define the right experience.</li>
<li><strong>Terminology</strong> - Offering a glossary of the most common terms and phrases that are in use that might not be readily known by stakeholders, providing easy to find definitions for words that will be used across guidelines</li>
<li><strong>API Design</strong> -<span>&nbsp; </span>Articulating how the API surface each client library must have the most thought as it is the primary interaction that the consumer has with each service, defining the overall developer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong> - Guidance for to actually begin implementing your SDKs once you have thoughtfully define the surface area of the API for the SDK, beginning to actually craft the intended language library SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Providing details of what is required when it comes to delivering documentation to support all language client libraries, and that it includes a standard approach to delivering a README for the SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Core</strong> - Defining the core set of libraries available that are used across all other client libraries providing shared libraries for common elements like HTTP, configuration, credentials, and other shared needs.</li>
<li><strong>Languages</strong>&nbsp;- Azure SDK guidelines dictates that the following languages to be be implemented: Android, C, C#, Go, Java, Python, and Typescript. Providing a base of languages that are expected for all SDK implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This outline provides a nice list of governance considerations when it comes to the primary areas of SDK development, providing the first draft of API SDK governance I&rsquo;ve ever come across. Shining a light on the biggest areas of concern for Microsoft when it comes to delivering SDKs across the company at scale, and providing an open blueprint that other companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies can consider as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/azure_sdk_governance_open_source_policies.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">In addition to guidelines for some of the most common concerns, Azure sets forth actual policies that govern how SDKs are developed, delivered, and supported, giving the guidelines some actual governance teeth when it comes to what is expected. Providing policies in the following areas across ALL SDK being delivered for internal and external usage.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Guideline Adoption</strong> - Setting expectations when it comes to the adoption of the SDK guidelines.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Open Source </strong>- Requiring that all SDKS be open sourced and managed via GitHub.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Repository Structure</strong> - Defining how GitHub repositories should be setup and operated.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Repository Branching</strong> - Outlining how the branching of SDK repositories will happen.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Review Process</strong> - Discussing the process involved with first time and ongoing reviews of SDKs. <span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Releases</strong> - Governance for how SDKs are released in sync with the underlying API.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These policies provide an additional blueprint for other API providers to consider when it comes to reaching this level of API governance maturity, and working to standardize how API SDKs are delivered. The Azure SDK Guidelines provide one last area of guidance, providing a structured way to approach SDK namespaces, keeping the way in which each SDK, and the underlying resources and actions are defined. Keeping things much more coherent and organized as the number of SDKs grows, helping making libraries easy to search through and consumers are able to find what they need.</p>
<p class="p1">As I said, this is the first example of SDK governance I have come across in the wild. It is a positive sign when it comes to the overall API governance conversation. It shows the maturity of API governance at Microsoft who I worked with a couple years back to develop an API design governance guide for usage across teams, and now the SDK guidance shows they are working to govern other stops along the API life cycle. I&rsquo;ll add it to my growing evidence of how API governance is being conducted across the enterprise. Adding to my API governance reference materials for helping companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies better govern the APIs they are defining, designing, delivering, and supporting as part of their regular operations.</p>

<p class="p1">As part of my work as the Chief Evangelist for Postman I find myself regularly talking to other devrel, advocates, and evangelists who are looking for ideas on how to expand their evangelism toolbox, and be more successful in their work. As part of these conversation I wanted to work my way through my own toolbox to see what is still relevant, and share the tools and tricks I have with other evangelists I am talking with, and hopefully also learn about a few new ones myself, as I engage with different API personalities from across the space.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Much of what I do as the API Evangelist is very formulaic and repetitive. While there is a creative storytelling element as part of these, really the more tangible, repeatable and quantifiable elements of what I do are pretty known, and do not represent any sort of secret sauce or special ability--here are the building blocks of API evangelism you will find in my toolbox.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Blog Posts </strong>- Publishing a single blog post on a specific topic, process, or idea I think the community will find valuable.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Social Media Post -</strong> Publishing single Tweet, LinkedIn, Facebook, or other post to a social network for my profile(s).</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Questions / Answers </strong>- Publishing questions or answers to online properties, helping seed, drive, and amplify conversations.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Emails </strong>- Craft a newsletter, broadcast, and personalized email involving a specific concept, narrative, or other relevant item.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Meetup Talk </strong>- A 10 to 30 minute talk to a targeted audience of less than 100 people in a Meetup environment.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Conference Talk </strong>- A 15 to 60 minute talk to a larger audience of 50 to 500 people in physical conference setting.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Webinar Talk </strong>- A 15 to 60 minute talk on a specific subject to an online audience via web conferencing platform.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Images</strong> - Creating an image that represents a specific concept for use across my evangelism activity on and offline.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Video</strong> - Producing a video of a talk, or other format for publishing online and sharing with a wide or specific audience.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Audio</strong> - Producing an audio recording of a talk, or other format for publishing online and sharing with a wide or specific audience.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Slideshow</strong> - Producing a slideshow for a talk, or other format for publishing online and sharing with a wide or specific audience.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Tutorial</strong> - A simple walkthrough of a specific concept, helping on-boarding business or technical consumers about topic.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>White Paper </strong>- An opinionated narrative about a specific topic, usually 1500 to 10,000 words, published as a PDF or HTML paper.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Guide</strong> - A guide to a specific relevant topic, usually 1500 to 10,000 words, and published as a PDF or HTML paper.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Repository</strong> - A Git-driven repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket which becomes a vehicle to reach a specific audience.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Proof of Concept</strong> - Building a quick proof of concept to help illustrate a specific concept or process, mocking what is expected.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Prototype</strong> - Providing a more functional prototype of a specific concept of process, going further to demonstrate a specific idea.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Artifact</strong> - Crafting a machine readable artifact using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or a Postman collection to help drive the conversation.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Collection</strong> - Building a more sophisticated Postman collection that walks through many different stops in a larger workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are the common building blocks of my API evangelism toolbox. These are the formulaic and repetitive things I craft for sharing via a mix of on and offline channels. This represents my output, and the vehicles I use to reach my audience. None of this is my secret sauce, or unique advice to other evangelists. It is my toolbox of the most common tools I use each day. Where the magic really begins is when it comes to the stories I tell using these building blocks across many different channels. This is where my knowledge, experience, personality, and creativity comes into play, helping me define, evolve, and deliver relevant and (hopefully) compelling narratives that speak to my intended audience, and is suitable for the channels I am using.</p>
<p class="p1">My storytelling will employ any combination of these building blocks to get my intended point across. These are the quantifiable and tangible elements of what I do, and hopefully other evangelists, advocates, ambassadors, and champions would use. As part of these shared evangelist conversations I&rsquo;m participating in I will be crafting other stories about what&rsquo;s next. Talking more about how I find, seed, develop, polish, share, and evolve stories as part of my work. So far, I don&rsquo;t think there is much new and novel here, but when it comes to how I continue putting these building blocks to work after over nine years of sustained evangelism, I feel I definitely bring my own unique approach to technical storytelling, evangelism, and software engineering.</p>

<p class="p2">As I was refreshing my understanding of what copyright is and isn&rsquo;t I was working my way through <a href="http://Copyright.gov"><span class="s1">Copyright.gov</span></a>, and found this snippet about the copyrightability of forms&mdash;which I think applies pretty nicely to what APIs accomplish in a digital way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><em>Blank forms typically contain empty fields or lined spaces as well as words or short phrases that identify the content that should be recorded in each field or space. Blank forms that are designed for recording information and do not themselves convey information are uncopyrightable. Similarly, the ideas or principles behind a blank form, the systems or methods implemented by a form, or the form&rsquo;s functional layout are not protected by copyright.&nbsp;</em></p>
<br />
<p class="p1"><em>A blank form may incorporate Works Not Protected by Copyright 4 images or text that is sufficiently creative to be protected by copyright. For example, bank checks may be registered if they contain pictorial decoration that is sufficiently creative. Contracts, insurance policies, and other documents with &ldquo;fill-in&rdquo; spaces may also be registered if there is sufficient literary authorship that is not standard or functional.&nbsp;</em></p>
<br />
<p class="p1"><em>In all cases, the registration covers only the original textual or pictorial expression that the author contributed to the work, but does not cover the blank form or other uncopyrightable elements that the form may contain. Examples of blank forms include &bull; Time cards &bull; Graph paper &bull; Account books &bull; Diaries &bull; Bank checks &bull; Scorecards &bull; Address books &bull; Report forms &bull; Order forms &bull; Date books and schedulers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">APIs are forms &mdash; often times literally. Whether a language, framework, or web API, each API is a blank form waiting to be submitted. It contains one or more fields or parameters that can be submitted or retrieved. Like forms, APIs may contain copyrightable content or algorithms, but the interface themselves are just a title applied to give the API context, and a set of words organized in a certain order to solicit a specific response. Like a physical form, APIs can represent many types of resources, depending on how you organize the fields and parameters, providing a pretty versatile and flexible way to communicate online.</p>
<p class="p1">The challenge here for most business and technical folks is separating the API from the backend code, and the content, media, and algorithms flowing through the API pipes. Your API is nothing more than just a menu, form, and recipe for making digital resources available via the web. While they may feel like you&rsquo;ve created something unique, special, and are a form of expression&mdash;they aren&rsquo;t. We can&rsquo;t let the creative bar be so low. We also can&rsquo;t attach copyright friction to the interfaces that are desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications will use to provide access to our valuable resources, which may or may not include copyrightable, patentable, and trademarked elements.</p>

<p class="p1">I have been working to migrate all the different API driven JavaScript solutions I have developed over the years and run on GitHub using Jekyll to operate self-contained Postman collections. <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/visualizer/">Now that Postman has a JavasScript visitations layer, I can make calls to APIs, parse the response, and generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript visualizations</a>. Allowing me to begin organizing all my API-driven visualization tools as simple, sharable, and executable Postman collections.</p>
<p class="p1">I had developed a way to visualize the API lifecycle a while back using <a href="http://kalyani.com/2010/10/subway-map-visualization-jquery-plugin/">the Subway Map Visualization jQuery Plugin, by Nik Kalyani</a>. It provides a pretty slick way of drawing lines, establishing stations, connectors, and other icon Subway map visualizations. I have been running this on Github using Jekyll, but wanted to make it something that I could keep portable and machine readable so that anyone else could run in locally or on the web.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/35240/SW7XbVW4?version=latest"><img style="width: 100%;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_visualizer_subway_map.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I haven't hooked the visualization up to any specific APIs yet. I&rsquo;m going to make it run from my API lifecycle training, allowing users to visualize and then explore the stops along the API life cycle they want. Then I want to see what I can do to hook it up to AWS, Google, and Azure for helping visualize API infrastructure, allowing me to map out different APIs, and organize them into lines based upon OpenAPI tags or Postman collection folders.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://explore.postman.com/templates/4422">The Subway Map visualization Postman collection is published as a template in the Postman network</a>, and I have <a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/35240/SW7XbVW4?version=latest">published supporting documentation</a>&nbsp;from <a href="https://www.postman.com/collections/926778ece9009912872b">the collection</a>. Once I have updated it to work with any particular API I will publish a separate template, keeping this one as my base, but then evolving it to meet different API life cycle and infrastructure needs, helping create a Subway map for navigating the complex API landscapes we are building.</p>

title: 'Organizing EC2 API Actions As A Postman Collection'
image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_aws_ec2_documentation.png
---
<p class="p1">I&rsquo;m crafting Postman collections in support of the upcoming re:Invent conference in Vegas in December. One of the first collections I crafted was for Amazon EC2, allowing anyone put the Postman collection to work managing their AWS EC2 infrastructure. At first glance of the 359 actions available via the AWS EC2 API documentation page, I was overwhelmed. I definitely needed a way to tame the AWS EC2 API, making it more accessible and usable by a human&mdash;while APIs are meant for system to system integration, and delivering desktop, web, mobile, and device applications, it still has to be implemented by a human.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">When crafting the AWS EC2 Postman collection I wanted to take some time to better organize the wealth of actions you can take, making them more accessible via a single Postman collection, organized by resource.<a href="https://www.postman.com/collections/e6e8465143cba95cf28b"> You can access the collection here</a>, and the Postman generated API documentation for the AWS EC2 API by clicking on the image below.</p>
<p><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/35240/SW7XZpAm?version=latest"><img src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_aws_ec2_documentation.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The Postman collection helps organize the 350+ actions into folders by resource&mdash;making them a little easier on the eyes, and to navigate, while also making every AWS EC2 action immediately executable once you publish your keys and secrets to the Postman environment that accompanies the collection. By organizing all of the individual resources into more coherent groups, it increases the chance that the resource you need will be found, and put too use.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111519zr_8n59.pdf">I received an email this last Friday that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on the freedom to reimplement APIs</a>, as well as reconsider the copyrightability of APIs, and whether their reimplementation constitutes fair use. I&rsquo;ve been a signer on two briefs as well as supporter of the case since 2012, and to help fire up my imagination and storytelling around why APIs should NOT be copyrightable, I wanted to revisit some of my storytelling over the years, and brainstorm some possible new arguments that might help in this latest wave of litigation.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p1">Each time I pick up this torch I have to re-educate myself exactly what copyright is and isn&rsquo;t, and build upon all my former learnings helping pour the latest batch of concrete that acts as the foundation for my belief system around API copyright, patents, trademark, and licensing. For this round, let&rsquo;s once again revisit the basics, what is copyright?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><em>Copyright is the exclusive right given to the creator of a creative work to reproduce the work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Some jurisdictions require "fixing" copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders. These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution.</em></p>
<p class="p2"><em>Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered "territorial rights". This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works "cross" national borders or national rights are inconsistent.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Next, let&rsquo;s look at some things that are copyrightable to help us remember how copyright can be a force for good when it comes to protecting the rights of artists and creators, but also rekindle some understanding of how it can also be abused.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Literature</strong> - Written works, especially those considered of superior or lasting artistic merit.</li>
<li><strong>Music</strong> - Wocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.</li>
<li><strong>Choreography</strong> - The sequence of steps and movements in dance or figure skating, especially in a ballet or other staged dance.</li>
<li><strong>Pictures</strong> - A painting, drawing, photograph, or portrait.</li>
<li><strong>Movies</strong> - A story or event recorded by a camera as a set of moving images and shown in a theater or on television; a motion picture.</li>
<li><strong>Audio</strong> - Sound, especially when recorded, transmitted, or reproduced.</li>
<li><strong>Software</strong> - The programs and other operating information used by a computer.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture</strong> - The complex or carefully designed structure of something.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Now, let&rsquo;s look at some of the things that are not copyrightable to help us remember how copyright cannot be applied, and how there are many things that just exist in the public commons for everyone to use, and should not be locked up and owned.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Titles</strong> - The name of a book, composition, or other artistic work.</li>
<li><strong>Phrases</strong> - A small group of words standing together as a conceptual unit, typically forming a component of a clause.</li>
<li><strong>Slogans</strong> - A short and striking or memorable phrase used in advertising.</li>
<li><strong>Symbols</strong> - A mark or character used as a conventional representation of an object, function, or process, e.g. the letter or letters standing for a chemical element or a character in musical notation.</li>
<li><strong>Logos</strong> - A symbol or other design adopted by an organization to identify its products, uniform, vehicles, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Ideas</strong> - A thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action.</li>
<li><strong>Procedures</strong> - An established or official way of doing something.</li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong> - A particular form of procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one.</li>
<li><strong>Systems</strong> - A set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network</li>
<li><strong>Processes</strong> - A series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end.</li>
<li><strong>Concepts</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>- An abstract idea; a general notion.</li>
<li><strong>Principles</strong> - A fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>Discoveries</strong> - The action or process of discovering or being discovered.</li>
<li><strong>Recipes</strong> - A set of instructions for preparing a particular dish, including a list of the ingredients required.</li>
<li><strong>Directories</strong> - A book listing individuals or organizations alphabetically or thematically with details such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - An identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet</li>
<li><strong>Fashion</strong> - A popular trend, especially in styles of dress and ornament or manners of behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Facts</strong> - A thing that is known or proved to be true.</li>
<li><strong>Forms</strong> - A printed (or digital) document with blank spaces for information to be inserted.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">One other thing to remember with copyright is that something has to be fixed, realized, implemented, and tangible to be copyrighted. You can't just copyright the idea of your API. However, according to the current state of litigation when it comes to Oracle vs. Google, the naming and order of your API is copyrightable, and even more scarier that fair use may not even apply in this world Oracle is despreately trying to define for all of us.</p>
<p class="p2">Ok, let&rsquo;s look at some of the core arguments I&rsquo;ve made in the past that have helped define this conversation for me. Helping me understand what copyright looks like, or doesn&rsquo;t look like in a digital API-driven world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - The cloud as a concept would not have existed if Amazon had asserted copyright over the storage, compute, and other architectural components they were releasing as APIs. Competing services and tooling vendors were free to emulate AWS in their operations, streamline integration and encouraging interoperability at a time that cloud was defining itself.</li>
<li><strong>Competition</strong> - I use the Pinboard social bookamrking API as a solid example of why API copyright matters, because Pinboard expressly copied the entire delicious bookarking API, which allowed Pinboard customers and application developers to seamlessly switch with each round of acquisitions of the formerly popular platform that send into motion much of the social elements of the web we now take for granted.</li>
<li><strong>Menu</strong> - APIs are just a menu to the digital resources your technology restaurant is serving up. Making it clear that the value of your organizations does not lie in the naming and ordering of how your customers, or competitions customers purchase products and services, but it is about the quality of your ingredients and the service you offer&mdash;essentially, you don&rsquo;t hide your menus behind the counter, and you don&rsquo;t sue your competition because they have burgers on their menu too.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I&rsquo;d say that these were three core arguments I&rsquo;ve made so far. I&rsquo;ve made some other weaker ones, but after revisiting I think this represents the cream on the top of what I&rsquo;ve been arguing. Going into 2020 I&rsquo;d like help craft some new arguments, rooting in what we are know about copyright law and real world, but work harder to apply it to this very abstract world we find ouirselves living in--which is being defined by APIs.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directories</strong> - APIs are just a directory of your organizational digital capabilities and often times Human Resources. Saying that business directories and phone books in the digital age are copyrightable just does not make pass muster.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Forms</strong> - Most APIs are literally just digital forms. Providing you with a set of key / value pairs that you submit as part of the path, parameters, headers, and body of each API request, digitally filling out forms and submitting them too platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - Much of my thinking is very web API centric, where Oracle v Google is a language API, but I feel pretty strongly that web APIs matter to this discussion, and the notion that part of the API is just addressing for the web is important.</li>
<li><strong>Recipes</strong> - All of our APIs are just recipes for cooking up some digital dish. Unless you have some amazing narrative around your API telling how your grandma used to cook up API dishes during the war in rural Appalachia, then I&rsquo;m guessing it isn&rsquo;t copyrightable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I think that gives us four new ways to look at why APIs are not copyrightable. They are directories, forms, and recipes that operate in the online domain. However, to push my storytelling around APIs I wanted to lookout it from the other side. How do APIs size up against existing notions about what can be copyrighted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Literature</strong> - I could probably craft a pretty interested Postman collection for an API, or series of APIs that dovetails pretty nicely with a creative and original narrative, providing some pretty interactive experience, but 99% of APIs are NOT this.</li>
<li><strong>Music</strong> - There are plenty of music APIs, but an API is not on the same level as music when it comes to inspiration, creativity, and expression--sorry.</li>
<li><strong>Choreography</strong> - Ok, again I could see some pretty creative and expressive choreographies and orchestrations be crated using one or many APIs that might rise to the occasion, but naming your API tooling &ldquo;choreography&rdquo; or &ldquo;orchestration&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t make them so.</li>
<li><strong>Pictures</strong> - I don&rsquo;t have many API pictures in my portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Movies</strong> - I don&rsquo;t have many API movies in my catalog.</li>
<li><strong>Audio</strong> - I don&rsquo;t think any APIs have been recorded in the wild.</li>
<li><strong>Software</strong> - Ok, APIs are software right. NO. We are talking about the copyrighting of the &ldquo;interface&rdquo;, not your software. Your API is not the code behind, it is the portion you are asking everyone to put into their system.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture</strong> - Similar to software, the interface for your architecture is not the entirety of your architecture. Also, I believe this is purely a more tangible form of architecture, not the many ways in which us in the tech space have co-opted terms for our use.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The key thing to remember when it comes to API copyright is that this is about creativity and expression. I know that most technical folks within startups and the enterprise feel like their APIs are creative, original, and a form of expression, but sadly they are largely not. This is more about our lack of exposure to the humanities, than it is about beliefs in intellectual property. I&rsquo;m pretty confident that I could craft an API that was creative and interesting enough, that was wrapped in an original narrative, and presented in such a way that it MIGHT warrant having copyright applied&mdash;if that was your thing. <a href="http://twitter-field-guide.apievangelist.com/">I could see if Twitter&rsquo;s API design creatively mapped to their earlier field guide style API documentation</a>, that it may begin to approach creative and expressive territory. But, the interfaces we are defining, designing, delivering, and supporting for use across desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications are not creative expressions. Sorry, they aren't. That is too low of a bar, we can do better.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/supreme-court-judgement.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Reductive Qualities of API Transactions<br /></strong>APIs are all about reducing something to a transaction, a search of a directory, retrieving of an a one or more ingredients within a recipe, or simple posting of a digital form. APIs are formulaic and work with words, data, and facts to provide access to digital resources using common standards and protocols. We rarely &ldquo;create&rdquo; APIs out of our imaginations, we assemble or generate them from known constructs&mdash;our IDE, OpenAPI definitions, HTTP, and other protocols, services, and tooling define what and how we can assemble. Crafting of your API path or operation name is no more copyrightable that the domain that precedes it when implementing as a web API&mdash;it is just another dimension of the public domain name system (DNS) you are employing to make the directory of your digital resources more accessible. The variables, parameters, and keys that you employ as part of your API design are just the existing building blocks of your directories, forms, and digital recipes--they aren&rsquo;t poetry.</p>
<p class="p1">I am not saying that APIs can&rsquo;t take a lead role in defining a copyrighted piece of work, patent filing, or trademark. I am saying that the API isn&rsquo;t the intellectual property you should be holding back. It is the menu, form, directory, and recipe for the thing you are holding back as part of your intellectual property&mdash;if that is your jam. The problem is that most business people, and most technical stakeholders do not see the separation between backend data, content, media, and algorithms, and the interface you provide for accessing them. Apply the proper licensing to your data, content, media, and algorithms, and even the code and infrastructure delivery mechanisms behind, but don&rsquo;t introduce additional transactional friction at the interface layer. Don&rsquo;t make your consumers ask for a license to see and use your menu, recipe, directory, or forms involved with obtaining access to your products and services.</p>
<p class="p1">In the end, I see this as a shortcoming of business and technology people to be able to separate the front-end from the backend of the digital services we provide, as well as what is being delivered via these pipes. Sadly, it is also a shortcoming of technical folks like myself who feel that their work is more creative than it really is, allowing the companies we work for to exploit of our lack of exposure to the humanities. Finally, believing in API copyright is just part of the continued advance of intellectual property laws dictated by large corporations hoping expand the reach of their portfolios, claiming that something is creative purely so that value and scarcity can be applied to it, actively reducing meaningful forms of creativity, expression, and art down to a transaction so that they too can be co-opted and added to the corporate intellectual property portfolio&mdash;which has nothing to do with protecting the rights of creators and artists.</p>

<p class="p1">I was teaching a class to business users yesterday and they were very curious about being able to play with some of the public APIs that exist, but for me, once again I found myself struggling with how to help them get over the hurdle of signing up for an API and getting the key or token you need to begin making your first call to an API. Even with having some ready to go Postman Collections that help introduce business users to some very well known APIs like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, I still can&rsquo;t on-board them without pushing them to setup a developer account, create a new application, and obtain a set of keys or tokens. Something that is a regular hurdle for developers to jump over, and one that will keep most &ldquo;normals&rdquo; out of the conversation.</p>
<p class="p1">This bothers me. After over a decade of evangelizing the streamlining of API on-boarding processes, and listening to API management and other API service providers profess how they&rsquo;ll reduce friction when it comes to putting APIs to work&mdash;clearly nothing has changed. Few APIs are truly open, meaning you don&rsquo;t need any API keys or tokens to access, and the rest of the APIs use a mix of different authentication strategies to secure their APIs&mdash;introducing friction for developers and non-developers. This isn&rsquo;t just a problem for non-developers, it is also a problem for developers, making it pretty challenging to go from learning about a new API to actually making a call to that API. Even with my experience, I find it very difficult to on-board with most APIs&mdash;this is a problem.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to putting APIs to work, there are a handful of common areas where friction exist, making it difficult and in many cases impossible to actually make an API call, even once they gone through the hard work of finding an API and learning about what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sign-Up</strong> - Finding where you can signup for an API, and then going through a process of signing up can introduce a lot of friction for any user. There are many issues at play here, ranging from the amount of information required, needing approval, or just having complex multi-step processes to signup for an API account&mdash;pushing most users to just walk away from on-boarding.</li>
<li><strong>Account</strong> - Adding to the sign-up friction many API platforms have a separation in platform accounts that can cause confusion. Twitter is a good example of this. There used to be ore parity between your Twitter amount and your Twitter developer account, but these seem to be separating, and most users do not realize there is a separate account area to manage your API access.</li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong> - Next, for the APIs that require API keys for general access to an API, the process isn&rsquo;t always clear where you obtain those keys even after signing up for an account. Some of this has been standardized by API management providers, but it can take me anywhere from seconds to days to figure out where the API keys are for the APIs I am on-boarding with making it a real challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Many platforms require you to setup an application and explain what you are going to do before you can obtain keys or tokens. When OAuth is involved an added dimension is introduced, making a process that is too challenging for most developers and impossible for non-developers. Where other platforms like GitHub allow you to add a simple app token for each user account, bypassing the entire process for personal use.</li>
<li><strong>Key or Token Placement </strong>- Even once you have signed up for an account, added an application, and obtained your key or token, where you put these tokens will vary from platform to platform. Do you put them in a query parameter or a header? Is it custom header or standard header? ?What is different between secret, keys, or tokens? There are many questions to be answered before you can make your first API call.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are the main areas of friction when it comes to going from discovering an API to making your first API call. While some API providers have made this easier and very frictionless, many API providers insist on making it as hard as possible in often unintentional ways, but sometimes I suspect it is on purpose. The API management providers promised to make this easy, but because of the competitive nature of this game, they needed up each doing it in their own way, refusing to support any sort of common standard, leaving us with an even more confusing range of API on-boarding and authentication solutions. Demonstrating how venture backed API services and tooling will often do very little to actually drive interoperability and solve these common areas of friction developers and non-developers face every day in their work.</p>
<h3>Thinking Through Solutions</h3>
<p class="p1">Ok, so how do we fix all of this. It isn&rsquo;t easy. We&rsquo;d have to provide a single open source API management solution for all API providers to use, and convince them to use it. Both things aren&rsquo;t going to happen. As the first proponent of there being an open source API management solution back in 2011 and 12, and living in a reality where there are now many different open source API management solutions, we won&rsquo;t get every API provider using the same solution. In my opinion, this comes down to patterns and standards, and we need to begin establishing common solutions that API providers and API tooling and service providers can implement to help streamline the friction. These are some of the areas we need to collectively invest in when it comes to reducing friction:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sign-Up -</strong> There needs to be a set of sign-up forms in a variety of language and platforms for API providers to use.</li>
<li><strong>OpenID -</strong> There needs to be dead simple implementation for authentication using existing platform providers.</li>
<li><strong>Account -</strong> We need a set of open source account management forms and screen that standardize how accounts work.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - We need a set of open source solutions for managing applications, keys, and tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Usage</strong> - We need a set of open source solutions for reporting upon usage for each API developer.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Ok, yawwwwn. This is basically open source API management&mdash;which we have. If every API provider was the same it would reduce friction for developers when on-boarding. This is what I have been evangelizing for almost ten years. Let&rsquo;s all use the common API building blocks when it comes to publishing our APIs. Emulate what Twilio, Stripe, and others do, and it will help make API on-boarding easier, where developers do not have to learn about yet another process each time they go to use another API. Ideally, also use OpenID so you don&rsquo;t have to create yet another account just to kick the tires of an API, and allow developers to use my GitHub or Google account to signup and manage all of our API accounts. This is a solution, but it clearly isn&rsquo;t the solution that will move the needle, because I&rsquo;ve been evangelizing this approach for waaaaay too long.</p>
<p class="p1">If I have to add in some elements to help move this conversation forward, I would focus on a few newer ways that I feel represents API management 2.0, and allow API providers to begin thinking beyond their portal and API silo. The problem with most API providers is that even though they&rsquo;ve gotten over the hurdle of doing a public API, they are still operating within their bubble, and do not think about the bigger world of APIs. Everyone wants to build their API, and API consumers will just come, sign-up, and the magic will just happen. They find it difficult to think about the fact that they are just one of thousands of APIs operating in a sea of APIs, and we need some patterns and standards that help us make our APIs more interoperable and usable at scale&mdash;here is what I am thinking might help move the needle on this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Every API provider needs APIs. Duh. They do! Well, they also need APIs for their API infrastructure. I should be able to signup and create an account with an API. I should be able to manage my account, applications, keys, and usage via APIs. I should be able to do everything I&rsquo;m expected to do via an API portal via an API.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Personal Tokens -</strong> I should be automatically given, or able to create a personal access token as part of my account and use to make API calls on behalf of my account, without setting up an application, and doing the OAuth dance required of most platforms. Every API should have this as a feature within the primary account for their platforms&mdash;not some separate area just for developers.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - We need to evolve the definition of what an &ldquo;application&rdquo; is within the modern API ecosystem. It isn&rsquo;t just a web or mobile application anymore. We need personal applications, integration applications, device applications, and many other types. This is one area that API management providers have dropped the ball in their quest of exists and revenue, and not innovating in helping evolve the definition of what application means.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - We need a machine readable definition for API service composition, access tiers, and the pricing of resources to emerge. The cost of usage, or the lack of pricing is one of the biggest challenges in on-boarding new API consumers, and if this is going to be automated and scaled, we are going to need a machine readable representation of the business of APIs, complete with tooling and services to help you manage.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> One of the biggest areas of friction for this reality is the TOS for API providers, and that platforms want to have the direct relationship with each developer, restricting aggregators, marketplaces, and other brokers from signing up new users in automated way via an API or other mechanism. API providers need to be able to allow more streamlined TOS for their platforms, getting out of the way of scaled usage and adoption of their resources.</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> - There has to be some sort of trust network if things re going to scaled and automated. You need to know that your newly setup API accounts aren&rsquo;t just bots and are trustworthy. So we need some way to validate new accounts, as well as accounts over time, ensuring that our platform users actually benefitting the platform overall. This is something that can be done through both a technical and business solution, but needs standardization.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are what I&rsquo;d consider to be the API management 2.0 investments that need to occur to fix the illnesses we experience with on-boarding developers and non-developers with APIs. Ironically it will be APIs for APIs that will help scale and automate this problem outside of the bubble for each individual API provider. I know that every API provider wants to be the next Twilio or Stripe, but 98.9% of the APIs will end up just being a commodity in a sea of APIs, and if your API won&rsquo;t allow for on-boarding via an API you won&rsquo;t last in the next decade. We need API providers to evolve the technology of their APIs with APIs, the business of their APIs with machine readability and APIs, and the legal side of your API operations with more scalable, flexible terms of service. We need more investment in these areas by API service providers. This work has been left on the table after the latest round of investment, acquisitions, and exists. Just as mainstream companies began on-boarding with the world of APIs.</p>
<p class="p1">If the next generation of developers are going to be successful on-boarding with not just 10+ APIs, but with 100+, or 1000+ APIs, we have to automate and standardize all of this. If we are going to empower business users to integrate and automate their operations using APIs in low-code and no-code ways, we are going to have to automate and standardize all of this. It shouldn&rsquo;t be this hard. The technical solutions are already out there. This isn&rsquo;t a technical challenge. This is a business challenge. The desires of venture capital, and the captive power of this realm has pushed API service providers to miss what needs to happen. Resulting in waves of API startups that aren&rsquo;t about actually providing API solutions. They are just providing solutions that help investors find an exit, and building walled gardens and silos. We need more investment in the API life cycle tooling we already have, and more participation in API standards development that isn&rsquo;t just about the selfish needs of a single company, but the robustness of the entire API economy. Let&rsquo;s stop just talking about the API economy, and actually invest in what is needed to do this at scale&mdash;we all will be much better for it, and there will be plenty of money to be made along the way.</p>

<p class="p1">My friend Lorenzino Vaccari (<a href="https://twitter.com/lvaccari">@lvaccari)</a> asked me to help him with what I think of as an open API. Not to be confused with the OpenAPI specification, but an API that is &ldquo;open&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll begin with the state of things and the reality that there are many API providers who proclaim that they have an open API, when in reality there are very, very, very, very, very, few APIs that are actually open. Honestly it is a term that I&rsquo;d completely avoid using mostly because it doesn&rsquo;t have any meaning anymore, but also because of the unfortunate name that Swagger was given after it was put into the Linux Foundation. Even so, I&rsquo;d do anything for Lorenzino, so let&rsquo;s work through this exercise of what it actually means when you wield the term &ldquo;open API&rdquo; in my opinion&mdash;so here we go.</p>
<p class="p1">In my opinion, the most common thing that &ldquo;open API&rdquo; means is open for business. It has almost nothing to do with API access, but if I was to explore what an honest real world bar for what &ldquo;open API&rdquo; SHOULD mean, here is a list of things I would consider. First, I&rsquo;d say that being an open API is not black or white, but more many shades of gray, resulting in a laundry list of things API providers and consumers should be considering when they wield the term.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Can I find the API? Is it easy to discover and explore for any potential consumer.</li>
<li><strong>Portal</strong> - Is the landing page or portal for the API accessible to the public, allowing me to learn about the API.</li>
<li><strong>Docs</strong> - Is there complete, up to date API documentation for the API that is accessibly publicly.</li>
<li><strong>Paths</strong> - Do developers have access to all of the paths that are available for the API made available.</li>
<li><strong>Enumerators</strong> - As a developer do I have access to all enumerated values that can be used for an API.</li>
<li><strong>Read / Write</strong> - Is an API just GET access, or can developers POST, PUT, and DELETE resources.</li>
<li><strong>Media Types</strong> - Are there standardized media types in use for each API response from an API.</li>
<li><strong>Sign-Up </strong>- Is the signup for the API self-service and allows developers to easily access and complete.</li>
<li><strong>Sign-Up Scope</strong> - How much information is required from developers to be able to get access to an API.</li>
<li><strong>Sign-Up Approval</strong> - Do developers have to wait for access and be approved before they can obtain keys to access.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - What is involved with authentication, and is the technical bar set too high for some developers.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> - Is an API intuitive, easy to understand, and accessible to everyone using it, or is it cryptic and hard to learn.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong> - Are API patterns consistent across all APIs, alleviating extra work to put any of the APIs to work.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong> - What limitations are placed upon developers access to an API, limiting the usage of any individual API.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Ceilings</strong> - Are there not just limits, but entire ceilings I cannot overcome at any point in development.</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - Can developers access all APIs in a sandbox, so you do not have fear of only working with live data.</li>
<li><strong>Status Codes </strong>- Are standard HTTP status codes returned allowing for understanding what each response means.</li>
<li><strong>Error Messages</strong> - Are there standardized and coherent error messages associated with each API, making things understandable.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong> - Is there large periods of time when the API is not available for use within applications.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> - Is the availability of the APIs reliable, making it something developers can count on and put to use.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> - Is the API performant and something you can actually receive responses in an acceptable time frame.</li>
<li><strong>API License</strong> - Is the interface for an API openly licensed so I can confidently integrate and use in my code.</li>
<li><strong>Data License </strong>- Is data returned as part of API responses licensed in an open way allowing developers to use.</li>
<li><strong>Code License</strong>.- Are the cod made available as part of an API openly license for wide usage within applications.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Costs</strong> - Are the costs associated with usage of an API within reasonable ranges for developers.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Increases </strong>- Are there regular cost increases that might move an API out of range of access.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> - Can I get access to support when it comes to accessing and using an API.</li>
<li><strong>Communication&nbsp;</strong>- Is there anyone home behind an API helping communicate about what is happening.</li>
<li><strong>Road Map</strong> - Is there any visibility into what the future will hold when it comes to the development road map.</li>
<li><strong>Censorship</strong> - Is data or content actively being filtered or censored as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Is there a privacy policy in place that protects developers and their usage of an API.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - Is there a TOS in place that governs the API, and what are the constraints in place.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement</strong> - Are there any guarantees In place that govern the availability and costs associated with an API.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This may seem like a lengthy list, but in reality these are all of the ways in which APIs are made closed, when they are marketed as being open. There is also a very invasive quality to many APIs that are marketed as &ldquo;open&rdquo;. Meaning they distract you by being easy to access and free, while they are extracting data from you, and putting your data and privacy in jeopardy when it comes to breaches, and selling your data. So, the opposite of open, or exploiting your life so that YOU are more OPEN for business, for sale, and generating value for a platform. Honestly I&rsquo;d ay that open API means this type of exploitation more than it ever means anything about the API and its resources being available&mdash;this is the dirty (not so secret) secret of the API sector.</p>
<p class="p1">In reality, there are many layers to the open API onion. Intentionally making it very difficult to truly rank APIs as being open or not. Even if you can make sense of the documentation, signup, authentication, rate limits, pricing, and terms of service for an API, there are many other ways in which an API can be further locked down, restricted, and closed down. If an API provider declares they have an &ldquo;open API&rdquo; I honestly see it as a red flag. I think we need to come up with another phrase to describe what many of us mean when it comes to API access, and attach it to some very specific deliverables. The phrase open API is too tainted at this point to recover what it means, and turn it into anything meaningful. I don&rsquo;t expect every API provider to adhere to this list, but as a community we should be thinking about all of these ways in which API providers introduce friction, ultimately making their APIs more closed&mdash;after on-boarding with thousands of APIs, I&rsquo;ve seen it all.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2019/11/11/thinking-about-data-and-api-governance-as-well-as-observability/">After some time in DC talking API governance</a> I&rsquo;m reminded that the &ldquo;normals&rdquo; are increasingly aware of public APIs, being able to actively discuss Facebook, Twitter, and other APIs, but are still very unaware of the larger mass of APIs that exist behind the mobile applications we are all dependent on. I don&rsquo;t blame them, as many of the API providers I walk to who develop mobile APIs often do not fully see them either, leaving mobile APIs often un-secured, and operating in the shadows. Public APIs are easy to talk about, and I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve made progress in hing theelp &ldquo;normals&rdquo; be more aware, but we need to also be investing in more storytelling that helps bring mobile APIs out of the dark.</p>
<p class="p1">Most people, developer or non-developers just see a mobile application when looking at the icons available on our mobile devices. When I look at them, I just see APIs. The mobile applications are just a Hollywood facade, and it is APIs that move data and content back and forth between mobile phones and the platforms behind each application. It is APIs that broadcast our locations, access our cameras, and use our microphone and speakers. APIs are the plumbing behind the applications we depend on, but do not receive much of the conversation and attention when it comes to privacy, security, and the observability of our personal and professional data resources&mdash;this is a problem, and we need to invest more in helping educate folks about the API pipes just below the surface.</p>
<p class="p1">Even when APIs are hidden behind mobile applications they are still public APIs. Even though these APIs may not have not be published via a public developer portal, they still use public DNS and are accessible simply by running am mobile application through a proxy. These APIs should be receiving the same amount of attention, scrutiny, and auditing as any other public API. We should be having open discussion around how these APIs are secured, as well as the privacy, reliability, and observability of this critical API infrastructure. These aren&rsquo;t private APIs, but somehow they keep living on in the shadows of the mobile applications we are putting to work each day on our mobile devices, and just do not get the scrutiny and discussion they deserve.</p>
<p class="p1">Developers are more than aware of the API infrastructure behind mobile applications, as they are responsible for making APIs so popular. However, business leaders at companies who are developing mobile applications, and business users who are generally API aware do not see this API iceberg that exists across the enterprise. In 2020 I will be spending more time educating business folks about the APIs that exist behind mobile applications, helping draw more attention to the security, privacy, and observability issues that exist. Leading more conversations around how we govern and engage in conversation around the valuable data and content flowing through the API pipes that are behind everything, driving our desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications that litter our personal and professional lives.</p>

<p class="p1">I am always wondering how much of the API sector is a construct of API providers, or something that was introduce by API service providers. Ok, I guess there is probably a third category of how much is manifested by analysts, storytellers, and bullshitters like me. One of the building blocks I have been pondering on lately is the concept of the developer or API portal. While it is something you can find organically growing in the wild, I&rsquo;d say that mostly it is something you find being a construct or deliverable of the latest couple of waves of API management providers. Leaving me wondering what came first, the API management portal, or the API portal? Also, pushing me to ask other questions like whether or not we need the API portal at all?</p>
<p class="p1">I am a big fan of having a single <a href="http://developer.example.com"><span class="s1">developer.example.com</span></a> portal to visit for every domain. I don&rsquo;t think we should be getting rid of centralized API portals and catalogs for companies, but I am questioning (as I always do) the belief systems we have in place, wondering if we&rsquo;ve become trapped by our own narratives along the way. I feel like many APIs I use do not need wider availability via a central API catalog and it helps to just be able to provide URLs to the API documentation, which should give me everything I need to on-board and being putting an API to work. Not all APIs are ready for prime time, and just needs sharing amongst a tighter group of shareholders, and depending on the life cycle and evolution of the API, it may or may not need publishing to central catalog.</p>
<p class="p1">If an API possesses a dedicate URL to a landing page with the essential building blocks like sign-up, documentation, code snippets, support, TOS, and other essential building blocks, does it need to be published to a single, comprehensive API portal? I am noticing that the operation of centralized API portals are becoming a point of friction within large enterprise organizations, where there isn&rsquo;t always agreement in how and who should be operating the portal, and what the requirements and governance involved in publishing APIs to a collective location. Pushing some API providers to start their own catalogs, or just publishing APIs via their own GitHub hosted, or other landing pages, where they publish docs and other supporting elements. In my opinion, a central API catalog is a good thing, but if it starts getting in the way of API developers making their API resources available, and injecting friction into the process, then we should be asking more questions about whether or not we are making the right decision here.</p>
<p class="p1">While developer portals are largely a positive building block in the API ecosystem, I feel like the tractor beam of API management vendors has dominated the discussion around what should be the presence of each API we publish. I&rsquo;m not saying this needs to go away, and I&rsquo;d love to see more API management providers begin to innovate in this area, and begin thinking out of the box when it comes to the discoverability of our APIs, and how we empower API developers to share their resources. I think that public and private API portals should be default for all organizations. However, I also think there should be other frictionless ways of publishing public and private APIs, while still ensuring they have all the necessary building blocks for success, and ensure the APIs are discoverable by any stakeholder involved. At the very least, I think we should always be questioning the constructs we put in place, regularly asking how we got here, and if everything we are doing makes sense&mdash;keeping things fresh and always changing when it makes sense.</p>

<p>I just got back to Seattle from Washington DC after spending a day talking about data governance at <a href="https://www.governingdata.org/">the Data Governance Design Conference</a>. I thoroughly enjoyed the on-stage discussions as well as the hallway, and cocktail party conversation around the increasing importance of the governance of data online. I have a notebook full of thoughts from the event, and a head full of ideas after a plane ride home. I&rsquo;ll be doing some more writing on the subject, but I wanted to lay the foundation of how I see the world of data governance, which is a much more technical view of things, but also overlaps nicely with the policy view of the landscape I just experienced.</p>
<p>The group participating in the #DGDC discussions were much more focused on the important big picture elements, and the human call to action when it comes to data governance. I learned a lot listening to these smart folks share their expertise on the world stage, and I mostly just listened and absorbed what was going on around me, occasionally sharing a bit of perspective from my view of the landscape. I have a much more technical view of the landscape, but I am captivated by the policy level discussions that were going on, which are much more closer to what I consider to be the human side of the discussion, and how laws are made to dictate what happens or doesn&rsquo;t happens in countries around the globe. Coming out of the discussion I wanted to flesh out the building blocks of my technical view of the landscape, and re-evaluate them in terms of what I have heard at the event.</p>
<h3>Bringing APIs To The Data Governance Discussion</h3>
<p>This was a data governance discussion, but of course I&rsquo;m going to bring the API to the table. You can&rsquo;t talk data governance without talking APIs. Data is the valuable resource(s) being created, passed around, and put to use&mdash;APIs are how it is passed around and put to use. APIs are how Facebook, Twitter, and Google creates, manages, and shares the data they have via applications and 3rd party systems. APIs are how these platforms are accessed and scaled. APIs are the layer that any data governance approach will have to be realized, injecting governance between how several different actors interests are protected and policed. APIs aren&rsquo;t something new to bring into the discussion, they are already the conduit for how applications are being delivered, making them the layer we need to understand when it comes to applying sensible data governance from within the firewall, or externally from within regulatory bodies.</p>
<h3>Who Are The Actors On This Data Governance Stage</h3>
<p>To set the stage I wanted to describe the different actors that need to be involved in these data governance discussions, making sure there are considerations, policy, and tooling in place that governs this production already in motion. When it comes to API access to the valuable data and resources we are trying to govern, a clear set of actors have emerged that we will need to make sure have a seat at the table, and are part of the data governance discussions happening&mdash;including, but not limited to this primary buckets of actors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provider</strong> - The platform provider, making sure the Twitters, Facebooks, Googles, and other platform providers are active and willing particpants in data governance conversation whether they want to be there or not.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Party</strong> - Ensuring that ALL 3rd party consumers and developers of platform data are accounted for, have a seat at the table, and are held accountable when it comes to putting valuable data to work across the web.</li>
<li><strong>End-User </strong>- Making sure ALL end-users are represented, ensuring that the human beings most impacted by all of this data are well represented, making sure the full spectrum of people are represented, and not just a select few.</li>
<li><strong>Regulator</strong> - Acknowledging that there is an increasing regulatory role in this discussion, and making sure regulators have the knowledge, skills, and access to do what they need to do from a municipal, state, and federal view.</li>
<li><strong>Law Enforcement</strong> - Going one step beyond the regulatory and looking at the enforcement side of the conversation, making sure law enforcement has the access they need, but are also just as accountable as all other actors.</li>
<li><strong>Researcher</strong> - Ensuring there is trusted researcher and press access to the data governance conversation, allowing for Universities, media, and other entities to participate in the analysis of data, and the API pipes the data is accessed through.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these actors are already using the Twitter, Facebook, and Google APIs to do what they do. I&rsquo;d say the regulator, law enforcement, and research roles are the least define here, but they are actively using APIs to adapt to the new landscape, whether it is directly via APIs, or via applications built on top of the APIs. Modern API infrastructure is currently serving all of the needs of these actors, but is currently not doing it in a structured approach with data governance in mind. Data governance already exists, but the deck is heavily tiled in favor of the platform, giving them the edge when it comes to governing 3rd parties, driving end-user behavior, and dictating what regulation, law enforcement, and research looks like on their platforms.</p>
<h3>Suite Of Specifications Being Employed For Data Governance</h3>
<p>This industry and platform provider governance is being increasingly led by a handful of machine readable specifications that allow platforms to define and realize data governance across their platforms. This is where my view of the landscape shifts from the more policy oriented discussions I had yesterday, and will be seen as more technical, but in reality they aren&rsquo;t&mdash;they perfectly dovetail with the objectives of all of the actors above. There are handful of standards driving the data governance across technology platforms, which are rapidly being evolved to meet the needs of platform providers, but can also be applied to help balance the data governance conversations across all of the actors involved.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSON Schema</strong> - A schema standard for describing each individual data object, it&rsquo;s properties, and the validation meta data needed to maintain integrity of each piece of data, providing a machine readable view of the data landscape that exists within enterprise organizations.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - An API standard for describing the surface area of an HTTP 1.1 request and response API (which most APIs are), defining how data will be accessed and made available internally and externally, leveraging JSON schema to describe the data, but goes further to describe the surface area of what is possible when it comes to access of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Postman Collections -</strong> An API definition for describing the schema and API, but done in a way that allows it to be accessed and executed, providing a portable, machine readable and executable representation of any capability that a platform has, and the data being leverage as part of each capability.</li>
<li><strong>Postman Environments </strong>- An API definition for describing the authentication, authorization, and variables needed to access APIs in general, or on behalf of a specific user, providing the credentials and meta data needed to actually make one or many API calls and retrieve data in a variety of contexts.</li>
<li><strong>AsyncAPI</strong> - An API standard for describing event-driven, TCP, websocket, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and other more real-time APIs, describing the surface area of a fast growing breed of APIs in use in B2B environments, and within the internal enterprise operations of platforms.</li>
<li><strong>OAuth</strong> - An open standard for handling authentication and authorization for APIs, used by Twitter, Facebook, Google, and other APIs providing a way for platform providers, 3rd party developers, and end-users to all have a voice in what data is accessed, within establish scopes by provider and regulatory body.</li>
<li><strong>RBAC</strong> - Role based authentication control for defining who has access to what, used by itself, or in conjunction with OAuth to define who has access to what data, defining roles for every stakeholder involved in data governance.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json </strong>- API open standard for indexing API operations, and all the common building blocks like where documentation, signup and terms of service are for an API, while also indexing all of the artifacts listed above as part of a wider governance and discovery pfft.</li>
</ul>
<p>These specifications are currently being used by platforms to get a handle on data governance across operations. Some organizations are further along in this journey, while most are still just getting a handle on their "big data problem", as well as governance of this explosion in data they find themselves drowning in. All of these machine readable artifacts can be used to negotiate, define, and automate governance across platforms, and within specific business sectors. You can find a variety of these artifacts for leading API platforms, and you can find them baked into the services, tooling, and infrastructure being put to use by companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Leveraging Existing Infrastructure In Service Of Data Governance</h3>
<p>Next up is the infrastructure that platform providers are already using to operate their APIs, and make data, content, and other resources available using the web. These common architecture components are already in use across platform providers, helping operate their existing API, application, device, and system integrations. These are just a handful of the common architectural areas of consideration when it comes to data governance across the enterprise.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Gateway </strong>- An architectural component used to deploy and manage APIs, connecting them to backend services, storage, and database components.</li>
<li><strong>API Management</strong> - An architectural solution for governing access to APIs, helping organization APIs in logical service tiers, and manage access to resources.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> - Common storage in use across API, application, device, and system integrations, providing varying grades of object and data storage.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> - Common or specialized database where data is stored and organized, then made available via well defined API implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong> - The gathering of activity logs across all areas of operation providing a record of every engagement with data resources being made available APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are key architectural components already in use across the enterprise to govern the creation, access, evolution, and use of data on any platform. However there are two additional dimensions to this conversation that should be taken into consideration when thinking about how existing modern API infrastructure can be used to govern data within the enterprise, as well as externally within regulated industries.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure APIs </strong>- All of these infrastructure components all have APIs, allowing for remote and automated management of the data governance life cycle--yes APIs have APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong> - All of these infrastructure components all have logging, allowing the data governance life cycle to tracked, audited, and managed programmatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logging and APIs are essential to properly governing the access to data via APIs. API gateways, management, storage, and databases are essential to properly governing the access to data via APIs. Leading technology platform providers have been developing and using this infrastructure for 20 years, and it is becoming a mainstream practice with all enterprise organization realizing they need to operate their APIs in not just an API-first way, but also to develop mature data and API governance practices along they way. We have the infrastructure needed to properly govern data at scale within the enterprise, and externally across industries--we just need the will to use it for proper data governance.</p>
<h3>Ensuring There Is Always Platform Observability</h3>
<p>Behind the key infrastructure elements, and specifications in use, there is one more dimension of existing API operations that contributes significantly to the data governance conversation. There is a philosophy emerging out of historical industrial control practices called observability, which helps more effectively govern their platform operations by providing them with more visibility or observability into what is happening, using the existing outputs of these architectural components listed above. Observability spans several essential aspects of operating platforms at scale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - The monitoring of infrastructure to understand the overall health and availability of platform resources.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> - The monitoring of infrastructure from multiple to regions to understand the performance of platform resources.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - The monitoring of how data is access to ensure there are no breaches of privacy based upon agreed upon policies.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Allowing the platform to identify and understand threats, address vulnerabilities, and mitigate breaches of access to data.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreements (SLA)</strong> - Providing governance over the SLAs in place between platform providers and their consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency Reports</strong> - Publishing regular information regarding how data is shared with law enforcement and government agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observability provides platform providers with visibility into everything that is occurring across a platform. If it can do this for providers, it can also be leveraged on behalf of other stakeholders, providing visibility into essential areas for other actors like 3rd party developers, end-users, regulators, and researchers. Defining a set of observability policies in the service of data governance, helping ensure the health of the overall platform across every dimension of concern for each of the actors involved in the governance of data.</p>
<h3>The Technology And Processes For Data Governance Already Exists</h3>
<p>Data governance is something enterprise organizations already desire and work towards, using existing proprietary API services and open source tooling, and specifications. Data governance is not equally balanced across all of the data governance stakeholders listed above. This is an approach I have talked about several times before <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/26/a-regulatory-framework-for-facebook-and-other-platforms-is-already-in-place/">in service of governing Facebook</a>, being <a href="http://open.banking.blueprint.apievangelist.com/">applied to the banking industry</a>, and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/07/19/api-governance-models-in-the-public-and-private-sector/">API governance models for both the public and private sector</a>. The technology and processes already exist to realize data governance across the enterprise, and the industries they operate in. The only thing that is missing is the desire to do so in a balanced way across all data governance stakeholders, and the establishment of well-defined blueprints for how to conduct data governance at this scale well.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I will use this as my base for some more storytelling on the subject, and keep working through my notes from the Data Governance Design Conference. I have a lot of work to do to keep evolving my blueprints for conducting data governance using API infrastructure, specifications, and processes. I am thinking I need some more real world examples of doing this at scale for multiple industries, not just banking. Maybe apply it to what I know about Facebook, Twitter, and say YouTube&mdash;three API platforms I think could use a little more investment in observability and data governance. Then I will look at some more examples of data governance when it comes to health care, entertainment, and some of the other areas where data is making a significant positive or potentially negative effect on a wide audience of people&mdash;pushing my own understanding of how data governance might play out in coming years.</p>

<p class="p1">After spending some time in DC talking about data governance and the role API definitions play in how we quantify the data we have, as well as how it is accessed by all stakeholders, I have a serious need for a primer on API definitions&mdash;helping some smart folks I know better understand not just the history of API definitions and how we got here, but the critical role they are playing in how desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications are defined, deployed, managed, and evolved. API definitions are tough to fully understand unless you&rsquo;ve been tracking on them for a while, and have experience delivering APIs using modern API Infrastructure, so I wanted to craft a quick primer on what API definitions are, and why they matter.</p>
<p class="p1">I consider an API definition to cover a wide variety of specifications that have contributed to how data is made accessible via APIs. These definitions span the last twenty years of web service and API development, and are currently being used to define, deliver, and evolve API infrastructure that power desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications and system to system integrations. Think of API definitions as the restaurant menus to the buffet of resources needed to power the web, mobile, and connected device world that has exploded over the last twenty years. These API definitions provide developers, and business users with the information they need to understand the capabilities that exist behind leading technology platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and others.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to API definitions, there are a handful of stand out specifications that should be considered when getting up to speed on the world of APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl.html">Web Service Description Language (WSDL)</a></strong> - WSDL is an XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md">Swagger 2.0</a></strong> - Swagger was a project used to describe and document RESTful APIs that use HTTP 1.1 as a transport, defining a set of files required to describe each API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI 3.0</a></strong> - Swagger was put into the Linux foundation and renamed as OpenAPI, publishing version 3.0 of the specification for describing RESTful APIs that use HTTP 1.1 as a transport, defining a set of files required to describe each API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a></strong> - JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents, providing a schema approach to defining data.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">ASyncAPI</a></strong>&nbsp;- AsyncAPI is an open source initiative that seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA), making working with EDA&rsquo;s as easy as it is to work with REST APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/collection">Postman Collections</a></strong> - Collections allow for API requests to be organized into folders, making easier to work with, and providing the necessary details to automate the usage of web and GraphQL APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/environments-and-globals/manage-environments/">Postman Environments&nbsp;</a></strong>- Postman environments are a machine readable format for managing API secrets, tokens, and the key / value pairs needed to work with an existing APIs, providing the data needed authenticate and use within specific contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are other API definition formats that what is listed here, but these are the most relevant to the overall API conversation occurring across platforms today. WSDL are still in use across many enterprise organizations today, but is falling out of use in favor of newer ways of delivering APIs. Swagger is worth noting because it shifted the landscape from WSDL to a more modern approach of defining APIs, but OpenAPI, JSON Schema, ASyncAPI, and Postman Collections and Environments represent the current state of defining API infrastructure. They provide a machine readable way to describe data, and how it can be accessed via variety of approaches to delivering APIs using HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 and TCP, employing a variety of message formats and patterns.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Definitions Are Servicing The Entire API Life Cycle</strong></p>
<p class="p1">In the early days of WSDL, API definitions were very much machine readable, and something just for developers and system integration, in an XML format. Now API definitions are available as usually JSON or YAML, ensuring these artifacts are human and machine readable. OpenAPI and AsyncAPI provide the vocabulary for describing about 90% of the APIs in operation today. OpenAPI has changed how we define, view, and work with HTTP 1.1 APIs, and AsyncAPI is rapidly doing the same for the event-driven API landscape which is often more real time, and using sustained connections or publish and subscribe patterns for accessing data at scale using APIs. Both OpenAPI and AsyncAPI employ JSON Schema to define the underlying data being passed back and forth using HTTP 1.1 request / response approaches, or more real-time, event-driven approaches via TCP, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">These API definition artifacts began simply as a way to document our APIs, but quickly have become central to many different stops along the API life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - You can generate consistent API documentation using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.</li>
<li><strong>Mock APIs </strong>-<span>&nbsp; </span>You can mocked versions of APIs using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - You can generate libraries, SDKs and other code for providing and consuming APIs using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - You can automate the monitoring and performance of APIs using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - You can automate the validation that each API is operating as expected using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - You can automate the scanning and securing API infrastructure using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong> - You can automate the integration of APIs with other API platforms using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - You can automate the search and discovery of APIs using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong> - You can govern the design, delivery, operation, and usage of APIs using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">APIs definitions are pushing organizations and teams to adopt an API-first approach to delivering the infrastructure they need for web, mobile, device, and network infrastructure. API definitions are being used to deliver and manage APIs from start to finish, throughout the life cycle of each individual API. API definitions help define what an API does, and then allow that use of the definition to manage every aspect of how each API is also delivered. Additionally, each API specification allows for being extended beyond the core specification, better meeting the needs of API providers, and service providers, often times being used to better deliver value to providers and consumers in each of the stops along the API life cycle listed above.</p>
<p class="p1">Effectively using API definitions are how API providers, as well as service and tooling providers are able to consistently deliver APIs at scale to meet the growing demand for application and system to system integration. API definitions are how API providers, service providers, and consumers are mapping out the growing API landscape across the enterprise, and every business sector being impacted by the web (which is all of them). These API definitions can be used to define any type of API, but we are already seeing industry specific standards emerge using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman collections. Providing not just a machine readable contract that can be used in banking, healthcare, and other industries, but a contract that can be documented, mocked, monitored, tested, secured, integrated, discovered, and governed in an automated way.</p>
<p class="p1">Hopefully that provide you with a quick primer on what API definitions are, what they are used for, and why they matter. API definitions are being used to deliver and manage the infrastructure behind all the applications we depend on in our professional and personal worlds. Well defined, available, and versioned API definitions are how we make sense of our infrastructure and engage in a coordinated approach to operating and evolving infrastructure, allowing us to confidently know what our organizational capabilities are, and effectively plan for and evolve towards the future we envision when it comes to operating our organizations at scale on the world wide web.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p1">I have written several times about what a Postman collection means to my API discovery and search workflow. I have thousands of OpenAPI definitions indexed as part of my research, but until there is a Postman collection with a functional environment, my API definitions aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can have a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; OpenAPI definition for the surface area of an API, but without a functional Postman collection, with API keys or tokens, and real world examples for each individual API path&mdash;it is just decoration. In this reality the Postman collection becomes a unit of compute that represents the discovery and search stops along the API life cycle, providing just two examples of how this machine readable API definition can be used across the entire API life cycle.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">A Postman collection doesn&rsquo;t just just act as a reference for an API, it can be a reference of the API for a variety of contexts and workflows. The collection can possess a variety of API paths across a single, or multiple APIs. One Postman collection can have multiple Postman environments that represent a variety of context&mdash;possessing different authentication scenarios, and pre-populated variables that illicit different responses from each API. These reference and workflow collections, complete with environment(s) are portable and shareable units of representation of any single API, or meaningful business capabilities that exist across multiple API providers. This portable, machine readable unit of compute becomes something that can be used by both API provider and API consumer to engage in more meaningful, and automated ways across almost every stop along the API life cycle.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">I spoke of how I use a Postman collection as a executable unit of compute for API discovery, and search, but other stops along the API life cycle might also include API monitoring and performance, using a reference or workflow collection to represent a specific business capability that needs monitoring to ensure the service level agreement is being met. <a href="https://blog.postman.com/2019/10/22/how-to-use-postman-apimetrics/">You can see this in action if you are an APIMetrics customer, where you can upload a Postman collection and use it as the seed for monitoring the availability, quality, and performance of a specific API or a set of APIs from any region in the world</a>. APIMetrics provides multi-regional industrial-grade monitoring of your business API capabilities. Not just your APIs, but the Postman collection driven workflows that make your business go round each day. This isn&rsquo;t just about the API, or monitoring the API, it is about crafting actual business workflows and monitoring these workflows that bring value to your business.</p>
<p class="p1">Using a Postman Collection to monitor your real-world business processes, allowing you to define, monitor, test, and share your organizational capabilities is how we define reliable API contracts for use internally, and externally with partners. This contract can then further be used to service other stops along the API life cycle, automating the documenting, securing, discovery, and other vitals aspects of providing and consuming APIs. A complete Postman Collection with a Postman Environment that describes a specific business context represents a single capability of a company, organization, institution, and government agency. Giving us a unit of compute that we can share internally across teams, empowering developers and non-developers to put the capability to work, while also sharing externally with 3rd party developers and users, extending the reach of each organizational capability&mdash;allowing it to go wherever it is needed.</p>

<p>As I <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-cli">read the recent announcement about Stripe releasing a command line interface (CLI)</a> I find myself think more about the reasons behind the recent resurgence of the CLI, and what makes it a growing favorite of developers. Personally, I&rsquo;ve had an on and off relationship with the CLI. Sometimes I really enjoy working in there, and other times it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m working with more of a black box. In the age of API, it felt like CLIs were falling out of favor, but in recent years I am coming across more API providers like Stripe who are launching their own CLI alongside their API, and I&rsquo;m interested to stay in tune with the reasons behind this shift in the landscape.<br /><br />I remember when I was first on-boarding with AWS S3 and EC2 back in 2006 they only had an API and CLI, no GUI dashboard. CLI seemed to be on equal footing with API in those days, but as the popularity of web APIs grew, the CLI didn&rsquo;t seem to keep up. APIs always seemed more accessible to non-developers, and this was a significant portion of its appeal and growth beyond just the developer community. However, in recent years, CLI seems to be picking up momentum, and at first glance it feels like it is about the adoption of a CI/CD way of doing things, but I don&rsquo;t want to just assume, I&rsquo;d like to spend more time thinking about it, and solicit the opinion of other folks I know and trust in the space. Is CLI growth about CI/CD, or are there other factors at play here that is causing its resurgence across the API sector.<br /><br />Beyond the growth in CI/CD, one of the other reasons I think there is a growth in CLI usage is that more enterprise developers are on-boarding to the concept of API platforms, and looking to get access to these valuable API resources that are emerging. These developers are often times much more older school than the latest couple of waves of developers who put APIs to work, and feel more comfortable in a CLI than they do making calls against a web API. Pushing API providers to provide CLI alongside their APIs, and often times deployed on top of their APIs, transcending HTTP or any particular programming language and reaching enterprise developers where they operate already. Making it so enterprise developers do not have to adopt new tooling and practices to get their work done with this new breed of digital resources.<br /><br />Beyond CI/CD, and older enterprise developers coming into the mix, I&rsquo;d say that many of the enablers that come with the CLI, things like logging, workflows, keyboard shortcuts, and other supporting features of the CLI might come into play as part of this shift. I will be spending more time understand why the CLI is making a comeback. If you have any thoughts on why the CLI might be preferable for developers over API, or how they complement each other, I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts. For me, this dance between both CLI and API is where the sweet spot lies. I still have many tasks I do in the CLI, but mostly because that was the doorway introduced to me for a set of valuable resources. Ultimately I much prefer leverage a variety of scripts I&rsquo;ve written or use my Postman collections to get at what I need when it comes to putting APIs to work, but I&rsquo;m curious to learn more about other people&rsquo;s work patterns, and why the CLI, or the API is helping you get your work done.</p>

<p>I was on a call recently with some folks doing the hard work of moving the API conversation forward across their enterprise organization, and the topic of API governance came up (again). This is a conversation I find myself having on a regularly basis, and one thing that comes up each time, is that the group I&rsquo;m talking with has to state that they really haven&rsquo;t figured out how to do API governance properly. I will state what I say each time I encounter this subject within these enterprise conversations so everyone can hear, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOBODY HAS API GOVERNANCE FIGURED OUT</strong></span>. Even the folks who I have been having this conversation with for 5+ years. Even the agile, nimble, scrappy little startups I&rsquo;m having this conversation with. Nobody has it nailed, everyone wants to, and everyone is very nervous about not having it all figured out.<br /><br />Defining what API governance means is hard work, let alone making it a reality across a large enterprise organization. API governance is not an end state, it is a perpetual approach to standardizing how APIs are delivered and consumed internally and externally across the enterprise. Due to the ever changing state of the enterprise and turnover of staff you will never realize any perfect state of API governance. Your anxiety around doing it right, doing it well, and the scope of doing it, shouldn&rsquo;t get in the way of you investing in the area of API governance. However, you should let your fear of missing out light the fire under your ass when it comes to this investment, because I can almost guarantee your competitor is doing it better than you are&mdash;so get to work right now! ;-)<br /><br />API governance begins with conversations around what it means to your organization. It involves bringing together business and technology leadership to establish a definition of what it means, and why you are doing it. Like the rest of API governance this definition will continually evolve, and you will have to regularly re-ask what it means and why you are doing it, or you will lose your way. Your definition of what API governance means in the beginning will not be the same definition of what it means after one or two years of doing it. This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing&mdash;this is a good thing. You see, a big part of API governance centers around learning, adapting, and finding just the right definition for your organization, and the industry you operating within. There is no single definition of what API governance is, and why you should be doing it&mdash;it is all relative to how you operate.<br /><br />If you have API governance anxiety, welcome to the club. If you do not have everything figured out, welcome to the club. API governance is like teenage sex, everyone is talking about, and very few are doing it, and there is no doing it right. It will all be awkward, and unfamiliar. It is a world where a little dialogue and education can go a long way. So kick off the API governance conversations across your teams. Spend time asking people you know at other companies what they are doing when it comes to API governance. And of course, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about where to begin with API governance. <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/07/19/api-governance-models-in-the-public-and-private-sector/">I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time working with large enterprise organizations on the subject, interviewing leading thinkers on the subject, and sharing some of the best practices</a>&mdash;I am happy to sit down with your team and share what I&rsquo;ve learned along the way.

<p>My friend Tim Burks (<a href="https://twitter.com/timburks">@timburks</a>) over at Google gave a great workshop presentation at the API Specifications Conference (ASC) in Vancouver. His talk was on OpenAPI, GraphQL, and gRPC, but one phase he used to describe OpenAPI definitions you find in the wild caught my attention. He described most of the OpenAPIs out there as &ldquo;fan fiction&rdquo;. I think this phrase is perfect for describing what happens in the world of API definitions, and accurately describes the growing number of API definitions you can find littering GitHub and other public locations. Resembling a steady flow of machine readable fan fiction about APIs, with some API producers telling their own story, but for most of the landscape, it is up to the fans to shape the narrative.<br /><br />You can find <a href="https://apis.guru/openapi-directory/">professional level OpenAPI fan fictions sites like APIs.guru</a>. As well as hundreds of little pockets of fan fiction littering GitHub, often tagged so they can be <a href="https://github.com/topics/openapi">found via GitHub topics</a>. You can find <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/index">my index of API fan fiction on GitHub</a> too. I also have scripts who crawl GitHub looking for API fan fiction, as well as API fiction, and non-fiction. I fancy myself as a curator of the stories being told and retold out there, but also someone who tells stories about the stories I hear. Think of me as the TMZ of the API sector. Ok, at this point, you are probably asking why this is relevant to you. Well, fan fiction is an important expression out of your API community. It is a positive sign that your community is crafting OpenAPI definitions and Postman collections for your API, but it might also be a cry for help, and something you should consider when considering creating your own API definitions, and making sure they are available to your community.<br /><br />First, fan fiction API definitions show that people care about your API&mdash;this is good. Second, it shows that people have a need for machine readable definitions of your API&mdash;this is also good. Third, it demonstrates that you should be investing in the creation, maintenance, and sharing of your own API definitions. Since you have such a strong fan-base you might want to consider publishing your API definitions to GitHub, and encouraging your community to lend a hand when it comes to maintaining them. The goal isn&rsquo;t to silence the voice of your community by creating your own API definitions, the goal is to include them in the process, and encourage them to be part of the story, and help you craft the official narrative. You never know, you might find some fans who are worthy of bringing on in some sort of official capacity to help out with this work.<br /><br />Fan fiction API definitions play an important role in spreading the word about what you can do with APIs. Even when API providers step up to craft and manage their own API definitions, the versions created by the community may still be relevant. Sometimes the fan version might be more complete or robust than the platforms, and other times it might reflect the needs of a specific stop along the API lifecycle, like generating SDKs, documentation, visualizations, and other solutions. When it comes to Postman collections, these API definitions might go beyond just being a reference implementation, and define a specific business workflow, connecting several different API calls into a single, more meaningful API definition. There are many ways in which a community can express themselves using API definitions, and this is something that every platform should be taking notice of, incentivizing and rewarding whenever possible.<br /><br />While I wish that all API providers would take control over the narrative around their APIs using OpenAPI and Postman collections, I also realize the value and importance of API fan fiction. I find API definition fan fiction to be extremely valuable in the absence of API providers creating their own API definitions. It also provides me with an important signal regarding the health of an API community&mdash;the more passionate fans, the more relevance of an API. Often times that won&rsquo;t go away even when API providers take control over their own API narrative and actively publish their own API definitions. As part of my API research, I am going to work on a better way to identify and tag authoritative API definition narratives versus fan fiction versions. I also want to continue evolving my approach to API attribution, referencing where I found API definitions, and giving credit to whoever did the hard work to publish each API definitions. Ultimately I want to always be giving author credits to whoever tells the story, be able to differentiate between API non-fiction, fiction, and fan fiction&mdash;all of which tell an important story about what is happening within each sector of the API economy.</p>

<p>I think a lot about the words we use in the technology sector. What they mean, and what they don&rsquo;t mean. One of the stops along the API life cycle I struggle with a lot is about how we describe the process of deploying APIs. I chose to use the word "deploy" about five years ago when it comes to my API research, but I have also dabbled in the usage of other terms to describe what we do at this phase of the API life cycle. I wanted to pause for a moment to rethink this usage, and explore why I use deploy, instead of provide, publish, produce, or other ways of describing the act of making an API available. I&rsquo;m guessing that the purpose and meaning of the words we use impacts the entire API life cycle in ways we might not fully understand.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s start with deployment. I use this term because of the definition, &ldquo;the arrangement or distribution (of resources such as people or equipment), in preparation for battle or work&rdquo;. While my view of the world has shifted in recent years, I grew up captivated by everything military, and the word deployment made sense in my brain when it comes to making resources available. After more thought, I also like it because once you deploy an API, you are responsible for it until it is no longer deployed. Even though I know this is&rsquo;t the case, I like to think that a team who is responsible for deploying an API is responsible for it until it isn&rsquo;t deployed anymore, much like a military unit.<br /><br />Similar to deployment, I like the term provide, because it makes me feel like there is a continued ownership or stewardship for the resource. If you provide an API, you have to support it, own it, and be responsible for what happens down the road. You aren&rsquo;t just checking some box, and moving on, which I think represents much of the illness we see with APIs across the tech sector. If we are providing a resource, it feels like it is a sustained effort, which means we&rsquo;ll stay engage with the process, and the consumers who we are providing this resources to. Which just feels healthier to me. If you are providing something, it is likely that you are the face of it, and have to be engaged, and have skin in the game, which is why you hear me describe people who have APIs as API providers.<br /><br />Publishing an API feels like we are done once we publish it to the gateway or production server. I&rsquo;m not sure it does the reality of API management justice. I&rsquo;d say that producing an API has the same feel to it. Publishing and producing an API feels like we are off the hook once we have accomplished the task, and checked off this request. The ongoing evolution, support, and engagement around an API is just too important to diminish with the words we use. I see too many companies, institutions, and government agencies check the API box and move on, leaving a soulless API for consumers, with nobody home to answer questions, and provide the critical feedback loop. I guess that these terms could work within larger operations where there are separate teams in charge of publishing and producing than there are for managing and supporting, but for most API providers, I am thinking that we should use words that reflect the sustained nature of our obligation around the APIs we deploy.<br /><br />I feel like the words we use are being define solely by vendors who want use to publish APIs to their platforms, encouraging us to produce the things that matter to them. This is fine, but I also think we should be thinking about the bigger picture of how we play the API game, and consider how we can incentivize teams to own more of the process, and take pride in not just producing APIs, but playing a sustained role in their deployment, and being willing to engage with consumers. I think that the words we use matter a lot. I think that it is too easy for us to be detached from the technical resources we are producing, and easily put up walls between us and those who are putting our APIs to work. I&rsquo;d be curious to learn how your teams describe the process. Are they deploying, providing, publishing, producing, or some other way of bringing APIs to life? Or do you think it doesn&rsquo;t matter in the end, as long as the API is made available for consumers to integrate into their desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications.</p>

<p>I have had the pleasure of sitting in on several event storming sessions, where an organization is brainstorming the design of the next generation of their APIs, ensuring that every idea and resource is literally put on the wall and represented as a sticky note. I have also had the opposite of pleasure of sitting in on many shit storming sessions where an organization is doing everything but properly planning the present or future of their API infrastructure. Revealing to me what I consider to be a fairly common approach to designing, defining, or just pushing tone deaf, out of sync, and unreliable APIs into production&mdash;adding to the technical debts that already exist across some large enterprise organizations.<br /><br />Shit storming within an organization is where everyone is running around with their hair on fire on a regular basis. So often, it is seen as normal, and most people don&rsquo;t think anything of it. It is an environment where most ideas are suppressed, and people do not share what they are thinking, acting in passive aggressive ways, or just waiting until the right moment and acting out with actual aggression. It is an environment where most people just keep their heads down and try to do the best they can with what they have, and a small handful of people get to dictate where things are headed without much feedback from other stakeholders. <br /><br />While this approach to delivering API infrastructure may be common, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be considered normal. Some people thrive in these environments, because they are able to adapt and stay afloat amidst the chaos. In my experience these situations arise over time as part of regular waves of dysfunction, bad decision making, and re-enforced by leadership that doesn&rsquo;t not reward honest feedback from their teams. Resulting in APIs that get developed in isolation, absent of nutrient delivering feedback loops, and the essential building blocks that help ensure APIs make a positive impact. Setting the stage for a less than desirable experience across the desktop, web, mobile, and device applications that are built on top of these APIs&mdash;leaving a bad taste in the mouth of developers and end-users who engage with what comes out of an organization.<br /><br />If you have been to one too many shit storming API sessions you might want to look for employment somewhere else&mdash;take my word, this is not how things are done everywhere. If you are passionate about staying where you are at, then start digging in your heals and pushing for more structured conversations around how APIs get designed, developed, and delivered. If you are determined to make change regardless of the historical patterns in place I commend you, and I&rsquo;m here to support you. Let me know how I can help you develop your API strategy toolbox, and challenge some of these legacy practices, or lack of practices within your organization. Who knows, maybe you have the power to make change and calm the storm, and begin to reverse the cycle of the storming sessions within your organization&mdash;shifting how API resources are defined and delivered, and setting a new tone for how business gets done across teams.</p>

<p>I see it over and over&mdash;organizations learning new ways of thinking, moving beyond their legacy constraints by investing in APIs. This is one of the disruptive powers of APIs which can be all about making good things happen, or bringing unintended negative consequences, depending on the state of an organization, and the industry it operates in. This is why companies should be doing APIs, but they should always be approach them with a plan, starting small, and learning in a controlled environment before going to big. Making sure that an organization is ready for the changes being introduced before moving too fast, and going all in on participating in the API economy.<br /><br />API are all about entering an agreement with other parties regarding access to a particular resource. Even if this other party is just another internal group within our organizaiton, we are now being pushed to think externally outside our group. If you are even braver and will be opening up an API for partner access, the external forces being let in will be even greater. With the publishing of public APIs, you are pushing your organization even further when it comes to thinking beyond your own echo chamber. Not every organization will actually open up and immediately change as a result of opening up to the world, but the impact will still be there, even if not consciously realized. Making for a pretty interesting mix of how API providers dip their toe in the water, wade in, or just dive straight into the deep ened of the API pool. Resulting in a diverse range of outcomes that may or may not benefit the organization or group exposing the API.<br /><br />For many, the sunlight entering the room once an API is exposed will be swift and painful, resulting in a backlash, and the API in question being severely limited, left idle, or completely walked away from. Most organizations had no idea what they were doing by opening up their APIs, and are not equipped to receive feedback from other groups, or be able to respond to common support requests. Others will endure, and learn to adapt, grow, and evolve within this new environment. Being shocked by the sunlight entering the room, but eventually understanding its disinfecting qualities, and the potential for change it brings. Seeing APIs as something that is letting in some much needed change, altering organizational behavior, and allowing new ideas in, and maybe, just maybe allow them take root in this new environment.<br /><br />Pushing us to think externally is the most important reasons for doing APIs. Forcing us outside of our bubbles is where the real API value is at. Enterprise firewalls don&rsquo;t just keep malicious actors out, they also keep us in. APIs push us to enter into agreements with outside parties, and establish feedback loops that let outside ideas flow. APIs do not guarantee change, let alone positive change. However, they do have the potential to poke holes into our impenetrable exteriors and let some light in. What we do next is up to us. Whether we heed the lessons that we are presented with will depend on why we are doing APIs in the first place. Whether we see them as lessons or unnecessary noise will depend on the internal culture of our organizations. Unsure about how your organization will respond? Then dip your toe in and begin offering some simple APIs for use by other internal groups, external partners, or if you are brave expose some resources to the public. You just might be surprised what you&rsquo;ll be exposed to and learn along the way.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/pull_image_09_26_2019_07_20_pm.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bunq.com/">The banking API bunq</a> purchased one of <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/cjANw">my API profile packages</a>, so I spent some time this week going through what they offer. Every API provider who purchases one of my profiling packages will utlimately get a post here on the blog, outlining what I found. It is no guarantee of a positive story, but it is the only way an API provider can technically pay to have a story published to API Evangelist. This is the narrative from what I found as I worked my way through what bunq offers, using <a href="https://discovery.apievangelist.com/2019/10/14/the-api-evangelist-api-profiling-process/">my formal approach to profiling APIs</a>.</p>
<p>I always enjoy finding a simple description of what an API does, and bunq doesn't disappoint with, <em>"Use bunq&rsquo;s RESTful open banking API to build  fintech apps you can't build anywhere else and reshape your banking  experience the way you want it."</em> Providing me with what I need to know in 5 seconds or less, setting the tone for our relationship, and planting a seed in my mind regarding what bunq is all about. bunq's business objective is pretty clear. I don't have to hunt around, and my profiling of the Fintech platform is already off to a good start.</p>
<h3>Overview Details</h3>
<p>The bunq profiling begins with three key links, that put you on the home page for bunq, introduce you to what they are all about with their about page, or land you directly in their developer portal, letting you quickly get up to speed on what is possible when you integrate bunq into an application.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/">Website</a> - The website for bunq.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/about-us">About</a> - The about page for bunq.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/api/developer">Developers</a> - The developer portal for bunq.</li>
</ul>
<p>You quickly get an idea for what bunq does across these three pages. It allowed me to immediately get up to speed on what they do, and understand the scope of investment they've made in their platform. Employing the three most common building blocks to help on-board new API consumers to their banking platform.</p>
<h3>Company Tag Cloud</h3>
<p>As I profiled bunq I worked to apply a set of meaningful tags to the profile, which I use to organize and make the API available as part of my research. These tags are applied by me as I work my way through the website, providing some useful dimensions for considering where bunq fits in with the overall API economy--here are the tags I applied to bunq, helping illustrate what it is that they deliver.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bunq_company_tag_cloud.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>These help me define the entity behind each API. It is a taxonomy that will evolve over time as my taxonomy continues to expand and contract to accomodate the landscape I'm seeing. They provide a rich set of tags we can use to understand the value the bunq platform provides, allowing us to pick and choose which dimeinsion is the most meaningful to what we are looking to accomplish as an API consumer.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Next I went through bunq's API documentation looking for some of the common building blocks that should exist for all API providers. bunq nails it in the area of documentation, providing mature, API definition-driven documentation that is up to date. Covering a rich set of well designed APIs that are consistent and easy to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/introduction">Documentation</a> - Documentation for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/error">Error Codes</a> - Error codes for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/headers">Headers</a> - Headers for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/8012148/S1a8zkS4?version=latest">Postman Documentation</a> - The Postman documentation for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I had to critique their approach in some way I would add that the bunq documentation could use another round of clean up and organization. It uses Swagger UI which while still relevant, but it is a little dated and doesn't provide the seamless experience across all areas of the documentation--the general information abut the API, and the interactive details for each endpoint seem a little at odds with one another.</p>
<h3>API Tag Cloud</h3>
<p>The tag cloud for the company paints an important picture of what bunq does, but I always find that the actual design of the API tends to add another critical layer to what is possible. Getting down to the technical details of what bunq can do, providing us with another rich set of tags that are directly associated with what each individual API path can deliver.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bunq_api_tag_cloud.png" alt="" width="100%" />I find the API design to be a more honest view of what is happening than the general marketing. It isn't always as coherent as the marketing materials, but it provides a nice snapshot of what is truly possible at the ground level. I think that bunq has a pretty sophisticated and rich set of API resources, representing a pretty relevant slice of the Fintech landscape.</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>bunq's access reflects what all modern APIs should do. They give you a 30 day free trial, and allow you to quickly sign up and get access to the API. Being transparent about the business of their API, and providing a very simple and elegant self-service registration workflow to on-board with their API.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/signup">Self-Service Registration</a> - The self-service registration location for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The business model for bunq is pretty straightforward. I have to admit though, I did get stuck on the sign-process entering in my six digit code, it just kept telling me my code was incorrect. However, with the amount of resources bunq provides it didn't stop me from conducting my profiling of their API--I'll get into my account and round off this research later.</p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>It is easy to find information about authentication for the bunq API, with a simple overview of how developers can authentication for the banking API platform, including the details of how to put OAuth to work. Authentication is the top friction point for developers who are on-boarding with an API and bunq does a good job of walking you through what is needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/authentication">Authentication</a> - The authentication information for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/oauth">OAuth</a> -  The oAuth information for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>bunq's OAuth is pretty straightforward, providing the expected security for a banking API, while giving developers what they need to authenticate then authorize users of their applicaitons. They do a good job of distilling the information down and giving you what you need to authenticate with the platform without overwhelming you with too much information like many API provides are guilty of.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>bunq nails it when it comes to API definitions for their banking API. They have both OpenAPI and Postman collections for their platform. Making it dead simple to get up and running using their Swagger UI documentation, or within the Postman platform--providing us with a blueprint for how all API providers should be defining the APIs they are making available.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-definitions/openapi/30773-2019-10-25-18-26-13.json">OpenAPI</a> - An OpenAPI for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.postman.com/collections/8012148-2a401c1b-b64c-41d7-b0ba-e3f26c0a6a7a-S1a8zkS4">Postman Collection</a> - A Postman Collection for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bunq/postman">Postman on GitHub</a> - The Postman collection managed on GitHub for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to highlight here that bunq manages their Postman collection on Github. Making it something that they can manage alongside their other code and artifacts, but done in a way that allows anyone to also fork and put to use in their own API workflows. This is a healthy pattern I actively encourage other API proviers to follow, and would recocmend that bunq also does this for their OpenAPI definitions as well, keeping all definitions open and accessible, while also managed using version control.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>When it comes to the code-assist, I'd say bunq could invest more in some additional language libraries and SDKs. They provide four separate language resources when it comes to supporting consumers. With the quality of the API definition, it wouldn't take much to produce additional languages going beyond the three current GitHub repositories available.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bunq/sdk_php">PHP</a> - PHP resources for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bunq/sdk_python">Python</a> - Python resources for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bunq/sdk_java">Java</a> - Java resources for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bunq/sdk_csharp"><strong>cSharp</strong></a> -&nbsp;cSharp resources for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/8012148/S1a8zkS4?version=latest">You can find code snippets available for the bunq Postman documentation available in 7 different languages</a>, but I'd say that more investment in the area of code-enablement for developers would have a significant impact on on-boarding bunq developers. I'd also consider investing in more mobile development kits (MDK), and platform development kits (PDK), going beyond just language specific resources.</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>bunq has a very nice application marketplace for developers to submit their application, making it really easy to get exposure for you build on to of the banking APIs. bunq has two critical building blocks for showcasing what gets built on top of their platform, engaging with the community to build a banking application marketplace.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apps.bunq.com/">Applications</a> - Applications for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.bunq.com/apps/submit#app">Add Applications</a> - Add application for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application marketplace for bunq is simple and well done. It reflects the baseline application showcase / marketplace that all API providers should invest in. Providing a necessary outlet for their developers when it comes helping them reach a wider audience, while also showcasing to newer developers what is possible with the bunq API.</p>
<h3>Orchestration</h3>
<p>When it comes to API orchestration, and allowing developers to move data around in real-time, and respond to different events, bunq has only one building block. Providing webhooks, or as they call them callbacks, for push information when a variety of events occur on the banking API platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/callbacks">Callbacks</a> - Callbacks for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>bunq provides a pretty lengthy list of event types in which API consumers can tune into, and receive notifications for. It is a pretty simple, yet effective approach to helping make the platform more real time, while also keeping the API interfaces simple and consumble by the widest possible audience--allowing all users to stay informed of the most meaningful events that occur via their bunq integrations.</p>
<h3>Business</h3>
<p>bunq gets straight to business when it comes to the pricing for their platform. You can sign up for a 30 day trial, and the pricing for everything is front and center on the prominent pricing page. bunq even take things up a notch by offering an affiliate program for developers to tap into when it comes to getting a share of the revenue generated through the business they send bunqs way.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/pricing">Pricing</a> - Pricing for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/affiliates">Affiliates</a> - Affiliate information for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pricing for bunq is very straightforward, with detail pages available for each of their memberships levels (<a href="https://www.bunq.com/pricing/business">Business</a>, <a href="https://www.bunq.com/pricing/premium">Premium</a>, <a href="https://www.bunq.com/pricing/joint">Joint</a>, <a href="https://www.bunq.com/pricing/travel-card">Travel Card</a>). The API supports access to each customers account via OAuth, requiring each user to have their own bunq membership level, while also providing revenue opportunities for developers via the bunq affiliate program.</p>
<h3>Legal</h3>
<p>When it comes to the legal department bunq provides the bare minimum required for operating a platform today, publishing the terms of service, as well as the privacy policy that governs developers, as well as end users.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/legal">Terms of Service</a> - Terms of service for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/legal/en/20190903_Privacy_Statement_EN.pdf">Privacy Policy</a> - Privacy policy for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these two building blocks are sufficient, I'd recommend more investment in service level agreements (SLA), transparency reports, licensing and other common legal building blocks that leading API providers use to govern their operations.</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>bunq has a pretty straightforward approach to supporting the platform, with a general support page, in-application channels, and emails to allow developers to get support from the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/contact">Support</a> - Support informtion for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Support at bunq is also conducted via social media channels outlined below in my list of external resources. So while their support offering might look a little thin, they go all in on the social channels where users already exist.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>bunq provides a modern informative, and up to date blog to help keep their platform up to date, breaking down their stories into a handful of categories including products &amp; services, fintech, lifestyle, company, and business insights.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/blog">Blog</a> - The blog for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/bunq-developers-corner">Developer Blog</a> - Medium developer blog for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/updates">Updates</a> - Updates for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://beta.doc.bunq.com/basics/changelog">Change Log</a> - A change log for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to support, the communication area might look like a short list, but because of the social media channels listed under external resources, bunq is clearly engaged when it comes to communicating with their community.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>There are a handful of resources provided by bunq, acknolwedging that it won't just be developers showing up to learn about the platform, and providing resources that help spread the word about what the platform is up to.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/press">Press</a> - Press for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/press/kit">Press Kit</a> - Press kit for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would recommend expanding the number of resources available to developers and non-developers in this area. Providing more white papers, case studies, tutorials, webinars, and other resources that help developers be more successful.</p>
<h3>External Resources</h3>
<p>When it comes to providing a diverse set of support and communication channels, bunq has checked all the boxes. Making sure their platform has a presence on all the core platforms necesary for getting the word out about an API, but also done in a way that helps you expand and stay engaged with your community.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bunq">GitHub</a> - GitHub for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/bunq">Twitter</a> - Twitter for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bunq/">LinkedIn</a> - LinkedIn for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bunq">Crunchbase</a> - Crunchbase for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bunq/">Facebook</a> - Facebook for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://apievangelist.com/network/providers/bunq/Medium - https://medium.com/bunq">Medium</a> - Medium for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bunq/?hl=en">Instagram</a> - Instagram for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bunq">Wikipedia</a> - Wikipedia for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that the number of external resources present, as well as the activity on each of these channels provides me with important signals regarding the health and velocity of the bunq API. bunq reflects not just how SaaS providers are operating their business, but also how succesful API providers are getting business done on the web.</p>
<h3>Virtualization</h3>
<p>I was very happy to see a sandbox for bunq. I feel pretty strongly that sandboxes should be default for all APIs, but especially for heavily regulated industries like banking. In adition to a sandbox environment, bunq also provides an Android emulator for helping developers build mobile applications more easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bunq.com/api/psd2-sandbox">Sandbox</a> - A sandbox for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/android-emulator">Emulator</a> - An Android emulator for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtualization  is valuable for helping developers be more confident when developing against APIs  and learning about what is possible without having to work with sensitve data. An additional thing to note is that bunq's sandbox is PSD2 compliant, demonstrating the importance of API virtualization for not just API providers, but also for entire industries like banking, and the regulatory process.</p>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>When it comes to API discovery, I was pleasantly surprised to see how much bunq has invested in making sure their APIs are found. I feel that bunq's approach to API discovery is worth highlighting all by itself, and will be writing a separate story on it, helping shine a light on how API discovery is finally thawing after many years of limited growth--bunq has invested in these areas when it comes to API discovery.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/company/bunq">ProgrammableWeb</a> - ProgrammableWeb for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://rapidapi.com/bunq/api/bunq">RapidAPI</a> - RapidAPI for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://apilist.fun/api/bunq-api">API List</a> - API List for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/BankOrCreditUnion">Schema.org</a> - Schema.org for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bunq/postman">Postman on GitHub</a> - The Postman collection managed on GitHub for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://explore.postman.com/api/1655">Postman Network</a> - The Postman network page for the bunq API.</li>
<li><a href="https://explore.postman.com/team/423451">Postman Team</a> - The Postman team page for the bunq API.</li>
</ul>
<p>bunq's usage of OpenAPI as well as Postman is pretty forward thinking, and when you consider how they publish a JSON-LD to identify their API as a Schema.org BankorCreditUnion, their approach is worthy of showcasing. Using JSON-LD + Schema.org is not something I see very often, but it is something I would like for all API providers to be doing--overall, bunq gets pretty high marks when it comes to the API discovery portion of my profiling.</p>
<h3>In Summary</h3>
<p>While I can always recommend additional building blocks for API providers like bunq, I have to note that their approach is not only robust, it is precise. I can definitely recommend that they invest more into case studies and other resources, but bunq really nails all of the essential building blocks for me, while also investing in some forward leaning stuff like API discovery, virtualization, and orchestration. As far as a profiling goes, the bunq approach to their APIs reaches what I consider to be a blueprint standard--meaning that it is a profile I would hold up as an example that other API providers should consider following.</p>
<p>There are always things that can be improved upon with each API provider I profile, but the goal is always to make sure you are investing in all the right areas. bunq does this well. I'm impressed with their approach. I will spend more time playing around with the bunq platform, updating my profile about what they do, and will also consider crafting a formal banking API industry blueprint from their approach. I have to admit, I'm not overly excited by banking APIs, but I am very interested in how fintech companies like bunq are pushing forward the banking API conversation in Europe, North America , and Asia.</p>

<p>My friend James Higginbotham had a really nice example of using <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> in a talk I saw him give the other day. It was one of those things that jumpstarted my desire to showcase different ways of using the machine readable API discovery format. I still use APIs.json heavily in my <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a> and search efforts, but not something I've been really good at maintaining as a spec, and telling stories about. I'm working to remedy this, so thanks to James I'm pulling different examples of how to use APIs.json from my research.</p>
<p>One example I wanted to use is out of Slack. So I pulled my most recent APIs.json index for Slack, and made sure it was updated with the latest building blocks, which included an OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman collection, and JSON Schema. Providing a diverse example of how you can use APIs.json as an index for your API infrastructure. <a href="https://github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs">Slack has an OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema available on GitHub</a>, but to round off the index I wanted to make sure there was also a Postman collection present.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/b2d68bbeeda6ac585e16de5b2a1db187.js"></script>
<p>First off, I am painfully reminded of the irony in the name of APIs.json coupled with the fact that I'm using YAML. I prefer the readability of YAML when it comes to storytelling, Beyond this, you can see I have two separate APIs indexed, along with a set of common building blocks of the operations supporting the two APIs. Demonstrating how APIs.json doesn't copete with OpenAPI, Postman collections, or AsyncAPI, it actually compliments it and provides a way of indexing multiple types of APIs that are working in concert.</p>
<p>I am working to update the APIs.json website, and put some more energy into the specification. You'll notice I use a lot of vendor extensions to reflect where I'd like to be going next with the API discovery format. Right now, I am just looking to showcase how it can be used as an index of your API operations. Next, I want to continue borrowing from my friend James, and add <a href="http://alps.io/">an ALPS profile</a> for these APIs, going beyond describing the underlying objects that JSON Schema defines, and describing the capabilities of the Slack API. Adding another rich dimension to <a href="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/b2d68bbeeda6ac585e16de5b2a1db187">the Slack API index</a>, providing a robust set of artifacts that can be used to discover, document, and integrate with the Slack API.</p>

<p>I had someone email me a question the other day, asking about how they should respond when someone asks them why APIs are a better choice that using a direct ODBC / JDBC database connection. Before I wrote a piece on it I wanted to tap my network of API geeks to see what other opinions might be lurking out there. My network is always a good place to start when it comes to looking for relevant, experienced answers.</p>

<p>I definitely agree with my network on this. Seeing an API as simply database access is a very limited understanding of what APIs are capable of. The key word being "capability" here. It is natural for developers to begin their journey with simple Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) APIs, but it really is the 101 of what APIs are capable of. As my network says, APIs aren't about the data being stored on the backend, it is about access to that data, sharing it, interactions with it, and the capabilities this data makes possible--this is why thoughtful API design is so critical to APIs having the impact we envision.</p>
<p>ODBC / JDBC is about connecting to data stores. It isn't about realizing message-based system interactions as James articulates. API interactions are much more than the data exhaust produced when putting these API capabilities to work. API requests, events, and streams are not simply database queries. Sure, they can possess many of the same characteristics as a database query, but this is a pretty limited, and unimaginative view of how API design shapes how desktop, web, mobile, and device applications do what they do--going well beyond what has been capable with ODBC / JDBC integrations.</p>
<p>Going neyond what many database-centered folks will see as just see as philosophical differences, until they actually spend time delivering modern APIs, I feel that I should discuss some of the more tangible benefits of APIs--exploring other areas where APIs go beyond what you can do with ODBC / JDBC.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - You have more authentication standards available for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - It is more secure to abstract away the database driving your apps.</li>
<li><strong>Entitlements</strong> - There is more flexibility in defining who has access to which APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong> - APIs allow for more fine grain rate limiting for access to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Transformations</strong> - You can more easily transform calls made to each individual API.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - There are more analysis opportunities available at the API layer.</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong> - You can improve efficiency by caching API responses using HTTP.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the more tangible benefits of going API over direct ODBC / JDBC integration. APIs reflect the current web-based world we live in, and providing direct database access by applications over the web doesn't reflect this modern reality. With APIs, we have much more visibility and observability into this layer of our application, going beyond anything we've had with direct application to database integrations. The awareness that has come from this shift in how we deliver the capabilities we need in our applications has allowed us to define and deliver entirely new types of products we couldn't realize at the database connector layer.</p>
<p>I have over 30 years of experience as a database administrator and developer. What caught my attention between 2006 and 2010 while using web APIs wasn't just about everything listed here. It was also about bringing me out of my database silo and forcing me to be closer to the business solutions I was looking to provide on top of my databases using APIs. Forever changing how I engage with application developers and end-users, helping me be able to see entirely new ways of doing business, and establish an awareness of how business resources can be put to work--developing an awareness I never was able to establish from building applications directly on top databases.</p>

<p>I was profiling <a href="/admin/blog/I was profiling the banking API bunq over the weekend and noticed they were managing their Postman collections on GitHub. I have long been an advocate for API providers to manage OpenAPI and Swagger on GitHub, and managing as they would any other piece of code or machine readable artifact. Anytime I find API providers like the New York Times https:/apievangelist.com/2017/03/01/new-york-times-manages-their-openapi-using-github/, Box https:/apievangelist.com/2017/05/22/box-goes-all-in-on-openapi/, and Slack https:/github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs, I make sure and try to write a post showcasing the practices, so other API providers will consider following the lead.

<p>I am a big fan of there being many versatile and competiting API definitions that describe many different dimensions of how we put APIs to work. I hear folks say that they'd prefer to have one single API definition format to rule them all, which is something I think is short-sighted, lazy, and something that accomodates the future we want, not the one we need. I'm always eager to learn about new API definition formats, and always wiling to support new ones if they help us better define, communicate, and execute the APIs in our lives.</p>
<p>One API definition I am increasingly using in my regular operations, and realizing the importance is the <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/environments-and-globals/manage-environments/">Postman environment format</a>, which is a portable machine readable format you can use in unlimited ways. Within the Postman platform you can define one or many Postman environments, and use them across your workspace and collections. Postman environments are simply a list of key value pairs that can be use to define variables in use across the request elements of the API calls you are making. Which can then be outputted as a simple JSON definition, and then published, shared, and used in API services and tooling.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/c987b8ad351c1e5829bb6f49bcbe62f6.js"></script>
<p>Any variable defined within an environment can be referenced as part of each request header, path, query, or body parameter, and used within pre-response scripts. Defining and standardizing the values we use across our API calls, allowing us to pre-populate values we employ, and managing the secrets we employ as part of API authentication. Allowing us to iterate upon the environments we employ, evolving and shifting how we put APIs to work with small variations and iterations in our enviornments.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/39a707fea0c2de549178ed5d0145413e.js"></script>
<p>Once I have my environments defined, I can apply them by placing variables within each API request. Putting  in headers, and , , and other  within each API request. Which allows me to quickly switch environments to make different API requests without having to change each individual API request. Making environments a pretty flexible way of defining environments for API design, development, QA, and production. Making each API request dynamic, with the static data being passed in as part of a suite of well-defined and organized API environments.</p>
<p>Employing environments have shifted how I design my APIs, and how I define my core API reference definitions. It has also forced me to begin developing a strategy for developing, managing, and evolving my API environments. You can manage environments via the Postman platform, organizing them across workspaces and teams, as well as programmatically manipulate via the Postman API. I'm also exploring different ways of managing them purely as JSON and YAML via GitHub repositories, helping me more dynamically generate, aggregate, and manipulate outside of the Postman platform. Making environments an increasingly critical aspect of how I work with APIs, and think about my API consumption.</p>
<p>I see API environments as a critical API definition building block. While environments are born out of Postman, I see them as being much bigger than just existing as a Postman feature, and a construct and schema that all API providers should be investing in, helping API consumers be more successful, efficient, and flexible in what they are trying to accomplish. I'd like to see API environments used against both Postman collections and OpenAPI, and tooling and services emerge to help API consumers keep this dimension of their API definition world in order, and right at your fingertips like Postman does. You'll see me increasingly prioritize API environments in my API storytelling, not just because I'm working at Postman, but because they are essential to helping move the API definition conversation forward.</p>

Evaluating the dedicated pages API providers publish, working to better understand what the building blocks these providers are using to highlight how they make their open source projects available, as well as being more transparent about the open source tooling they are using as well. Out of this I&rsquo;m looking to have a single blueprint I can share with folks, breaking down the moving parts of an open source initiative for an API provider or service provider.</p>
<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2019/10/29/20-open-source-landing-pages-from-leading-api-providers/">After looking through 20 separate open source pages for leading API providers</a>, here are the building blocks of an open source page I&rsquo;ve identified.</p>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>FMA - Tag Line</strong> - Simple phrase describing open source at an organization.</li>
<li><strong>Mission / Purpose</strong> - Stating the purpose of doing open source.</li>
<li><strong>Influential Quotes</strong> - Sharing quotes with influential stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Why Open Source? </strong>- Explaining the reason why an organization is doing it.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong> -- <a href="https://opensource.google/docs/">Google has robust overview</a> of how they do open source.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Core:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects</strong> - Open source projects owned by the organization.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Party</strong> - External open source project being used.</li>
<li><strong>Categories</strong> - Breaking projects down by simple categories.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/open-source-pages/paypal.png"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/open-source-pages/paypal.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<h3>Communication:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Having a blog or channel dedicated the open source efforts.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong> - Using Github to host page, projects, and communicate.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Using Twitter as a social media communication channel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Support:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forum</strong> - Providing a forum for supporting open source efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong> - Establishing a feedback form for users take advantage of.</li>
<li><strong>Contributing</strong> - Providing guidelines for how the community can contribute.</li>
<li><strong>Talk to Expert </strong>- Offer up a way fr the community to talk with experts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - Ensuring there is a way to search across open source offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Stars</strong> - Exposing the stars for projects derived from GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Forks</strong> - Exposing the number of times a projects has been forked on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/open-source-pages/intuit.png"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/open-source-pages/intuit.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<h3>Innovation:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incubator</strong> - Providing details on a project incubation program.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong> - Sharing research involved within projects being operated.</li>
<li><strong>Podcast</strong> - Offering a regular podcast series covering open source.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talent:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Careers</strong> - Providing a listing of available jobs involved with organization.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong> - Showcasing the team behind the open source offering.</li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong> - Publish a form that users can submit to apply for jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legal:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terms of Service </strong>- Publishing terms of service governing open source.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong> - Publishing a privacy policy governing open source.</li>
<li><strong>Code of Conduct</strong> - Publishing a code of conduct governing open source.</li>
</ul>
<p>That provides a pretty robust list of the elements any organization can consider when publishing their own open source page supporting the platform, and showcasing the contributions being made back to an organization&rsquo;s own community, as well as the communities of existing open source offerings. Helping improve the brand image for an organization, and encourage more participation in helping move forward individual open source projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend companies showcase the open source projects they are putting to work in their platform, even if they aren&rsquo;t moving forward their own projects. The open source tools you depend on will appreciate the attention, and it will help you think about the bigger picture when it comes to the tooling you depend on. If you do have your own open source projects, it helps elevate the conversation to aggregate all of your projects onto a single page, and link prominently from your website. There are numerous benefits to having an organized open source effort, but the top two reasons I&rsquo;m seeing are to help improve the overall brand image, and for talent acquisition&mdash;two things that almost every API provider will benefit from.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of all API providers who offer sandboxes, and providing synthetic APIs, data, and other resources. It should be the default operating mode for anyone offering a public API, but it is definitely a requirement of providers who operate in regulated industries. With this in mind I am always on the hunt for sandboxes to showcase as I&rsquo;m profiling APIs, so I was pleased to find <a href="https://www.bunq.com/api/psd2-sandbox">a sandbox for banking API provider bunq</a>, and impressed to learn it was also a PSD2 compliant sandbox&mdash;meeting the requirements of the EU banking API standard.<br /><br />As a PSD2 service provider, either an Account Information Service Provider (AISP) or Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP), you will need a license from your local supervisor, and your unique electronic identification, authentication and trust services (eIDAS) certificate number to start using the PSD2-compliant bunq API in production. To help jumpstart developers, bunq provides their PSD2 compliant sandbox where you can generate a pseudo certificate, and get to work developing your application on top of the bunq sandbox API.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.bunq.com/api/developer">The bunq PSD2 sandbox API</a> provides different interaction abilities based upon your role, adding another interesting dimension to the sandbox, targeting specific personas defined by the EU banking regulation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Information Service Provider (AISP) </strong>- With AISP you get to read account information like: legal name, IBAN, nationality, card validity data, account balance and transaction history.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) -</strong> With PISP you can read account information including legal name and IBAN. You can also initiate payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/psd2">providing documentation for PSD2 service providers</a>, bunq also provides <a href="https://doc.bunq.com/#/moving-to-production">documentation for helping service providers move to production</a> once they have successfully developed and tested their application against the sandbox API. Providing a pretty solid look at how an API provider can operate a sandbox, but also an example of how industry API standards and regulation can be emulated within sandbox environments, helping standardize how industry compliant applications are developed.<br /><br />I am adding bunq to the list of PSD2 APIs that I showcase. I&rsquo;m also adding the industry compliant sandbox as a building block to my research. It provides a pretty important example of how API sandboxes can be used in service of not just the standardization of APIs, but the standardization of them in service of regulatory forces. An API sandbox is a critical building block for API providers, helping them virtualize APIs and data for developers. Making it easier to confidently develop applications on top of APIs, without the concern of having to work with production data, increasing the chance that mistakes might be made.</p>

<p>I am at <a href="https://www.vonage.com/campus/">the Vonage Campus event today in San Francisco</a> listening to a variety of talks from their team and partners. As I&rsquo;m listening I can&rsquo;t help but <a href="https://developer.nexmo.com/">play around with their APIs</a>, and explore what is possible. It is easy to try out the SMS via the Nexmo documentation, but I wanted to create a more portable, sharable way of sending an SMS that anyone can use&mdash;even a non-developer. This gives me a chance to play around with Next more, while also crafting Postman collections that I can include in my catalog of simple, usable APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/overview">Nexmo provides a pretty straightforward API for sending SMS</a>, with a basic set of properties for who the message is to, who it is from, and the body of the message. There are other parameters you can include, and of course you have to pass in your API key and secret, but overall it is a pretty simple, straightforward API that anyone can put to work.</p>

<p>To help me learn more about the Nexmo API while also providing a usable example that anyone can run I published <a href="https://www.postman.com/collections/f0a2143915bc08419b7e">a Nexmo Postman collection</a>, as well as a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/nexmo/master/nexmo.environment.json">Postman environment</a>. You can import into your Postman client or use the Run in Postman button below. You will have to <a href="https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up">sign up for your own Nexmo API key</a>, add add your key and secret to the Postman environment, but once you have you should be able to send an SMS to any number you choose.</p>
<p>I will be creating more Postman collections for other Nexmo APIs, publishing them individually, as well as publishing a complete collection containing all of them when I am done. I want the individual Postman collections for referencing within specific stories, but I also want the entire collection for indexing all the capabilities of the telco API provider. If there are any particular Nexmo APIs you&rsquo;d like to see published, please let me know, and I&rsquo;m happy to fire up a collection to help make your work easier.</p>

<p>I am spending time understanding how API providers have invested in their open source offerings. Mapping out which leading API providers have dedicated pages for showcasing not only the open source they are building, but also the open source tools they are putting to work within their platforms. As I do with all of my API research I am looking to learn as much as I can from the approach of existing API leaders, and distill it down as part of the stories I tell, and work I'm doing at Postman and with partners.</p>
<p>To help me get an understanding of what is happening, I took a sampling of top API providers from my database, and got to work profiling their apporach to showcasing the open source they build and put to use--here is what I'm seeing at first glance.</p>

<p>These 20 API providers offer up a bunch of lessons for me when it comes to showcasing open source as part of their operations. Next I will be going through each of these pages and documenting the common building blocks in use, and assemble a master list of elements other API providers should think about when it comes to showcasing their open source offerings. Helping demonstrate that API providers aren't just about APIs, and they also actively invest in giving back with open source.</p>
<p>I have always tracked on open source pages for the API I profile, but it hasn't really been a priority. I'm going to bump it up in priority, and eventually publish an industry guide for other API providers to use when planning their own open source showcase. I know that many of my readers would rather have a checklist they can use when planning their own efforts, and have a list of links to click on when looking for inspiration from API providers they already respect.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/salesforce_rest_api_developer_guide.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I regularly find myself shining a spotlight on <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/quickstart.htm">the SalesForce API</a>, holding it up as an example of why APIs matter. They are the OG API pioneer, and 20 years later they are still rocking it with their APIs. With that said, their API approach is in desperate need of some modernization. I don&rsquo;t want to shame the folks operating things now, they&rsquo;ve done a great job, but as someone who looks at a lot of APIs, every time I have to roll up my sleeves and implement an integration with SalesForce, I find it all to be much more cumbersome than it should to be.<br /><br />After almost 20 years, the value is evident within the SaleSforce REST API, but there are so many other supporting APIs, SDKs, and other resources, that the core Force.com REST API seems to get lots in the shuffle. Not that my opinion matters all that much, but I wanted to take a few moments to share my views, in hopes someone at SalesForce might read this, or at the very least help other API think more deeply about how to keep their APIs modern and useful for their consumers--here are a handful of things I&rsquo;d suggest the SalesForce developer community consider as they look towards the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information</strong> - I have integrated with SalesForce over 50 times, and even though I know what I need, I always get lost wading through the volume of information that exists within the developer portal. It takes me a click, a significant amount of scrolling, and a second click to get to the REST API documentation that I need. I get it, there is an amazing number of resources available, but I&rsquo;m afraid the core value of the Force.com REST API gets lost in the shuffle. I know what I need and I get lost, I can only imagine how confusing it is for new developers.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - The OAuth implementation and documentation is just too verbose. I can always find the core set of values I need to configure when setting up my application, but finding where and how to do it usually takes me about 1-2 hours each time I have to setup OAuth. Take a look at the OAuth approach for other leading API providers, then get to work distilling things down, making it dead simple to add an application, and know how to setup, then put the more detailed information one-click behind the scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> - While extremely robust, the design of the SalesForce API is pretty old school. Calling everything sObject, and making us all look up our objects to build our own paths is a pretty dated approach to getting things done. <a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/35240/SVzua1S6?version=latest#intro">Take a look at the Postman Collection I&rsquo;ve created where I&rsquo;ve merged the objects with the API paths</a>, making things much more intuitive to new users who might not get what all this sObject talk is about. Once you know how things work you eventually find your way, but the challenge for me always is introduced when I have to put down for a while, come back, and re-learn all of the complexities&mdash;the design of the API should just do this work for me.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - The documentation for the API is too verbose, and takes too many clicks to get through it all. I recommend modernizing the API documentation by maintaining your own Postman collection or OpenAPI definition and publish more modern API documentation from these machine readable artifacts. Invest the time and energy in crafting short, concise, and meaningful summaries and descriptions for each path, and make sure they have all the properties, enums, and other elements well defined and kept up to date.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stop there. I could go on for days, but I feel like if SalesForce invested in these four areas it would completely transform their API on boarding and integration process. This all could be done without impact the evolution and delivery of the API, just change up how you present what is possible. Then you could get to work standardizing this approach across all of the available SalesForce API. I can&rsquo;t help but think that if the presentation for the core Force.com REST API was simplified and brought front and center within the portal, it would change the entire tone of the community. There is so much value in there that could be brought out pretty easily with some information architecture, and leverage modern API definitions and documentation publishing solutions.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m not saying you should get rid of all the rich documentation that exists, just don&rsquo;t make me wade through it all when integrating with the SalesForce API. Just give me exactly what I need to sign up for an account, setup authentication, and get to work integrating with all the available APIs. If I want more information I will go find it. I recommend the SalesForce API team go spend time within the developer portals of other modern APIs like Stripe, Twilio and others, then invest some cycles in modernizing your approach. I get it, you&rsquo;ve spent years publishing documentation, and evolving the API to meet the needs of your massive developer community&mdash;it can be hard to see the forest for the trees. However, I think with just a little modernization effort, you could reach an entirely new audience, and power entirely new applications and integrations, reducing friction for developers when it comes to understanding what is possible, allowing them to go from zero to sixty in as little time as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, <a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/35240/SVzua1S6?version=latest#intro">you can visit the documentation I've published for the SalesForce API</a>, demonstrating how a little design can be applied to the APIs and make them a little more approachable and usable. You can also use the run in Postman button on the documentation, or <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/salesforce/blob/master/README.md">put to use, help evolve, and fork Postman Collection and OpenAPI definitions for the SalesForce API on GitHub</a>--if you have any questions, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/salesforce/issues">submit GitHub issue on the repository</a>.</p>

<p>I process a lot of API documentation, trying to make sense of what each API does. As I wade through the human and machine generated API documentation for the different APIs I am profiling I am reminded that more information isn&rsquo;t always better when it comes to getting started with an API. When it comes to understanding what is possible with each API, it is more meaningful to begin making API calls and seeing results than it is read lengthy descriptions about what is possible. Especially when it is rambling technical speak that doesn&rsquo;t provide you with any sort of narrative about what is happening, often leaving me more confused than when I first stumbled across an API in the first place.<br /><br />I know it may seem like more information is better, but most of the time developers will just need a summary of an API that is less than 50 characters, and a description that is less than 250 characters. The path, parameters, headers, body, and resulting response should tell the rest of the story. If you have to list too many parameters, enumerators, and write a chapter about what is possible with a single API path, then you probably need to spend more time refining the design of the API. I just don&rsquo;t have the time to read multiple paragraphs about what each API path does, I want the design of the API request and response to tell the story for me in a standardized way that makes sense.<br /><br />Take the time to think about your consumers when writing your API documentation. Better yet, rely on the schema for OpenAPI, Postman collections, and other machine readable definitions to provide the constraints necessary to distill down the human readable portions of your API definitions. Both of these API definition formats provide you with a limited about of space to tell your story, and populate what is needed for publishing coherent API documentation. Pushing you to fill in the blanks with short concise descriptions of what each API path and verb delivers, allowing you to lean on the specifications when it comes to dialing in how you describe your API capabilities.<br /><br />Our APIs should always be as precise as they can be. So should the documentation and other resources we provide to support hem. We should always be working to refine how we speak about what our APIs do. This is one of the reason for establishing feedback loops like blogs, road maps, and social media accounts supporting our APIs, so that we can be regularly thinking about how we communicate about our APIs, done in a way that allows for other stakeholders to respond, critiquing our approach, and pushing us to be more coherent in how we talk about our APIs. The more we talk about our APIs, the better we will get at talking about them. Pushing us to be more thoughtful, informative, and precise in how we design, document, and tell stories about what our APIs do, helping us make them more approachable by our consumers.</p>

<p>One difficulty I have telling stories across the API lifecycle involves the separation of stops along the API life cycle that are about each individual API, and those that are about serving the entire operation--all APIs. There is a relationship between the two, but there are many different ways in which you can help educate developers, and provide instruction depending on whether it is just about a single API, or something that supports all APIs. One key aspect of standardizing how APIs are brought to life is to make sure you are always thinking about the big picture, while also ensuring each individual API has what it needs.<br /><br />It is common for API developers to think about their immediate needs when designing, developing, delivering, ad supporting an API. It takes a lot more work to make sure that the things which can be reused and replicated across APIs are identified. It usually takes someone paying attention to the bigger picture, helping connect the dots, and lending a hand in helping developers work together and follow standards that have been set to help insure quality, consistency, along the way. Helping identify common patterns in use, documenting them, and then working to educate, disseminate, and incentivize their usage and adoption. Turning healthy practices into well-defined stops along the API life cycle, and minimizing the unique special snowflake status of each individual API we deliver.<br /><br />Letting API developers operate in isolation is how we end up with many different kinds of APIs, across different teams and groups. If you have ever used a large public API provider like Google, Amazon, or Azure, you&rsquo;ve noticed that not all the APIs are designed the same. While there may be similarities across them, there are often little difference that can cause friction all along the way, resulting in challenges for developers when building their applications. I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to help developers see the big picture beyond what they are working on, which is why I like my storytelling to properly straddle both dimensions of the API life cycle, while also helping my readers expand their view of landscape, and how sharing and reuse of API patterns can help them be more efficient now, and in the future. <br /><br />This post is just a gentle reminder for me to thinking about this duality in the world of APIs as I write blog posts, crafting white papers, and produce webinars, tutorials, workshops, and talks. I want to invest in helping API developers be more successful in what they are doing, while also contributing to the bigger picture. The trick is helping them understand that this isn&rsquo;t just about giving them more work, and it is about helping them make things as painless as possible for their consumers, while also being more efficient at delivering kick-ass APIs. I&rsquo;d say that 75% of API development should be about reusing existing patterns, and about 20% uniqueness, with maybe around 5% giving back with new patterns that should be considered for wider adoption. Developers should be heavily focused on learning and reusing patterns over creating anything new or special&mdash;I am interested in making sure my storytelling reflects this reality.</p>

title: 'Embedding JSON-LD To Power API Discovery'

<p>If you have been in charge of operating a public API you know how hard it is to get your APIs found. One important way you can increase the discoverability of your API is by embedding <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> into the HTML for your API portal, and describing your API resources using <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. While this is something that all API providers should be doing, it is something that is still pretty rare in the wild, so anytime I come across a real world implementation, I make sure and showcase. My most recent example of using JSON-LD and Schema.org in the wild comes from <a href="https://www.bunq.com/">the banking API platform bunq</a>.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/204a742b0927edb582f4ac7f3d287f87.js"></script>
<p>bunq is a banking API that represents the future of banking in my opinion. bunq gets APIs, and understands how to do them well. Their API is well designed, and their developer portal is full of all the essential building blocks you need to successfully operate an API. To help make the bunq API more discoverable, bunq has embedded a set of JSON-LD references within the HTML for their website, providing Schema.org representations for their business.</p>
<p>This JSON-LD snippet isn&rsquo;t focused particularly on their API, but it does <a href="https://schema.org/BankOrCreditUnion">designate bunq as a BankorCreditUnion</a>, and provides some additional context about their business. If I were bunq, I&rsquo;d consider adding Schema.org representations for as many of their API resources as they can. Providing more machine readable context about the potential that is available within <a href="https://www.bunq.com/api/developer">the bunq banking APIs</a>. This is something that all API providers should consider when it comes to publishing their own company website and developer portal, helping make the resources you offer more discoverable by web and API search engines.</p>
<p>In addition to publishing JSON-LD Schema.org representations for all of your API resources, I also recommend you publish one for <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/02/thoughts-on-the-schema-org-webapi-type-extension/,">the WebAPI object type</a> which is currently being evolved, and additional usage always helps evolve each schema standard. I&rsquo;d like to see more tooling emerge to help API providers craft JSON-LD Schema.org representations for publishing to their API portals. I will add to my list of work, and see if I can develop a wizard that will help walk API providers through the possible, giving them a simple set of JSON-LD snippets out the other end. This will help augment the existing work I&rsquo;m doing <a href="http://http//apisjson.org">around APIs.json</a>, and the wider discovery of APIs across the landscape, increasing the richness of my own API indexes, as well as those of other web and API search engines.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m working through my tasks each day I am always looking for ways to automate away the cumbersome portions of what I need to accomplish. I am always weighing having to manually accomplish something over being able to write a script to accomplish something. It is always tempting to think about writing a scrape script to work through a pile of research I need to gather, and engineer some crafty algorithm that will help me sort through it and make sense of it all. As I get older I&rsquo;m finding that most of the time this automation is more about laziness than it is about the power of technology, or the benefit it can bring to my work. <br /><br />I am pretty good at calculating what it will cost for me to manually tackle something versus what it will take to automate something&mdash;if it is even possible in the first place. I&rsquo;ve gone down the automation road many of time only to establish pretty quickly that something isn&rsquo;t even possible, or that the quality of the results would be much below what I could deliver if I just rolled up my sleeves and did it manually. Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned to step away from the allure of automation, but it is still something that I still find myself thinking about way too much, simmering on some automation scheme, procrastinating about how much work something is, where if I just did the task manually, I could get done in half the time.<br /><br />As I dig into my API-driven automation fantasies I usually return pretty quickly with a realization that things are more about me being lazy or a procrastinator. I hate to admit it, but I think a significant portion of my belief in technology in my desire to get out of some work, avoid a mundane task, and accomplish some meaningless thing that I&rsquo;ve convinced myself is important, when it probably is not. Often times when I do automate something I will neglect scheduling or allocating the resources need to keep things running in the future, storing data, and publishing any insights or value from the automation. Most of the times I would be better off accomplishing a one-time task manually than spending more time automating it in a way that I will rarely ever use again.<br /><br />I think I need to learn to be more honest with myself in the future about what automation is worth it and what is not. I think I need to just get more organized about specifying the work that needs to get done, and queueing things up&mdash;getting work done with good ol fashioned elbow grease. I just have too much evidence demonstrating that the ROI on automation doesn&rsquo;t always pay-off, and I need to get better at thinking things through. I&rsquo;m not talking about abandoning API automation, I&rsquo;m just talking about being more structured in how I approach getting work accomplished, and being more critical about how and what I automate. Being more of a grownup when it comes to just realizing that sometimes it will take a significant amount of one-time human effort to tackle something, and I need to save my API automation skills for when it is really needed.</p>

<p>Channeling APIs, and cranking out API content i what I do. I find it pretty easy to regularly produce a regular flow of diverse content spanning the entire API life cycle. However, one challenge I do have is making sure it is all done in a consistent way, ensuring that I&rsquo;m publishing across all stops along the API lifecycle, but also making my work available in a variety of formats. I prefer reading short and long form content as part of my regular intake of API information, but I know that other people thrive on obtaining their knowledge via different channels. Making it important for me to make sure I&rsquo;m being consistent in how I&rsquo;m measuring my output by establishing some common metrics I can use to keep track of how I am doing.<br /><br />Much of the content I produce for API Evangelist is pretty spontaneous, however it has always followed the path of my overall API research. Using the areas of research, and the stops along the API life cycle that I&rsquo;ve established over the years as a framework for the development of my storytelling. Over the years I have produced content in all of these areas, but in the future I am looking to be more deliberate and consistent in how I roll out new content, spreading things equally across the different areas of the API life cycle, but also making available in the following formats, leveraging a variety of delivery mechanisms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short Form (Blogs) - </strong>Publishing blog posts for publishing to API Evangelist, Postman, and other locations.</li>
<li><strong>Long Form (White Papers) -</strong> Producing white papers that cover every area of my API life cycle research.</li>
<li><strong>Webinars (Video) - </strong>Participating in regular webinars addressing each stop along the API lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Tutorials (Video, Audio) -</strong> Creating a regular stream of tutorials walking users through API concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Conference &amp; Meetups (Talk) -</strong> Carving out different areas of the API lifecycle to talk about in person.</li>
<li><strong>Workshops (Talk, Video) -</strong> Providing single and multiple day workshops covering the API lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Meetings (In Person, Phone, Video) -</strong> Engaging with individuals and groups in API life cycle discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the building blocks of my API evangelism, advocacy, outreach, and engagement. Providing me with some pretty straightforward delivery vehicles for my API storytelling, and a variety of tangible things that I can measure. Tracking the number of blog posts, white papers, video, audio, conferences, meetups, meetings, and calls I do on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis. I&rsquo;m not looking to live and die by the numbers, but it does helps me articulate what I&rsquo;m working on, and use as a way of tracking what I&rsquo;m producing as part of my work.<br /><br />Measuring the areas of the API lifecycle I&rsquo;m using in my API storytelling, as well as diversity in channels I&rsquo;m using is important in helping me refine my approach to storytelling, while also increasing my audience reach. It helps me steady my hand when it comes to what I&rsquo;m working on, and allows me to better articulate the direction I&rsquo;m headed to other team members. Giving me some clear goals when it comes to generating content that helps folks learn about the API life cycle, and making it available in a variety of ways, keeping things informative, consistent, and headed in a coherent direction.</p>

<p>The API landscape is huge. APIs are being used to power desktop, web, mobile, and device applications across almost every business sector. While there are many common patterns used across the leading APIs, APIs still come in many shapes and sizes, making it difficult to know where to begin when first learning about APIs. This isn&rsquo;t an exclusive situation with people who are just learning about APIs, it is the state of things for most people working with APIs on a regular basis. No matter how experienced you are with APIs, there is always some new approach emerging, and some evolution in how things are done that might just be out of view. Leaving us all struggling to keep up, stay aware of latest trends, while perpetually working master what we already know, always refining our approach to getting things done with APIs.<br /><br />Adding to the mix of complexities to articulate about the world of APIs, there are many different capacities in which you can engage with APIs. Opening up a handful of opportunities for developers, and non-developer individuals to roll up their sleeves and get involved. Many discussions around APIs will center on being an API provider, someone is making APIs available, or you are an API consumer, and you are putting APIs to work. The consumption of APIs is where most people start, but then learning about developing and operating APIs also dominates the conversation because of the commercial opportunity that has evolved over the last decade, making it a popular place to begin. Additionally, there are a handful of other doors we like to open when it comes to introducing people to APIs<br /><br /><strong>Focusing Just On Consuming APIs</strong><br />Using an API is the easiest place to begin when beginning your API journey. You are more likely to find your way forward with APIs if you get started with a single API provider, or category of APIs that align with interests you already have, helping connect your desire to learn more about APIs with things that already drive you. One of the biggest challenges with helping the API curious navigate this layer of the web, is that there are so many APIs out there. Putting the responsibility on each API curious individual to pick a handful of topics that interest them. Sit down at their favorite search engine, type in each of these words, appending the acronym API before hitting submit. Continuing your quest for knowledge about how APIs can be put to work in your daily workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover New APIs -</strong> Search for APIs online using keywords and phrases that are relevant to you will introduce you to a whole new world of how data, content, media, and other resources are made available in the layer of the web that interests you. Search, and explore the results of your API searches, then bookmark the APIs that look interesting to you. Don&rsquo;t stop with just a handful of APIs, explore many different keywords, breaking out your thesaurus to help expand your vocabulary, while also expanding your API horizon.</li>
<li><strong>Play With APIs -</strong> As you are learning about the APIs you&rsquo;ve discovered, go ahead and sign up for an account, obtain API keys, and play around with the APIs. Even if you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing, you will learn a lot along the way. Most APIs do not have limitations about who can sign up for APIs, and anyone can make an API call using client solutions like Postman, no coding necessary. </li>
<li><strong>Build With APIs - </strong>If you have the ability to write code, or are fearless enough to begin playing around, hacking, and learning to code, you can begin building something on top of an API. Most APIs provide you with code snippets, software development kits (SDKs), and starter applications, providing you with the basics of learning how to build something useful on top of an API. Even if you do not intend on delivering an actual application, there is nothing stopping you from learning how it all works.</li>
<li><strong>Help Improve APIs -</strong> Most API providers are looking for feedback on their creations, and are grateful when developers play around with, build things, and provide feedback on how easy, or hard the APIs are to use, and what other APIs might be interesting to offer. Entire communities have emerge around individual APIs, and APIs in general, producing a wealth of knowledge out there when it comes to putting APIs to work, offering an opportunity for hobbyists all the way up to professionals to get involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using other people&rsquo;s APIs is the best gateway to the world of APIs. The best API providers, are also API consumers, and having an awareness of how popular APIs like Twitter, Twilio, Stripe, and others work is an asset. If you want to learn more about APIs, always start with just playing with APIs that already exist. There are endless API lessons available out there, all you have to is seek them out, and work to discover and play with new APIs&mdash;repeating on a regular basis. Learning the best patterns, as well as the mistakes made by interesting APIs you probably are already using on the web, or on your mobile phone. Expanding your awareness of how APIs are used, while also cultivating and stimulating your own interests all along the way.<br /><br /><strong>Learning To Integrate Using APIs</strong><br />Going one step further with your knowledge of APIs, and kicking the tires when it comes to consuming APIs, you can invest more time understanding how developers, SaaS providers, and other API savvy folks are connecting services, applications, and platforms together, taking advantage of API integration opportunities that exist. This doorway to the world of APIs presents another opportunity for developers and non-developer individuals to not just learn about APIs, but put them to work automating the syncing, triggering, and accomplish a variety of integration tasks using the services, applications, and platforms they already depend on.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover New APIs -</strong> Software as a Service (SaaS) provider integration pages, and next generation integration platform as a services (iPaaS) provide a rich opportunity discovering new APIs, ready to go with low-code or no-code integration capabilities. Once you begin to look for integration pages for SaaS providers you will see them everywhere. Opening up a whole new dimension of API-driven capabilities that have always been with reach of both developers and non-developers, but were just out of view.</li>
<li><strong>Platforms -</strong> With the number of APIs emerging over the last ten years an entire ecosystem of low-code and no-code solutions have emerged to connect the dots between existing API-enabled services. All of these services are well within reach of the average developer, and even non-developers. Opening up a wealth of API-driven capabilities assoociated with the applications, services, and platforms we already depend on.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow Orchestration </strong>- SaaS and iPaaS integrations go well beyond simple API reference based opportunities, and tend to reflect more meaningful workflows for common everyday business tasks. Using one or more APIs to accomplish a specific objective, using the services we are already using&mdash;all we have to do is authentication, and connect the dots in our worlds. </li>
<li><strong>Knowing What Is Possible - </strong>Those who are familiar with SaaS and iPaaS integrations, and regularly employ them to accomplish tasks tend to be more aware and in command of what is possible with the applications, services, and platforms they depend on. Showing how APIs can empower individuals to get things done, augment the tools and services they already use with additional capabilities, and establish more control over their digital presence.</li>
</ul>
<p>API integration opportunities are everywhere once you begin to scratch the surface. You do not need to be a coder to become proficient at navigating the world of APIs, and putting them to work. SaaS and iPaaS integrations are being used to average business users to orchestrate data, content, and media across the web. Some API curious individuals might end their journey here, finding everything they need to know about APIs by walking through the API consumer and integration doors. Being able to not just understand what APIs and what they are used for, but actually be able to put them to work. Making APIs the critic tool in our business toolboxes, allowing us to be in control of our own data, then dictate and execute the business workflows enable us to be more success in our daily work.<br /><br /><strong>Being a Steward Of Open Data With APIs</strong><br />One step beyond just being an API consumer and integrator, moving towards the world of providing APIs, many data stewards are realizing the benefit of publishing their spreadsheets as simple APIs, allowing them to be access by many different consumers, and used in a variety of applications. While also allowing data stewards to maintain a level of control and quality over their data, ensuring they remain the source of truth when it comes to the source of the valuable data we use in applications, visualizations, and even additional API powered spreadsheets. Software as a Service (SaaS) providers have opened up a new realm of services and tooling to help data stewards better manage their data in the could, complete with a suite of tools for helping publish data as simple, intuitive web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets - </strong>Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets both have APIs to expose data within spreadsheets, and they both have the ability to make calls to existing APIs to populate data within spreadsheets from APIs. Making APIs the preferred way of data stewards when it comes to opening up access to data, using the tools they already depend on to get the job done.</li>
<li><strong>CSV &amp; JSON - </strong>Beyond the spreadsheet there are numerous tools for helping data stewards convert and export spreadsheets into CSV and JSON formats, providing the preferred data format for publishing APIs. Allowing stewards to quickly publish spreadsheets as machine readable data, which is the most simplest form of an API out there&mdash;no expensive infrastructure needed.</li>
<li><strong>Publish Data APIs - </strong>Most API management providers have solutions for turning your spreadsheets, CSV, and JSON files into APIs, quickly publishing data as an API that can be properly secured, managed, measured, and made available to a controlled audience. Leveraging APIs to make data more accessible and usable across many different applications, while allowing data stewards to stick with the tools they know best&mdash;the spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Quality -</strong> API consumers can just take data from an API and use within their applications, or they seamless integrate the API directly into their application, allowing data to be updated whenever the data within he API is updated. It is common to limit the terms of service for data APIs to limit how data can be stored and cached, requiring consumers to treat the data API as as source of truth, giving data stewards much more control over how it is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs and data are synonymous. Most APIs are just about providing access to data within databases, or within spreadsheets. APIs help reduce the number of times in which a spreadsheet are emailed around or duplicated. APIs provide centralized access to the data within a spreadsheet, allowing it to quickly be used in visualizations, and other ways of displaying information across web and mobile applications. APIs open up opportunities for data stewards go provide wider access to dat with more control over what is done with it, and even potentially opening up additional revenue opportunities through commercial access, and the development of new products and services around the data being provided.<br /><br /><strong>Becoming A More Capable API Provider</strong><br />Once you have your footing in the world of APIs, how they are consumed and integrated within applications, you can begin to explore the opportunities around becoming an API provider eternally within your organization, externally with partners, or eventually by making an API publicly available to 3rd party developers. Providing APIs requires a much higher level of understanding around how to do APIs, but there are plenty of opportunities for business stakeholders to get involved in the process, especially when it comes to defining, designing, developing, and publishing modern APIs, which provide more areas for non-technical folks to contribute, without having to have the deep technical experience required to actually deliver the API itself. Providing a handful of places anyone can get involved in moving the API deployment conversation forward at their organization.<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know Your APIs -</strong> The place to start within any organization when it comes to APIs is know what APIs are currently available for consumption inside or outside the firewall. Every company, organization, institution, and government agency has APIs&mdash;they just might not be actively deploying and supporting them. Most modern software and open source tooling have APIs, which should be included in the list of your API capabilities. Beyond these starting points, if your organization does deploy and support APIs, spend the time to get to know them, understand what they do, and what the process is to deliver them-know your organization APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Teams -</strong> Next, understand the teams behind the APIs being developed, and if your organization isn&rsquo;t formally delivering APIs, then explore and find out the APIs that different groups are putting to use in their applications and system integrations. Understand the capacity for knowing about and using APIs across different teams, and spend the time to map out the strengths, weaknesses, assets, and liabilities that exist across the teams you have to support an API conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Stakeholders - </strong>Beyond teams providing and consuming APIs, spend the time to identify other potential stakeholders in the API conversation. Who will make decision around what software gets used, which application get developed, and the integrations that get tackled, or maybe are in most need of being done. Have a good understanding of the technical and business stakeholders that exist who can help, or hurt the API conversation at your organization.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Applications - </strong>Beyond the APIs themselves, understand what applications are operating which depend on APIs If applications are being developed on top of the APIs your organization develops, spend the time to understand how they are used, and what metrics are in place to better understand their API dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Capabilities - </strong>Understand where the API resources are, but also develop a strong understanding of ho those APIs can be put to work in common workflows that benefit your business, and empower your teams. Know the capabilities of your organization, and develop your understanding of what capabilities will be required to get your organization where you want it to be. APIs are the key to understanding what your organization is or isn&rsquo;t capable of today, and tomorrow.</li>
<li><strong>Define Your Lifecycle - </strong>Cultivate your awareness of how APIs are defined, designed, developed, documented, tested, and supported in production. Document the life cycle of the existing APIs in operation, understand more about how they came to be, and what it takes to keep them alive. Work with team members and other stakeholders to standardize the definition you establish of your API lifecycle, then work to share with as many other individuals as you possibly can, repeating as necessary to get desired results.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to define, design, deliver, support, and integrate an API without writing code. Most of the steps in this process are within reach of business users. Many developers are unaware of modern approaches to delivering APIs within large enterprise organizations, leaving a pretty large vacuum for technical or business leadership to step in and guide the process. Helping teams become more capable API developers and providers, helping them refine their skills and participate in a much more streamline API lifecycle. Establishing a repeatable series of steps that everyone has agreed upon to help deliver APIs from start to finish, repeating as necessary, standardizing and optimizing how APIs are delivered across an organization, turning it into a shared effort between business and IT, or development groups&mdash;leveraging what you have learned about APIs to ensure healthier outcomes for your organization, and the teams that work there.<br /><br /><strong>Stepping Up To Evangelize APIs</strong><br />The final doorway we will welcome you in when it comes to learning about what is next for your API journey is all about stepping up to help evangelize APIs within your organization, or possibly the industry you operate in. API evangelists, advocates, and champions are needed within every company and team. Passionate individuals who understand the API opportunity that exists, as well as those who are willing to wrestle with the challenges are desperately needed across almost any industry. Passionate evangelists who are obsessively curious and passionate about connecting people within an organization or industry are one of the most sought after resources in the space today. Representing a pretty significant opportunity when it comes to apply the API knowledge you have, while also investing in it, by stepping up to be and API advocate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover New APIs - </strong>Take the time to find new, interesting, and useful APIs that your organization and customers can put to use. Be vocal about the process, and what you find. Share the stories of what APIs exist, how they are being used, and being applied to solve real business problems. Be the go to person within your organization for knowing where the best APIs exist, and who across your organization and industry is doing the most interesting things with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Play With APIs -</strong> Be API literate. Play with APIs, understand how they work, and how they don&rsquo;t. Be an advocate for API consumers, while also being an advocate for API providers. Understand what it takes to put an API to work, and be the person who develops the most meaningful integrations and workflows with the APIs that already exist.</li>
<li><strong>Tell Stories of APIs - </strong>Tell endless stories about what you are learning about APIs. Write blog posts, tutorials, white papers, and share you story in any meeting, meetup, or conference you can think will matter. Be the API storyteller who is shining a light on what matters, helping your organization, teams, and customers be more successful.</li>
<li><strong>Shine A Light On People -</strong> Don&rsquo;t make your evangelism about you, make it about the interesting things other people are doing with APIs. Listen to other stakeholders, team members, and consumers. Keep notes on what is being worked on, and think about the most positive ways in which you can share information, push for collaboration, and encourage reuse of quality work you find across your organization and API community.</li>
<li><strong>Develop Relationships -</strong> About 35% of your evangelism work will be about the technical details of APIs, the rest of your work will be about developing relationships with different groups, teams, partners, and individuals. Work overtime to develop relationships the individuals who matter the most, and will have the most positive impact on the API conversation, acknowledging that some relationships will be more difficult than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evangelism, advocacy, and the championing of APIs within an organization can make or break the effectiveness they have on operations. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how good the technical details are for how you deliver APIs, if you don&rsquo;t address the human side of things, it will fall apart. Technology is comfortable with us operating within silos, business is not so accommodating. Doing business online in a global business climate requires everyone working in concert, and when teams exist in different buildings and geographic locations, investing heavily in evangelism, advocacy, and collaboration is essential. Always requiring a passionate champion who&rsquo;s job is to simply connect people, tell stories, and strengthen relationships, which will help keep the API gears turning and always moving forward towards a common goal.<br /><br /><strong>APIs Aren&rsquo;t Just For Developers</strong><br />It has been said several times so far&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for developers. This is a legacy way of thinking that has been pushed out of companies who have made progress in their digital transformations. We&rsquo;ve clearly identified several ways in which APIs can be put to work by non-developers, and that modern approaches to integrating services, applications, and platforms with APIs can be deployed and managed entirely without the assistance of a developer. While there are technical pitfalls that still exist across the API landscape which will ensure business stakeholders, there are increasingly services, tooling, connectors, and plugins to help bridge the gap&mdash;all you ave to do is spend the time looking for the right API-enabled solution. We can&rsquo;t emphasize enough that APIs are for everyone. We see APIs like the banking system, you don&rsquo;t have to have full knowledge of how it works, but you should be able to manage your finances, know who has access to your accounts, then be able to connect and integrate the various services you spend on. Which by the way, is all API enabled&mdash;demonstrating another way in which APIs will help you further master the orchestration of not just your professional world, but your personal life as well.<br /><br /><strong>APIs Help Build Our Awareness</strong><br />Most large organizations do not possess an awareness of where all of their digital assets live, and what their organizations are capable of on any given day. APIs help quantify these resources and capabilities, and if done right, provide us with a way to define, document, share, collaborate, and integrate using these digital resources. Inviting more people to the discussion, making API an organizational wide affair, helps develop awareness of what is possible. It helps break down the walls that exist between organizations, and externally with our partners and customers. APIs help us standardize how we provide access to data, content, media, and our most valuable algorithms. A modern API lifecycle is how streamline the design, development, and delivery of our organizational capabilities, injecting more agility, flexibility, and efficiency into how we deliver API infrastructure, but also open up access to them and develop desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications on top of this infrastructure. The health of our APIs depend on developing this awareness, making this quest you are on to understand more about APIs, and where you should be starting one of the more critical things you should be doing today.<br /><br /><strong>APIs Give You A Stronger Voice</strong><br />Equipped with an awareness of what your organization is capable of, and what the process is to add to that arsenal, you will develop a much strong voice when it comes to contributing to the direction your organization is headed. The more you understand about how applications are developed across your organization, and how the APIs behind these applications and other integrations are brought to life and evolved, the more tables you will have a seat at. Understanding not just how APIs are developed within your organization, but also how they are consumed and integrated with will give you a command over the landscape that will transcend your traditional organizational boundaries. What you know about APIs is applicable across groups, and will be valuable in making a bigger impact in the business sectors you operate. You will have access to the resources and capabilities of your organization, but also access to the most relevant data, content, and media from 3rd party APIs that exist behind the applications, services, and platforms you&rsquo; chose specifically because they hav eAPIs&mdash;leveraging APIs to shift the balance of power within your organization, and amongst your customers when it comes to them realizing what you are capable of.<br /><br /><strong>APIs Equip You With New Capabilities</strong><br />Your API journey will lead you towards a new future will you will be much more confident about what you currently possess, what you will need to equip your organization for the future, and how you will deliver the next generation of capabilities that are need to get you where you want to be. Each API represents a valuable resource your organization possesses, and when orchestrated alongside other resources, you begin to establish processes and workflows that shift how work gets done. In the last couple of years more mainstream businesses are waking up to how much they depend on APIs to get business done today, while also demonstrating the importance of APIs to what they will be able to accomplish in the next decade. Realizing that if they don&rsquo;t go all in on investing in their API capabilities today, that they won&rsquo;t be able to keep up and deliver new capabilities fast enough, crippling their overall ability to innovate and compete as the business world continues to march forward as part of this wider digital evolution.</p>

<p>I like machine readable definitions that are also human readable. Depending on how much you care about your API consumers, and how mature your API life cycle is, your will invest different amounts of energy into crafting your API definitions. Many will just autogenerate them, putting little refinement into them, relying on services and tooling to do most of the work. However, those who understand the value of API documentation will realize that investing in the details of your API definition and design will realize a bigger return when it comes to on-boarding developers with their API.<br /><br />API definitions, whether OpenAPI, Postman Collection, or other format should be accessible and always strike a balance between being both machine and human readable. API definitions are primarily used for API documentation, and secondarily used for API mocking, testing, monitoring, security, code generation, and other stops along the API life cycle. While all of these stops along the API life cycle help contribute to the maturity and robustness of your API definitions, heavy investment in API documentation will ave the greatest ROI when it comes to making an impact on our human stakeholders. Helping attract users to your APIs, on-boarding them with less friction, and help increase their adoption and integration of resources into their applications. <br /><br />Take the time to add summaries and descriptions to each path in your API definitions. Make sure that every request body and response has an example. Ensure that you take the time to be concise, but informative when crafting the API definitions&mdash;your API documentation will be better off for it. Make sure you aren&rsquo;t hand-rolling your API documentation and are taking advantage of the wealth of OpenAPI and Postman collection driven documentation solutions. These types of API documentation just look better, and help reduce friction when on-boarding new developers, and giving existing API developers what they need when they come back to learn about new APIs, and expand their usage of existing APIs. <br /><br />It can be easy to focus on the use of API definitions for the automation of the API life cycle, over thinking of them for humans. However, it is the human readability and added touches that are meant for human consumption that will make your APIs better. The human readability of your API definitions will help strengthen the feedback loop with API stakeholders involved in the delivery, usage, and evolution of your APIs. Pushing the human readability of your API definitions will help keep your API definitions speaking to not just developers for integration into other systems, and driving different stops along the API lifecycle&mdash;it will keep your API definitions acting as business contracts meeting the needs of your organization, making sure APIs don&rsquo;t just work, but they are also properly solving actual problems that need addressing across business operations.</p>

<p>The is my regular reminder that not everyone will care about APIs as much as I do. Most people just want to do their job, and aren&rsquo;t interested in understanding the nuance of API design. I&rsquo;d say that this is one of my biggest sins as a technologist&mdash;believing that other people see the world as I do, and in turn will want to care about &ldquo;doing APIs right&rdquo;. This is not a case of I&rsquo;m right, and they are wrong.&nbsp; This is a case of the world is full of different people, who see the problem very differently, and not everyone will agree that APIs are the solution, let alone care about understanding and debating the details of API design with me. And I can&rsquo;t expect them to always change their tune.<br /><br />While there are people who will stop, listen, and over time internalize what I&rsquo;m sharing with them, the majority of people will show no interest, avoid, and even resist what I&rsquo;m putting on the table. I have to realize and accept that most of these people will never convert, and become believers. If I am going to be successful, I&rsquo;m going have to find ways of herding these folks along, trick them into contributing, and I guess in some situations force them to be compliant. But do I want to do this? There has to be other more creative ways of educating folks and getting them on board. I mean, I&rsquo;m write aren&rsquo;t I? My solution is the logical solution? Let&rsquo;s explore the possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maybe I Am Wrong - </strong>Lets start with the obvious and most painful. Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing APIs. Maybe my way of doing APIs isn&rsquo;t right. This one gets at the very foundation of my being, my existence. Maybe these people smell something I don&rsquo;t, and my suggestions for doing APIs in a particular way is a bad idea. I&rsquo;m going to simmer on this one more, see where it leads me.</li>
<li><strong>Make Them Do It - </strong>I can possibly just make someone do what I want, depending on my level of control over the situation, but do I really want to do this? I do not think so. I am not a big fan of command and control ways of operation. </li>
<li><strong>Give Them Room - </strong>Maybe people aren&rsquo;t on board with doing APIs because they just don&rsquo;t have the breathing room in their day to care about things at any other level, and if I can carve out enough space for them to breathe, things might change.</li>
<li><strong>Moving On -</strong> Letting someone go is always a possibility, acknowledging that they are not capable of change, or maybe they need a greater disruption in their world before they&rsquo;ll begin to see thing differently, making termination the only option.</li>
<li><strong>Education -</strong> It is quite possible that someone just can&rsquo;t see the big picture and is missing critical pieces of the puzzle that are preventing them from getting on board. Making education and training a critical nutrient that might help them get over the hump and get on board with things.</li>
<li><strong>Give It More Time -</strong> Maybe I am being too impatient and I need to give people more time to see the change that is possible, and overcome their legacy mindset, acknowledging that this will take much more time to play out.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate The Value -</strong> There may need to be more demonstration of the value APIs bring to an organization before some people will agree with the API change that is being proposed will begin to move hearts and minds.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realized a long time ago that my expectations will not always match other people&rsquo;s expectations.The bar I set for myself might be too high for others. If I&rsquo;ve learned nothing over my time as the API Evangelist, it is that nothing happens as fast as I think, and my first attempts at sharing API concepts with others is almost always stonewalled. None of this stuff works out as easy as it seems in my head. Most folks who aren&rsquo;t already immersed in the world of APIs may not be interested in what I am saying, and hear me as one of the parents from the old Charlie Brown cartoons&mdash;API wah wah wah. It is important that I don&rsquo;t see this as their problem, and I realize it is a challenge for me.<br /><br />Being able to have the time to consider the bigger API picture is a luxury. I&rsquo;m thankful for having been able to carve out the time to contemplate the API space so thoughtfully. Not everyone has the space and bandwidth to be genuinely interested in the process, or even if they are, they know that the realities on the ground within their organization will prevent them from staying engaged in any meaningful way. This reality is why I stick to my storytelling, even after I&rsquo;ve long reached the point where I&rsquo;m saying the same things over and over. This is what is necessary to properly plant the seeds of change that will begin bearing fruit in coming years. It just takes time, a lot of work, and patience, but eventually we will get there. Just not as quickly as we originally anticipated.</p>

<p>Having standard API practices established across our development teams plays an important role in pushing us to deliver more consistent and usable APIs. Establishing a feedback loop with API consumers and other stakeholders adds another layer of refinement to our APIs that help us iterate and harden them. Another dimension of the API conversation that helps us push our APIs towards maturity centers around discussing and defining the meaningful workflows that can be developed with our APIs. Helping us establish more meaningful business workflow with our APIs, and potentially other partner or 3rd party APIs, connecting our APIs together into workflows that help us accomplish the most valuable tasks we can.<br /><br />API workflows are all about getting us past the caveman CRUD grunts and groans we use to communicate with our API resources, and begin to actually use real words and phrases to describe a series of API calls that accomplish something with real world business values. Having a machine readable reference for all of our APIs is essential, making sure that every path is well documented and accessible by developers. However, also having a machine readable definitions for our workflows that help us articulate how the most common and valuable API workflows should occur is a sign of maturity in our APIs, our process, and how we articulate this value to developers and end-users.<br /><br />When crafting API workflows, the place to begin involves stitching together your own APIs to recreate the most relevant workflows that are already present in your applications. This helps you think through the business value that your APIs deliver, helping you smooth out the rough edges around how things work (or don&rsquo;t). Another important aspect of this effort is to make sure that you are also weaving in partner and other 3rd party APIs as part of this workflow development, enriching and adding value to your own APIs, and expanding the reach of the business value your API workflows deliver. Exposing your API stakeholders to a richer set of functionality, while also ensuring that you are regularly sizing up your own APIs against other leading 3rd party APIs, further hardening your practices, process, and APIs along the way.<br /><br />The last five years have been all about making sure we have reference style API definitions available for all of our APIs, allowing us to leverage them throughout the API lifecycle, generating mocks, documentation, testing, and other essential stops along a modern API lifecycle. While this work will continue as more mainstream companies realize the importance of APIs to their business, the next evolution in APIs will be all about API workflows, and ensuring we have thought through how our APIs are being applied. Helping us mature how we approach our API operations, and are in tune with how our APIs are put to use, making sure that we aren&rsquo;t just delivering real value to our consumers, but also that we have reduced any friction, minimized complexities, and distilled down our most meaningful API workflows into something anyone can follow and put to use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a series of introductory API blog posts for Postman, helping introduce people to the concepts of APIs. When I do series like this I tend to get comments from people that the work reflects my earlier writing on API Evangelist, and is something that reflects the past. Bringing people out of the woodwork who feel that everything I publish here on API Evangelist is always in forward motion, and my knowledge of is always advancing and marching ever into the future at a steady pace. I feel that this notion reflects a general belief that technology is always moving froward and that you either keep up with the pace, or you are left behind. Believing that most API concepts are outdated shortly after they are applied, and we will always have to be looking out for the next evolution in how APIs are being done.<br /><br />As long as API Evangelist is operating, I will always be reworking how I tell stories that target API newbies. I always find it valuable to force myself to step back from what I know and how I articulate the vast world of APIs to folks who are just learning about APIs. It is vital to the sector that we are always educating and on-boarding new voices, and we should all be working to equip all skill levels with our API evangelism, communication, and training. Ensuring that we aren&rsquo;t just leveling up in everything we do, and we continue to reach as wide as possible audience as we can with our storytelling. Forcing ourselves to re-evaluate how we articulate our API practices to others, refine our storytelling, documentation, and other resources&mdash;considering how they will be viewed by newcomers, as well as the veterans who depend on our services.<br /><br />Regular investment in introductory API concepts helps us stay grounded, remember how we got here, and ensure we keep the rope ladder available for others to get to the same place we are. Technology does not perpetually move forward in a linear fashion, forever erasing what came before, and unleashing the inevitable future at regular intervals. There are numerous historical API concepts that are still applicable, which should regularly be re-evaluated, re-worked, and applied in today&rsquo;s environment. Despite many of us living and working within he API echo chamber, there are still many, many individuals who exist within other work industries where APIs haven&rsquo;t fully penetrated and flourished. We can&rsquo;t assume everyone sees the technology sector as we do, and are aware of how APIs are changing everything, and driving desktop, web, mobile, and device applications.<br /><br />Introductory API concepts are timeless and should be always kept as a regular part of the conversation. We should never shame people for not understanding everything that is going on, and never assume a level of proficiency with people who appear to have a history of working with APIs. You just never know where someone has come from, and what their journey towards API literacy has involved. We should regularly work to redefine how we on-board new voices into the API space, and perpetually hone how we share stories about what APIs are, why they matter, and how they are being applied. The basics of REST are not a 2005 concept, anymore than API management is simply a 2010 concept. Make sure your API storytelling toolbox is full of introductory, intermediate, advanced, and master level API stories and tools, ensuring you reach the widest possible audience you can.</p>

<p>I think back regularly to my days as a database administrator in the 1990s, and the critical role I played in so many different organizations by being a keeper of the valuable data that was used to power the business. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve seen this role done well and not so well at many different organizations across many different business sectors&mdash;a position that still holds a great deal of power today. However, the one big difference I see now, is that much of this power has been displaced, shifted, and distributed by exposing simple web APIs, making valuable data available across internal groups, amongst partners, and to 3rd party developers. Changing the balance of power, and opening up the opportunity for a new generation of users to emulate some of the realities that database administrators catered to, but often times it s something that is more about giving power to people who are closer to where the business action is, and moving things out of the classic IT departments where it has existed for decades.<br /><br />As we&rsquo;ve seen by the rise of Facebook, Twitter, and other data rich platforms, having access to relevant data at scale is where the new revenue opportunities are, which in turn has shifted where folks go for information, knowledge, and access to the power within an industry, or a specific organization. Moving databases online has changed how value is created, and power is amassed, something that web APIs has fueled, being behind almost every major shift in the technological landscape over the last 20 years. Making those who know how to discover, create, and put APIs to work part of the new class of player who gets to dictate what goes on in the web and mobile shifts in the business landscape. Elevating the relevance of those of who mind to the technical details of APIs we create and depend on within our organizations, making them the next generation of power brokers.<br /><br />Knowing where the documented and undocumented APIs are across your organization is a difficult role to play. You have to be willing to spend time reverse engineering applications and system integrations, and blindly mapping out the unknown landscape that has emerged over the years across countless legacy projects. APIs get stood up intentionally for a variety of web, mobile, and device integrations, and unintentionally stood up as part of the default installation of applications that might not be fully understood, and having someone acting as the librarian for these APIs is becoming one of the more valuable things you can focus on as part of your API efforts. Things are moving fast, and APIs are often cast aside to make way for whatever the new priorities might be, even when the legacy APIs are still used and providing access to valuable resources. Sometimes the only person who is documenting and tending to these API stacks is the self-appointed API librarian who is more interested in the long tail of knowledge within an organization, than whatever the new hot trendy project might be.<br /><br />Beyond the internal APIs, the individuals who are staying in tune with the external API landscape are also enjoying their own version of this power shift. These API savvy individuals are taking the time to educate themselves about the latest APIs out there, and which APIs have become indispensable to developers when it comes to getting things done. Becoming the go to people within their organizations when it comes to understanding where you can access critical resources like compute, storage, messaging, social, documents, and everything else you will need to get your job done, whether you are building an application, enriching the calculations in your spreadsheet, or make sure data exists within the SaaS solutions you depend on to accomplish your work business workflows. Being the person who is the keeper of the API knowledge, and can help you access the most relevant API services across a rising sea of API solutions, and avoid the most common pitfalls developers encounter when discovering, on-boarding, and relying upon 3rd party APIs.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve taken pride in being the API librarian for the entire API sector since 2010. Knowing how to access the most relevant APIs out there like Amazon, Twitter, Stripe, and Twilio, but also knowing about the lesser known APIs like the Free Law Project, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), or Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Which might be known within their respective industries, but have trouble getting attention within the louder API ecosystem, but still are relevant to the wider API conversation, and should be considered as part of our wider API toolbox. After almost a decade of acting as a librarian for API knowledge, I&rsquo;m going to invest more in helping folks emulate what I do within specific industries, enterprise organizations, and government agencies. I&rsquo;ve historically called these folks evangelists, but I&rsquo;d say that knowing where resources are is becoming just as important as spreading the word about these resources. When it comes to agility, flexibility, efficiency, and security, knowing where your digital capabilities are is essential. If you don&rsquo;t know where your API resources are and how they are being used (or not) within applications, you won&rsquo;t be able to compete or keep up with other players, increasing the need for having API librarians who are dedicated and passionate about keeping track of all things API.&nbsp; Are you the API librarian within your organization? If not, who is?</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges I face in reaching API practitioners in my work as the Chief Evangelist for Postman is that most people in these roles are more focused on the day to day details of their work, and are often cognitively unable to zoom out and see the bigger picture. It isn&rsquo;t that they don&rsquo;t have the interest or capacity to do this, it is that the day to day demands of their jobs prevent them from having the bandwidth to pause even for a few minutes to think about the bigger picture, let alone get up to speed on what they need to, and craft a more robust API strategy. My biggest competitor when it comes to reaching these folks is not another service or tool, it is just the expectations placed on them by their organizational environment.<br /><br />I may be able to get my stories read by API architects, designers, and developers, but if I can&rsquo;t figure out how to make them more applicable in their day, I&rsquo;m not going to make a difference. To help me shape my storytelling I want to better understand the challenges on the ground, and regularly document the common challenges so that I can actually craft not just stories that are relative, but also create collections and influence other Postman features that might actually reduce friction wherever I can, to help give people more room. So, what are some of the common challenges my readers face?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bugs</strong> - Every one of my readers faces a steady stream of bugs in the APIs, and applications they are in charge of. Regularly distracting them from the work that will move things forward making most feel like they are always drowning.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Failures</strong> - When you are running large scale systems there will always be infrastructure challenges involve failures, bottlenecks, and limitations imposed by the infrastructure in place, and the impact of decisions made, or not made.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity Losses </strong>- Bugs and infrastructure failure always introduces productivity losses that often seems to be perpetually putting teams behind, making it feel like they are never moving forward, maintaining friction across operations.</li>
<li><strong>Broken Workflows</strong> - Even once we&rsquo;ve rolled out new Ads, the dots aren&rsquo;t always connected in ways that ensure business gets done, and there are regularly broken or fragmented workflows that will trip us up in getting our work done.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy Constraints</strong> - The decisions made by previous teams, or just the decisions we made on our own 5, 10, or more years ago will always work against us, introducing regular waves of constraints on what we are trying to get accomplished.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - The number of security concerns each team faces exponentially increases each day, distracting us from our work and perpetually limiting the impact we can have with the APIs we are delivering each day.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong> - Managing data and API governance is a never ending job, and something that becomes even more unwieldy if we can&rsquo;t ever pause and take a look at the bigger picture&mdash;introducing a self-fulling cycle of friction.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is difficult to pay attention to the big picture when you are down in the weeds of operations. This is one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve stuck with consulting for different companies over the years, and why I&rsquo;m focusing on talking to Postman customers about the realities of their API operations on the ground floor. I find that if I&rsquo;m too removed from these stories I run the risk of becoming too academic in my work, and I&rsquo;ll just be telling stories that do to speak to folks in the trenches. I&rsquo;ll be taking each of these areas and working to establish ways of using Postman collections to help reduce the friction, execute valuable tasks, and most importantly for me, wrap them in stories I can tell that will reach and speak to the average enterprise developer. <br /><br />I am determined to not be creating more work for folks, and crafting executable solutions in Postman. Our director of customer success Sanjeev Sisodiya (<a href="https://twitter.com/ssisodiya">@ssisodiya</a>) has a vision that every support response, and customer success story should also be a Postman collection. Making everything we do actionable by our customers, and helping make any concept we are looking to get across something that is portable, sharable, and executable, just like everything is in Postman. I&rsquo;m looking to try and realize Sanjeev&rsquo;s vision in my storytelling, and work harder weave Postman collections into my narratives, and begin solving more of these common issues that my readers are focused on, providing little nuggets of value they can put to work reducing friction in their world. I&rsquo;m going to focus on some of the governance areas first helping manage more of the API design issues that get injected into the API development lifecycle, creating a variety of collections that can be adopted to help standardize the APIs our customers are defining using collections.</p>

<p>You hear a lot about learning to code in the tech sector. I want to invest more in people &ldquo;learning to API&rdquo;. Not just developers, but anyone who wants to understand how to push back a little on the digital word we&rsquo;ve built for ourselves. I&rsquo;m not convinced everyone should learn to code, but I am a believer that everyone should learn to API. If you use the web, you should learn to API. To help you in your job. To help you in your hobbies. To help you better understand the physical and online worlds around us. You may never actually write any code against an API, or build an application, but with the growing number of services available today that have APIs, there is no reason why you can&rsquo;t be putting these APIs to work for you using the wide array of integration opportunities available to developers and non-developers.<br /><br />There is nothing stopping normal everyday folks from knowing what an API in its most basic form, and understanding that they exist behind all of the desktop, web, mobile, and device applications we use each day. There is no reason average business people can&rsquo;t move data, content, and media around between the services they use each day. There are plenty of low-code or no-code solutions for putting APIs to work, and there are a growing number of baked in integrations available with the common business and consumer applications we are already using. The only thing stopping people from learning to APIs is the perceived notion that programming is out of their reach, and something that they don&rsquo;t have have the capacity to understanding, which is a concept perpetuated by a specific class of technological wizards who want to keep this world for our own.<br /><br />It will be a regular mission of mine to craft blog posts, white papers, and tutorials that help the average business person learn to API. Working hard to reduce the complexity involved with understand what each API does, and the authentication and other aspects involved with putting an API to work. Postman provides me with an amazing opportunity to reach out beyond just the developer community, and build useful collections that help walk them through more meaningful and useful workflows that involve APIs. Shifting the conversation around who participates in the API conversation. And most importantly for me, who gets to wield the value that exists across the growing number of online platforms we are using, simply because we begin to start showing more people where the back door exists to these platforms, allowing you to bypass the normal interfaces and get at the data you desire.<br /><br />I am aware that most people will not be interested. I get that most people are conditioned to be afraid of the technical details. I also am painfully experienced with the fact that many developers lash out at me when I make these claims, and work harder to on-board non-developers. Over the last nine years I have written about this concept in many different ways, and almost every time I do there are waves of developers who step up to let me know that normal people won&rsquo;t care, don&rsquo;t understand, and aren&rsquo;t smart enough to figure this stuff out. This comes with the territory when trying to on-board folks with technology, but I&rdquo;m willing to deal with it, as I have over the last nine years. I&rsquo;m pretty passionate about the fact that for people to have more control in our increasingly digital we are going to have to learn to API. In this mission I&rsquo;m not advocating any particular API, but I am focusing on possessions a wider awareness that APIs exist and you know how to put them to work without needing a developers. Investing in everyone learning to API.</p>

<p>I am going through a bunch of different tutorials from API providers looking to motivate users to accomplish some fundamental API on-boarding task, or introduce them to some meaningful workflow involving their API. I am amazed at how much detail, including screenshots that people go into, and how so few of them actually provide Postman collections that help power the task or workflow they are shining a light on. I&rsquo;m determined to figure out why. I&rsquo;m guessing folks are used to using Postman as a simple web API client, and haven&rsquo;t really fully grasped the concept of sharing collections, and how collections go above and beyond what they are used to with Swagger / OpenAPI. After over eight years of people using Swagger / OpenAPI, most still think it is a documentation solution, so I&rsquo;m not really surprised that folks don&rsquo;t fully get collections&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t until recently.<br /><br />The one thing I want to help people understand is that your Postman collection should be the tutorial. It is fine to have all the content and screenshot fluff around it, as this helps you with SEO, discovery, and other things, but everything you describe int he tutorial should be actionable in your Postman collection&mdash;this is the purpose behind collections! Postman collections excel at containing all of the detail you need to walk folks through making API calls in a portable, shareable, executable unit of representation for your API. Making it so that your audience can take the tutorial with them, play with it in their own environment, and the best thing is that it stays around in their application development environment until they remove it, providing a potentially ongoing reference for them at some point in the future&mdash;making your tutorials stickier.<br /><br />It takes experience to be able to craft a meaningful Postman collection, going beyond just a basic reference of your API. It isn&rsquo;t something I&rdquo;m very good at yet, but will spend time honing and polishing. As I get better at it I will help share stories about the process, and gather more tips for how API providers can get better at publishing their own tutorials. It can be difficult to understand what is possible with API definitions, and I know that Postman collections has a lot of nuances that seem to escape us. I know that I didn&rsquo;t fully understand how it was different from OpenAPI, and I was just seeing the platform evolve towards testing, mocking, and documentation. Which is needed, but I really think that collections for on-boarding developers and non-developers to a new API, to new concepts, and help them learn how to be more efficient at putting APIs to work is where the future lies with Postman. I believe in Postman as a full API lifecycle tool, but I also believe in it as an essential tool for on-boarding people to APIs.<br /><br />If you are crafting a tutorial for your API make sure you include a reference collection for the APIs you are talking about&mdash;as a minimum. Every tutorial should have a Run in Postman button associated with it. If you tell developers to use Postman, you should enable this with a collection. If you are posting screenshots of how to use your API in Postman, you should enable this with a collection. If you are wanting to get really slick with how you craft your tutorials, then seamlessly dovetail them a Postman collection and make sure your API tutorial is something that encourages your target audience to go from reading to making calls to your API within a couple of clicks. Helping ensure that your tutorial isn&rsquo;t read then forgotten and ensure it becomes something that your API consumers can get hands on with, and if you are really lucky the developer will leave your collection in their personal or team Postman space and continue to make use of in the future-taking your API tutorials to a whole new level by transforming them into a Postman collection.</p>

<p>API governance is a hot topic amongst leadership and stakeholders who care about the long term health of API operations. I regularly get questions from folks about what I&rsquo;m seeing when it comes to API governance, from developing an API design guide, all the way up to t<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/07/19/api-governance-models-in-the-public-and-private-sector/">he deeper dive into governance I did last year for the Department of Veterans Affairs</a>. I would say that this work goes way beyond what most organizations are ready for, but API leadership is still interested in learning more about how they should develop what I would consider to be a capital G API Governance strategy. Something I recommend everyone think about, but make sure you also think about the more organic and incremental governance efforts as well, finding a balance between the two.<br /><br />I have come across numerous enterprise groups who have begun putting in place capital G governance as part of an organized effort, only to encounter resistance on the ground across teams. Resistance from folks on the ground range from not understanding what is being mandated, having better ideas on what can be done, or simply just being against anything that leadership proposes. Governance is hard work, and something that can be fraught from the beginning, depending on the nature of your organization and the industry you operate in. When I first began studying the world of API governance I was pretty against the term and the concept, but over the years I&rsquo;ve learned more about what t takes to do APIs at scale across large organizations and I changed my tune. I would say after about seven years, I&rsquo;m slowly drifting back towards thinking governance might do more harm than good.<br /><br />I am a fan of organizations having API design, deployment, management, testing, and other guidance in place, helping govern how APIs are delivered. However, within large organizations I have begun to see more examples of how capital G API Governance can become at odds with lowercase g API governance. For example, I spoke with a group in charge of governance recently, and learned about how they had governance in place for how you publish documentation, requiring everyone publish OpenAPI, Redoc, and some other elements to a central internal developer portal and catalog&mdash;makes sense right? Then I spoke with another group within the same enterprise organization, and they were explaining how they were doing some innovative work around API documentation, going beyond the existing guidelines, but they weren&rsquo;t able to publish and share because of the governance guidelines that were in place, and they weren&rsquo;t getting a response about evolving governance from the central group.<br /><br />This story is probably more about making sure you have proper feedback loops in place for your API governance efforts, than it is about governance itself, but I think it provides something we should consider when it comes to how we impose API governance on high, and how our well meaning work could stifle innovation and incremental improvements on the ground. Putting capital G Governance at odds with lowercase g API governance. I think this example shows the importance of going beyond just the technical aspects of API governance and ensuring we have the proper ongoing feedback loops in place, giving everyone a voice in how the API governance guidelines get established, communicated, and evolved. I think that API governance should be sure to have change baked in from the beginning so that practices don&rsquo;t get stuck in any single rut when it comes each of the stops along the API lifecycle. Allowing anyone on the ground within an organization to showcase incremental improvements or seismic shifts to an organizational API governance strategy&mdash;as long as they are willing to step up and own it.<br /><br />I am going through all of my research right now and reworking it all to better serve the work I am doing with Postman. A part of this includes going through all of API governance work and thinking deeply about how it all works, and fits together with the other moving parts of designing, development, and operating of APIs in production. As part of this work I am going to rethink my views on API governance, and consider how they might be bad for innovation and agility at the lower levels. I&rsquo;m going to think more about how difficult it is to evangelize and gain adoption with API governance across large organizations, and what this means when you need to make incremental changes on the ground. I&rsquo;m betting that API governance continues to be a hot topic due to the increased number of APIs being developed and operated on the ground within large organizations. Doing APIs well at scale across large organizations isn&rsquo;t easy, and I&rsquo;m looking to understand the honest realities of what it takes to realize API governance, or maybe continue eroding my beliefs that it is even necessary at all, and maybe there is a more distributed, organic, bottom up approach we should be setting into motion&mdash;moving beyond the word governance all together.</p>

<p>I am preparing for a busy week of conversation with folks at API World, and with an inbox full of requests to meet and discuss the challenges API providers and service providers face, I want to work on preparing myself by loading up a variety of topics into my old brain. Some of the folks I&rsquo;m talking with have shared questions with me to prime our conversational pump, so in my way, I figured I&rsquo;d work through them here on the blog to help put these thoughts on the tip of my tongue.<br /><br />AN area that API providers are rabid for more information on is how we they increase adoption of their APIs, and turn consumers from just making a few API calls into active users who are putting APIs to work within their applications. I would break these things into two distinct categories: 1) increasing your understanding of how your APIs work (or don&rsquo;t), and 2) increasing your understanding of the context in which your consumers operate within. While you may be focused on how to get a users adopting a specific API endpoint, you may not be thinking about the lack of flow between each of your API endpoints, and you probably aren&rsquo;t fully up to speed on your consumers workflow, and how the two do not match up. Which is more about how you define and design your APIs, and get to know your consumers, then it is about actual adoption or consumption.<br /><br /><strong>Reference API Design Versus Workflow API Design</strong><br />When I talk with API providers about why people aren&rsquo;t using their APIs I find the most of the time there has been little consideration for how those APIs should be used prior to them being released into production. Most APIs I come across are purely reference-based designs. Meaning they reference the resources being made available, but do not speak to how they will actually be put to use. API providers who are just beginning in their journey have a lot of trouble lifting themselves out of their silos and relating to the outside world of consumers they are targeting. As API providers we know our resources, and we assume this awareness exists amongst our consumers. They should just be able to consume the reference documentation, and be able to connect the dots regarding how to actually put them to use. When in reality, developers need a lot of help in this area, often times if workflows between multiple APIs haven&rsquo;t been considered as part of the API design process, there are sharp edges that prevent developers from realizing a smooth adoption, or getting to the point of increased consumption of your valuable API resources.<br /><br /><strong>Use Cases, Personas, and Consumer Workflows</strong><br />Understanding our target consumers is critical to increasing adoption and consumption. Developing an awareness to new users we&rsquo;d like to attract by developing and evolving personas is essential to learning to speak to the consumers who actually need our APIs&mdash;helping them see how APIs provide solutions to their problems. This awareness of consumers continues even once they have on-boarded and making API calls, requiring us to invest time in understanding the context in which our API consumers are putting our APIs to work. We might think since they are using API A, then using API B just makes sense, but without more understanding of the context in which they operate, the leap from A to B might end up being further than we realize. We might not understand all of the friction they encounter with the workflow from A to B, or realize that the leap isn&rsquo;t worth it without C. It takes a lot of work to build an awareness of fictional API consumers that do not exist yet, and it takes even more investment to get to know the ones who have shown up and are kicking the tires, or using our APIs in some basic ways. However, API adoption and consumption is more about our awareness and the state of our APIs, then it is about our actual consumers, and pushing them to just make the decision to jump.<br /><br /><strong>Leaving Our Silos and Developing Empathy For Consumers</strong><br />Like almost every other area of API operations there is no silver bullet to increasing API adoption and consumption. It requires getting to know your consumers, which is something that doesn&rsquo;t always fit with the limited budgets API providers operate under, and the scarce resources we have to profile, target, and understand our communities. It is a practice that will take regular investment and refinement, and having to make hard decisions about where to cut corners, as well as the places you just can&rsquo;t ignore. There are a lot of unknown unknowns in the world of API operations, and it is something that takes weekly and monthly review of where things are at, what we&rsquo;ve learned, and what adjustments we are going to make based upon the real world data we&rsquo;ve gathered about wha works. It is something that will grow and evolve as our awareness of our community grows and evolve. It is something that we will get better at after getting to know what are consumers are facing in their environments&mdash;forcing us further out of our silos and demanding that we develop more empathy for our users.<br /><br />API adoption is equal parts a provider and consumer concept. The design of our APIs, and the makeup of our operations will define our success when it comes to initial usage moving to adoption, and then evolving to sustained consumption. The understanding of our consumers and their needs will be more important than our own understanding of our resources, and our ability to publish reference documentation. Our success will ultimately depend on us being able to move from providing API resources to providing API solutions that can be easily applied to everyday problems our consumers face. Pushing us to evolve from just being good REST API designers, to being good experience and workflow API designers. Often times we just can&rsquo;t see the leap required for increased adoption and consumption, because we haven&rsquo;t walked in the shoes of our consumers, and we can&rsquo;t understand the distance that exists between onboarding with our APIs and putting our APIs to work in applications. This outward facing reality is something that most organizations don&rsquo;t realize hs to exist before you will realize any API success, because often times we are too insulated within our operations, unable to break through and reach our consumers in a meaningful way, helping us better relate to the challenges they face--making that critical connection that helps get them over the hump and begin putting our APIs to work.</p>

<p>I am preparing for a busy week of conversation with folks at API World, and with an inbox full of requests to meet and discuss the challenges API providers and service providers face, I want to work on preparing myself by loading up a variety of topics into my old brain. Some of the folks I&rsquo;m talking with have shared questions with me to prime our conversational pump, so in my way, I figured I&rsquo;d work through them here on the blog to help put these thoughts on the tip of my tongue.<br /><br />One interesting question I received this week is around how to get API providers to step up to agreeing to and respecting service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs). To provide more context, this involves APIs within a large enterprise, where there is a shared catalog of APIs for internal, as well as for external usage, and API providers can step up and publish their APIs for access within the enterprise API catalog--a situation where you have several challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting API Providers To Publish APIs </strong>- Not all groups are going to be competent and confident in publishing their API resources to a shared catalog.</li>
<li><strong>Getting API Providers To Publish Well Designed APIs - </strong>Not all groups have the skills and know how to publish well designed web APIs to a shared catalog.</li>
<li><strong>Getting API Providers To Care About Reliability and Performance - </strong>Most providers will see the publishing of the API as checking the box, not reliably operating.</li>
<li><strong>Getting API Providers To Care About API Consumers - </strong>Even with APIs published and reliably operated, most providers won&rsquo;t care about those who put to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is tough to find groups and teams who will fire on all cylinders in these areas, especially without a clear definition regarding what is required to play in this game. Since this question was asked in context of not just SLAs, but also SLOs, I would expand to include another acronym, because this is what we do in API land, and include SLI, or service level indicators. I feel like the Venn diagram of these three acronyms gets at some of the answers we might be looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Level Objective (SLO) - The goal we are both looking to reach with publishing of a service.</li>
<li>Service Level Agreement (SLA) - The agreement we enter into that governs the services we are publishing.</li>
<li>Service Level Indicator (SLI) - The metric(s) we are using to understand whether or not we are meeting goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Venn diagram reflects what I consider the politics of APIs. Getting different stakeholders together to agree upon what it means to provide and consume a digital resource. 90% of these scenarios playing out not he web are imbalanced, and too often favor the provider. In the situation I&rsquo;m talking about where these stakeholders are not just about providers and consumers agreeing, but also many disparate providers also agreeing, only further complicates an already challenging reality. Getting all providers to agree on the goal, metrics, and level of service around each API is not easy. Attempting to only one or two of these areas makes things even harder. If you haven&rsquo;t agreed upon the goal, and the metrics used to measure what is happening, the chances you are going to be successful with only a service level agreement (SLA), are significantly diminished. <br /><br />I would say that all API providers have to agree on the SLO, SLA, and SLI (Object, Agreement, and Indicator) for it to work. Getting this done is easier said than done. I would say we are going to need a new acronym for service level motivation (SLM) and map out how we are going to motivate all the API providers, otherwise they aren&rsquo;t always going to step up to any of this. We need to better understand what will motivate each API provider to not just publish their API, but invest in it being well designed, genuinely caring about the reliability, performance, an ultimately the consumers of the API. Otherwise a providers participation levels will be less that desirable, and never rise to the occasion. Without a clear map of who the API providers, and would-be API providers are, and what their motivations are, we will never actually bring them into alignment with the API platform, and other providers who are publishing there. <br /><br />One of the most frustrating realizations I&rsquo;ve had about doing APIs, is that not everyone cares about doing them well. Most API providers are just looking to check the box on a list of things leadership has asked them to deliver. A list that rarely involves monitoring, testing, performance, security, and the other areas that help ensure a certain level of service. Most API providers don&rsquo;t see the bigger picture of how and why they should be doing APIs, and they are just one task they were asked to accomplish as they work to get through their day or week. This is a condition that can be incrementally improved upon with a little more education around modern approaches to delivering APIs, as well as more formal articulation of why we are doing APIs, and working to build an API-driven platform. Getting API providers to step up to SLOs and SLAs by expanding their view of the API landscape, and bringing their motivations and objectives into closer alignment with the platform, and the community emerging to put APIs to use within applications.</p>

<p>I am having conversations with different organizations about where to start with APIs, pushing me to revisit some of my previous API landscape analysis work, <a href="https://api-evangelist.github.io/va-api-landscape/report/">like an evaluation of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) existing data and resource presence</a>. The process is born out of my <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/04/13/formalizing-my-approach-to-identifying-the-low-hanging-api-fruit/">low hanging fruit work</a>, identifying where the existing data sets for an organization already exist, shining a light on how and where an organization should begin with their API investment. Asking the question, if an organization is regularly publishing spreadsheets, CSV, JSON, and XML data to their website, why are these not available as APIs? A question that 98% of the enterprise organizations I come across do not have an adequate answer to. Possessing no formal strategy for how data is created, published, shared, centralized, distributed, or made available via APIs. Resulting in most organizations having no idea of where their digital assets are, and what their organizational capabilities are.<br /><br />My low hanging fruit process involves spidering a domain looking for CSV, JSON, and XML files, as well as identifying pages that have tables and forms on them. I&rsquo;ve done this for several organizations who have paid me, a handful of others where people who work there asked me to do it, as well as for organizations that I find interesting and work to identify the API low hanging fruit for my own purposes. I use it to gain a better understanding the digital capabilities of an organizations, but <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">it is also work that has got me in trouble after applying it to the University of Oklahoma, uncovering some spreadsheets that shouldn&rsquo;t have been made public, and attracting the attention of the institution&rsquo;s leadership</a>. It all worked out, but for a little while they were considering calling the FBI on me--it all provides an important story about how we manage our digital assets, and making sure we have a comprehensive strategy for how we publish data, what should be making available internally, with the public, and ideally via a centralized API strategy that is accessible to everyone, not just developers.<br /><br /><a href="https://api-evangelist.github.io/va-api-landscape/report/">The VA API Landscape Analysis and Roadmapping Project Report</a> is a pretty healthy look at how the API conversation should begin at most organizations. It doesn&rsquo;t just work to identify the existing data sets available across an organization, it shows the existing information architecture being rolled out intentionally or unintentionally, and will set the stage for what an API program will look like, including which resources are made available, and the vocabulary we employ to describe our ongoing, perpetual, digital transformations. I played around with the idea of doing landscape analysis as a business, making big part of how I operate API Evangelist, but after engaging with a handful of large enterprise organizations around the approach, I realize that most will not be able to process what is being given to them, let alone understand where to begin when it comes to course correcting. Some just see this process as an annoyance, seeing me as being too focused on their shortcomings, and failing to see that I am trying to help&mdash;not ever fully grasping what APIs are all about.<br /><br />If I was running a large institution, I would welcome someone spidering my website helping map out the API landscape that already exists across my company, organization, institution, or government agency. I would want to identify the spreadsheets that shouldn&rsquo;t be published as soon as they are published, and helping those who did it understand better practices when it comes to sharing their data. I would want to understand how my employees are creating, managing, sharing, and reporting around data. I would want to understand what all of my organizational capabilities are, and make sure I had them available as a single stack of machine readable, and human access API resources. Sadly, this isn&rsquo;t the state of things within most large organizations. Most people at lower levels don&rsquo;t care about the big picture, and many at the higher levels don&rsquo;t understand the importance of having a formal strategy for how data is managed, and that APIs are how you not only provide access to data, they are also how you get your data schema house in order. Making sense of the data sprawl that exists across your organization, and standardizing how these assets are published and accessed, providing further awareness into how data is being put to work across a company, organization, institution, or government agency.<br /><br />I will keep investing my API landscape analysis process. It is a cornerstone of my API research. Mapping out the landscape of existing API providers, as well as the more closeted API providers, is how I do what I do. I will keep using it to help organizations who are ready for an honest investment in their overall API journey understand the digital assets they already possess, and see the value of publishing them as simple, intuitive APIs that are part of a wider organizational API catalog. Ultimately it is up to each organization to want to begin stabilizing their domain landscape, and understand the relationship between our web presence and our API presence. Working to get more organized about our overall information architecture, and how API design is more about the structure of our organizations and what different teams produce each day, than it is actually about APIs. Understanding that our digital self is just a reflection of our physical self, and what we publish online tells a story about who we are behind the network router and firewall. And, you are either someone who is aware of this, and works to shape your physical and digital presence in a concerted way, or you just blindly operate hoping for the best in this new online reality we have created for ourselves.</p>

<p>I am preparing for a busy week of conversation with folks at API World, and with an inbox full of requests to meet and discuss the challenges API providers and service providers face, I want to work on preparing myself by loading up a variety of topics into my old brain. Some of the folks I&rsquo;m talking with have shared questions with me to prime our conversational pump, so in my way, I figured I&rsquo;d work through them here on the blog to help put these thoughts on the tip of my tongue.<br /><br />API providers are always wanting more advice on how to help developers be more successful when it comes to their valuable API resources. This is a question with one answer&mdash;get out of their way at every turn. Make it dead simple to signup, obtain access keys, and begin making calls on the API you make available. As technologists, we excel at over thinking things, and assuming everyone has the same view of the landscape as we do, when in reality we suck at explaining how we got here, and are notorious for leaving obstacles in our potential consumers way. Here are the main areas I invest in when it comes to reducing friction for developers when it comes to on-boarding with our APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Provide modern, complete, and up to date documentation for your API powered by an API definition (OpenAPI, Postman)&mdash;do not hand-roll your own documentation. Keep your summaries, and description simple, intuitive, and informative, and as yourself how you can get out of developers way with regular refinements.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Started </strong>- Craft a simple yet comprehensive getting started page for your new developers, breaking everything that is needed to get up and running. This is your opportunity to regularly revisit your on-boarding process, reduce friction, remove the sharp edges, and unnecessary steps.</li>
<li><strong>Run In Postman </strong>- If you have an OpenAPI, generate a Postman collection, and make sure it is refined, well organized, and make it available to your API developers using a Run in Postman button, allowing them to begin making calls to APIs within as few clicks as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong> - Invest in an environment definition to accompany your Postman collection, abstracting away authentication and the variables developers need to make their first API call, and put each API to work. Providing a blueprint of everything needed to go from Run in Postman, to seeing API responses in your client.</li>
<li><strong>Signup</strong> - Make your sign up process as frictionless as possible by reducing the amount of data you require, and the number of steps needed to signup, verify your identity, add an application, and obtain API keys. Put yourself in your consumers shoes and be honest about what it should take to get access to an entry level API key.</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - Provide a sandbox that new developers can play with, allowing developers to play with mocked APIs, complete with synthetic data. Providing a safe environment for developers to kick the tires and play with to see what is possible, then raise the bar when it comes to obtaining access to a production environment. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Service</strong> - Make everything in your API developer portal as self service as possible. Even if you need greater approval to gain access to production resources or higher rate limits, lower the bar for new users, and help them get what they need without asking. You can have greater requirements when it comes to further activating them, once you&rsquo;ve successfully on-boarded them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will stop there. I think keeping things short and concise is an important aspect of on-boarding someone, whether it is to an API, or just to a concept. How do you reduce friction with on-boarding is a question you shouldn&rsquo;t just ask once. Ask over and over until you have reduced the unnecessary steps involved in understanding what your API does, and how you get access to it. If you truly want to hone your skills in on-boarding new developers, pick twenty-five 3rd party APIs, and on-board with them. Don&rsquo;t just review their developer portals and documentation, actually sign-up and get the point where you are making API calls. See what it takes to do it well, and experience what it takes to do not so well.<br /><br />There is no definitive guide to on-boarding API developers. It will vary depending on the API you are offering, the consumers you are targeting, and the industry you operate in. However, there are some common practices that can help you speed up the process, and assist developers in reaching that AHA! moment much sooner. You can find these being applied in the most successful APIs out there like Stripe, Twilio, and others. The best ways in which you can refine your on-boarding practices is to learn the practices of other API providers, and to talk to your developers, and listen to the friction and challenges they encounter. If you invest in these two areas, and regularly re-ask this question, eventually you will get to a place where your on-boarding is smooth, and soothing that makes sense to a wide swath of the community that you are targeting.</p>

<p>I have written about this several times before, and it is something I will keep writing about until it comes true. Every API provider that employs OAuth for their APIs, show have a quick and easy, non-code way of obtaining a token for API access to your own account, and any generally available public APIs. <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">If you need an example of this in action, log into your GitHub account,&nbsp; click on your account settings, choose developer settings, and look at your personal access tokens</a>. With personal access tokens you can create a new token, drop it into the header of any API request, and begin making calls to the GitHub API&mdash;this is how it should be for all APIs that use OAuth. No OAuth dance to just at your own resources.<br /><br />OAuth isn&rsquo;t great, but its the best we got at the moment when it comes to authorization. It is also one of the biggest obstacles for many developers, and all non-developers, when it comes to putting API resources, and most egregiously their own data and content that is available via APIs, to work. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with pushing developers who are building an application to leverage the standard OAuth interfaces and flow. You definitely want to build a Postman collection for them, and make signing up, and adding an application to obtain your key as frictionless as possible. But, for quickly on-boarding developers, and non-developers quickly to be able to play around, kick the tires, and understand what an API does, you should be providing personal access tokens. <br /><br />The personal access token topic is one of the reasons I do API Evangelist. So I can find incremental improvements in the core standards and technologies we already use, that make our lives easier&mdash;then beat the drum about why everyone should do it. This is a topic I should be publishing a story about every quarter until I see movement by providers. Helping API provider reduce friction when it comes to authentication an authorization is one of the most important things we can be doing to help increase the adoption of our APIs amongst developers, and more importantly it will be how we get the non-technical normals on-board. Using APIs to get at the data and content that matters to them. Allowing them to solve everyday business problems they face in their day to day world. This is when APIs are going to to level up when it comes to solving real world challenges, and not just be in the back pocket of programmers.<br /><br />I should be able to signup for any online service, grab a personal access token, or ready to go Postman environment populated with my personal access token, grab a Postman collection dedicated to the use case that suits me, plug I my environment and be making API calls&mdash;within 10 minutes or less. That is the API on-boarding reality I would like to see for ALL online platforms. I do not want an online account that doesn&rsquo;t have APIs, personal access tokens, and Postman collections for all their most common workflows. I know. My bar is pretty high, but a guy can hope and dream right? If I keep hollering about this stuff, maybe eventually, some day, I will get what I want. I like to think of it as API manifestation&mdash;taking the pieces of the space that make me happy and harass everyone to into implementing them.</p>

<p>I am getting ready for my first API event as the Chief Evangelist for Postman&mdash;API World next week. To help prepare us, Joyce Lin (<a href="https://twitter.com/PetuniaGray">@PetuniaGray</a>), fellow developer relations team member shared some Postman templates with me, equipping us with some of the most useful examples of using Postman she uses in her talks. I thought I was a proficient Postman collection user until I began working at Postman, where I quickly realized that I have a lot of work ahead of me to learn all the ways of doing interesting API things with Postman collections and templates. Making them perfect little portable learning objects, demonstrating how to accomplish a handful of API-driven tasks, or even more relevant workflows.<br /><br />You can find Postman templates in the Postman API development environment (ADE) by clicking on the big orange &ldquo;New&rdquo; button in the top left corner of the application&mdash;it is a tab on the popup window that comes up. You can browse by category, or you can search using a keyword. Here are three of the templates that Joyce shared with us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visualizer Examples</strong> - This collection contains two sample templates for visualizing data returned as part of an API response, one rendering data as a table, and the other renders data as a bar graph.</li>
<li><strong>Intro to Writing Tests </strong>- This collection contains examples of tests that you can use to automate your testing process. Includes basic test syntax, examples of API tests, and integration tests.</li>
<li><strong>Working with GraphQL </strong>- This collection introduces you to the GraphQL functionality that Postman supports, demonstrating how Postman can be used for more than just working with web APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>While playing around with Postman templates, I came across a handful of others that I think are interesting in what they deliver, but also in the way that they demonstrate how Postman templates, and the resulting collections can be used for so much more than just API reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MOCKS: fake it till you make it </strong>- Use the Postman API to generate and manage mock servers, and automate the virtualization of your API infrastructure as part of an API first approach.</li>
<li><strong>Postman Expert Training - EX1.1</strong> - Collection to demonstrate the use of environment variables and their behavior in the Collection Runner</li>
<li><strong>Reverse engineering an API </strong>- From inspecting a single HTTP request to monitoring a stream of requests, here's how you can use Postman to capture and visualize this HTTP traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Extract data to chain requests </strong>- Extract data from the response. This is useful to capture authorization, session, or cookie data or parse information (e.g. XML or JSON) available within the response body to chain requests and use this data in a subsequent request.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find all of these Postman templates by using the search available in the templates tab. I&rsquo;m going to be going through all the different templates, better understanding the different approaches behind them&mdash;reverse engineering why they matter. Templates are a pretty compelling way to rise above the purely reference nature of most API definitions like OpenAPI and Postman collections, demonstrating how Postman collections break into new territory and help us define workflows, tutorials, and other interesting and useful ways to sharing useful and executable nuggets of API value.<br /><br />If you want to shift your view of the API landscape I recommend playing around with Postman templates. Find one or two that you find interesting, and begin pushing your understanding of collections into new territory. I am looking forward to getting more proficient in using them, and be able to quickly whip up different types of workflows, and useful API-driven solutions for developers and non-developers. I feel like they represent a lot of the potential creativity and imagination I feel was missing from Swagger and OpenAPI. Not the it wasn&rsquo;t possible, but I think the tooling enablement that was going on was very narrow (docs, codgen)--lacking imagination. Postman collections and templates represent a more empowering approach to API definitions, taking them beyond just reference implementations, and help us truly see the value of individual as well as multiple APIs working in concert.</p>

title: 'API First With Legacy APIs'

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/old-barn-old-barn-1500-alberto-giacometti.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is common to think API-first just applies to new green field APIs being developed. However, I&rsquo;d say that it should become a priority with addressing legacy APIs as well. I&rsquo;m working to evolve my tagging API to better meet my current needs for not just tagging my blog posts, curated news, organizations, links, patents, and other resources, but also begin to apply to my OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and other machine readable artifacts. I need to do a major revision on it, but first I need to better map out what I have. My tagging API has been around since 2011, and since nobody but me uses I have never created an OpenAPI, or documented it in any way, so my first move is to map out what I have.<br /><br />I got to work creating a Postman collection for my API, mapping out the surface area of the legacy version of my tagging API. I needed to understand the paths and variables I had on this API that came together over a couple of years, and has had several tweaks and adjustment since it was first conceived. Currently&nbsp; it has the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tag</strong> - A single word or phrase that adds to my tag vocabulary.</li>
<li><strong>Children</strong> - I can relate tags to tags, allowing me to infinitely group.</li>
<li><strong>URLs</strong> - I can associate multiple URLs with any single tag.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong> - I can add an image for each of the tags that I define.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation</strong> -&nbsp; An index of words I transform automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> - An entire diction of all the words for verifying tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>I regularly apply my tags across all of my primary resources. I depend on my tags to help me organize information, and make sense of my API research. I&rsquo;m going to keep the tag and children endpoints basically the same, but I&rsquo;m going to change how I handle URLs and images.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m also looking to make some modifications on the way I transform words to better deal with plural words&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t very smart right now. Anyways, I completed a Postman for the current state of my tagging API, now I need to create a duplicate of it, and get to work on the next version.<br /><br />In addition to changing some of my existing APIs, I need to add some new paths, helping me be more efficient when it comes to managing and refining my tag vocabulary. I am using the new API feature of Postman to define, design, and develop the new version of my tagging API, adding the following resources to the stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counts - Maintaining usage counts for all tags, and the resources they are applied.</li>
<li>Ranking - I&rsquo;m now ranking my tags, like I rank and sort all the other resources I track on.</li>
<li>Automated - Tags that are automatically applied have a different configuration in my world.</li>
<li>Manual - Tags that I manually apply have different configuration and value across the platform.</li>
<li>Refinement - There will be a number of new resources dedicated to helping refine my vocabulary.</li>
<li>Publish - I depend on tags to publish content across my network of sites, and I want to manage better.</li>
</ul>
<p>I now have a complete definition for version 2.0 of my tagging API available as a Postman collection. It has the changes I&rsquo;m making to the existing APIs, as well as the addition of the new paths. Each individual API is defined, mocked and documented, and I haven&rsquo;t written any code. Since I don&rsquo;t have any other stakeholders, other than me, myself, and I, the feedback loop on this one will involve me building some UI elements against the mocks. Helping me understand if my API design is going to work for what I&rsquo;m looking to accomplish in my overall tagging processes, including the new reporting on the counts, ranking, and other elements. If I need to make any tweaks I will just go back into the Postman collection, make the changes I want, and adjust my UI, and repeat until I&rsquo;m satisfied.<br /><br />This is a major revision to my tagging API, and since I&rsquo;m the only user I am not too worried about backward breaking changes. I will spend some time crafting tests to check that every path within my collection is checked to ensure the proper schema is returned. Then once I actually publish my API into production, I can just switch out the mock URL for the production URL, and my tests should work&mdash;if I have done my job as a developer. Allowing me to map out my legacy infrastructure, move them forward a version, and establish and then establish an API contract for what is expected of them in production&mdash;then firing up a monitor to execute the tests daily to ensure I&rsquo;m meeting my new API contract terms. Helping me establish an API-first contract approach to rapidly, and more efficiently moving my legacy infrastructure to a better state.</p>

<p class="p1">As I work my way through the features of Postman and work to bring it all into alignment with my existing storytelling around APIs, one of the areas I&rsquo;ve been slowly adding to my collective API research is "collaboration". I setup <a href="http://collaboration.apievangelist.com"><span class="s1">collaboration.apievangelist.com</span></a> a while back to help track on what different companies are up to, as I do with any other area of the API landscape. Collaboration is a pretty big tent to operate within, with many different interpretations of what it means, and a growing number of examples out there regarding how it can be done. While there are many features of Postman that get me excited, I&rsquo;d say the collaboration features around Postman collections, workspaces, and the API development platform is what I wold call the next killer feature&mdash;let me explain a little more about why.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the things that attracted me to the potential of APIs back in 2010 when I first started doing this, was the way APIs brought me out of my shell. As a database administrator I had grown accustom to be siloed. Just leave me alone. Let me do what I do. Keep those business people at a distance. The only problem with this reality was I kept getting further and further away from the business problems I was working to solve, which resulted in some pretty catastrophic mistakes. Then I made the mistake of deciding to take management route with my career, which then resulted in the opposite problem&mdash;I was too close to the business problems, and too far away from the technical solutions. I wasn&rsquo;t coding anymore. I couldn&rsquo;t deliver the solutions I was needing. I realized that I needed a bridge between business and development, and APIs seemed like the solution to me.</p>
<p class="p1">APIs force us out of our bubbles. It forces us to integrate with other internal groups, partners, or public users. The killer feature of APIs is interoperability, allowing us to have a conversation about the resources we are making available. When done well, it forces us to establish feedback loops between provider and consumer, and ideally between IT and business unites. APIs are about collaboration, so it makes sense that the API lifecycle should be about collaboration and working together, throughout the entire API lifecycle. 95% of the API challenges we face are human problems, not technical ones, making collaboration the grease in the API gears. Any API service providers that invest in collaboration, syncing, sharing, workspaces, and other human enablement solutions alongside their primary, will do well in this climate of exponential API creation and adoption.</p>
<p class="p1">APIs aren&rsquo;t meant to be consumed in silos, and they shouldn't be developed in silos. The API lifecycle needs collaboration at every stop along the way, and seamlessly with the many different tools that might be in use by developers. This is why API definition formats like OpenAPI and Postman collections have made such an impact. You can import and export these API definitions into almost every modern API service or tool out there, the product is that most people are still sharing API definitions via email, chat, or hopefully at least Git. As API architects, designers, developers, and evangelists, we do not have a lot of solutions that help us not just maintain the API definitions, but also to reduce friction throughout their lifecycle. This will make any features that enable seamless, effortless, frictionless collaboration something that will make a big impact on how we get business done in the next wave of API expansion--ising up to be more of a killer feature than any direct API functionality I can think of currently.</p>

<p>I regularly receive emails from random strangers, as well as known individuals who I am working with, that contain JSON responses from an API request, asking for some analysis, troubleshooting, or feedback on how an API works (or doesn&rsquo;t). I even receive Microsoft Word or Google Docs with API responses pasted in them, attempting to articulate something how an API works, or to solicit some feedback from me. If I am going to share an API response with another user, I&rsquo;m going to start with a Postman Collection, and secondarily share a link to a GitHub Gist, so the practice of emailing around is something I&rsquo;m actively trying to nip in the bud with some storytelling and education.<br /><br />First, let&rsquo;s start with the quickest, easiest, and most reusable approach to sharing API responses&mdash;sharing a Postman collection. This is the most informative and educational way to get the job done, allowing you to actually make the request you desire, save not just the response, but also the details of the request, and share with any other user. This is important, because anyone you are sharing your response with can actually re-run the request, maybe change some parameters or other values, hit save, and share not just the results, but also their changes back to the original user. Plus Postman allows you share in multiple ways, publishing documentation and a run in Postman button, via a simple link, or if the user is part of your team, you can share the collection into a workspace that the team member has access to. This is the most productive way to be sharing API responses. Do this please. Stop sharing responses via email.<br /><br />Next, if you are going to insist on using email, just send a link to your response. Ideally you are sharing the link to the Postman collection, but at the very least, publish the JSON response to a public or private GitHub Gist, or other platform, and only send the link to anyone you are looking to share the API response with. Pasting JSON responses in Word, or emails can tweak the formatting, and depending on the email platforms and clients you are using, the response can be transformed in transit, or when it is being displayed. Email just isn&rsquo;t an optimal channel for sharing machine readable files, and you are better off emailing links to anything that is JSON, YAML, CSV, or other machine readable format. Keeping emails about text, or maybe some images and screenshots, relying on more definition friendly tooling for actually presenting and working with JSON responses.<br /><br />The more I work with enterprise users across different industries, the more emails I see sharing API responses and API definitions. I have even seen this from individuals who are using Postman to make API requests, and demo API functionality in sprint demos. They are just unaware of the sharing functionality built into Postman, and are operating Postman in isolation. Something that I&rsquo;ve seen over and over at larger enterprise organizations&mdash;regularly reminding me that everyone is using Postman, and few are using to collaborate and work in concert. Relying on established tools like email to do what they do. Being extremely inefficient when it comes to daily operations, but also increasing the friction that exists around the delivery and integration of APIs. If you encounter team members who are emailing you API responses and definitions, make sure you don&rsquo;t shame them, and take a few moments out of your day to help introduce them to more productive ways of engage with team members when it comes to the feedback loop that is essential for delivering reliable APIs at scale.</p>

<p>One of the biggest benefits from the evolution of the API management over the last decade was the visibility and awareness it gave us around who is using our APIs. While this is something that is playing out over and over as each mainstream company wakes up to the potential of APIs. As I get back to working with companies on their API strategy I&rsquo;m beginning to realize that a similar type of awareness is beginning to play out internally, but instead of developing an awareness of who is consuming APIs, it is more about gaining visibility into who is building APIs across distributed groups and teams. Helping API leadership within organizations get a better handle on their overall API lifecycle, and begin to establish more meaningful metrics about how valuable API resources are being delivered.<br /><br />Most of the organizations that I go into do not possess any formal strategy for how APIs are brought to life. Some have API catalogs or directories where you can find APIs, but they are rarely complete, and might provide the basics of API discoverability, but provide little visibility into the teams behind them. Most of the time, APIs do not make it into the catalog until the API makes its way into a production state, leaving it pretty impossible to discover APIs that are being planned, designed, or in the process of being developed, and there isn&rsquo;t any way to understand which teams are planning APIs, or beginning to work on the development of new resources. Leaving API leadership working to paint a more complete picture of what teams are working on, what processes are I place for developing APIs, and how efficient groups are when it comes to delivering critical resources.<br /><br />Some of the folks I am talking to are relying on the tooling they&rsquo;ve adopted to provide them with some of the metrics they require to gain more visibility into how teams operate (ie. GitHub, Postman, etc.). Most API providers have invested in API management infrastructure, which provides a handful of ways to understand what is being developed, depending on how you are using it, but most of these metrics are externally focused on who is consuming these resources. Next, the companies I&rsquo;m talking with depend on a variety of other developer tools to piece together a fragmented picture of how things are coming together across the earlier phases of the API lifecycle. Similar to 2008 through 2012 with he lack of awareness providers had into who was using their APIs, 2018 through 2022 will be all about gaining awareness of who is building your APIs.<br /><br />How do you map out your organizational structure as it pertains to API development? How do you keep track of the teams who are planning, defining, designing, and developing your APIs? Do you have any formal process for understand what is being built, and addressing the redundancy of resources and schema being developed? If you have any formal approach, do you have any metrics on team performance, or the speed at which APIs move through the development process? As you can tell, I have a lot of questions regarding our lack of visibility into how APIs are brought to life. I&rsquo;m looking to understand how companies are investing in being more organized and efficient in how APIs are brought to life. I will be asking folks these questions while at API World in San Jose next week, pushing on API providers to be honest about the visibility they have into what their teams are up to when it comes to delivering API infrastructure.</p>

<p>API folks are great at being passionate about the technologies they believe in. This is great for them, but it isn&rsquo;t always great for the folks who aren&rsquo;t quite as passionate and are just working to understand the API landscape and make sense of the different patterns, services, and tooling out there. One of the areas I&rsquo;ve been heavily investing in as part of my API industry research over the last couple of years is to help people understand how they can invest in a diverse API toolbox, and develop the awareness they need to be successful in designing, developing, and delivering APIs at scale, for a variety of use cases. Counteracting some of the more vendor focused storytelling in the space that works to confuse, distort, and shame folks for their approach to delivering APIs&mdash;providing a more pragmatic view of how we should doing APIs.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve had a front row seat for several new technologies to emerge within the API sector, and with each one there is always an aggressive group of technologists who like to employ a pretty old and tired API trope that the new technology is the future, and what already is represent the wrong, or out of date way of doing things. It is what vendors do to dethrone what came before, and try to get a foothold within markets. Playing on a popular belief that technology is perpetually moving faster than ever before, and you have to always be buying into what is next, otherwise you will miss out on the future, and be eaten alive by your competition. If a vendor, blogger, or analyst is saying that one API technology will completely replace another API technology, and the previous way is the wrong way, I recommend moving on, finding other sources of information to educate yourself and inform your organization&rsquo;s overall API strategy.<br /><br /><strong>REST Is Where You Begin</strong><br />The API haters love to bash on RESTful design practices. However, the reality of the matter is that REST is where you should begin your journey, and will remain a staple of the API sector. Sure, REST has many flaws and shortcomings, but it still is the lowest cost, simplest, and most ubiquitous approach to delivering APIs that will be usable by the widest possible audience. If you are new to APIs, REST is where you should be spending your time learning about the API landscape, and understanding what is possible. The number of REST APIs, also known as web or HTTP APIs dwarfs the number of other API design patterns in use. Ignore all the REST API haters, and make sure you properly educate yourself about why it is the dominant API design pattern, and how it will help you lay the foundation you need for your API platform.<br /><br /><strong>Hypermedia Reflects the Web</strong><br />Another API design pattern people love to hate on is what is known as HATEOS or simple hypermedia. Ironically, many hypermedia believers have also fallen prey to the same trope, and declared that hypermedia is the one right way of delivering APIs, and you should ignore all other patterns. In reality, hypermedia is extremely useful for specific types of APIs that rely on affordances we take for granted from the web. Hypermedia makes sense for content centric and media focused APIs. You&rsquo;ll find TV, movie, news, and other media APIs employing hypermedia very successfully, providing a very rich developer experience, providing links, formal media types, and other structural elements that help make for a better API. Like other API patterns, hypermedia will begin to diminish in value for some types of APIs, and will prove to be challenging for newer developers who may not be familiar with the increased complexity and robustness of the approach to delivering APIs. Hypermedia is definitely a pattern you should be learning about to add and round off your API design toolbox.<br /><br /><strong>Schema Powered GraphQL </strong><br />GraphQL is another approach to APIs that people love to say is going to replace REST entirely, but in reality it is just another approach to have in your toolbox, helping you cater to the specific needs of a known audience of consumers who need more access and control over the schema behind an API. GraphQL excels at providing access to complex backend database schema, and goes a long ways to empowering developers who are familiar with the schema to move quicker in delivering applications. Like hypermedia, GraphQL can prove to be a challenge for new users who are not familiar with the underlying schema, and why some of the added complexity that exists. GraphQL is not for every API project, and should live alongside other design patterns in your diverse API toolbox. When you have the right project, and the right developer audience, you should be looking at GraphQL, but make sure your audience is up to speed on your schema and tooling, and the reasons for putting to use are in alignment between the platform and consumers.<br /><br /><strong>gRPC Delivering Performance</strong><br />An industrial grade approach to delivering APIs that has gained in popularity and adoption lately is gRPC, and open standard out of Google. gRPC excels at delivering digital resources at scale internally and in B2B environments. gRPC tends to take advantage of HTTP/2, and represents the evolution of the HTTP standard for many. It is fast. Much faster than REST over HTTP 1.1. If performance and volume are major concerns, then you should be considering gRPC. However, like hypermedia and GraphQL there is a cognitive load associated with getting up and going for some developers, and the design patterns in play aren&rsquo;t always as intuitive, and easy to learn as REST. gRPC has its place in the toolbox, and is something you should be thinking about as you develop your toolbox, and your API strategy. Adding another valuable API pattern to your arsenal, allowing you to think critically about which tool is right for the job you have in front of you.<br /><br /><strong>Event-Driven Approaches</strong><br />Finally, there area number of event-driven approaches to doing APIs, ranging from Webhooks to Kafka, providing developers with a variety of patterns to apply when looking to make their API infrastructure more resilient, real-time, and responsive to consumers needs. If you are looking to get your feet wet in the event-driven space, I recommend beginning with web hooks, and augmenting your HTTP APIs with outbound hooks that push data to consumers when the most meaningful events occur across a platform. If you are looking to dive right into the event-driven space and you have the expertise and bandwidth to properly evaluate new technologies, I recommend firing up Kafka, NATS, or the other industrial grade solutions available on the market today. Event-driven approaches to delivering API infrastructure reflect the future, and are present across the most mature API providers out there. It is definitely where you should be headed with your API operations, but how you get there may take time, and require a significant amount of learning before you can effectively get what you are looking done. <br /><br /><strong>Invest In Your API Toolbox</strong><br />If you truly want to be an API professional, then get to work developing your API toolbox, and equipping it with a range of solutions. Don&rsquo;t spend time listening to the API haters, and the most dogmatic voices out there. Don&rsquo;t let yourself be restricted by any single pattern, or be held prisoner by your own dogmatic beliefs. There is no single right way of doing APIs, there are only a suite of patterns and approaches for you to consider applying to the API challenge you face. As you are reading blogs about APIs, remember it is never REST vs. GraphQL, or Kafka vs REST, or Hypermedia vs. REST &mdash; it is REST and Hypermedia and GraphQL and gRPC and event-driven, as well as any other useful patterns you might come across and can successfully apply to your operations. When learning about any of the technologies I&rsquo;ve discussed, make sure you spend the time to find the right sources of information regarding the pros and cons of each approach, and regularly take time to step back and consider the bigger picture.<br /><br />Doing APIs well takes experience. Being able to competently switch from technology to technology takes confidence, and an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each solution. You will never solve your business problems by jumping on bandwagons and subscribing to the hype in the API space. It can be hard to truly see what is hype and what is reality sometimes, but with the right amount of work, you can develop your own sense for what matters. Develop your network of trusted sources of information, and spend time asking questions of providers, practitioners, and analysts about not just the happy paths, but also the less than happy paths that exist when employing any particular technology. Invest in your teams knowledge. Invest in your toolbox. Build prototypes and proofs of concepts. Don&rsquo;t just make decisions on the latest wave of hype and excitement coming from the online API boombox&mdash;eventually you will find your way forward.</p>

<p>One of the high level API concepts I have been championing for a couple of years now is helping API providers move from a code-first approach, to an API design first, or as I like to call it, and API define first approach. The practice of crafting an API definition, applying common API design practices, mocking, documentation, and soliciting feedback on your API before you ever begin writing any code, or publishing your API to a gateway. It is a concept that has clear benefits, and has captured the imagination of many API providers, but it is something that is easier said than done when it comes to actually pushing teams to make a complete shift to being API define / design first--leaving me thinking deeply about what is holding teams back.<br /><br />Most API architectects, designers, and developers agree that if you can successfully define, design, mock, document, and engage with stakeholders before you formalize your APIs, deploying as code, and launching into production, you will be better off. By doing this, you are shortening the feedback loop with other API stakeholders regarding what they API should and shouldn&rsquo;t do, and increasing efficiency, agility, while saving resources when it comes to delivering API infrastructure. The biggest challenge with this approach is that once you are ready to actually deliver an API, you still end up having to write code, a process which can potentially orphan the agreed upon API contract that was crafted as part of the API define / design first process, and thus the code then becomes the truth. Leaving most developers wondering where the benefits are when it comes to moving to an API define / design first approach. <br /><br />There are some API gateways that will let you take an OpenAPI, or other API definition and publish your API, and there are server-side code generation solutions for taking API definitions and producing much of the code you need to deploy, but both approaches still require finish work to make it all reality. There are other cloud services that help you with this process as part of a proprietary workflow, but there are no universal, or complete open source solutions that help you go from API definitions to fully functioning API in one or two clicks. Much of the friction holding us back when it comes to automating and streaming API definition from API definitions is the complexity we accept in our database structures, as well as the designs of our APIs, and everything in between. Always requiring the finish work to actually realize the entire surface area of an API, wire it up to backend resources.<br /><br />I would say that other challenges introduced are more about dogmatic developer beliefs, than it is about any actual realities. Developers like to write code. Many do not fully understand the benefits of going API define / design first, and have perceptions that the process may be about diminishing their importance and role in the workflow, leaving them more interested in being an obstacle to change, rather than embracing an API define / design first approach. Most times you can overcome this with some education and training, and helping developers see the wider development picture, which also includes the business realities of delivering and supporting the API in production. Going beyond what each individual developers will normally see, and involve them in more of the overall API lifecycle, showing them how wide the feedback loop is between developing an API and getting the feedback from consumer, then applying that to the next version. Something that can be dramatically reduced and optimized with an API define / design first approach.<br /><br />In my conversations with API providers I am going to be asking more questions about how far along in their shift to being API define / design first, and gather more information what the obstacles were that prevented them from getting there. What the friction along thew way looked like. Working to reach out to a diverse range of API providers who I now are at different points in their journeys. Including some who haven&rsquo;t even began their journey, and are still just in the early phases of learning about and discussing how to go API define / design first. I am guessing that it is like other aspects of the API sector, and folks are just needing more real-world examples of how to do it, with clear guides, tutorials, and other resources that help them figure things out. Along with a regular drumbeat of stories that help them sell the concept to their leadership, and position things in terms of time, resources, and money save by going to an API define / design first&mdash;shifting organizational behavior from a code-first way of getting work done, to something more efficient.</p>

<p><a href="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/guides/regions/api-evangelist-tyk-api-industry-guide-10-2019.pdf"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/guides/regions/industry-guide-tyk-screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a><a href="https://tyk.io/">Tyk</a> first asked to sponor this guide over a year ago, and I finally found the bandwidth this summer to <a href="http://regions.apievangelist.com/">move my API region research</a> to a point where I could produce the quality of output I require for my guides. Like my other API industry guides, this is an executive summary of a single stop along the API lifecycle to think about when planning your own API strategy, but this guide is dedicated to understanding how different geographical regions are influencing how we think about APIs. This isn't something that is unique to APIs, and the multi-regional availability of applications, infrastructure, and APIs is born out of the cloud evolution--with the big three (AWS, Google, and Azure) dominating the landscape, and who are rolling out new availbility regions at a break neck pace. Making it very realistic and cost effective to deliver API infrastructure in a variety geographic regions.</p>
<p>To help API providers understand the growing importance of how geographic regions can be leveraged, I distilled down my API regions research into the follow areas, resulting in this guide that is full of considerations to share with your team when thinking about how to go global with your API operatons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regional API Deployment</strong> - Setting the stage for the regional deployment of your APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing Fundamentals</strong> - Acknowledging the role the cloud computing providers play.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Service Availability </strong>- Looking at the uneven landscape of services that are available.</li>
<li><strong>Other Regional API Services</strong> - Moving beyond the cloud computing providers to understand regional availability.</li>
<li><strong>Why Deploy APIs In Multiple Regions</strong> - Looking at the reasons behind regional API deployment and availability.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Region API Deployment Considerations</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong> - What you should be thinking before you deploy in multiple regions.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong> - Understanding how availability is impacted with different regions.</li>
<li><strong>Operations</strong> - Considering how you should be operating across various regions.</li>
<li><strong>Orchestration</strong> - Looking at how you can orchestrate across your regions.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Thinking about what it costs, and revenue opportunities with regions.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong> - Sharing a look at how we can govern API operations across regions.</li>
<li><strong>Legal</strong> - Making sure we are considering the legal implications of this approach.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong> - Ensuring that our platforms are healthy with the assistance of regions.</li>
<li><strong>Outreach</strong> and Support - Making sure you can actually support multiple API regions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Break Existing Consumers Down By Region</strong> - Begin by understanding your existing consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Awareness Of API Performance Across Regions </strong>- Making sure you have the awarness necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Starting Out Small With A Single Region</strong> - Start with baby steps, then incrementally go bigger.</li>
<li><strong>Thinking Beyond A Single API Region</strong> - Getting out of your single region API mindset.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't want to just repeat the information that is already available on cloud providers website about regional availability. I wanted to actually think deeply about the challenges and benefits of deploying API infrastructure in multiple geographic regions. It is important that API providers think about the bigger picture when planning to go global, or diving into specific regions, and not assume that their cloud infrastructure will do everything they need. As with my other API industry guides I wanted to make sure API providers had what they need to understand the high level considerations for regional API delivery, before they start embarking on their regional expansion journey.</p>
<p>In this guide I talk about the different reasons why API providers will want to deploy into different regions in this guide, highlight the opportunistic reasons involving growing your business, but I also talk about the growing imperative to think about your operations at a regional level due to the growing data sovereignty and regulatory climating emerging around the world. Hopefully this guide can help elevate how you are thinking about deploying and operating within multiple geographic regions, and if this is a journey that you are embarking on within your organization I'd love to learn more about your approach, your concerns, and add to my API regions toolbox--helping others learn from your successes and challenges you have had along the way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on my strategy as the Chief Evangelist at Postman. We have a kick ass developer relations team and a passionate community of users who generate tutorials and other content, and while I will be working to help rolls up my sleeves and contribute in these areas, supporting the team, but I know they have this part of the conversation covered well. To augment what is already happening, I am working to develop a voice and approach that is uniquely mine, built on what I&rsquo;ve been doing as the API Evangelist, but something that can be evolved to have that unique Postman presence. One of the areas I&rsquo;m including in my approach is a heavy focus on non-developers, but specifically tryiing to make content, talks, and other resources that decision makers and other business users will benefit from.<br /><br />While the tutorials and other technical storytelling are critical, one aspect of evangelism that isn&rsquo;t always addressed by API providers and service providers is content that is accessible and relevant to business and technical leaders. Helping them understand why APIs are important, and get enough information on various stops along the API lifecycle, and other important aspects of delivering APIs reliably, ensuring they are making informed decisions when it comes building teams, crafting budgets, and other important aspects of operations that will make or break your API program. If your leadership isn&rsquo;t on board with what is going on, the chances you will be able to realize the change you envision with your API effort will be drastically diminished, and you will be always struggling to stay afloat and properly invest in what is needed to find your way forward in any meaningful way.<br /><br />I love being down in the weeds with APIs. Making requests to existing APIs, and designing new and interesting APIs. However, I also realize the importance of me zooming out, thinking about how business leaders can be engage to make sure they are up to speed on the how and why we are doing things, so that we are all on the same page when it comes to defining what API success is across teams. I have been talking with a variety of organizations about their struggles getting the attention of management and leadership, and will be working on more stories of how people are keeping their leadership and teams up to speed on what is happening within the organization, but also across the wider industry landscape. If you have had meaningful successes or failures at getting leadership on board with your API vision, I&rsquo;d love to hear more about it&mdash;I am happy to tell your story publicly, or keep things anonymized if you, or your company prefers.<br /><br />As I work through my notes from existing conversation, as well as past research and discussions, I&rsquo;m putting on my &ldquo;sell this to management&rdquo; hat, trying to craft a view of the API lifecycle from which organizational leadership will want to look at things. I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll be consistently thinking about how to more coherently measure what is happening, and be looking at everything in terms of efficiency, velocity, and money saved. In the end, I&rsquo;m looking to craft a guide that anyone can take within a small business, enterprise, government agency, or other entity, and put to work helping them plot a course forward. Setting the tone for how I reach out to a mainstream business audience when it comes to talking about the API lifecycle and how Postman is essential to not just developer success, but also for business stakeholders when it comes to defining API operations across your company, organization, institution, or government agency.</p>

image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/socrata_apis_json.png
---
<p>I crafted a pretty useful APIs.json index over the weekend. I thought it provided a pretty robust look <a href="http://apisjson.org/">at what APIs.json can do when it comes to providing machine readable API catalogs</a>. This is a project I had started a couple years back, but just found some bandwidth to move forward--providing a complete APIs.json of t<a href="https://dev.socrata.com/">he Socrata platform of data and APIs for city, county, state, and federal government</a>. The APIs.json for the Socrata platform provides everything you need to get up and running with Socrata's discovery and metadata API, as well as the 200+ domains they support when it comes to providing public data access.</p>
<p>Here is the APIs.json index in it's entirty. Note the include options, which provide references to the 200+ domains, where you will find entirely separate APIs.json indexes for each domain, complete with JSON Schema, JSON examples, OpenAPI, and Postman collecitons for reach individual data set being made available--providing a pretty robust look at what APIs.json brings to the table.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/607791b15b5221a0fd30e7f81afb1044.js"></script>
<p>I will be adding more properties to each of the individual public data domain APIs.json indexes, linking to the other resources that Socrata provides--more tightly coupling APIs.json with all available resources. I am using the same approach to map out the <a href="https://getdkan.org/">DKAN</a> and <a href="https://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> ecosystems, layering these dimensions of the public data universe into my master catalog of the sector. I am also going to play around with creating overall OpenAPI and Postman collections for reach individual domain, breaking individual data sets into groups defined by tags. My biggest challenge here is not all of the data sets are properly tagged, so I need to work some tagging voodoo on each my APIs.json indexes, harvesting meaningful tags from the title, description, and other meta data for the public data I've catalogued.</p>
<p>This is timely work, as I prepare to refresh the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a> websites, and underlying specifications. As I prepare for heading up to <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/asc-2019/">the API Specification Conference (ASC) in Vancouver</a> this month I'm flexing all my API definition knowledge, and dusting off my own specifications that I should be spending more time moving forward. The APIs.json for Socrata, and other large scope API definition work I've been doing with Schema.org, and other industry related API and data standards are all part of a wider push for me to crank up momentum when it comes to what I"m evanaglizing when it comes to schema, specifications, definitions, enumerators, policy, and the other machine readable, contract-driven aspecs of what we do with APIs.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/yosemite-yosemite-marcel-duchamp.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am working my way through <a href="https://www.postman.com/use-cases/developer-onboarding">the use cases on the Postman website</a>, getting familiar with how their customers are using the platform. They have some very straightforward use cases that they have assembled based upon actual ways in which their customers are applying the value they bring to the table. Developer on-boarding is a particular fascinating one for me because it really touches on one of the most difficult aspects of APIs&mdash;getting someone new up to speed on what is going on. Getting people to go from zero to understanding what an API does and actually making API calls is how you begin to realize the value from new users, developers, employees, or anyone you are trying to reach with your API operations.</p>
<p>Postman has broken down the developer on-boarding use case into four easy to follow areas, breaking out some of the ways in which Postman is being used to get new users up to speed in a very hands on way, that really is the best way to learn an API in a way that will ensure it is much more sticky then just reading documentation. Their <a href="https://www.postman.com/use-cases/developer-onboarding">developer on-boarding use case</a> provides what you need to quickly reach new users, and keep them engaged with the API lifecycle, allowing you to engage with developers who are actually contributing to the delivery of an API, or with consumers who will be putting it to use within their particular applications. Here are the core building blocks of how Postman is being used when it comes to developer on boarding&mdash;on both the provider and consumer side of things.</p>
<p><strong>1. Understand the API</strong> - Making sense of internal or external APIs using the API browser environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore the API </strong>- Being able to kick the tires and see what an APIs I all about, making sense of internal or external APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Import API Specification </strong>- Import a Swagger, OpenAPI, RAML and other specification and play with an existing API definition.</li>
<li><strong>Import a Postman Collection </strong>- Grabbing an existing collection and importing it to learn more about how an API works.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Build Use Cases</strong> - Taking collections and evolving them to meet the needs of specific use cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save API Calls with examples</strong> - Rounding off existing collection with examples making them more usable to developers.</li>
<li><strong>Write use case documentation </strong>- Publishing collections that are designed for specific use cases as usable documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Chain API Calls </strong>- Daisy chaining multiple APIs together to demonstrate how workflows can be delivered across multiple APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Invite, Share, Or Publish</strong> - Inviting other team members or the public to participate and engage with collections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invite Teammates to a workspace </strong>- Ask specific individuals on your team to participate within a specific API workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Share with another workspace </strong>- Take a collection you have build and publish to another workspace for engagement.</li>

<p>I see developer on-baroding as one of the most important uses of Postman--more than just making an API request / response. This is the biggest pain point for API providers when it comes to getting new users to their APIs, and for organizations who are needing to on-board new developers with how APIs are being delivered across an organization. This represent the next generation of how you get up and running with any API, building upon the work we&rsquo;e already done as a community to refine developer portals and API documentation to make them more usable by developers. This is how developers go from landing on a developer portal and browsing API documentation to actually using an API and understanding what it does in minutes, not hours or days. This is one of the ares you will hear me talking about regularly on the blog, and providing real world examples of the value an API actually delivers for developers, and what standards and best practices are in place when it comes to delivering APIs across an organization.</p>
<p>This use case is title &ldquo;developer on boarding&rdquo; &mdash; I am going to work hard to rebrand as simply &ldquo;API on-boarding.&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because I don&rsquo;t believe that this is only for developers. This is a set of practices for on-boarding people to how to provide and consume APIs--because everyone should be both a provider and consumer&mdash;both developers and business users. I just wanted to work through this use case as part of my &ldquo;on-boarding&rdquo; phase with Postman as an employee. I am going to be working through hundreds of different stories and examples of how Postman can be used to on-barding individuals to the world of APIs, to how a company does (or doesn&rsquo;t) do APIs, individual APIs, or workflows across many different APIs. Out of all of the Postman use cases this is the one I am most excited about and I feel will have the biggest impact when it comes to how APIs are used across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies.</p>

<p>I like using the command line, but I get that it is intimidating for a lot of folks. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure why, but at different points in my career I have embraced and distanced myself from the command line. So for me, I understand this emotion and while I have used the command line a lot over the years,&nbsp; much prefer interactive documentation, client side tooling. This is one reason I was such a believer in Postman when it first came on the scene in 2012 / 2013 (if I remember correctly). It simplified the ability to make API calls, and it returned all the details you needed about what was going on behind the scenes of applications. No command line needed. I know that many folks love the command line. I would say I don&rsquo;t love it, we are more old friends that get along well, but we don&rsquo;t see each other as much as we used to.<br /><br />I would say my biggest challenge with the command line and using cURL is that I&rdquo;m just not as efficient and knowledgable as I should be in this environment. Sure, I have spent countless hours on Stack Overflow copying and pasting cURL and other commands, and I&rsquo;ve even bought a couple of books. The problem is the knowledge doesn&rsquo;t ever stick around in my head, and I tend to add snippets to my collection of scripts and CLI commands, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to make things stick in my brain. I think it is the old 486 processor, and limited storage situation. Maybe it was the 60s. IDK. Regardless, I can empathize when folks are apprehensive about using the command line. I work hard to not make them feel stupid about it and do what I can to help them in crafting commands, teaching them whatever I can, or just introduce them to Postman.<br /><br />In my many years evangelizing APIs outside the echo chamber amongst the normals I have come across several lines in which non-technical folks do not like to cross. While I don&rsquo;t see these lines as hard and fast lines that should not be crossed, I am respectful of people&rsquo;s fears of these perceived lines between technical and non-technical folks. While I see them as make believe, the reasons why they believe in them have been re-enforced by their IT and development groups, vendors, and many other factors over the course of their careers--making them very real to them. The command line is often one of these lines. Personally I blame Microsoft for running people away from the command line, but I&rsquo;m guessing there are plenty of other reasons why many folks fear the command line, and see it as something that isn&rsquo;t intuitive, helpful, or wielding the power that many of us programmers understand. <br /><br />Personally, I like seeing CLI and API living side by side in harmony, but I understand that not every wants to use the command line, making cURL examples something that isn&rsquo;t always helpful for all audiences. I think cURL commands should be default alongside the other 10+ programming languages we provide with our API documentation. I also think that Postman collections should be present, and be crafted in a way that help developers and non-developers on-board with APIs, and quickly put them to work. I&rsquo;m going to be investing in more API collections that target non-developers, and I&rsquo;m going to be conducting some missions out into the land of the normals to test out some of my theories, and see if Postman, with some well crafted collections can help bridge the gap between APIs and the normal people, helping some tech curious friends of mine put Postman to work extracting data from APIs that might matter to them in their line of work.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/fast-lights-freeway-redes-fast-flux-623x425-light-dali.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the benefits of doing APIs that we have always touted as API believers, is that APIs increases efficiency. We are able to move faster. Be more agile. Increased velocity of what our teams can deliver by reducing the size and scope of teams and the API infrastructure they can bring to life. It is something I&rsquo;ve said over and over in my storytelling, and as I work to scrutinize the words I use in my storytelling, and work to justify the meaning behind my work, I&rsquo;m looking to better understand I how I can back up this claim. The first question I ask in these situations is how do we measure whatever is in question, and quantify this change we claim is going on. So, with this, how do we measure the efficient, agility, and velocity that APIs are brining to the table.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I guess I am trying to better understand what different organizations are measuring when it comes to understanding all of this. We generally say that we can move faster, but specifically what does moving faster actually mean? I am trying to think through some of the details of what I should be measuring with each team, so that I can better articulate and visualize what exactly faster means. Which of these areas matter the most?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teams</strong> - Are we measuring the speed at which teams operation, helping them get more work done?</li>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Are we measuring the number of APIs delivered? If so, how are we quantifying the scope of each API being delivered?</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Are tracking the number of applications being developed? If so, how are we defining the scope of each App?</li>
<li><strong>Releases</strong> - Are we measuring the number of version releases? If so, are we looking at major, minor, and impact of patch?</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong> - Are we tracking on the number of features being delivered that actually impact the end-users?</li>
<li><strong>Tickets</strong> - If we are using JIRA or other ticketing system, are we just satisfying some metric regarding the number of tickets closed?</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong> - Are we doing more with partners? Delivering what they want at a speed we were never able to realize before?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear from y&rsquo;all regarding what efficiency, agility, and velocity means to you. Are you actually measuring, quantifying, and reporting upon the velocity you&rsquo;ve realized from doing APIs and microservices and / or going API-first? Or is everything still just anecdotal and just talk? If I was to question my own velocity measurements it would center around APIs and API enabled capabilities. I can definitely deliver APIs much faster than I used to, but without any actual benchmark about the scope of each API I&rsquo;ve developed, I can&rsquo;t really articulate that my 2014 APIs were much slower than my 2019 APIs, any more than I can say my 2014 APIs are bigger than my 2019 APIs. I really don&rsquo;t have any cornerstone to lean on when I am claiming that I&rsquo;m moving faster, it is all just anecdotal.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This is a subject I will be revisiting often. I have a lot of questions. I have very little data to back up my beliefs. I&rsquo;ll be talking with different folks I know to better understand if they are indeed moving faster, and how they are measuring things, or not. Another aspect of this discussion I&rsquo;m thinking about is if we are doing things faster, what are we doing with all that time we&rsquo;ve saved? I&rsquo;m guessing the answer is we are doing more! Then I would like to know more about how we are measuring this as well.<span>&nbsp;</span>Again, are we doing more APIs, applications, releases, features, and tickets? How are we tracking it? Also, has the size of teams shifted along the way? There are just so many questions to be answered about this fundamental claim I have been making for some time now, and I&rsquo;d like to be able to do a better job of backing up what I say with actual real world data and examples.</p>

<p>I have been learning a lot about the different ways in which Postman users are using collections in my new role. One of the more interesting use cases I&rsquo;m tracking on is for assisting the on-boarding of new developers. I can get behind anything that makes it easier for developers or non-developers to get up and running with an API, and some of the creative ways I&rsquo;ve seen companies craft Postman collections to help reduce friction has inspired me to keep exploring and mining this aspect of putting API definitions to work in my storytelling. One of the most recent use cases I was exposed to in this area, was the crafting of complete Postman collections for more experienced developers, and more simpler ones for newer developers&mdash;reducing the cognitive load when it comes to API on-boarding.<br /><br />As a seasoned API veteran, when on boarding with a new API I tend to like to see the full menu being offered, but this belief system regularly leaves me drowning in a state of information overload. Some API providers have hundreds, or thousands of APIs, and depending on the quality of API design and documentation this can be both a good or a very bad thing. To help reduce this overload in their own communites I&rsquo;ve been seeing some Postman customers crafting specialized on-boarding collections that help define the APIs most new developers are going to care about, pre-populated with the parameters, values, and other details that reduce the friction for them when on-boarding. Helping us get more precise in how we craft our API definitions, being more thoughtful in how we name, organize, and document our APIs using collections&mdash;rather than just dumping an overwhelming number of API paths, parameters, schema and documentation on someone.<br /><br />I am going to take some of the more robust API collections I have defined in my API workspaces and begin crafting a more simpler, entry level version of the same collection&mdash;with fewer endpoints, and more helpful environments, examples, and other elements. I&rsquo;m looking to further hone my API collection abilities, pushing me to be more coherent and thoughtful in my presentation of various APIs. As someone who gets APIs, I find it endlessly enlightening to think about the on-boarding of new users to APIs, and push myself to simplify and reduce friction at every turn. This is one of the reasons I am so prolific in my storytelling, is it helps me refine my craft, and help me reach a larger audience. I am looking to develop the storytelling or narrative equivalent in a Postman collection, allowing me to craft a single machine readable file that is also very human accessible and readable. <br /><br />When it comes to crafting API collections I am looking to onboard two types of users: 1) new users who are learning about a specific API, and 2) new users who are just learning APIs. I strongly believe that Postman collections are the key to unlocking both of these areas, and provide me with a portable, shareable, executable representation of an API, that if thoughtfully crafted can go a long way to bridge the gap between someone learning about a single API, or getting started with APIs in general. It will take some practice, and probably the crafting of a couple hundred separate API collections to get to the level I&rsquo;m envisionining in my head, but once I get there I&rsquo;m pretty confident I can take my API storytelling to another level. Providing Postman collections for not just individual APIs I&rsquo;m profiling, but remixing my collections using many different APIs in a single collection, telling a specific story that will speak to any user that I am trying to on-board.</p>

<p>I have been using Postman collections for a couple of years now. I have been auto-generating them from my central database alongside OpenAPI 3.0, and previously Swagger 2.0, as part of my regular work profiling APIs. I have imported and used many different collection in my Postman API development environment. I assumed I fully grasped what they are all about. I mean I am the API Evangelist, all I need to do is play with something a little bit, and the API utility of it will become evident to me within minutes. I know my stuff. Right? Not exactly. Apparently I was pretty tainted from my usage, adoption, and evangelism of OpenAPI, and I didn&rsquo;t fully see how Postman collections can be used to define APIs, and act as an executable unit of representation for an API. <br /><br />Postman collections define the surface area of a API just like OpenAPI. I fully understood this. I also grasped that it went beyond OpenAPI in acting as more of executable representation of an API. Meaning you can populate parameter values, and use variables as part of Postman environments, creating and versioning different collections for the same API, allowing it to be executed in a variety of scenarios. What I didn&rsquo;t get was how you can label and organize different scenarios and workflows into different folders, and how pre-execution, tests, and monitors can be applied against collections, folders, and that there is different levels of variable and script scoping dependent on how you structure your collections. I know us pundits like to call OpenAPI definitions API contracts, but they are void of the dynamic variables, environment, testing, and monitoring that is required to truly be a contract--this isn't so with Postman collections.<br /><br />I have been increasingly excited about the executable potential of Postman collections over OpenAPI&rsquo;s static nature. Sure, it can be used for making actual API requests, but it doesn&rsquo;t have all the nuts and bolts of making that request like Postman has. Postman environments, variables, and being able to define a variety of collections for the same API provides a pretty seismic shift in how we deliver our API definitions. It means I can hand someone an API definition, and they can execute in in exactly he context I hand it to them. I&rsquo;ve long augmented OpenAPI with other definitions to mimic this behavior, but Postman provides version control, workspaces, and other essential elements that make this functionality occur by default, not as augmented behavior--helping you manage the process all along the way. This was already a game changer, but it is just the beginning of the potential in my opinion when it comes the potential of Postman collections.<br /><br />When defining Postman collections I can fully define the surface area of an API. I can also define some, or all of the contexts in which that API can be run. Populating parameters and other details as part of the collection or environment settings. This is just the start. You can also then define pre-request scripts to manipulate all of those parameters and variables, and you can then run tests after requests are run, setup monitors to ensure the tests are satisfied in an ongoing basis. This elevates API definitions to the level of API contract for me. It provides the core of each API contract, all of the contexts for what the API contract covers, and the ongoing validation of the contract in question. This is significant. With all of this, you can also provide a mock of the contract that anyone with access to the API collection via a Postman workspace can put to work understanding all of the details of the contract in question.<br /><br />I am a little embarrassed that I didn&rsquo;t see all of these details, as well as the potential and scope of Postman collection folders. I didn&rsquo;t see that collection folders introduce scope layers which can impact how environments are applied, and how scripts and tests are executed. While I am embarrassed, I&rsquo;m also fully aware how we can all easily get siloed into how we think. We can easily become captured by the tools, services, and practices we already know, and become very biased when it comes to being exposed to new services, tools, and practices. I am going to take this to heart and spend more time reassessing other tools and services I&rsquo;ve been playing around with and may have put back on the shelf thinking I understood everything that was going on. This is one aspect of the API space I enjoy regularly, that I can keep learning after so many years, and realize how little I actually know about what is happening with APIs, and I can easily break into new territory with just simple shifts in how I view the landscape.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working extra hard when it comes to creating APIs across every  possible industry I can think of to help push my understanding of what  Postman collections are all about, and what is possible when putting  them to work. As I progress in my work I am quickly realizing how much  more versatile they are than OpenAPI definitions, allowing me to do  things I wanted to do with OpenAPI, but couldn&rsquo;t always figure out how  to make happen. Some of my dedicated readers might be getting sick of  hearing me talk about Postman collections, but since most of my readers  don&rsquo;t follow me regularly and rely weekly updates via email, or stumble  across my work as part of search engine exploration&mdash;I am going to  continue cranking out the stories! <a href="https://www.apievangelist.com/2019/09/24/enabler-mock-data-apis-alongside-other-apis-within-my-collections/">While working with an API collection for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API</a>,  I realized how Postman collections can help flatten some cumbersome API  queries I encounter while on-boarding with some of less than well  designed APIs out there.<br /><br />Many APIs are born out of database  backends, with very little design applied to the APIs externalizing the  database tables. Because of this most APIs offer Create, Read, Update,  and Delete (CRUD) functionality with the parameters reflecting the core  elements of a SQL Query. In these situations, database developers assume  that consumers will possess enough knowledge about the underlying  schema and requiring them to fill in the blanks of what fields should be  returned, and the details of the where clause determining which records  will be returned. Missing the point of what APIs are all about, and  workig harder to externalize the rich resources available within  database tables by providing intuitive paths, parameters, and other  elements that help any consumer understand what is possible. Database  developers who deploy APIs make these mistakes over and over again,  making many assumptions about what other developers will know and not  know, introducing unecessary friction for developers who are on-boarding  with their APIs.<br /><br /><a href="https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/ndc/example-api-queries/">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API</a> possesses a lot of rich data inside of it, but it does a pretty poor  job of documenting everything it is capable of its would-be consumers,  forcing you to do a significant amount of sleuthing before you can  really get at the entire surface of the API. The API provides a search  property which allows you to pass in a variety of properties including  brand_name:&rdquo;{brand name}&ldquo; and active_ingredients:&rdquo;{active ingredient}&ldquo;.  The approach isn&rsquo;t too uncommon, and if you have played with many  different APIs you can pretty quickly follow what is going on. Where the  challenge really comes in is knowing what the values are for brand name  and active ingredients&mdash;they don&rsquo;t document them for you. Providing two  hurdles for the average consumer when on boarding: 1) figuring out the  search properties, and 2) hunting down what the potential values can be.  Something not all developers or non-developers will be able to get  over.<br /><br /></p>
<p>To help abstract away this complexity I am developing a  Postman collection for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National  Drug Code (NDC) API, possessing folders for each of the search  properties, with individual collections that are pre-populated values  for each parameter, so consumers do not have to learn the query language  or the potential values.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/pharmaceutical_drugs_brands.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Here are a handful of examples of the queries  I&rsquo;ve populated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brands</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Abilifu</li>
<li>Humira</li>
<li>Nexium </li>
<li>Crestor</li>
<li>Enbrel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Abiraterone Acetate</li>
<li>Acamprosate Calcium</li>
<li>Acitretin</li>
<li>Adapalene</li>
<li>Adefovir Dipivoxil</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All a potential consumer of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  National Drug Code (NDC) API has to do is click on the Run in Postman  Button, open the folder for brands or active pharmaceutical ingredients  and click on the option they want, and click &ldquo;send&rdquo;, and they get the  results. Eliminating the friction for API consumers using a Postman  collection. This is one of the features of Postman collection that you  can accomplish with an OpenAPI, but because of the historic use cases  for OpenAPI, it isn&rsquo;t something anyone has fully realized. For me, it is  a simple, yet potentially powerful feature that can significantly make  APIs more accessible to developers, and non-developers alike. This is  friction that could be easily addressed through some investment in APIs  design as well as API documentation, but for APIs that haven&rsquo;t done  this, Postman collections make for a pretty sweet plan B approach.<br /><br />This  is one of many killer features I&rsquo;m uncovering while playing around with  Postman, while cranking out Postman collections for many different  APIs. I am purposely playing around with many different types of APIs  because I want to see how I can push the boundaries of what Postman  collections are capable of doing, and transcend the technical aspects of  API integration, and make APIs more intuitive for consumers who aren&rsquo;t  necessarily up to speed on all the gotchas when it comes to API  integration. I have a LOT of work to do on this Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API collection before it  is ready for publishing. Once I have all the parameters and values added  to the collection I will share in another blog post. I&rsquo;m playing around  with dynamically generating the Postman collections from APIs I have  created for each of the lists of property values I&rsquo;ve gathered from  other data sources outside of the FDA developer area. I really don&rsquo;t  want to be manually adding each request to the collection, and automated  the creation of this type of Postman collection will pay dividends in  the future when I come across similar APIs that are missing their parts  and pieces, and haven&rsquo;t gone the distance with their API  design--allowing me to make some very useful APIs more accessible using  Postman collections.</p><p>I&rsquo;m working extra hard when it comes to creating APIs across every possible industry I can think of to help push my understanding of what Postman collections are all about, and what is possible when putting them to work.

Some of my dedicated readers might be getting sick of hearing me talk about Postman collections, but since most of my readers don&rsquo;t follow me regularly and rely weekly updates via email, or stumble across my work as part of search engine exploration&mdash;I am going to continue cranking out the stories! <a href="https://www.apievangelist.com/2019/09/24/enabler-mock-data-apis-alongside-other-apis-within-my-collections/">While working with an API collection for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API</a>, I realized how Postman collections can help flatten some cumbersome API queries I encounter while on-boarding with some of less than well designed APIs out there.<br /><br />Many APIs are born out of database backends, with very little design applied to the APIs externalizing the database tables. Because of this most APIs offer Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality with the parameters reflecting the core elements of a SQL Query. In these situations, database developers assume that consumers will possess enough knowledge about the underlying schema and requiring them to fill in the blanks of what fields should be returned, and the details of the where clause determining which records will be returned. Missing the point of what APIs are all about, and workig harder to externalize the rich resources available within database tables by providing intuitive paths, parameters, and other elements that help any consumer understand what is possible. Database developers who deploy APIs make these mistakes over and over again, making many assumptions about what other developers will know and not know, introducing unecessary friction for developers who are on-boarding with their APIs.<br /><br /><a href="https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/ndc/example-api-queries/">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API</a> possesses a lot of rich data inside of it, but it does a pretty poor job of documenting everything it is capable of its would-be consumers, forcing you to do a significant amount of sleuthing before you can really get at the entire surface of the API. The API provides a search property which allows you to pass in a variety of properties including brand_name:&rdquo;{brand name}&ldquo; and active_ingredients:&rdquo;{active ingredient}&ldquo;. The approach isn&rsquo;t too uncommon, and if you have played with many different APIs you can pretty quickly follow what is going on. Where the challenge really comes in is knowing what the values are for brand name and active ingredients&mdash;they don&rsquo;t document them for you. Providing two hurdles for the average consumer when on boarding: 1) figuring out the search properties, and 2) hunting down what the potential values can be. Something not all developers or non-developers will be able to get over.<br /><br />To help abstract away this complexity I am developing a Postman collection for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API, possessing folders for each of the search properties, with individual collections that are pre-populated values for each parameter, so consumers do not have to learn the query language or the potential values. Here are a handful of examples of the queries I&rsquo;ve populated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brands</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Abilifu</li>
<li>Humira</li>
<li>Nexium </li>
<li>Crestor</li>
<li>Enbrel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Abiraterone Acetate</li>
<li>Acamprosate Calcium</li>
<li>Acitretin</li>
<li>Adapalene</li>
<li>Adefovir Dipivoxil</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All a potential consumer of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API has to do is click on the Run in Postman Button, open the folder for brands or active pharmaceutical ingredients and click on the option they want, and click &ldquo;send&rdquo;, and they get the results. Eliminating the friction for API consumers using a Postman collection. This is one of the features of Postman collection that you can accomplish with an OpenAPI, but because of the historic use cases for OpenAPI, it isn&rsquo;t something anyone has fully realized. For me, it is a simple, yet potentially powerful feature that can significantly make APIs more accessible to developers, and non-developers alike. This is friction that could be easily addressed through some investment in APIs design as well as API documentation, but for APIs that haven&rsquo;t done this, Postman collections make for a pretty sweet plan B approach.<br /><br />This is one of many killer features I&rsquo;m uncovering while playing around with Postman, while cranking out Postman collections for many different APIs. I am purposely playing around with many different types of APIs because I want to see how I can push the boundaries of what Postman collections are capable of doing, and transcend the technical aspects of API integration, and make APIs more intuitive for consumers who aren&rsquo;t necessarily up to speed on all the gotchas when it comes to API integration. I have a LOT of work to do on this Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API collection before it is ready for publishing. Once I have all the parameters and values added to the collection I will share in another blog post. I&rsquo;m playing around with dynamically generating the Postman collections from APIs I have created for each of the lists of property values I&rsquo;ve gathered from other data sources outside of the FDA developer area. I really don&rsquo;t want to be manually adding each request to the collection, and automated the creation of this type of Postman collection will pay dividends in the future when I come across similar APIs that are missing their parts and pieces, and haven&rsquo;t gone the distance with their API design--allowing me to make some very useful APIs more accessible using Postman collections.</p>

<p>As I was working to improve upon a couple of the API collections I&rsquo;m building, and trying to assess at what constitutes a &ldquo;complete enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;robust enough&rdquo; collection, I noticed how the process within Postman is iterative, outcome based, and driven from actual requests and responses. Meaning a complete enough Postman collection is relative to the outcomes I&rsquo;m looking for&mdash;things like documentation and mock APIs. To be able to achieve robust API documentation and mocks I simply need to add my API request, successfully make a call to my API defined, and save the response as part of my API collection. Then, once I&rsquo;m ready, all I need to do to update my API documentation and generation API mocks is to hit publish for each of these desired outcomes. Making the documenting and mocking of APIs very straightforward and logical for me. <br /><br />I will be stepping through my API profiling process again and writing a fresh post on how I profile the operational and API level data of the companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies I&rsquo;m covering. Have an example of each API request to not just round off the definition of an API so I have an understanding of the schema being applied is valuable, but I&rsquo;m finding that making sure I have it in service of documentation, mocking, testing, and other essential stops along the lifecycle makes it more meaningful and valuable. Personally, I want the request and response for each API I&rsquo;m profiling to help increase the surface area of each API I have for better search-ability. However, thinking about making it so anyone can find the API and more easily put it to use with more complete documentation is another bar to set for my profiling work&mdash;making I more valuable to my audience.<br /><br />Managing my profiling of APIs using Postman and specifically as Postman collections is changing I&rsquo;m profiling the API sector, and how I see the API lifecycle. I&rsquo;ve long seen the valuable of an API definition when it comes to documenting an API, and even mocking an API. However, seeing the definition play a central, real time role in defining how I create, evolve, and communicate the value of any single API is taking things up another level for me. I don&rsquo;t just produce a static JSON or YAML definition and hit publish, and be done with it. As a Postman Collection, my API definition is a living interactive representation of the value an API delivers, and on a regular basis I&rsquo;m using that definition to execute real API calls, and taking those requests and responses and translate them into more meaningful documentation, usable mocks, as well as code snippets, tests, and other essential stops along the API lifecycle. This is a tough thing to convey if you aren&rsquo;t actively maintaining many different APIs as collections&mdash;you might be scratching your head to understand the nuance of the process. I&rsquo;ll have to work on more stories to help illustrate what I am talking about. <br /><br />I guess the point of this posts is that updating your documentation shouldn&rsquo;t be an after thought. Extra work. Something else you have to do. Creating and publishing up to date API documentation for your APIs should be part of your regular operations and build process. You should be able to create documentation from the operation of your actual APIs like Postman does. If you have to hand-craft responses and examples the chance that you will get things wrong increases&mdash;why not just do it from real world requests. One of the items on my checklist for each API collection is &ldquo;does every request have an example&rdquo;? I have a very long checklist, but this is one of the new ones I&rsquo;m adding to help me determine how complete and mature an API collection is. If an API definition doesn&rsquo;t have examples associated with the collection it means that I probably haven&rsquo;t successfully made an API call with the collection which means it is most likely not an accurate representation, and it means that I won&rsquo;t be able to publish meaningful API documentation for consumers. This means the collection I am managing isn&rsquo;t acceptable, and is not ready for prime time.</p>

<p>I was demonstrating to to someone how you can document <a href="https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/ndc/example-api-queries/">the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API</a> using Postman and I found a way to enrich real world APIs by publishing mocked data APIs alongside the primary APIs within the same Postman Collection. The URL structure of the FDA DNC API (acronym congestion) is pretty simple <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://api.fda.gov/drug/ndc.json?search=brand_name:"xanax"&amp;limit=100</span>, and it is an open API so you can jus take that URL and see a response without putting in an API keys or tokens. The API provides a suite of keywords you can query as part of the search parameter, with the only two I&rsquo;m focused on being &ldquo;brand_name&rdquo; and &ldquo;active_ingredients&rdquo;, providing fairly straightforward querying capabilities, but there are some gaps in their documentation approach. They provide a wealth of ways (PDF, Excel, YAML) to get what fields you can filter by, but not any more information on useful and accepted values for those parameters.<br /><br />For what I was working on, I needed two lists of values: 1) brands, and 2) active pharmaceutical ingredients. Without them you have to kind of just bumble around until you find the right values, and slowly reverse engineer what the possibilities are. These types of gaps are common with API providers, and maybe the FDA has the values somewhere else on their website, but I can&rsquo;t seem to find them. I looked for a while and then began widening my scope beyond what the FDA provides, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_selling_pharmaceutical_products">finding brands on Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="https://www.sunpharma.com/products/api">active pharmaceutical ingredients on another 3rd party site</a>. These tables can quickly be converted into CSV and then JSON files, which I can then turn into mock APIs using Postman collections. All I do is create new requests for my mock endpoints, add the resulting JSON as an example, and then publish my collection as a new mock server. I can tweak my variable urls for the live and mock versions to accommodate localized versions living side by side with the live FDA drug database. <br /><br />Now I have a collection for directly querying the FDA National Drug Code API directly, as well as two separate enablement APIs for branding and active pharmaceutical ingredients (which is an API API) that are just mocked postman requests with examples for each of the responses. Allowing me to quickly get at brands and active pharmaceutical ingredients to make queries against the FDA National Drug Code API. Continuing to push forward how I use Postman collections. Helping me smooth out the friction with APIs introduced through inadequate API design or documentation, and provide a localized and executable collections that anyone can import and use in their own Postman API development environment. Helping make APIs easier to use by developers from the outside, augmenting what is already in place with more information, so that developer are more successful when putting an API to work.<br /><br />Now that I have this design pattern in my toolbox I will keep refining upon and use it to help me create other relevant collections. I&rsquo;m enjoying pushing the boundaries of what I knew could be done with Postman Collections. It has shifted by perspective of not just Postman, but of the API lifecycle and how the API provider and consumer can interact. Breaking the normal cycles of behavior we see around APIs, and empowering the community to help improve upon APIs that already exist and just haven&rsquo;t receive the amount investment and energy to make them usable. Not everyone understands the potential of Postman collections and how they can be used, so I want to keep exploring and pushing the boundaries, and tell the story to help enlighten folks about what is possible. While I also improve my ability to profile the API space and produce executable API stories that are enabled by Postman.</p>

<p>This API definitions  guide is the result of almost 10 years of research and participation in  the evolution of API definitions as part of community development,  conferences, and the API efforts behind the specifications themselves.  I've worked to distill my research on API definitions down into a short  guide that business as well as technical individuals can follow.  Providing a single guide to the impact that API definitions are making  across the sector, empowering both API providers and consumers when it  comes to putting APIs to work in web, mobile, and device applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Table of Contents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions</strong> - Overview of what API definitions mean to stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Defining APIs</strong> - How API definitions are used to define each individual API.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Readable</strong> - Providing what is needed for systems to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Human Readable</strong> - Providing what is needed for humans to understand.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Schema</strong> - A standard for describing the properties of each API object.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - Standard for defining API contracts for HTTP 1.1 or web APIs.</li>

<li><strong>Providing API Contracts</strong> - API definitions have the potential to act as API contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide is meant to help decision makers make sense of how the API movement grew organically out of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) industry and produced a wealth of competing schema and API definition formats that are used to define what APIs do, but also are critical for powering almost every stop along the API lifecycle. While this guide is focused on a very technical subject, it is designed to be consume by both developers and non-technical audiences, attempting to encourage business and technical stakeholders to work together to deliver the next generation of providers.</p>
<p>API definitions aren't just the first stop in the API lifecycle. They are the most critical stop that will service every other stop, providing the human and machine readable definitions that are needed to deliver the technology and business of APIs. Get your copy of the API Evangelist API Definitions Industry Guide to help give you the understanding you need of why API definitons are critical to your API success. Helping ensure you have all of your organization'ss capabilities properly defined, discoverable, and properly applied across teams for all of the APIs you are delivering or consuming.</p>

Providing a way that Twilio users can invite a friend to become a Twilio user, which isn&rsquo;t anything that groundbreaking, as most SaaS and API platforms offer this, but with Twilio&rsquo;s referral program you get $10.00 to apply to your Twilio account for each referral you make.</p>
<p><br />They made the Twilio referral program pretty straightforward, which is nice because many affiliate related solutions can be pretty cumbersome&mdash;it goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get a personal referral link that you can share with your networks</li>
<li>Users sign up with your link, upgrade, then receive $10 to spend with Twilio</li>
<li>For each person you refer who signs up for Twilio and upgrades, you get $10 in your Twilio account</li>
</ul>
<p>As Twilio says on their announcement, &ldquo;depending on the country where you&rsquo;re sending&hellip; that&rsquo;s over 1250 SMS messages&hellip; or 1,000 free voice minutes.... or over 12,000 chats. And that&rsquo;s just for 1 referral&rdquo;. As part of their announcement they even give you some template referral text, and recommendations of where you can share your referral message and code, taking advantage of your common social networks like LinkedIn, Twitch, YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and in your email signature.<br /><br />Twilio provides a pretty basic example of an API referral program, a building block I will be adding to my list of the more business elements we can be baking into our platform. I could even envision this being offered by a startup or existing API service providers allowing API providers to quickly implement as part of their API management, portal, and other existing services and tooling. Making for dead simple, plug and play API referrals for API providers, helping them leverage their existing networks to help grow their base, and attract new users.</p>

<p>I am working to expand the vocabulary I use to search for new APIs. I already have a pretty extensive set of keywords and phrases I have from mining the world of APIs over the last nine years, but I wanted to get more formal about how I find new and interesting APIs across as many industries as I possibly can. To help me in my effort I adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Industry_Classification_System">the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</a> as the official vocabulary I use for searching and organizing the businesses, organizations, tooling, APIs, and datasets I'm profiling as part of my research. Helping me standardize how I uncover new APIs, keeping my vocabulary in alignment with government agencies like Censuse and Labor, but also industry organizations, and the companies that operate within each business sector.</p>
<p>After settling in on NAICS, I found the NAICS API and created a Postman Collection for it. The open source API implementation doesn't have the most recent 2017 update, and the response schema didn't really work for what I was looking to build. So I got to work on creating <a href="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/adaf75265e8f45a4e6dccbc73153f26c">my own version of NAISC from the 2017 index</a>, shaping the structure of the JSON response to better meet my needs. Resulting in a single JSON file that represents the entire NAICS index, but also reflecting each tier of the specification.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/adaf75265e8f45a4e6dccbc73153f26c.js"></script>
<p>Now that I have the JSON in a more usable format I am using it as part of my automated API search engine, but I also wanted to develop ways to visualize and manually engage with any layer of the NAISC scaffolding while searching for new APIs on the web and GitHub. To help me see the scope of the vocabulary I was implementing I published it as a series of HTML lists, allowing me to quickly search for different APIs using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-web-search-api/">the Bing Cognitive Search API</a>, or via the public Bing search page. Producing an interesting list of industries which one click queries that generally surface interesting APIs.</p>
<p>[industries]</p>
<p>It is a big list. Damn. Anyways, it is the definition of the landscape I was looking for. I'm going to keep extending it with some of my own vocabulary. I just wanted to try and create a screen for manually applying the vocabulary, and help quantify the scope of the automated search I was doing. I'll take every industry and look for OpenAPI, Swagger, and Postman Collecitons on GitHub and via Bing. I'm going to also work on dimensions of it service of specifically looking for data schema, standards, and data sets--however, this one will only use the top three layers of vocabulary, and not going as deep as this one did.</p>
<p>I will run the automated search for a few days and see how many API definitions it hoovers up. Even if it doesn't find any API definitions, it will still catalog the domains it finds as part of each search, adding them to my queue of potential APIs to manually look at. I'm always amazed at what comes up in searches for key phrases I would never have thought about without standards like NAICS existing out there. I'll keep monitoring this dimension for APIs and track on changes over time. In addition to finding interesting APIs I'm guessing I'm going to learn a lot of other lessons, identify varioius trends and opportunities that exist in the cracks. I'm hoping NAICS helps me increase the scope of my API search vocabulary and shine a light in all the cracks and crevices of every business sector where APIs are making an impact, helping me shine a light on what is going, or maybe just on what isn't going on.</p>

<p>I invest a lot of resources into spidering domains. I spend probably about $50.00 to $75.00 a month in compute resources to scrape domains I have targeted as part of my API research. This is something that will increase 3x in the next year as I expand my API search and discovery efforts. While it is very valuable to use GitHub and Bing API to uncover new and interesting domains, they don&rsquo;t always give me very meaningful indexes of what each site contains. I prefer actually spidering the site and looking for meaningful words from my vocabulary like Swagger, OpenAPI, Documentation, etc. All the words the help me understand whether there is really an API there or just a blog post mentioning an API, or other ephemeral reference of API. As I work to refine and evolve my API search tooling I find myself wishing that website owners would own and operate their own sitemap API, providing a rich index of every public page available on their website.</p>
<p>I should probably begin to adopt <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl,</a> instead of running my own scraper and crawler&mdash;however, the overhead of setting up Common Crawl and the special types of searches I&rsquo;m conducting has prevented it from every occuring. I&rsquo;ll most likely just keep doing my home grown version of harvesting of domains, but I can&rsquo;t help dream and design the future I&rsquo;d like to see along the way. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if EVERY domain had a base API for getting at the sitemap? Letting the domain owner control what is indexed and what is not, while also providing a simple, alternative, and machine readable interface for people to get access to content. Hell, I&rsquo;d even pay a premium to get more structured data, or direct API access to the complete index of a website. It seems like something someone could cobble together and standardize using the ELK stick, and wrap it in a simple white label API + documentation.</p>
<p>In my mind every domain should have a developer.[domain].[extension] subdomain setup with a suite of default API services available, with the first one being a sitemap API. Next there should APIs and / or Atom feeds for all news, blogs, press, forums, and other common streams of information. Don&rsquo;t make me scrape your blog to just make my own Atom feed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don&rsquo;t make me rely on your Twitter stream for this either. Having an API for the website sitemap and requiring scrapers to register and use a dedicated search endpoint will help reduce traffic and load on a primary domain website, and give domain owners more visibility into who is pulling information from your website. Sure, not everyone is going to respect this, but there many of us who will, and would be very thankful for having a well defined index of your website for helping understand your operations.</p>
<p class="p1">In the end I know this is a fantasy. Most website operators don&rsquo;t understand this world, and just rely on Google to get things done for them. Most aren&rsquo;t going to see the value in providing a dedicated API for accessing the content on their website. I know many of the linked data folks still believe in this wet dream, but i have too much experience to believe that website owners will ever understand and care at this level. However, it can&rsquo;t stop me from dreaming and writing up as a story, and talking about the future I would like to have. Who knows, maybe someone will take my idea and turn it into a viable service, and actually begin offering for the more progressive domains, changing how the web is indexed and accessed. I don&rsquo;t have time to do things like this. I barely have enough time and resources to be cobbling together and operating my scrape scripts for about 10K domains, grabbing what I need from across the companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies I am monitoring as part of my API research.</p>

<p>Providing early access to your APIs is nothing new. It is something that all API providers should do whether they are publishing their APIs publicly or keeping them private for internal or partner use. However, I feel that the concept of API workspaces introduced by Postman provides you with an opportunity to segment off your APIs using different collections and make them available to an invite only audience. Realizing the concept of API workspaces allows you to easily create a working area dedicated to providing trusted users have access to early versions of your latest APIs. Leveraging the Postman platform as a conduit for engaging with your developers, and getting feedback on the designs and functionality of your APIs before they ever are generally released to the public.<br /><br />Think of Postman workspaces as a separate namespace where as you are already developing your APIs, but now you can just turn on access to collections containing all the technical details of your API, including variables and authentication in an environment&mdash;allowing beta users to make calls to each API, and play around with the new functionality. All you will have to do is produce one or more Postman collections for your new beta APsIs, create a new workspace, and share your collections to the workspace. You can also publish API documentation for your collections if you want, or you can just begin with one or more Postman collections that provide everything developers will need to get up and running. Establishing special access to your APIs, without all the overhead of having to manage your beta program&mdash;you just rely on the functionality that Postman already delivers.<br /><br />You might even consider publishing your early API collections and include a mock API if you don&rsquo;t have the API fully baked yet. Moving forward the timeline when you can get an API into your beta users hands, and begin getting early feedback on what is going on. This can be done with internal users, your partners, or your most passionate users from your public API community. Before users get access to the canary workspace you can make sure they are in agreement with your terms of service, and other guidelines governing the beta releases of your APIs, ensuring nothing you are developing ends up on the open web. Further reducing the feedback loop when it comes to whether or not your APIs will be meeting the needs of your customers.<br /><br />Once you have your canary program setup using Postman workspaces and collections, you ca also solicit feedback on the APIs directly within the Postman interface, leverage the comments feature to establish a feedback loop with your beta users. Putting all the existing features of Postman to work when it comes to building the foundation of your beta program and the feedback loop that comes with it. Demonstrating why it is fruitful to go API first, because it can shorten the cycles of your feedback loop and significantly reduces costs associated with each iteration of each version of your API. The longer you wait, the more your API designs is baked into code on both the server and client side, making beta programs more about efficiency and cost saving than it is about just giving developers an early look at what is coming down the pipes.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll work on some real world prototypes of how this can be done. I&rsquo;ll create some prototype canary workspaces with some APIs I&rsquo;m developing, and work through the workflow as part of some stories here on the blog. I know that having an early beta or canary user program is something that many API teams I&rsquo;m working with aspire to, but few have the budgets and resources to actually make happen. So actually having an easy and free (or low cost) way to implement with just a handful of users, using tooling that teams are already using is pretty attractive. It is one of those little changes you can make with your API program that will have a big impact on how you design and deliver your APIs, but also something that will dramatically help with your bottom line when it comes to the lifetime cost of delivering your API infrastructure.</p>

<p>You ever feel like you just preach to the choir when evangelizing your API tool or service? I do. All the time! While crafting stories for the blog I am constantly burying topics that I find super interesting but realize the &ldquo;normals&rdquo; I&rsquo;m interested in reaching just aren&rsquo;t going to care. Of course, I don&rsquo;t always focus on this audience but I&rsquo;d say I prefer a 60% normals to 40% geek focus in my storytelling. With this in mind I&rsquo;m investing some more energy in getting out of the echo chamber with my storytelling and spending more time at healthcare, financial, energy, automobile, home improvement, and other conferences catering to specific industries and verticals, rather than just hanging with my API pals at the same old events. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I will still be showing up at some of the best API events, but I&rsquo;m going to be focusing on expeditionary mission work&mdash;it is the most dangerous type of API evangelism, but in my experience it can really pay off.<br /><br />When going outside of the API echo chamber to evangelize APIs you have to work hard to refine your vocabulary and keep your stories precise and compelling. One downside is that you have to tell a lot of the same stories over and over, but I guess if you aren&rsquo;t that keen on creating new content, and perpetually having to reinvent yourself, this could be a positive thing. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of my storytelling within the echo chamber&mdash;it keeps my mind busy. However, reaching outside the echo chamber pushes me to refine my storytelling in ways that only speaking to &ldquo;normals&rdquo; can do. Also, getting the real world questions that are more closely aligned with the actual business problems we are looking to solve with APIs helps me ground my API blah blah blah in reality, and keeping it out of the stratosphere above the clouds.<br /><br />Being the API tooling presence at a consumer electronics, home improvement, or insurance conference takes a different frame of mind. It will get you out of your comfort zone where everyone knows the tricks of the developer relations trade. It will force you to hone your approach a little more, and reach a little further when it comes to explaining the value you bring to the table. I mean, aren&rsquo;t you getting sick of &ldquo;selling&rdquo; to people who already know and love your product, and just preaching to your own choir, and most likely your own competitors? If your API tools and services are so good you should be able to engage with average folks running businesses in almost any vertical. Only selling your wares to the API sector, and presenting yourself as a &ldquo;thought leader&rdquo; seems like a pretty sophomore move. If we want to ensure the rubber meets the road when it comes to our tools and services being put to use across the business landscape we will have to break out of our bubbles.<br /><br />I find the process of researching different industries, understanding their trade organizations, and where their conferences are a learning experience all by itself. To help me think about the big picture I like to have a ready to go vocabulary at my fingertips for driving my inquiries. Having a list of industries and keywords available for search for events, data sets, data standards, APIs, and companies is essential to expanding my horizons. I enjoy expanding my horizons on a regular basis and keep this whole API evangelism game forever moving into new territory, on-boarding new users to the importance of APIs, and how they are impacting their personal and professional lives in both positive and negative ways. After nine years of doing this I just don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m reaching my potential if I stay in my comfort zone and listen to how my voice sounds echoing back at me in this API chamber we&rsquo;ve created for ourselves.</p>

<p>The government agencies, institutions, organizations, and companies that I talk to on a regular basis always express their desire to get a handle on how to consistently deliver APIs across the API lifecycle, and ask me to help quantity their overall API maturity. They are looking for honest answers on how mature their approach is compared to other API providers , and companies that operate within the same business sector that they do. To help folks self-analyze, as well as help guide conversations I am having with them on the ground, I&rsquo;ve drafted a short list of questions you can ask of your operations.<br /><br />I have broken down my questions into six separate areas of the API lifecycle which go a long ways towards defining how mature a company is, asking some of the questions that I am commonly asking new companies I am engaging with in workshops, consulting, and now working with Postman. The goal of this is to help establish the overall maturity of an API operation, not to shame people involved, but to better get at where we should begin investing to help move teams along in their API journey. Here is a breakdown of API maturity questions I currently have.<br /><br /><strong>Discovery</strong> - Knowing where all of your digital assets are at scale.<br /><br />- Do you know where all of your APIs are?<br />- Do you have a way track schema used across APIs?<br />- Do you have an actively used catalog of APIs?<br />- Do you use Swagger, OpenAPI, RAML, API Blueprint or Postman Collections to define your APIs?<br />- Do you use JSON Schema to articulate the underlying data structure for APIs?<br />- Do your APIs have owners or teams assigned to them?<br /><br /><strong>Design</strong> - Focusing in on an a design first area of the lifecycle.<br /><br />- Do you hand edit and work with Swagger, OpenAPI, RAML, API Blueprint or Postman Collections?<br />- Do you auto-generate Swagger, OpenAPI, or Postman Collections<br />- Do you mock your APIs at any stage of their lifecycle?<br />- Do you share API designs across your API development teams?<br />- How much of your API infrastructure uses SOAP?<br />- How much of your API infrastructure uses REST?<br />- How much of your API infrastructure uses GraphQL?<br />- How much of your API infrastructure uses Kafka?<br />- How much of your API infrastructure uses Other?<br />- Do you have an API design guide for use across teams?<br /><br /><strong>Deployment</strong> - Understanding the many ways in which APIs are deployed.<br /><br />- How many API gateways do you use to deploy APIs?<br />- What programming languages do you use to deploy APIs?<br />- Do you deploy APIs on-premise?<br />- Do you deploy APIs in the cloud?<br />- Do you deploy APIs in multiple clouds?<br />- Do you use containers to deploy your APIs?<br />- Do you use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your APIs?<br />- Do you have webhook implementations to support APIs?<br />- Do you have any streaming APIs available for consumers?<br />- Do you have any event-driven APIs available for consumers?<br />- Have you been looking at serverless for API deployment?<br /><br /><strong>Production</strong> - Taking a snapshot of how APIs are maintained across operations.<br /><br />- Do you have a dedicated public portal for all your external APIs?<br />- Do you have a dedicated private portal for all your internal APIs?<br />- Do you publish interactive documentation for all of your APIs?<br />- How do you require developers authenticate with your APIs?<br />- What percentage of your API infrastructure supports web applications?<br />- What percentage of your API infrastructure supports mobile applications?<br />- What percentage of your API infrastructure supports device applications?<br />- Do you actively monitor the availability of all your APIs?<br />- Do you actively validate the responses for all of your APIs?<br />- Do you actively test the performance of all of your APIs?<br />- Do you actively scan all of your APIs for vulnerabilities?<br /><br /><strong>Outreach</strong> - Helping understand how organizations reach out internally and externally.<br /><br />- Is there a dedicated API advocate or evangelist on staff?<br />- Do you have a dedicated blog for your API program?<br />- Do you have an email address dedicated to supporting your APIs?<br />- Do you have a ticketing system dedicated to supporting your APIs?<br />- Do you have a newsletter available for your API program?<br />- Do you have a dedicated Twitter account for your API program?<br />- Do you have a dedicated GitHub organization for your API program?<br />- Does your team attend or speak at conferences about your API efforts?<br /><br /><strong>Governance</strong> - Understanding how organizations measure, report, and evolve API operations.<br /><br />- Is there a central API governance strategy at your organization?<br />- Do you have an API design guide available for your API team?<br />- Do you have service level agreements available for your APIs?<br />- Do you measure revenue / value generated across your APIs?<br />- Do you quantify the reach of your APIs across applications?<br />- Do you report upon activity across all APIs to leadership?<br /><br />These questions help paint a pretty interesting perspective of how far along a group is when it comes to their API journey. Some groups won't be able to answer some questions, while others will be able to confidently provide answers to most of them. It wouldn't be too difficult to attach scoring to each question, and then calculate a score for each area of the API lifecycle, as well as an overall score for the entity--using to understand what an organization is ready for, and where they should be investing.<br /><br />If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about your organizations API maturity, and learn more about what other companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are doing when it comes to their investment in their API operations., feel free to reach out. I have a significant amount of information regarding how other API providers are defining, designing, delivering, supporting, and governing their API operations&mdash;I&rsquo;m happy to help share this knowledge. I&rsquo;m going to continue to work on making this API maturity questionnaire more self-service so that companies can self apply, and potentially get at other resources to help them in their journey. If you have questions in the mean time, feel free to ping me with your questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2019/09/18/creating-a-postman-collection-for-the-fast-healthcare-interoperability-resources-fhir-specification/">I had generated a Postman Collection for the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) the other day</a>. Making a simple, easy to use, executable representation of any FHIR compliant API. I wanted to get intimate with the healthcare API standard so that I can better contribute specification and conversation, but I also wanted to use the specification to map out what industry level API contracts can be using Postman. Over time the Postman collection will evolve, and become more robust to contain the pieces of the puzzle that help move it from being an API definition to an API contract.<br /><br />After creating the collection <a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/35240/SVmwxdrK?version=latest">I have now published my FHIR API Postman Collection as documentation</a> and to t<a href="https://explore.postman.com/">he Postman API Network</a>. It still has to go through a review process before it is available in the Postman Network, but you can get at the documentation and Postman Collection directly. The process demonstrates how you can go from a working Postman Collection to documentation and discovery in just a couple of clicks. Then make your API collection and documentation available to any developers, helping them go from discovery to making actual API calls in just a couple clicks. The process for me demonstrates how ALL APIs should be defined, ensuring all APIs are well documented and executable by default&mdash;not something developed have to figure out for themselves.<br /><br />I am still working on which of my API definitions I want to be publishing to the Postman API Network. I&rsquo;ll be working to convert all of my API definitions to Postman Collections, and publishing API documentation, but I&rsquo;ll be very selective about which ones I publish to the Postman API Network. I really want the API provider to take charge of this process. I&rsquo;m happy to have all these APIs associated with my account, but it would be more authoritative to have Postman collections, documentation, and the directory page managed by the API provider themself. It doesn&rsquo;t take much to manage your Postman Collection, and something within the power of each API provider. I&rsquo;m happy to even do some of the heavy lifting in creation of the Postman Collection, but that last mile is really the low bar for what I can expect from API providers.<br /><br />The trick is to get the attention of API providers and helping them understand the value of having their API defined as a Postman Collection in the first place, as well has taking a moment to see how it is literally a couple of clicks to go from collection to documentation and directory listing. I&rsquo;ll keep tackling this problem API by API, company by company, and writing stories about each time I go through this process. I find that the savvy API providers eventually reach out after I publish information about them. One signal I track and add to their overall API rating, helping me understand the API providers who are actually somewhat aware of what is happening around their API, versus the ones who don&rsquo;t really care. Helping me understand the overall presence of each API provider, and how much they are paying attention to the world around them, and ultimately care about their API community.</p>

<p><a href="http://schema.org.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/schema-org/schema-org-schema-screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a>I wanted a ready to go supply of JSON examples from a variety of industries for me to use in my storytelling. No better place to begin with a project like this than with <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>, who provides a schema for just about anything you can think of. Karate Studio API anyone? I already had some scripts setup for creating Swagger 2.0 files from Schema.org, so <a href="http://schema.org.apievangelist.com/">I got to work retrofitting my Schema.org index to produce JSON Schema representations for each of the 600 objects in the index</a>. Providing me with wealth of schema to choose from when I am defining new APIs, and telling stories about how APIs can make an impact across many different industries. <br /><br />After generating <a href="http://schema.org.apievangelist.com/">JSON Schema for 600 Schema.org objects</a>, I worked to generate an example JSON for each of the objects, so I can demonstrate the schema as well as what it will look like while in use. The challenge with this work is how deep do you go when following the wormhole of Schema.org object properties&mdash;I opted to only do one level at the moment. I started hydrated each property that was an object, but then after going 5 levels deep I realized I should probably put more thought into this before creating massive JSON objects. I&rsquo;ll work on this as a separate task, tackle a handful of the objects to better understand just how deep things can go, and come up with a better strategy for handling.<br /><br />Next I wanted to take each JSON example and create a simple one request Postman Collection, so I wrote a script to generate 600 basic collection producing just a single GET request, with the single level JSON example as a response. I&rsquo;m not going to actually import my collections in Postman until I get them a little more polished, but so far the process has provided me with a nice proof of concept for starting new APIs from Schema.org using Postman. Next I will republish each Postman API Collection with POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, rounding off the CRUD nature of each of my Schema.org org API definitions. Providing simple seeds that anyone can use to quickly define and deploy an API that uses standardized schema, increasingly the interoperability between APIs, and realizing the value that Schema.org brings to the table.<br /><br />After having JSON Schema, JSON examples, and Postman Collections defined I am going to generate OpenAPI 3.0 definitions to round things off. Then I&rsquo;ll see what is possible for turning my Postman Collections into mock servers, and creating tests, monitors, and other API contract enablement elements. If you have any needs around these Schema.org seeds that might help you deliver new APIs, and standardize the schema you have in play across your API infrastructure. I&rsquo;ll be investing a couple of hours a week into my Schema.org API definitions, evolving them into a robust toolbox for me to use across my API storytelling. Hopefully along the way I can also provide a robust set of schema than anyone can use to power their API development, and most importantly help demonstrate the power of Schema.org, which is something that I feel strongly is under-represented across the API sector.</p>

<p>A true test of any API service provider is whether or not they have an API. It is one of the most critical tests I have for any company who is selling a service to API providers. If you are sell services to people who provide APIs, and do not have your own API, I&rsquo;m immediately skeptical about how you are playing the game. Postman passes a lot of quality and ethical tests I have, but the fact that they eat their own food, and has <a href="https://docs.api.postman.com/">documentation and a machine readable Postman Collection</a> demonstrates they get it.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m looking to sync my API catalog a series of my Postman workspaces&mdash;ensuring that if an API in my catalog has an OpenAPI, it also has an up to date Postman Collection. Actually, I am going to outsource the profiling of a companies API to a series of Postman workspaces, and only using my catalog for profiling the other elements of a company&rsquo;s operations. The presence of a Postman Collection, and a Postman Environment has long been the signal that an API in my catalog has a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; profile available for its API. This is why profiling APIs with Postman is valuable, if builds the definition around the actual request and response, thus completing the circle for me.<br /><br />Anyways, I thought it was pretty significant that Postman has an API, and manages it using the same services that they offer to their customers. I also thought it was significant that the completeness of Postman's API is enabling me to move faster when it comes profiling the completeness of other APIs I&rsquo;m tracking on. It really is a pretty virtuous cycle when you think about it. While I am happy to find an OpenAPI for any API I&rsquo;m profiling and learning about, I&rsquo;d rather find a Postman Collection, plus a Postman Environment, accompanied with a frictionless signup process to get my keys. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if I could just download a collection for an API, call a single signup endpoint using my Postman account, and get a Postman Environment in return&mdash;allowing me to make my first API call after just three clicks. Someday.<br /><br />I am going to get to work wiring up my API catalog with the Postman Collections and Environments API, and syncing things up so that I can use Postman to deploy some mock servers, and also continue to use Postman to successfully make calls to the APIs I don&rsquo;t already have a complete definition for, including the example that is necessary to actually deploy a mock server. I wish that all APIs had complete Postman Collections plus Postman Environments, then I wouldn&rsquo;t have to do all this work. I could just spider the web looking for Postman Collections, import them into my system, sign up for API access, and begin actually seeing the value each API offers. Eventually we will get there, but for now I still need to be the one who is connecting the dots.</p>

<p>Going from an idea for an API, to something you can actually share with another team member or stakeholder is historically something that can take hours, days or even weeks. Even if you manage to convey your idea to another or team member, you can&rsquo;t always guarantee they&rsquo;ll understand the API design as intended. The best way to convey your thoughts is to mock and document your API as if it was a real API, letting your intended audience actually review the documentation, make actual calls to the API, and provide feedback on each individual request, or even begin changing the design and implementation as part of their feedback.<br /><br />I wanted to see how easy it was to take a new idea for an API and make it something that can be easily shared and worked with using Postman. I had recently been updating the JSON Schema for my Schema.org objects, so I quickly wrote a script to generate JSON samples from each of the standardized objects, and picked a random object to use in my demonstration&mdash;Offers.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/f9305b7c09e1ffdecc59b7e3b97d35b2.js"></script>
Now that I have a JSON example I can get to work generating a new mock API using my JSON snippet, creating a single API GET request, with the JSON as the request response. First I create a new mock server using the orange new button.<br /><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman/new-api/new-mock.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Then I create a single GET endpoint for my API, and paste the JSON Schema for my Schema.org offers snippet into the response body for my new API endpoint.<br /><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman/new-api/new-request.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Then I just follow the rest of the wizard, giving my mock API a name, and leaving most other settings as their default before moving on to actually being able to use my mock API.<br /><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman/new-api/publish-mock.png" alt="" width="100%" /><br /><br />Now I have a an API collection with a mock server that I can make calls to and see my JSON returned as part of the API response, making my offers API come to life.<br /><br /><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman/new-api/api-response.png" alt="" width="100%" /><br /><br />I can now share this API collection with any team member, but why stop there. I want to actually provide documentation for the offers API along with my working Postman collection that they can put to work in a shared or personal Postman workspace.<br /><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman/new-api/api-docs.png" alt="" width="100%" /><br /><br />I went from idea for an API, to a working API and documentation in less than 5 minutes. That is pretty significant. It allows me to quickly share an API idea with anyone before I ever invest too much time into what it will do. I can give the API documentation and collection to anyone I want to work with on the API or any application that will be using the API. Demonstrating why API mocking and documentation generated from an API definition can change how we deliver our APIs.<br /><br />I expected Postman to excel at doing this, but I was a little surprised that it was less than 5 minutes to go from schema to mocked and documented API. I am going to play around with the possibilities using some of my other Schema.org schemas. I&rsquo;m working to establish the right template for a collection that I can programmatically create from all of the Schema.org JSON Schema I have, publishing a usable collection that can be easily mocked and have documentation published by anyone who downloads the Postman collection for the Schema.org object they desire. Helping streamline how we deliver APIs, but also help standardize them along the way using a standard schema vocabulary.</p>

<p>I have been working on healthcare APIs in government for over five  years now, providing feedback regularly to the Blue Button API effort  over at Health and Human Service (HHS), <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/09/18/talking-healthcare-apis-with-the-cms-blue-button-api-team-at-apistrat-in/">including having them speak at APIStrat last year in Nashville</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/09/18/talking-healthcare-apis-with-the-cms-blue-button-api-team-at-apistrat-in/">me speaking at the White House as part of the Blue Button 2.0 summit</a>.  I&rsquo;m always looking for more ways that I can contribute to the  healthcare API ecosystem, especially when it comes to investing in <a href="https://www.fhir.org/">the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification</a>.  Now that I have bandwidth to invest in healthcare APIs again, I wanted  to get my mind thinking about the potential of the FHIR specification,  and find ways to help move the conversation forward.<br /><br />To jumpstart my work on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification I generated <a href="https://www.postman.com/collections/28f36ef9615b6e5b13b7">a Postman Collection</a> from the FHIR test server, reverse engineering the specification and  creating my first draft of a collection to center my effort around. The  Postman Collection covers the following resource types:</p>

<p><a href="http://test.fhir.org/r4">The FHIR API specification collection points at the FHIR test server by default</a>,  and some of the paths need parameters dialed in a little better to  work. Next I&rsquo;ll work on cleaning up the ecollection some, making sure  the properties have descriptions, and every request has examples  defined. Then I&rsquo;ll publish some documentation and a FHIR API mock  server. Once I get to this point I&rsquo;ll look at defining an environment,  as well as tests that cover the entire surface area for all resource  types. Rounding off the FHIR Postman collection a little more, making  sure it isn&rsquo;t just a definition, but a contract that can be used to  certify any FHIR API deployment.<br /><br />I am looking to refresh my FHIR  knowledge using the most recent 4.0 version of the healthcare  specification, while also evolving my storytelling around how to define  API contracts that can be applied to APIs spanning an entire industry.  I&rsquo;d say that the FHIR specification is the most important API definition  we have right now. It is the most sophisticated openly defined industry  schema that has both government and industry support, supportsing  critical deployments like the Blue Button API for Medicare and the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and is something that has the potential  to impact millions of people. It&rsquo;s a relevant API, and something I want  to continue helping evangelize and invest in the API specification as  part of my work with Postman.</p>

<p>As I craft stories for my blog I am always working to reach as wide  possible audience as I can. It is one of the reasons I write so many  stories, because the process helps me refine how I say things, and the  words that I use. The process is a double edge sword because I want to  reach my more technical audience by using very precise and meaningful  terms, but I also want to reach out to a more business focused audience  by using other more general and meaningful terms. This is a tough  balance to find across any single post, so I tend to mix things up  across posts, going down the technical rabbit hole on some, while  keeping things high level for my business users on others. Keeping the  site reaching as many folks as possible.</p>
<p>Bridging what developers are thinking with what business users are  thinking has been one of the sustained missions of API Evangelist since  2010. I&rsquo;m not always successful in realizing this mission, but I work as  hard as possibly I can to help reach business users whenever possible.  When I write my posts I try to think about what a business user will be  Googling for, and I realize that this will rarely ever contain the  phrase application programming interface, or the acronym API. Business  users are going to be searching for terms and phrases that match the  problems they face, and the solutions they are in need of to make their  lives easier. Often times they are unaware that they are looking for an  API, a connector, or integration between platforms using APIs&mdash;rendering  many of the technical concepts us API aware folks depend on useless when  actually reaching outside the API echo chamber.</p>
<p>To help me push my word-smithing outside of the realm of API, I  wanted to explore some terms and phrases that might resonate with  business users when they are googling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrations</strong> - The integration between two platforms, often referred using the acronym iPaaS.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong> - The automatic movement of data and information across many different platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Orchestration</strong> - The orchestration and movement of data and information across many different platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> - Keeping one or many platforms in sync when it comes to the data they possess.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> - The aggregation and merging of data and information between many platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Syndication</strong> - The publishing of data, content, and media from one platform too many distributed locations.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate</strong> - Providing commercial access to data, content, media, and other resources for 3rd parties to sell.</li>
<li><strong>Connectors</strong> - Connecting platforms, systems, and applications together using APIs in a plug and play way.</li>
<li><strong>Plugins</strong> - Allowing for the extending of development of plugins for existing API-driven platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong> - Using APIs for development is common, with APIs abstracted away in the thought.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong> - Using the data, content, and other information from APIs to drive visualizations.</li>
<li><strong>System</strong> - A localized or distributed system that a user will be wanted to move data around within.</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong> - Targeting a specific platform as part of integration, automation, and up to date with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong> - The end use application being used or developed on top of API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Device</strong> - Physical devices that are connected to the internet and transmit data to cloud platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow</strong> - Defining logical processes and flows of information to accomplish specific objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong> - Establishing well defined processes that depend on multiple platforms to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong> - Opening up platforms and systems so that we can share data, content, media, and other resources.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - Enabling collaboration amongst teams, between companies, and with the public.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity</strong> - Ensuring that employees and team members are as productive as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are words that business users will be thinking about instead of  the acronym API. They are what APIs enable. Most people do not think  API when they are speaking in these terms, but APIs are always right  beneath the service delivering the functionality they are seeking. These  words represent the API enabled solution that a business user is  looking for, but they will usually also be attaching these solutions to a  specific resource, most likely one of these top API-driven  capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>News</strong> - Mainstream, financial, and other relevant news being consumed and aggregated.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong> - Working with images, photos, icons, screenshots, and other image resources.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong> - Managing the videos, media, and other interactive content using APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - Using spreadsheets as a data source, or getting data into spreadsheets.</li>
<li><strong>Order</strong> - Managing the ordering of products, services, and other commercial resources.</li>
<li><strong>Commerce</strong> - General commerce and supply chain integrations and automation.</li>
<li><strong>Products</strong> - Working with physical or more tangible products that can be purchased.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> - Working with less tangible, often on-going, and abstract services.</li>
<li><strong>Shopping Cart </strong>- The purchasing of products, services, and other resources.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Projects</strong> - Organizing projects and all the related resources that will go along with them.</li>
<li><strong>Calendars</strong> - Keeping our schedules organized managing individual and shared calendars.</li>
<li><strong>Appointments</strong> - Managing specific appointments that need to be schedule across calendars.</li>
<li><strong>Meetings</strong> - Handling all the details and resources associated with specific meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - Managing emails across all of our personal business accounts and platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - Widening the message umbrella to include all the other message that we send and receive.</li>
<li><strong>Chats</strong> - Keeping the real-time chat messages flowing between all of the platforms and devices we use.</li>
<li><strong>Documents</strong> - Finding solutions for managing documents, signatures, and other meta data.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> - Understanding how we store objects, media, and other resources across the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Understanding how to better integrate our social presence across all major platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Tasking</strong> - Finding solutions for managing the tasks that we need to accomplish across teams.</li>

<li><strong>Support</strong> - Being able to successfully support our customers and users via online tooling.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the meaningful resources business users depend on. I have  many more topics on this list, but these represent the top areas I am  tracking on when it comes to API providers and consumers, and are  central to integration and aggregation platforms I track on. This list  provides the base of word combinations I use throughout my research and  storytelling. I&rsquo;m always looking for more insight into how business  users think about the digital solutions they are looking for, and help  my content be more discoverable and accessible to these business users.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I take terms from each of these lists and combine them when I do  searches for APIs. I also try to cover API-driven solutions by using  various combination of these phrases in my titles and body of posts. One  area I need to get better at is providing real world, one or two click  solutions for helping people find API-driven solutions in these areas.  How do I point users to a Zapier or IFTTT solution, or maybe a Postman  Collection that delivers in one of these areas, and realize the solution  a business user is looking for. Continuing to build bridges between the  API-driven solutions we all work so hard on, but often fall short when  it comes to actually reaching the business users who make decisions, and  often are closer to the real problem being solved than us developers  are.</p>

<p>When doing web services and API inventory at enterprise organizations I always come across one or two individuals or groups who are the keepers of the APIs, schema, and related knowledge and truth within the organization. It is the new version of the database keepers within large organizations, but instead of it just being just about data, it is about access to all types of resources, including data, content, algorithms, network, and other infrastructure elements. Being the API knowledgebase, directory, and source of truth within an organization takes a lot of work, but it is something that will pay off down the road when it comes to actually getting things done within an organization.<br /><br />I have had a database of APIs since 2011, but it has mostly been for my discovery only. Historically I have published some of these to GitHub, and I&rsquo;m working on different ways of making them available via search, but now that I&rsquo;m working at Postman, I am considering making them available in different ways via Postman workspaces, and collections. Ideally, API providers would publish their own API definitions to Postman to <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">the Postman API network</a>, so I could just rely on API provider verified collections, but until that day I'll keep working on crafting them myself. Even once I have a complete API collection, I still find that my way of organizing a collection, and pre-populating Postman environment with certain variables often goes far beyond what most API providers will offer up in their own collections.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m looking for some of my hand-crafted Postman Collections and Templates to become the source of truth when it comes to some of the APIs I'm telling stories about. I don&rsquo;t just want to be the person people come to for interesting APIs with complete API definitions, I want them to come to me because I am pre-populating them with meaningful values, naming them using more meaningful labels, and making them available via accessible workspaces. Helping uncover some of the more interesting API use cases out there, while also making APIs more accessible to developers, and hopefully even non-technical users. I am all about being the source of truth for important API definitions, helping people not just find the APIs that exist, but also be able to quickly put them to work.<br /><br />Postman provides a pretty simple and free way to begin organizing API definitions in a very useable way. It is something that you can slowly gather and organize over time, and begin making available to different team members via carefully crafting workspaces. It is something you can start out doing for free, and then as it grows in adoption amongst team members you can sell your boss on going pro or enterprise, depending on the size of your team(s). I&rsquo;m going to work to better organize my API catalog using Postman collections, teams, environments, and templates, then tell the story along the way. I have a couple thousand APIs I want to organize and make accessible. I&rsquo;m guessing I am going to learn a thing or two along the way, making for some pretty good stories to tell, and eventually some guides to help other people become the source of truth for APIs within their organization.</p>

<p>I am now immersed in all things Postman. After a week at Postman, attending POSTCON, and listening to how API developers are putting the API development environment, I have realized what a Swiss army knife the platform is. I get the core functionality of the application very well, and have used for several years. However, I only lightly understood the mocking, testing, monitors, runners, documentation, and other key features. I also was introduced to how pre and post scripts reduce friction, and the versatility, portability, and share-ability of Postman Collections. I&rsquo;m beyond ecstatic to be studying and evangelizing all things Postman, and get to spend full time thinking deeply about how it can be applied across the API lifecycle.<br /><br />My days will be filled with me playing around with Postman, and defining, mocking, testing, monitoring, documenting, and moving APIs forward, then telling the story of what I am doing here on API Evangelist, on the Postman Blog, and as part of other conversations I&rsquo;m engaged in. While this will keep me very busy, I&rsquo;d like to hear what you are doing with Postman. I want it all. I want your mundane stories about how you use it just to make simple API requests. I want to hear the stories about why you aren&rsquo;t using some of the other features like mocking and testing. I also want to hear all about the amazing lifecycle workflows you&rsquo;ve cobbled together using Postman. After talking with companies at POSTCON I&rsquo;ve come to realize how much Postman enables many of the common API lifecycle workflows we hear about, but also that there is a long tail of workflows that are cobbled together to meet the specific needs of teams on the ground&mdash;lighting my imagination when it comes to what is possible with Postman.<br /><br />I am happy to showcase what you are working on here on the blog, as well as anonymize your story&mdash;it is something I do all the time. It&rsquo;s up to you. I&rsquo;m just looking to learn more about what is going on in the trenches when it comes to Postman usage within the enterprise. I knew that Postman is being used across the enterprise. I&rsquo;ve seen it become the ubiquitous API client for enterprise developers over the last five years. I have also seen the Postman Collections quickly become a useful definition for describing API capabilities in not just a machine readable format, but when combined with environments, become portable, shareable, executable units of API value. I knew Postman was doing interesting things with mocking, monitoring, testing, and documentation, but hadn&rsquo;t ever really played with an of it in a meaningful way. However, I had not idea of the impact that scripts and runners were having on how developers automated and orchestrated their API operations. I want to know more. I&rsquo;d like to have a more robust set of stories to tell when it comes to this type of API lifecycle realization.<br /><br />Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a>, or tweet at me via <a href="https://twitter.com/apievangelist">@apievangelist</a>. Or better yet, publish a blog post about it and shoot the link over to me. I&rsquo;m guessing y&rsquo;all are doing some pretty interesting things with Postman that I&rsquo;m not aware of. What I like best about what I&rsquo;ve seen so far is that it is all very organic, and developer defined. The Postman client defines a lot for developers, but it really leans on HTTP requests and responses in conjunction with some pre and post request scripts for its magic. It is something that seems to speak to developers, and allows for an unlimited ways to approach developing, delivering, and consuming APIs. Anyways, share your stories with me. My inbox is open. Ping me with as much detail about your approach as you can, and I&rsquo;ll add to my notebook, and see where I can riff off of what you are cooking up. I look forward to shining a light on your work.</p>

<p>I need a couple of generic APIs for some storytelling and workshop materials. Just some basic example of web API in action managing some common everyday resources like notes, products, and company information. As a developer, I have to admit that it is hard to not just get to work sling&rsquo;n code to bring an API to life. I&rsquo;m a full blown API-first believer, and I still struggle with wanting to roll up my sleeves and being code first. As a developer, it is what we do, and it isn&rsquo;t going to be easy to change behavior, but I find that I need to stop being my own worst enemy, and stop ignoring the benefits of being API-first and invest what in what I need to practice what I preach. <br /><br />My APIs always start with a schema, and in this case I&rsquo;m going to use <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>, keeping my APIs as standardized as possible. Now that I&rdquo;m evangelizing Postman I&rsquo;m going to to start all my APIs within the Postman API development environment, starting with a single GET request that returns the seed schema I&rsquo;m looking to deliver. Then I&rsquo;ll add a POST, PUT, and DELETE for my API, rounding off the CRUD basics, and fire up a mock using Postman, giving me my API-first capability I need. Then I can make requests to my API, and make available as part of my stories and tutorial, demonstrating how a basic API works. Now that I&rsquo;m fleshing this idea out, I&rsquo;m thinking I will also make a how to deploy an API tutorial using the same API. Originally I was just going to use it to show to consume an API, but since I&rdquo;m going with an API-first approach with my API, there is an API-first lesson in there as well.<br /><br />I think one of the things to get me over my hurdle will be the tooling. To be empowered to go from Schema.org schema to a mock API within a couple minutes, then be able to publish API documentation with one more click and share my working API with team members is pretty convincing. To setup a database, craft the code, and publish documentation using my classic process would take me at least an hour, if not two to three hours. This improved efficiency in crafting new APIs is what is going to change my behavior. I will still need to be able to deploy the resulting API, but that will be something I can workout using a couple of different approaches. I&rsquo;d say the hurdles around the actual deployment of APIs is one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve still clung to my old ways of doing things. Even if I&rsquo;m API-first I still have to ultimately deploy the code or gateway as part of the lifecycle of the API&mdash;something I&rsquo;m looking to streamline.<br /><br />This reality of API-first on the ground within the enterprise is something I&rsquo;m looking to explore further. If you are struggling with convincing your teams to go API-first I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts on why. It is something I&rsquo;m looking to shine a light on, and understand what factors prevent organizations from realizing API-first. I know it is something that many dream about realizing, but something that rarely gets fully realized on the ground. I want to know why. I&rsquo;m sure there are a number of reasons, but I&rsquo;m guessing that more streamlined processes, and tooling assists will go a long way towards tipping the scales towards embracing API-first. Well I have some more work to do on <a href="http://schema.org.apievangelist.com/">my Schema.org JSON schema files </a>before they are ready for mocking as APIs, but once I do I will publish a more comprehensive blog post here, and work to craft some more formal walkthroughs of how to actually do what I am talking about using Postman.</p>

<p><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/asc-2019/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/events/asc-vancouver-2019/asc-2019-vancouver.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a>I&rsquo;m happy to have the time in my new role to make it up to <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/asc-2019/">the API Specifications Conference</a> next month. It really is the most important API conference out there, not just because it used to be my baby APIStrat, but because it is about the bedrock of the API sector&mdash;API definitions. As the API sector continues to go mainstream it is becoming increasingly important that we continue to standardize how we deliver APIs, and develop a common vocabulary for everything API. The discussions we will be having at the API Specification Conference will impact every stop along the API lifecycle, making it the most important API event out there in my opinion.</p>
<p>Looking through the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/asc-2019/program/schedule/">ASC program schedule</a> I am seeing coverage of the entire API toolbox, covering REST ,Hypermedia, GraphQL, gRPC, and event-driven APIs, with representation for JSON Schema, JSON-LD, OData, OpenAPI, RAML, API Blueprint, and AsyncAPI. Which for me represents the future of API design and development, preparing us all for the realities we will be facing on the ground across the organizations we work at each day. While REST is the cornerstone of everything API, I support everyone being well versed in a diverse API toolbox, as well as there being multiple API specification formats to rule them all&mdash;again, making the API Specifications the most important API event out there in my opinion.<br /><br />I will be heading to Vancouver for ASC in October. No plans to speak yet, but Abhijit Kane from Postman will be speaking on API schema formats and his learnings using them at Postman. If nothing else, I will just be roaming the halls panhandling and maybe busking a little bit in the corner. The lineup is pretty amazing&mdash;I&rsquo;m looking forward to actually plotting out which talks I will be attending, and trying to take in sessions from across the spectrum. I&rsquo;m looking to learn more about what the future holds for JSON Schema, AsyncAPI, as well as OpenAPI, but I&rsquo;m also keen on getting up to speed regarding how some of the larger companies are viewing the spectrum of API specifications that exist across the landscape today.<br /><br />It will be interesting to be at the conference after operating it as API Strategy &amp; Practice for so many years. It REALLY makes me happy to see it reborn as a specification conference. I&rsquo;m completely serious when I say it is the most important API event out there (3 times). It is! To me, API definitions are what matter the most. Code will be refactored, and tools and services come and go, but our most important work will live on as API definitions. While there are plenty of vendor experiences to be had at other conferences, if you want o rub elbows with the who&rsquo;s who of the API sector, and learn what matters from the experts, you should be in Vancouver next month. I look forward to seeing you all there, and catching up with many of you that I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while.</p>

<p><em>This is part of my on-boarding work as Chief Evangelist with Postman. Part of my work to understand how Postman users are putting the platform to work is to process earch one of their use cases in a narrative format. The process helps these things stick in my mind, and since they are all driven by actual feedback and stories from their users, it populates my brain with relevant talking points when I'm engaging with customers.</em></p>
<p>API-first is a philosophy and way of life that involves beginning every software capability as an API before you ever begin developer any user interface, or any other element. API-first ensures that all organizational capabilities are defined as simple, intuitive, well-designed API interfaces that can be used and reused across many different applications and systems. Right now, API-first is more of a myth than it is reality in most companies, but regardless, API-first is something many companies strive for when it comes to the development of their software. <br /><br />Postman has a dedicated <a href="https://www.postman.com/use-cases/api-first-development">API-First development use case</a> which provides a simple set of steps to consider when it comes to establishing an API-first development process&mdash;breaking things down into four separate phases.<br /><br /><strong>1. Specification Phase -</strong> Getting to work defining what each API capability will actually do.<br /><br /><strong>- Create a new API -</strong> Begin defining a new API fro scratch, not working from existing pattern.<br /><strong>- Write or import a new specification -</strong> Working on an API from an existing API specification.<br /><br /><strong>2. Development Phase - </strong>The actual development of an API that is being specified. <br /><br /><strong>- Create a mock server -</strong> Turn the specification into a mock representation of the API.<br /><strong>- Create documentation - </strong>Publish documentation for your API using the API specification.<br /><strong>- Debug API - </strong>Track, coordinate and fix bugs and defects in the API being developed.<br /><br /><strong>3. Testing Phase -</strong> Ensuring you have the surface area of your API covered by API tests.<br /><br /><strong>- Explore the API -</strong> With an API mocked and being developed you can explore its details.<br /><strong>- Write tests using JavaSCript -</strong> Tests defining expected outcomes can be defined for all APIs.<br /><strong>- Verify test results in Collection Runner - </strong>Automate the verification of tests for all APIs.<br /><br /><strong>4. Deployment Phase -</strong> Actually realizing and deploying the API capability that is being defined.<br /><br /><strong>- Integrate tests in build system through Newman -</strong> Bake all tests for APIs into the CI/CD workflow.<br /><strong>- Deploy to production through your CI/CD pipeline -</strong> Publish code if all the tests pass as part of build.<br /><strong>- Setup monitors to get alerts -</strong> Monitor APIs to ensure the tests are regularly ran and validated.<br /><br />There are definitely more details in the cracks of API-first, but this list provides you with a high level view of what it is all about. Providing a simple checklist to use when starting API-first conversations across your organization. Each element of the phases above will look different depending on how your organization does what it does, but this basic blueprint is intentionally kept simple to help jumpstart the conversation, and not overwhelm API stakeholders who might not have a lot of experience with the API-first development process.<br /><br />This <a href="https://www.postman.com/use-cases/api-first-development">API-first use case blueprint</a> is the most talked about approach to APIs out there today. Companies who have invested in their API-first journey realize how much time, money, and pain can be saved by starting every software application conversation with APIs, and how much more efficient it is to define, mock, and be test-focused as part of their API-first reality. API-first is never as easy as it seems, but once development teams make the investment and begin making API-first a reality, they quickly realize that it was something they should have done a long time ago, and they understand how it can dramatically shift the conversation around how APIs get done across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently processing <a href="https://www.postman.com/use-cases/">the common Postman use cases</a>, and overlaying what the platform offers in context of historically what I&rsquo;ve called my API lifecycle research. I plan on brining my vision more in alignment with Postman&rsquo;s approach because I want to be telling consistent API lifecycle stories across API Evangelist and Postman, but also have things be in sync when I&rdquo;m out speaking in public. I spent some time going through the Postman website and application and documented all of the stops along the API lifecycle they service, and then I took that and mapped it to the vocabulary I&rsquo;ve been using to describe these areas as part of my own API lifecycle research. Providing me with a bulleted list of stops, not in any particular order, but demonstrating for me the scope of the impact Postman is making right now.</p>

<p>I am sure there will be other dots I connect between what Postman delivers and my API research, but this gives me a good checklist to be thinking about when it comes to the overlap in my world(s). I&rsquo;m going to be bringing more of my storytelling into sync with their blue print use cases methodology, but no doubt I will also be influencing how we evolve these API lifecycle blue prints to match what I&rsquo;ve been seeing over the last nine years, but more importantly, the realities on the ground within the Postman ecosystem. This is why I am doing all of this work. I want to use the resulting common vocabulary to describe what is actually happening on the ground at companies, institutions, organizations, and government agencies. I don&rsquo;t want Postman or API Evangelist to be defining the API lifecycle, I want us to be responding to what we are seeing on the ground, and helping establish a common vocabulary for describing what we are seeing.<br /><br />This list represents why I joined Postman. It is the most coherent snapshot of what I&rsquo;ve been calling API lifecycle tooling and Postman has been calling an API development environment (ADP). It is the most coherent vision I&rsquo;m seeing when it comes to delivering across multiple stops along the API lifecycle out of an API service provider. However, more importantly, Postman is a Swiss army knife of API lifecycle capabilities that can be implemented by developers in the trenches. My mission is to help map out how API providers and consumers are using Postman across their teams. I&rsquo;m looking to help create API blueprints of the common patterns I&rsquo;m seeing, and make it dead simple to apply only what developers desire and nothing more. Making the API lifecycle a buffet of things that COULD happen, but it is up to developer to decide how, when, and why they are putting Postman to work.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoy engaging with my wife when it comes to APIs. She has been along for the entire API Evangelist ride, and she has absorbed more about APIs from listening to me talk about APIs than almost anyone else in the industry. While she tunes me out most of the time, she does listen and engage regularly, providing me with a pretty valuable sounding board to bounce ideas and concepts off from time to time. I&rsquo;m cautious about how often I tap this resource, but when the time is right I will introduce her to an API concept I&rsquo;m working with to see what she has to say. Yesterday was one of these days, and I took advantage of an opportunity to show her a Postman Collection I had made of several NASA APIs.<br /><br />My wife isn&rsquo;t known for beating around the bush, <a href="https://hackeducation.com">just read her blog Hack Education</a> for a sampling, and after walking her through what Postman does when you have a bunchof APIs defined as collections, complete with an environment and API keys, her response was &ldquo;cool, but what now&rdquo;? Providing me with the regular brutal honesty I look for in my wife, but also what I like to hear when it comes to my API blah blah blah. My motivation behind sharing this Postman Collection with her was all about testing the waters for building API collections and potentially sharing them with non-developers. Since all of the NASA APIs are read only, and while they provide a wealth of rich data as part of each API response, the resulting value of these API collections is all about the JSON responses, which you can save in Postman, but then as she states, &ldquo;what now&rdquo;?<br /><br />I am going to work on some other API collections that allow you to add or update data to demonstrate the wider API potential, but her question pushed me to think about how I can also work to better provide her with an answer to her question, and enable her to do more with the JSON data returned from the API collections I give to her and other non-developers. As a developer, I know what to do with the JSON responses from each API, but to the average individual, there can be a pretty big cognitive gap associated with taking the wide variety of JSON schema you may get back from any single API, and actually putting it to work within some useful process or application. The challenge for me is, how do you make JSON more usable by normals, making it something they can actually benefit from using, and apply in their everyday life without having to know how to program. If all JSON responses were one dimensional this might be easier, but with very little standardization of API schema, this creates a pretty big hurdle for the non-developer API consumer.<br /><br />Postman has began to introduce features like API response visualization, adding to what you can do with each API response, but I feel there is a lot more opportunity ahead of us when it comes to what you can do with each API response in Postman. You can save, download, copy, and now visualize responses, but if I&rsquo;m going to reach &ldquo;normals&rdquo; with my Postman Collections I am going to need more than that. I&rsquo;ll start with some basic tooling that allows you to copy or upload the resulting JSON and accomplish some valuable task, just to explore what is possible. Then I&rsquo;ll explore what the possibilities are when it comes to making these capabilities more seamless with Postman, or possibly even work to influence the road map. I&rsquo;m pretty determined to see if I can come up with some answers to my wife&rsquo;s question of &ldquo;what now&rdquo;. She is a tough audience so it will require me creating something that delivers real value, and is dead simple for her to put to use, otherwise she is mostly likely to tell me to take a hike, and let me know what I am peddling is just API blah blah blah.</p>

<p>As some of you may have heard, I joined Postman as their Chief Evangelist last week. What does this mean? It means I will be telling a LOT of stories about my journey with the Postman team. Abhinav and team understand who I am and what I do, so not a whole lot will change, but like many phases of the last decade, my stories will be heavily focused on what I&rsquo;m doing with Postman. If you know my style, you know it won&rsquo;t be the usual product marketing storytelling you will find on an API service provider blog, it will be relevant stories about what I&rsquo;m doing and seeing as I do my research. Postman gets the value of me doing my research, and the importance of it remaining generic enough that you can apply outside the Postman ecosystem, but because Postman is such a versatile Swiss army knife af an API development environment (ADE), much of my storytelling will involve Postman. My goal is to always keep the stories I tell interesting, valuable, and relevant enough that people want to read them, and hopefully I do not lose my soul within the storytelling process. <br /><br />With that said, I am beyond excited to be diving into the Postman wormhole. If you&rsquo;ve followed my storytelling over the years, you know I can crank out the content when I&rsquo;m researching any topic, and when it comes to the core API lifecycle Postman is looking to dominate, I&rsquo;m confident I will be fully engaged. When I am fully engaged with a topic I care about, I can easily crank things up to OCD levels, and reach real-time levels of narration here on the blog regarding whatever I am working on within the moment. Every idea in my head gets written down, and the "best" of it gets fleshed out here on the blog, providing me with dizzying levels of momentum when it comes to moving ideas forward, refining them, and helping me better articulate myself in conversations I&rsquo;m having in person and online. When hitting my stride I can easily publish five posts a day on the blog, and craft one or two long form pieces a week on relevant topics I&rdquo;m immersed in.<br /><br />With that said, I&rsquo;d like to preemptively issue an apology for the volume of content I&rsquo;m about to produce. I&rsquo;m trusting you know how to rate limit your information intake, and you won&rsquo;t drown in my renewed excitement in the API space. Just remember that the blog here is my workbench, and I&rsquo;m hammering out my ideas in a very public way, while striving for more polished and honed work to be shared via other channels, and ultimately as part of my in-person speaking and conversations. From my experience, most people do not read my blog in a linear way via RSS anymore, and they depend on the algorithmically curated social timelines of Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others to be expose to my work. So the five stories I publish each day do not just get eyeballs one after another in a queue, it is spread across a one to two week period, some of which will also live on an enjoy an evergreen existence as part of my search engine optimization (SEO).<br /><br />I could not think of a more relevant tool than Postman to help guide my research and storytelling. The number of stops along the API lifecycle that you can service using Postman exceeds any other API service or tools out there. No other tools I use is more developer-centric, and I&rsquo;d say developer-lead, than Postman is. I couldn&rsquo;t have found a more rich API wormhole to dive into than the Postman community. My notebook is already full of story ideas after attending POSTCON last week, and crafting a pretty robust Postman Collection of NASA APIs this weekend. So before I cranked up the music and began writing I just wanted to give you fair warning of what is about to come down the pipes, and make sure you have fair warning to turn up or down the volume, or even reach out with your own API lifecycle and Postman stories, joining me in this next portion of my API journey while I explore what is possible using Postman.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.easypost.com/">EasyPost</a> spoke at the Postman User Conference (POSTCON) last week, and while they shared a number of very interesting stories, one that really stuck with me was about how they create Postman Collections for use by their non-technical sales teams. They put some of the common API driven tasks that a sales person would need to execute in the course of their daily work into each collection, and provided environments so that they didn&rsquo;t have to mess around with authentication. Making for a pretty compelling tale of non-developers putting APIs to work, which is kind of the holy grail of API consumption&mdash;empowering average business users to realize the potential of APIs.<br /><br />I am going to be creating several proof of concepts to see if I can create Postman Collections that are valuable enough, and simple enough to be executed by a non-technical user. The Postman interface can be a little busy at times because it is so feature rich, but I don&rsquo;t think it is out of the question for a business user to be able to get in there and execute on some pre-configured templates and collections. We&rsquo;ll see. I think it depends on the quality of the collection, and the fearlessness of the would-be user. I think with the right amount of attention while crafting, naming, and organizing the API collection, as wel as a dedicated effort to abstracting away the complexity of any of the underlying APIs, making it one click to get some value from some common, or even specialized APIs, we can make APIs much more accessible to a business audience.<br /><br />Postman provides a unique opportunity to make existing APIs more commonplace--reaching beyond just developers. I think we just have to work harder at defining collections, environments, and the scripts that help automate potential API engagements. We&rsquo;ll have to make sure we select useful API paths, pre-populate them with relevant values, and properly name and organize useful API capabilities, and then I believe we can start empowering average business users with features they will value. Postman lets you define workspaces with a variety of pre-defined API collections that are complete with environments, making for a pretty compelling API on-boarding solution for both developers and non-developers. Establishing a common executable format for accomplishing common tasks different teams will encounter in the course of their daily work.<br /><br />I have a lot to learn when it comes to properly crafting Postman Collections. I&rsquo;ve got the basics, but when it comes to sufficiently rounding off the sharp edges that will create friction for potential users, I have a lot of practicing ahead of me. I&rsquo;m going to conjure up a handful of potential roles for tailoring Postman Collections and Workspaces for, going beyond sales teams, and targeting marketing, journalism, and a handful of others to see if I can&rsquo;t craft some useful API collections. If nothing else I&rsquo;ll get more practice when it comes to creating Postman API Collections, and gather more intelligence from the poor non-technical folks I&rsquo;ll be using as test subjects when it comes to this experiment. I was inspired by the EasyPost team, and want to see if I can push the boundary of the types of users who are putting Postman to work, and expand the landscape when it comes to who consumes APIs.</p>

<p><em>This is a story derived from work to help develop a Postman Collection that could be used by the International Space Apps Challenge, establishing a machine readable definition for all the NASA APIs available at <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">https://api.nasa.gov/</a> that can be used by participations in the challenge, helping developers quickly get up to speed with the valuable APIs NASA provides. The International Space Apps Challenge is in need of sponsors and participants to help make the event a success--please visit <a href="http://www.spaceappschallenge.org">http://www.spaceappschallenge.org</a>, or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/spaceapps">@SpaceApps</a> to get involved.</em><br /><br />I met Katelyn Hertel (<a href="https://twitter.com/Katers_Potaters">@Katers_Potaters</a>) from the International Space Apps Challenge at POSTCON, and we got to talking about the interesting APIs NASA has, and how we can use Postman to make things easier for the developers who are participating in the global challenge. I immediately knew what was needed, and as soon as I got home this weekend I got to work on crafting a Postman Collection for all of the NASA APIs. It took me about four hours t apply for a key, and get up and running with each of the NASA APIs using Postman. As I was playing around with each of the individual API resources, which come from across many different groups, I took the liberty to better organize them, and came up with the following sub-folders for the NASA API Postman collection.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />I could spend days writing better summaries, descriptions, and organizing APIs into more meaningful folders and requests, but this should provide a good starting point. All 79 of the individual API requests work, allowing me to easily generate examples and documentation when ready. Here is the current draft of <a href="https://www.postman.com/collections/3a1e9510a749108b13ed">the NASA API Postman Collection</a>. I thought about breaking it into separate collections, one for reach area, but I thought it worked better as one collection, abstracting away the different APIs that come from different groups. I did manage to standardize some of the parameters across the APIs using <a href="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-collections/nasa/nasa-apis.postman_environment.json">a Postman Environment</a>, helping potentially reduce some friction running the different APIs. There is still much more work to be done across the APIs to help clean up some of the design and documentation available, but it provides a pretty robust picture of the different APIs NASA offers.<br /><br />This NASA API Postman Collection should help reduce friction for developers at the International Space Apps Challenge, providing them with a quick way to get up and running with any of the NASA APIs. Each developer will still need to signup for their own API key, but once they save their key as part of their Postman Environment, they should be able to use any of the 79 API requests organized within the collection. I&rsquo;m going to work with the International Space Apps Challenge folks to polish the collection a bit, and publish as part of the resources on the website for the challenge. Along the way I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of NASA&rsquo;s APIs, and organizing resources as a Postman Collection, something I will be talking about in ongoing stories here on the blog, showcasing how I profiled NASA APIs using Postman.</p>

<p>I have hundreds of collections within my Postman, but I&rsquo;ve never done much collaboration with others in there until now. I find myself getting more organized with the Postman collections for API Evangelist, because I&rsquo;m doing more coordination and sharing with the collections I maintain, but I&rsquo;m also preparing to ramp up as Chief Evangelist for Postman. The process has highlighted for me the importance of API workspaces and environments along with our API definitions. These are two killer features of Postman which I think are concepts that should be ubiquitous across the API sector, and of course is a conversation that Postman will continue to play an increasingly important role. Establishing workspaces for different projects, and being more thought fun of how I craft the environments along with the Postman collections I&rsquo;m defining for a variety of APIs has once again shifted how I see the API landscape.<br /><br />Workspaces mean the logical grouping, organization, access, and collaboration of API definitions. You shouldn&rsquo;t just have a big blob of API definitions you use for a variety of reasons. You should be managing API definitions that are maintained and shared across a variety of workspaces, giving access to relevant stakeholders. My personal workspace in Postman is littered with hundreds of collections because it has only been me in there. In this reality I tend to be my own worst enemy and not have any coherent organization of collections in mind, just relying on the quick search to pull up what I need. However, I&rsquo;m beginning to work with my wife and step-son on a variety of API definitions to help him get in on the &ldquo;family business&rdquo;, and now I&rdquo;m needing to be more organized with my approach.<br /><br />I can see small, medium, and large organizations needing someone dedicated to helping manage API workspaces, and the environments in use across teams, for both internal and external APIs. Thinking more critically around which APIs teams need access to while also ensuring they are well organized into logical workspaces, and making sure the management of environment, variables, secrets, and other elements are all more master planned. I envision API workspace, environment, and collection management something that will eventually dovetail and become a common aspect of managing human resources across the enterprise and small businesses. Logically defining how teams work together, and what API resources they have access to, including assistance in managing tokens and other secrets in a more secure, audible, and observable manner. Getting our act together when it comes to what APIs we use, and how we put them to work across teams.<br /><br />API workspace and environment management is something that API consultants should add to their toolbox. It may take a number of years for the opportunity to fully mature, but I know of many companies who are in desperate need of assistance in this area. When you are down in the weeds of your operations you don&rsquo;t always have the time and energy to see things at this level, and in my mind it represents an amazing opportunity for someone to come in from the outside and bring a little coherence to how APIs are published, managed, and consumed. Something that would go along way towards helping teams be more efficient in how they put APIs to work across desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications, but also doing so in a much more secure, observable, and auditable way&mdash;helping organizations and their teams realize the benefits of APIs.<br /><br />I am radically shifting how I manage my API definitions based upon me joining Postman. The situation has opened my eyes to the benefits their workspace, environment, and collection management tooling brings to the table. Having a Postman Collection that works has always been the holy grail of profiling APIs as part of my API Evangelist research, but now I see that it is also the missing link for me when it comes to bringing coherence and discoverability to my growing API catalog. Allowing me to better organize my collections, and begin establishing order and process to how I create, maintain, put to work, and share the valuable API resources I am putting to work across my research and storytelling. Providing me with a flexible and organized way of defining and collaborating around APIs within a variety of bounded context, while also safely, sensibly, and securely managing the environments I depend on for access APIs isn&rsquo;t a nice to have anymore&mdash;it is essential.</p>

<p>I am determined to continue taking my career to the next level. I&rsquo;ve done well doing API Evangelist over the years, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve gone as far as I can all by my lonesome. To level things up I feel I need more than just my words. I need some meaningful tooling, and collaboration with people who are building interesting and meaningful things with APIs to get to the place I envision in my minds eye. There are just a handful of startups out there who have both captured my API imagination, are making a meaningful impact on the API sector, and share my ethical view of the API sector, and one of them is <a href="https://www.postman.com">Postman</a>. I&rsquo;ve supported Postman since they emerged on the scene, and as of today, I am joining their team as their Chief Evangelist.<br /><br />Moving forward I will keep telling stories here on the blog, and doing what I do as the API Evangelist, but I will be actively supporting the Postman team when it comes to developer relations, marketing, product, and business development. I will be merging my visions of the API lifecycle with Postman's vision of how their API Development Environment (ADE) helps developers realize many of the stops along the API lifecycle that I talk about, while also working with enterprise groups, startups, and government agencies to development meaningful API blueprints that can help us all on our API journey. This will be just one of many tasks on my plate as I get my bearings within the Postman community, get to know the team, and become more acquainted with the product roadmap.<br /><br />After a six month break, I will be now showing up at more events, cranking up my storytelling on API Evangelist and Postman blogs, and working to craft other meaningful stories in a variety of formats, including guides, blueprints, videos, and other variations&mdash;helping us all better understand the API lifecycle. I am really eager to have a meaningful tool that is not just used by developers, but actually beloved by developers to help guide my API lifecycle research. I feel like I&rsquo;ve been working on an API PHD for the last 9 years, have finished my dissertation, and now I&rsquo;m ready to actually begin applying what I know in the real world. Moving from the theoretical to more of the hands on reality of doing APIs across startups, enterprise, and government agencies.<br /><br />While much of my storytelling will be rooted in what Postman does, Abhinav and team understand the importance of what I do, and the meaningful impact my work has on the API sector. Meaning that my storytelling will always be applicable to API providers and consumers who are not Postman customers, but since Postman is a free solution, there will be a significant opportunity for people to be putting Postman to work while also learning about providing and consuming APIs. If you have followed my work over the last nine years you will know that I don&rsquo;t get on board with tooling and services that I don&rsquo;t believe in, and I am definitely a user and believer in Postman, as well as the team behind it. I am super excited to be part of the team, and to be learning from how the Postman team views the API sector--adding to my existing knowledge and expertise.<br /><br />It will take me a few weeks to find my footing, but I&rsquo;m looking to better understand how people are using Postman. If you are using postman within your organization I&rsquo;d like to hear from you. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:kin@apievangelist.com">kin@apievangelist.com</a> or <a href="mailto:kin.lane@postman.com">kin.lane@postman.com</a> and share any thoughts you have. I&rsquo;m looking for anything I can use within stories that I tell on the blog, all the way up to full blown blueprints detailing the entire API lifecycle(s) that exist across your organization. I&rsquo;m also really looking for insight into what is holding developers back from using Postman beyond just being an API client, and taking advantage of the mocking, testing, documentation, scripting, and other more advanced features. I participated in an all-day Postman workshop yesterday and learned a ton of new things about variables, environments, scripting, and more, revealing how little of the functionality I have been actually putting to work in my API work.<br /><br />This post is coming together as I sit at PostCon in San Francisco. I&rsquo;m getting ready to help close things up with a few words about all the stories I&rsquo;ve heard today. I am rooting what I say in collaboration, because this was something I heard over and over today about Postman. It isn&rsquo;t just for making requests to APIs, it is for collaborating with your team, partners, and API consumers when it comes to the value your API resources bring to the table. This human centered capability is why I am here. I am a believer in the technical capabilities of Postman, but this human enablement is what matters to me when it comes to providing and consuming APIs. I am very much looking forward to the next phase of my API journey, and thank you to Abhinav, Ankit, Abhijit, and team for bringing me on, and making all of this possible.</p>
