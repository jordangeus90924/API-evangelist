{% include JB/setup %}<p>After looking through the list of folks who have RSVPd for the DFW API Professionals Meetup in Dallas tomorrow night, it looks like an interesting mix of tech and business folk.The tech group is definitely the larger, with a mix of mobile, web and enterprise.The business folks look like a mix of VC, project manager, marketing and startups.Im heading out to Dallas in the morning, and I am spending my afternoon preparing my talk.When it comes to meetups, I like to wait until the last moment, see who has RSVPd and shift my talk to being more tech, more business or more API 101 depending on the audience.</p>
