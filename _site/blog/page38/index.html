        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://momath.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-museum-of-mathematic/momath-museum-of-mathematics.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just found one of the coolest API stories I&rsquo;ve seen in a while over at <a href="http://chance.amstat.org/">CHANCE</a>, the quarterly magazine designed for "anyone who has an interest in the analysis of data, informally highlighting sound statistical practice." CHANCE talked with the executive director of <a href="http://momath.org/">The National Museum of Mathematics</a> (MoMath), Glen Whitney, about their new hands-on, API driven exhibit that the "museum has created a physical and virtual recreational math community to nurture this generation and the next in their mathematical pursuits."</p>
<p>As part of their plans to reach people outside New York City, and encourage them to join the conversation at the museum, they have installed as a JumboTron on the floor, which:</p>
<blockquote><em>You can walk right onto it and it&rsquo;s equipped with sensing technology, so it&rsquo;ll know the location of everyone who&rsquo;s standing on the floor. We have a variety of exploratory mathematical activities on that floor. We&rsquo;ll have mazes that have special rules or maybe a lot of turnstiles that trigger changes as you walk through them. It shows the notion that math is about exploring the consequences of simple rules."</em></blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the interactive mathematics exhibit:</p>
<p><a href="http://momath.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-museum-of-mathematic/momath-floor.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>"There will be an API (application programming interface)&mdash;a system by which groups can submit their own activity to be displayed on the Math Square floor. We will invite submissions from across the country. And we&rsquo;ll have a curation process, of course. If one group&rsquo;s exhibit is selected, we&rsquo;ll give them the opportunity through live streaming video where the class can see another group in the museum interacting with their creation and get feedback about what these other students experienced as they explored whatever puzzle, problem, or illustration the originators created. We&rsquo;re looking forward to that as a way of connecting people from around the country."</em></blockquote>
<p>At the moment where I&rsquo;m most concerned about the Internet of Things (IoT) API efforts I&rsquo;m seeing emerge across the landscape, an API project like the MoMath API shows up to make me happy. :-) ;-) Can you image the possibilities here? Not just for interactive, API driven displays on the floor at the National Museum of Mathematics, but interactive mathematics anywhere you can install a visual display, or a network of API driven human interfaces.</p>
<p>I am very curious to see what mathematicians around the world do with the <a href="http://3-byte.com/momath/">MoMath API</a> project, and better understand how we can use API to make math a much more fun, accessible, and interactive experience, that can be woven into our daily experiences.</p>
<p>P.S. I really, really hope this is good enough to make it into the <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a> roundup! ;-)</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/02/12/changes-to-linkedin-developer-program-are-no-surprise/">Changes To LinkedIn Developer Program Are No Surprise</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/linkedin/linkedin-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/blog/posts/2015/developer-program-changes">LinkedIn recently announced some changes to their developer program</a>, which involves further tightening down the screws on who has access to the API, limiting public access to only a handful of very superficial APIs. If you want greater access to the business social network API, you will need to be an officially approved partner.</p>
<p>As a result of LinkedIn&rsquo;s announcement, you will hear more discussion about the demise of public APIs, as this is narrative many API providers would like to employ, to support their own command and control positions around their client, or very own API driven resources. There is nothing wrong with having private APIs with supporting partner programs, but this has no bearing on the viability of publicly available APIs.</p>
<p>In reality, LinkedIn&rsquo;s API never really was open. Sure it is a public API, but the API has never been developer friendly, often times taking a very adversarial stance with its community, as opposed to embracing, nurturing, and investing in its developer ecosystem. Honestly, this is ok. Not every company has the DNA, or business model to make public APIs work&mdash;this latest move by LinkedIn reflects their ability, and not the potential of public APIs.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t expect all companies to be able to make public APIs work, it isn't easy. When it comes to making money around valuable content and data online, a closed ecosystem is seen as being better. Tighter control over your users data exhaust, allows you to decide who can do what, limiting to just the partners who have business relationships with you. You just can't monetize user generated to the extent LInkedIn would like, without taking away users control and access to this data.</p>
<p>Even with LinkedIn stance, there are a number of lessons to be learned by studying their approach. Like Twitter and Facebook, there are plenty of positive moves to analyze, as well as numerous other negative elements, that you can learn from when crafting the tone for your API. As an API provider do not dismiss what you can take away from LinkedIn&rsquo;s platform, and as a consumer LinkedIn is a valuable lesson in what you should look for in an API platform.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the move by LInkedIn is no surprise to me, and the platform is purely a distribution channel for me, and has been for some time.. Meaning I only syndicate content there, and you will never find me actually engaging very deep on the platform, building relationships there, because along with other platforms like Quora I do not have any ownership over any of the exhaust I generate. As a professional this is unacceptable to me, as I have a valuable brand that I carefully maintain. As other professionals realize this, they too will mostly abandon the business social network, leaving it to be a spammy corner of the Internet where HR professional prey upon the semi-professional, aspiring employee types.</p>

<p>After seeing the conversation around my In The Future There Will Be No Public vs. Private APIs, I'm reminded of my own mission. I write on API Evangelist first and foremost for my own education, and secondarily I do it to help educate the normals about the importance of APIs. Not page-views. Not to educate the API echo chamber. Not to drive conversation over at <a href="http://www.dzone.com/links/two_api_pundants.html">DZone</a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9010304">Hacker News</a>. Definitely not to insult anyone.</p>
<p>That story was me working through my own service composition, and looking at one possible future. That exchange you hear in the story, and all my stories, is the conversation between the voices in my head, and is never mean to insult anyone (think Michael Keaton in Birdman). All of this has reminded me that API Evangelist is not about cutting edge stories, like the unproven stuff I'm doing with my own API architecture, docker and microservices. However it is critical that I still flush out my ideas, in my own way, so I'll move these stories to my personal blog <a href="http://kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>.</p>
<p>As I re-read that post, I&rsquo;m faced with the link-baity title, which was not crafted with that intent, and the error and brevity in one statement that was singled out and ultimately fueled the conversation. I&rsquo;m always happy to see conversation stirred, but not in the way it was around David&rsquo;s post. It is ridiculous that I would allude to privacy being gone from the conversation around APIs (really?), but ultimately I was pleased to see most people make the same argument that I was having in my own head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super thankful for having APIEvangelist.com, and my readers. It makes it possible that to bring in the little bit of money I do from 3Scale, Restlet, and WSO2, to pay my rent, and fund my research and learning. I&rsquo;m also thankful for moments like this that help me remember why it is that I do this, and stay true to my API Evangelist mission.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The API savvy folks over at <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a> are at it again, pushing forward the conversation around generating of software development kits, using machine readable API formats, and this time the doorway to your SDK is via the <a href="http://apicommons.org/format.html">API Commons manifest</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to go ahead and use their own description, as it sums it well, no augmentation needed. Using the code generation API, you can generate SDKs for your API directly from your Github repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Describe you API using some format. You may choose from Swagger, RAML, APIBlueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery formats. Automatic code generation makes use of information in your API description to generate method and classes names. Please be as expressive as possible by not leaving out any optional fields as applicable e.g., not leaving out types and schemas for your parameters and fields.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Define meta information about your API using API Commons manifest format. You can generate your API Commons manifest using the <a href="http://apicommons.org/manifest-generator.html">API Commons Manifest generator.</a> Be sure to enter all relevant information. Upload the generated manifest as a new file in the root directory of your Github repo by the name "api-commons- manifest.json". Be sure to have the correct name and location of this file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open/Create a markdown file (README.md is a good candidate). Add the following markdown syntax to render an image link.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[![apimatic][apimatic-{platform-name}-image]][apimatic-{platform- name}-url]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[apimatic-{platform-name}-url]: https://apimatic.io/api/github/{account-name}/{repo-name}/{branch- name}?platform={platform-name}</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[apimatic-{platform-name}-image]: https://apimatic.io/img/github/{platform-name}.svg</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Replace the {platform-name} token with one of the following values: windows, android, ios<br />Replace the {account-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github account name <br />Replace the {repo-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github repository name <br />Replace the {branch-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github branch name where the API Commons manifest file is present. ï¿¼</p>
<p>To validate, open the following url after replacing tokens. This url should open the raw manifest file. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{account-name}/{repo-name}/{branch- name}/api-commons-manifest.json</p>
<p>You can see an example <a href="https://github.com/apimatic/videos">here</a>. Commit changes and navigate to your Markdown file in your browser. You will see apimatic widgets (image links), which you can click to generate SDKs for your API. To see an example, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apimatic/videos/gh- pages/README.md">open this link to view the README.md </a>file in raw text form.</p>
<p>The Apimatic team is owning the conversation when it comes to generation of full fledge SDKs for your APIs. I always hear folks talk about the limitations of auto-generation of client side code, but the Apimatic team is pushing the conversation forward with their persistent approach.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">A Minimum Viable APIs.json File For Your APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm continuing my work to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/04/what-exactly-is-api-commons/">help people understand what APIs.json is</a>, and the varying ways that it can be put to use.  My post the other day, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file</a> is a good example of where to get started, but I wanted to help further set the bar for a minimum viable APIs.json.</p>
<p>APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions of who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection.</li>
<li><strong>created</strong> - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created.</li>
<li><strong>modified</strong> - the last date in which an APIs.json file created.</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, which is part of specific project or application.</p>
<p>The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - the name of the API.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of the value an API delivers.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe the API itself.</li>
<li><strong>humanURL</strong> - The url any human should visit to learn more about an API.</li>
<li><strong>baseURL</strong> - The base url any machine should follow to start using an API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each API should have at least this information, at a minimum. I could stop here, with my minimum viable APIs.json definition, but I encourage you to take one more step, and put the properties collection to use for each of your API. Using the properties collection, you can provide any other URL you want for an API--I recommend starting with four basic properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-documentation</strong> - Where the documentation resides for the API.</li>
<li><strong>X-signup</strong> - Where a user can signup to use an API.</li>
<li><strong>X-pricing </strong>- What is the pricing for using an API.</li>
<li><strong>X-tos </strong>- Where do I find the legalize behind AP operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately you can define any property you wish for an API, but recommend with these essential building blocks that all API consumers will need. After that each API has a contact collection, allowing you to provide some basic support for API operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FN</strong> - The name of person to contact.</li>
<li><strong>email</strong> - The email address to contact.</li>
<li><strong>X-twitter </strong>- A twitter user for the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>These contact properties, follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">vCard format</a>, and provide what API consumers will need to get support for an API. The same properties are available again for the overall APIs.json file, as a maintainers collection, which provide contact information for the overall APIs.json maintainer. This will often be a duplicate of information for each API, but allows for ultimately flexibility in aggregating many disparate APIs, into a single collection.</p>
<p>That is it. That is a minimum viable APIs.json definition. We now know who maintains the collection, and essential details about API operations. This goes well beyond just the technical definition of an API, and provides essential business and political elements of API operations, that all API consumers will need to be informed of, and are something that developers will often overlook.</p>
<p>With an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json file</a>, <a href="http://apis.io/">open source API search engines like APIs.io</a> will be able to index your APIs, and any API directory like <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> can do the same. The definition of your API(s) is now machine readable, and is portable, allowing this definition to live on any website, or within any desktop, web or mobile application.</p>

I&rsquo;m a big fan of doing story responses using our blogs versus the sometimes difficult Twitter conversations that occur--so I am happy to craft a response as well. I&rsquo;m less of a fan of playing into page view games of fabricated kerfuffles, and link-bait titles, which after re-reading, my own blog title was a little link-baity. However in reality, my story came from my workbench as I was reworking some of the service composition stack, and reflect that process, not the conversation it seems to have created, but hey, I am all about embracing unintended consequences.</p>
<p>First, let me address my mistake. I said <em>"If it has an http:// in front of the address, it is a public API&mdash;sorry.&rdquo;</em>, which is total bullshit. As John Sheehan reminded me after I posted, at the point of DNS is what I should have meant, you can definitely use http:// on a totally private network, and what I meant to articulate was once you start making call via http://, using a DNS address.</p>
<p>Second, David really makes my case for me, so in reality we are in agreement, it is all about semantics&mdash;which really is the core of my argument. Private, like the term open is thrown around a lot, usually by marketers, who want to elicit some sort of emotion response from their intended audience, much like David is with his story. All I&rsquo;m pointing out, in my own journey, is I used to have two buckets, public, and private. Then I had three buckets internal, public, and partner. Now I have mulitiple buckets that reflect products, projects, dev groups, and the organic organizational structure that has emerged around the resources I manage, and put to use.</p>
<p>Private just doesn&rsquo;t describe my organizational structure anymore. My organization spans the globe, and has overlap with numerous other organizations, and individuals, and my service composition needs to reflect this change. If my statement: "the concept of public and private doesn't exist. This is a reality that plays out in conversations between people who don&rsquo;t fully understand the world of API management&mdash;aka the tech blogosphere.&rdquo;..is an insult to you. Maybe you can channel that anger into a blog post, and get some page views. ;-)</p>
<p>David is 100% right. It is your right to continue describing things as public vs. private, and I&rsquo;m completely confident that many of you will continue doing this in the future. Describing very public infrastructure as private, describing very closed things as open, what I&rsquo;m trying to do is move the conversation forward. When you are ready for a nunanced discussion about who has access to your API, API management, and service composition, I am here.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Look ma! I did it without a second page, to drive page views!</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://ardoq.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ardoq/ardoq_logo_small.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of putting my ideas for new tools, services, and other stuff out on the Internet, for public consumption. My mother taught me how to manifest things in my life, and this is my digital version of her teachings. By putting my ideas out there, a) I don't actually feel compelled to do them b) someone else might think it is good idea and build it, and c) when someone does build it and they start looking to publicize, they will find you. c) happened today.</p>
<p>One idea that I put out there recently, that I really wanted to manifest, was a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/30/swagger-visualization-layer-using-d3js/">visualization layer for APIs using Swagger</a>. My wish has been granted, and a startup called <a href="http://ardoq.com/">Ardoq</a>, has done just that, developed a <a href="http://ardoq.com/visualizing-swagger-api-documentation/">visualization layer using Swagger</a>. As they were taking their new product public they came across my story, and pinged me this morning. I&rsquo;m going to follow-up, with a link to the story, and get a full tour of the product, talk with the team, and better understand what they are up to.</p>
<p><a href="http://ardoq.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ardoq/IBM_API_Swagger_To_Ardoq.gif" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Ardoc is an important next step for machine readable API definition conversation, adding another <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentive for API providers to generate definitions for their APIs in API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML</a>. I really see three main phases of the evolution so far in this conversation, 1) when Wordnik introduce Swagger and Swagger UI, 2) with introduction of Apiary.io moving the conversation further upstream to API design, and now 3) more meaningful visualizations built on top of APIs and microservices.</p>
<p>Machine readable API definitions have done many significant things for the API conversation, allowing us to deploy interactive documentation, mock interfaces, ultimately giving us a common language that we can use to communicate around some very abstract concepts. I&rsquo;m excited to see visualizations enter the discussion, which will allow us to build powerful visual tooling around APIs, like being able to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/how-to-generate-an-api-surface-area-map-for-a-microservice/">map the scope of a microservice</a>, or provide a map for a whole stack of microservices.</p>
<p>I think visualizations generated for machine readable API definition is just the beginning of a whole <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">new world of UI elements developed on top of APIs,</a> and we will also see more analysis, interoperability, integration, and discovery tools emerge as well. API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger will continue to evolve as a central truth throughout the API lifecycle, providing as set of instructions for everything from design and deployment, to management and integration.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=05.02.2015092629NHEBWM.htm"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ibm-bluemix-third-party-services.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been talking about developing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks for a while now</a>, and as I continue understand current shifts in cloud computing, I am doing my own&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">reshuffling towards a more microservices, and docker-centric way of life</a>. When I say the phrase &ldquo;virtual API stack&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m talking about the ability to deploy a stack of APIs you need for a specific organization, project, app, or other configuration. In 2015, you should be able to quickly define exactly the stack of private, and public API services you need to accomplish exactly what you need--nothing more.</p>
<p>As part of my research in this area, I&rsquo;m tracking on similar patterns, that I see occurring at platform providers--today I found an example of <a href="http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=05.02.2015092629NHEBWM.htm">defining virtual API stacks</a> using the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html">service broker API </a>over at <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/bluemix/">IBM Bluemix</a>. Using Bluemix, you can build virtual API stacks from existing services they have setup, including Twilio, and Sendgrid, or register your own APIs using service broker, via their <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/partner-landing.html">cloud marketplace</a>&nbsp;(you have to be partner). The services deploy in this way, need to implement a common API surface area dictated by the platform (I&rsquo;d love to see a Swagger spec for this IBM).</p>
<p>IBM is blending several areas I&rsquo;ve been tracking on, starting with&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">defining of virtual stacks</a>, but also the aggregation of 3rd party services which opens up a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale layer of valuable API resources</a>, and sets up world where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API brokers can emerge</a>, and prosper. I see that <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZFB2_3.0.1/com.ibm.apimgmt.apionprem.doc/create_api_swagger.html">IBM has embraced machine readable API definitions like Swagger</a> as part of their operations, and I&rsquo;d love to see them <a href="http://apisjson.org/">adopt APIs.json for defining of their virtual API stacks or collections</a>. APIs.json would make the API collections that users define, much more portable, shareable, indexable, and ultimately discoverable. If you need example of APIs.json + Swagger working, look through <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">my API Stack inventory</a>, as I map out the top APIs.</p>
<p>My vision of a future with API stacks and collections, is a world where we can buy and sell these modular resources, in IBM&rsquo;s, Amazon&rsquo;s, Google&rsquo;s, and anyone other marketplace, but we can also run them in any infrastructure we choose. We would all possess our own stacks of resources, be able to choose from a wide array of public and private 3rd party resources, and deploy, remix, and re-use these resources in any way we choose, to drive websites, desktop solutions, system integrations, mobile apps, and devices.</p>
<p>It is good to see these patterns emerging over at IBM, via their Bluemix platform. This type of modular service definition, design, deployment, management and reuse is something I&rsquo;m talking with several other companies about as well--making for a very &ldquo;containerized microservice&rdquo; 2015, from what I can see.</p>

<p>As I travel around talking to folks about APIs, I spend as much time as I can educating folks about <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, and I&rsquo;m constantly reminded how little people, who have even heard, and read about API Commons, really understand what it is. With this in mind, I will be regularly publishing examples of what API Commons is, to help onboard everyone to mine and Steve's (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) vision of API Commons.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API Commons is a machine readable pointer to the license of your API</span>. As I talk with folks, and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ3-yFWYtrk">videos like this one at APICon in UK</a>, I realize how many misconceptions there are about it. Many folks emphasize the Creative Commons license we&rsquo;ve chosen, or the listing of APIs we&rsquo;ve had added to our version of the commons, by publishing an API Commons manifest, which references a CC-BY or CC0 license.</p>
<p>If you feel your API should be covered under an open source license, or covered by your patent, or not covered by any sort of license, create an API Commons manifest that points to your API, references your license, and you&rsquo;ve created your own commons. Now you can spider, and aggregate any API providers who have used the same license, into your own definition of what is the API Commons.</p>
<p>API Commons is not an API directory. API Commons is not a push for copyright in APIs. API Commons is a machine readable format for taking a stance on the licensing (or not) of your API definitions, and data models. Please join us today, by <a href="http://apicommons.org/">letting us know your stance on licensing of your API</a>, we&rsquo;ve love to hear your voice, and better understand your stance.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/global-change-information-system/global-change-information-system.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I remember the vision clearly from 2004, when I first changed the URL for my Delicious social bookmarking account to make it return a list of bookmarks as XML instead of HTML. It was a vision of the programmable web--where everything I explored on the Internet, wasn&rsquo;t just consumable, and right below the surface of any website or application I was using, there was also a machine readable version, allowing me to build whatever I desired.</p>
<p>People are often surprised when they realize I do not have anything to sell them, and that I evangelize that APIs are not some new product, but just the next step in the evolution of the web. This is easy to say, however it can be much harder to demostrate to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;, leaving me always hundting for easy to understand API implementations I can use to help bring me people closer to understanding.</p>
<p>Steve Ziegler (<a href="https://twitter.com/Stevezieglerva">@stevezieglerva</a>) introduced to me to a great new example of this in the wild. An API I haven&rsquo;t come across before, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a partnership between Department of Commerce, Energy, Interior, State Department, Transportation, EPA, Health &amp; Human Services, NASA, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian, USAID, and USDA.</p>
<p>According to their own description the <a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System</a> is:</p>
<blockquote><em>The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has established the Global Change Information System (GCIS) to better coordinate and integrate the use of federal information products on changes in the global environment and the implications of those changes for society.</em></blockquote>
<p>For me the Global Change Information System is an example of how websites, linked data, and APIs should work in concert, but is something I understand very little about how to actually do. The <em>GCIS&nbsp;</em>platform organizes an amazing amount of information, all the people, organizations, and relationships involved, in a very elegant way-you can start seeing in action by browsing the database, by clicking on the menu in top left corner.</p>
<p><a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/global-change-information-system/gcis-api-report-view.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>Immediately I notice how structured everything, then as I scroll to bottom I see that everything is available in a machine readable format. What is even cooler, is that it isn&rsquo;t just available as JSON, you get it in YAML, Turtle, RDF, and some formats I&rsquo;m not familiar with. Then  of course, you get a robust, yet simple web API as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/api_reference"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/global-change-information-system/gcis-api-reference.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed with the amount of detail available in the Global Change Information System, and the amount thought put into the relationships between all the information, and actors involved. It makes me optimistic for what can come out of government, and that something so forward thinking is being applied to an area as import as the environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting going reviewing the <a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/api_reference">Global Change Information System API</a>, and will make more time to evaluate how it works under the hood, maybe generating a Swagger spec for the interface, to help me better understand how it works. I&rsquo;m also going to reach out to them and see if I can get more information on the story behind, and possibly what the roadmap looks like&mdash;making it likely you will see more stories about it in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My work on <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/">APIs for the Department of Education</a>, and the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">FAFSA API</a> began while I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow. Shortly after leaving DC, I was informed that conversations around an API for the FAFSA had been put on back-burner, and in response I developed a prototype FAFSA API to help jumpstart the conversation.</p>
<p>In December 2013, I went to one of the two data jams put on my the White House and Dept of Education, up in Palo Alto, CA at Stanford. Then, in January 2014 I heard there was talk at the secretary level, about officially pursuing a FAFSA API. Yay! By February I got an email that there was an opportunity for funding such an initiative, if there was a technical specification available. Three days layer <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/02/20/fafsa-api-technical-specification-draft-raw/">I finished a couple of options</a>, which ultimately resulted in a <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/02/21/fafsa-api-technical-specification-draft/">draft technical proposal for a possible FAFSA API</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard nothing about the outcome of these efforts. I provided some thoughts on <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/06/02/my-response-to-how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">APIs in general, in June of 2014, in repose to their RFI</a>, but beyond that it has been radio silence at Department of Education when it comes to a FAFSA API. Granted, I&rsquo;m not pursuing this, but when it comes to FAFSA API discussion, I own the SEO conversation, so if it came up, I&rsquo;m sure someone would ping me.</p>
<p>I have no confidence that the Department of Education will pursue a FAFSA API. My motivations around contributing to the conversations stem from a desire to jumpstart investment from both the public, and the private sector. While jumpstarting conversations in the federal government, I was hoping I could also jumpstart the development, and deployment of a federated FAFSA API, which in turn would apply pressure on the federal government to participate. Doing this is not trivial, and a cause that needs a champion or full time evangelist&mdash;I&rsquo;m not your man.</p>
<p>The FAFSA API is an excellent example of the technology, business, and politics of APIs, something that is more art, than science. If it is going to become a thing, I think it has to happen inversely to the way the IRS ecosystem has occurred, from the outside in. I just don&rsquo;t have confidence that the Department of Education can own this one, I think multiple leaders from the private sector have to make it happen, get private sector buy-in, then convince the Department of Ed to play nicely in a federated FAFSA API ecosystem.</p>
<p>Which is no small task.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>This post is meant to help several groups understand where I am at with the FAFSA API. I just posted a round of updates directly to my <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">FAFSA API research</a>, as well as my overall <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/">Dept of Education research</a>.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.report/2015/02/04/infolytica-corporation-releases-motorsolve-v5/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/infolytica-motorsolve.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been pretty focused on web APIs in my API Evangelist world, steering clear of hardware, networking, desktop software, and the American Petroleum Institute. While you will never catch me paying attention to oil, I am slowly changing my tune on other types of legacy APIs.</p>
<p>As I read through <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">the first 700, of the 16K API related patents I&rsquo;ve harvested from USPTO XML files</a>, I initially started dismissing hardware related patents, and then some of the more network related ones as well. Then I started evaluating the impact these patents could have on the Internet of Things (IoT), and I am beginning to shift my stance.</p>
<p>I may not fully profile the approaches of some of these API providers, but I think I will at least bookmark, and consider the approach, and how its being applied, while also putting on my web API architect hat. As I read through a press release today on <a href="http://api.report/2015/02/04/infolytica-corporation-releases-motorsolve-v5/">Infolytica corporation releasing the next generation of their MotorSolve software</a>, complete with mention of an API, I can&rsquo;t help but think of the implications if Infolytica embraced a web-API strategy.</p>
<p>Imagine the potential, if MotorSolve was broken up, migrated into the cloud, and containerized? Then add in the necessary business building blocks like docs, code, pricing, and the requisite political building blocks like rate limits, terms of services, etc. This is the lens I am looking at older patents I am reading through, that may not 100% reflect modern web APIs, but because our virtual and physical worlds are increasingly merging with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), and Software Defined Networking (SDN), might have significant impact if just looked at a little differently.</p>
<p>Overall I see an pretty interesting opportunity in trying and consider all types of APIs, no matter their origins, reconsidering them in light of shifts in compute like the cloud, mobile, IoT, and SDN, and see what we can learn. You&rsquo;ll see more news reports of more &ldquo;low level&rdquo; APIs on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, and some of what I learn evolving my analysis here on API Evangelist.</p>

<p>I get a lot of folks who come to my blog, see the title, read one or two posts, and assume that I&rsquo;m a blind lover of API technology, and that I see APis as a solution to everything. While some of this is true, I do love APIs, and think they are a great solution (in some cases), at the same time I&rsquo;m also an outspoken critic of APIs, and work hard to be a voice of reason when I see people doing stupid shit with them.</p>
<p>With this theme in mind, I want to once again remind everyone that APIs are neither good, nor bad, nor neutral by themselves, they are merely one of the tools companies can wield, and completely reflect the motivations of their masters. One such example of this in action, where I believe an API is being used for some pretty bad reasons is with the <a href="https://developer.att.com/apis/sponsored-data">AT&amp;T sponsored data API</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to support AT&amp;T as much as I can, because I really want to help the enterprise make sense of web APIs, and teach them to wield them in positive ways, but I have to say the sponsored data API is not something I can get behind. Upon closer examination this API is working to close down, control and meter the Internet, rather than opening up the Internet making it more accessible, and usable by AT&amp;T customers.</p>
<p>Allowing for mobile users to get their music, video and other content delivered in a way that doesn&rsquo;t impact their phone bill seems like a good idea, and allowing companies to step in an sponsor the delivery of data and content for users, may smell like a good opportunity when you own the pipes, but this is leading us down a dark road. I&rsquo;m sorry, there are much more interesting ways to optimize the delivery of content, and make money off the Internet pipes you have--AT&amp;T you lack imagination, and creativity.</p>
<p>I'm sure you are well aware, but what you are doing with sponsored data delivery to mobile phones is another push for allowing the prioritization of Internet traffic, and being able to pay for a better Internet experience for those who can afford it, rather than making the web accessible to everyone. Additionally if you consider that many providers will actively work to slow the Internet delivery of content behind the scenes just so they can generate revenue using approaches like sponsored data, things really start to get really ugly. I'm not ok with you doing this via APIs, and helping your customers see API as something attached to their bill, and speeding up the Internet</p>
<p>This use of an API to close the Internet down, and such bad examples of API monetization really bum me out. There is so much opportunity for monetization if everyone has open, free access to the Internet. We can get more creative than this, when it comes to monetizing the pipes, and approaches like this from AT&amp;T is just going to continue fucking up the Internet, similar to what we are seeing come from Verizon, and the other leading telcos who don't get Internet, let alone APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.report/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-press-release-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent a portion of my time each day reviewing press release sites, in addition to the 1000+ blogs I keep an eye on, for syndication to <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a>. During the course of my work this year, I'm noticing an uptick in the number of press releases that are about some new app, feature, and partnership that has an API at its core.</p>
<p>Telling the story of prominent integrations is something I am a big advocate for, but I think the growth in the number of official press releases about API integrations shows that the mainstream SMB and enterprise markets are putting APIs to work more, and looking to showcase. For me, this demonstrates that APIs are playing more of a central role in not just the deployment of apps, but the course of regular business for an increasing number of companies in 2015.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that many more companies will be showcasing the API integrations that they achieve, long before they talk about the APIs they posess, let alone make publicly available. Ideally, everyone would be both a public API provider and consumer, but I&rsquo;m afraid that many companies just don&rsquo;t have the culture for such a thing&mdash;keeping their APIs closer to their chest, while still beating the API integration drum. Because it is what you do in 2015.</p>

<p>I spend a significant portion of my day looking for company logos, for use in the API stories I tell. When I come across a proper implementation of a logo page, one of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">business building blocks I recommend employing</a>, I have to showcase it.</p>
<p>I got an email from my friend and fellow API evangelist Keran McKenzie (<a href="https://twitter.com/keranm">@keranm</a>) about updating the listing for the <a href="http://developer.myob.com/">MYOB API</a> on my <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=accounting-stack">API Stack</a>. He sent me a better description, and a couple of new links that I didn&rsquo;t have, including <a href="http://developer.myob.com/program/myob-developer-logos/">a link to their logo page</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that I think is particularly interesting about the MYOB logo approach, is that they offer an assortment of designs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate Logo -</strong> The MYOB name and logo represent the MYOB business and is protected by copyright and trademark laws.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Logos -</strong> The MYOB Premium Developer Logo is reserved for the exclusive use of MYOB Premium Developer Partners.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Add-On Logos - </strong>The MYOB Certified Add-On logo is exclusively available to Add-Ons that have completed the MYOB Add-On Certification process. Product Logos - A full collection of product specific logos.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, a logo page is essential in assisting the media, and other folks like me, who will be talking about your services, be more successful. Second, their assortment of logos, shows MYOB has a well thought partner framework, that encourages developers to work hard, obtain premium status, and build certified add-ons.</p>
<p>A logo page, with a rich set of, well-planned embeddable logos, and other images, is an important <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building block</a>&nbsp;that tends to also be a signal of APIs who have their operations in order.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aglio-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm on the hunt for new ways to deploy attractive, interactive API documentation, from machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. I am <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">advocating for the development of new approaches to deploy UI documentation</a>, and part of this showcasing what I find along the way.</p>
<p>In the spotlight today is <a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio">Aglio</a>, which they describe as:</p>
<blockquote><em>An API Blueprint renderer that supports multiple themes and outputs static HTML that can be served by any web host. API Blueprint is a Markdown-based document format that lets you write API descriptions and documentation in a simple and straightforward way.</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aglio-html-docs.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Aglio is significant because it is driven from the machine readable format API Blueprint, and produces static HTML that can be served up anywhere, specifically on Github or Amazon S3 deployed using Jekyll. Additionally it just makes your document simple, easy to follow, and just damn sexy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a Swagger generated version of Aglio, allowing you to deploy the attractive API documentation from both Swagger or API Blueprint. If more API documentation looked like Aglio, I would be a seriously happy camper.</p>

<p>As I continue to evovle my service composition definition, using my <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, across my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">microservices stack</a>, the thought of public vs private doesn&rsquo;t even enter the equation. I am doing my APIs using the Internet pipes, so they are public by default&mdash;then using my service composition I define the layer that actually regulates what is openly accessible by the public, what resources have limited access, and specifically how much of any resource any single person can access.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m working through my API Stack, the concept of public and private doesn't exist. This is a reality that plays out in conversations between people who don&rsquo;t fully understand the world of API management&mdash;aka the tech blogosphere. If it has an http:// in front of the address, it is a public API&mdash;sorry. You need to secure it like it is public, and you need to approach service composition in a sensible way, that deals with identity, and access management across all your public infrastructure.</p>
<p>As we move towards a world where the Internet isn&rsquo;t just on our desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile environments, it is everywhere in our homes, business, cars, and public space, there will be no separation between public and private API resources. Everything will be public, it will just be a matter of properly defining who has access, exactly how much they can consume, and in what way they can actually engage with the valuable API driven resources emerging all around us.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>This conversation seems to have generated some buzz, and here are some of the responses:</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/jetpack-patent.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">reading API related patents</a>&nbsp;lately. I downloaded all of the patent applications between 2005 and 2015, filtered for all patents that mention &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo; in the title, abstract, or description of the API, resulting in a database of 16,485 patents. Currently I&rsquo;m reading the 700+ that just mention API in title or abstract, and once done I&rsquo;ll take a look at the rest.</p>
<p>First, let me state that patents are not a concept I subscribe to. Personally, I do not believe in defining, and locking up ideas, but I do not live in the world I&rsquo;d like, and after beginning my patent API search, I see patents are a concept that like API copyright, will be  increasingly wielded across many industries where APIs are being put to use. For this reason, I engage in my research, and overall patent awareness journey, not because I&rsquo;m a believer in the patent system, or am looking to submit any patents--I want to better understand how patents are being used to define API processes, and help see the evolving role APIs are playing in the larger patent story over the last 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>First, What Exactly Is An API Patent?</strong><br /> There are many incarnations of API, and making sense of whether a patent directly describes a specific API, or is more API adjacent can be very difficult to do. I&rsquo;m operating under the assumption that if &ldquo;application programming Interface&rdquo; is present in title or abstract, it is likely that the patent describes an API fueled process, and my initial review of the 700+ patents support this. This realization moved the conversation in my head from &ldquo;will patents affect APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;APIs are being patented&rdquo;, and we need to better understand what is going on, regardless of the precise definition of what an API is. Whether an API is more hardware related, system or specifically a web API as we know it today, becomes somewhat blurred on the current Internet landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Precise vs. Broad Stroke Patents</strong><br /> One thing that really stands out as I read these API patents, is the varying scope of the API definition. Some are very precise, talking about a specific API call, to accomplish a very specific, granular task. While others are very broad, talking about using APIs, for an industry-wide use. This distance, represents the rapid expansion of the API space, and how the vision from technologist to technologist will vary widely on how aware of change they are in their specific domain. Some companies seem to just cast a wide net, claiming a whole region of cyberspace, as operating under their patented idea, with little or no regard for many iterations that have evolved within this very space, in just the time they've submitted the patent.</p>
<p><strong>Internet of Things Blurring The Landscape</strong><br /> As I read through patents, it is easy to dismiss some of the application because they are very hardware focused, but when you consider the bigger Internet of Things (IoT) picture, where everyday, common devices are being connected to the Internet, using APIs&mdash;things get very blurry. A hardware API in the 1990s was definitely something that was pretty novel, and useful, but in 2015 these concepts are rapidly expanding, becoming commonplace, with the iterations and variations of process occurring at a staggering rate. I&rsquo;m considering pulling patents all the back to 1995, to evaluate telecommunication era APIs, for re-use, and applying in the IoT era, in hopes of bringing more focus to this blurry portion of the API patent landscape(or quite possibly confusing myself further). What was once a pretty specific hardware specific API in 1998, could have thousands of uses, in an IoT crazy 2015.</p>
<p><strong>The Pace of Change &mdash; New &amp; Useful Processes At A Breakneck Speed</strong><br /> After reading the handful of patents that I have, as an API architect, my brain immediately sees the variances in their patent ideas, that when actually applied as an API would become the  programmatic points where I can add variety, and iterate on the process being  defined. If it's a new and useful way for analyzing network traffic using an API, I can immediately define hundreds of network scenarios with software defined networking, and then exponentially augment with different user and device scenarios on different ends of this patented process. At what point do all my variations fall prey to this patent, requiring me to cut a deal with patent owners, and at which point do my variations begin breaking the established patent idea, as the world that the definition applies to continues its rapid expansion. The automobile patent was new and novel until Henry Ford came long, and the automobile became ubiquitous, Amazon Web Services implementation of compute and storage was new and novel when it came out, at what point does is it just become the way things are done. The Internet is just escalating this process, which each passing moment&mdash;something the patent process doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge.</p>
<p><strong>How Does US Patent Office Maintain The Army Of Domain Experts To Determine What Is New &amp; Useful?</strong><br /> As I read a patent about a specific API analytics patent, something I&rsquo;d consider myself a domain expert in, I&rsquo;m thinking this isn&rsquo;t that novel or new, and is something that has been going on a while, and then I find several more variations on the same subject, with varying scopes, muting each patent along the way. As I read through some of the networking based API patents, which I probably do not consider myself a domain expert, I think WOW, that is pretty new and novel idea, to almost each one, with very little awareness of scope of each idea. I have to ask myself, how does the US patent office maintain the army of domain experts needed to keep pace with what is truly new and useful in this digital age? There is no way this can occur under a single government or institutional entity anymore, it has to be done openly on the Internet, in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Are All About Re-Use, Remix, And Defining New &amp; Useful Processes</strong><br /> As an API architect, I can confidently say that APIs are all about establishing definitions of new and useful processes, that if you do properly, allows you to re-use, remix, and redefine a sometimes dizzying amount of variants in that new and useful process. Each API or microservice is a single, potentially well defined process, and when you start daisy chaining, stacking and remixing with APIs, you can rapidly rethink legacy processes, with an agility that is seldom seen in the physical world, or earlier evolutions in software development. Ultimately I feel that the patent process is the antithesis of an API, but at the very least, I would make the argument that it is a very antiquated way to look at how we operate in a digital world.</p>
<p><strong>1000LB Gorillas Are Filing Patents &mdash; Not The Doers, Defining Next Generation Processes</strong><br /> Another thing that stood out to me, when evaluating the 16K API patents I&rsquo;ve targeted, is  exactly who the characters are that apply for API patents. The two leading the charge are Microsoft and IBM, with a who&rsquo;s who of enterprise dominating the list after that. The companies and individuals doing patents, are not the doers, at the forefront of each business sector, who are actually defining the next generation of new and useful processes using APIs, that are increasingly spanning both our virtual, and physical worlds. While I don&rsquo;t have the research done to back this claim, at first glance at the areas in which API patents are being defined, this world does not reflect the API space I&rsquo;ve been mapping the expansion of. Which tells me that there are two distinct layers to this API expansion, those that are defining and moving almost every industry being touched by APIs forward, and those that are filing definitions with the patent office to define, make bets on, and ultimately lay claim to what might be.</p>
<p><strong>Doing Patents As A Defensive Measure &mdash; Its How You Play The Game!</strong><br /> I am sure there are numerous motivations for filing a patent on an API, and the popular claim is to say you are doing it as a defensive measure. Clearly software patents is a game of hardball, where companies can make or break your cool new startup, by burying you in legal woes&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been there myself. Companies like <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">Tesla</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/">Google</a> are making an open patent pledge, stating that they only do patents as a defensive maneuver. I get this. I can&rsquo;t argue with companies defending what they&rsquo;ve built against the more aggressive corporate personalities in the space. I guess this is why I am building, and curating my database of API related patents, and the companies behind them, so that I can eventually connect it to actual litigation by these companies&mdash;only time will tell which open patent pledges actually hold out to be true.</p>
<p><strong>Patents Are Rich Person&rsquo;s Game &mdash; We Don&rsquo;t All Have The Resources To Play!</strong><br /> To play in the patent game, you need money. You have to be able to afford to file your patents, and you need to be able to afford to defend them in court. This is not a doers game, it is a rich person&rsquo;s game. My everyday world would be an extremely fertile environment for the defining of patents, as I spend my days playing with thousands of API resources, and deeply thinking how these APIs could be used in new an novel ways in our personal and business lives. However without the resource ($$) to be able to file the patents, and defend these virtual, API driven spaces, in a court of law, patents are a game I will never participate in. I can guarantee there are thousands of patentable ideas laying around my workbench, but because patents aren&rsquo;t a concept I subscribe to, and I don&rsquo;t have the resources to play in the game, you will never see a patent with my name on it.</p>

<p><strong>Still Not Convinced You Can Define And Lock Up Ideas, Let Alone API Driven Ones</strong><br /> Even after about 60+ hours of <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">patent API research</a>, I&rsquo;m still not convinced the patent process is something that is applicable in the API space. I&rsquo;m barely sold on the concept when it involves the assembly of gears, conveyer belts, and physical elements, let alone with the new and useful process is algorithmic, allowing me to orchestrate infinite number of processes using APIs. I&rsquo;m preparing a keynote talk in Sydney Australia next week, about the opportunities for orchestration with microservices and docker containers, using machine readable definitions like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. As part of my work, I defined 18 specific processes that I depend on to operate as a business, and as soon as those were defined and deployed, I quickly define 8 new iterations on top of the existing processes. I&rsquo;m still defining my overall approach to API orchestration with virtualized containers, but once ready, I will be able to define a new node on my network in seconds, and remix with other resources instantly, reworking existing processes and defining entirely new ones each day&mdash;why would I want to lock these up, I need these ideas to flow to be successful. Execution trumps definition.</p>
<p><strong>If We Are Going To Apply Patents To APIs, We Need A Process That Will Keep Pace</strong><br /> Ok, say patents are even a thing we should be considering applying in the API space. At the very least we need a process that will keep pace with the world of APIs, and acknowledge not just the accelerated pace of change and iterations, but also the exponential variations that can occur, and the potential change of scope, in near real-time. I do not manually apply copyright to all my writing in 2015, because of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> I can apply copyright across all of my digital exhaust&mdash;why are processes and workflows any different?</p>
<p>I strongly believe the concept of patents is counter to the essence of what an API is, but if we insist on defining our new and useful processes in this way, we need a real-time way of capturing the intellectual exhaust from processes we execute, map out the new and useful processes that exist, in a way that requires them to &nbsp;have to actually be useful and implemented, while also having a way to share and vet these definitions with the public audience, whether it be industry, government or both.  I&rsquo;m just getting started with my API patent research, and as with my other research in the API space, I&rsquo;m sure my awareness will continue to expand rapidly, something I doubt I will also see with the patent process itself.</p>
<p>Ultimately I&rsquo;m left thinking what my friend, and fellow API Evangelist Mehdi Medjaoui&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) said in his very forward thinking post, <a href="http://api500.com/post/46951162382/open-apis-are-the-new-software-patents">that APIs are the new software patent</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/2016_budget_header.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The release of the the <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data">president's fiscal year 2016 budget in a machine readable format on Github</a> was one of the most important things to come out of Washington D.C. in a while when it comes to open data and APIs. I was optimistic when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">the president mandated that all federal agencies need to go machine readable by default</a>, but the release of the annual budget in this way is an important sign that the White House is following its own open data rhetoric, and something every agency should emulate.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done to make sense of the federal budget, but having it published in a machine readable format on Github saves a lot of time, and energy in this process. As soon as I landed on the Github repository, clicked into the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/2016-budget-data/tree/master/data">data folder, and saw the three CSV files, I got to work converting them to JSON format</a>. Having the budget available in CSV is a huge step beyond the historic PDFs we&rsquo;ve had to process in the past, to get at the budget numbers, but having it in JSON by default, would be even better.</p>
<p>What now? Well, I would like to make more sense of the budget, and to be able to slice and dice it in different ways, I&rsquo;m going to need an API. Using a Swagger definition, I generated a simple server framework using Slim &amp; PHP, with an endpoint for each file, budauth, outlays, and receipts. Now I just need to add some searching, filtering, paging, and other essential functionality, and it will be ready for public consumption--then I can get to work slicing and dicing the budget, and previous years budgets in different ways.</p>
<p>I already have my eye on a couple <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js visualizations</a> to help me make sense of the budget. First I want to be able to show the scope of budget for different areas of government, to help make the argument against bloat in areas like military. Second, I want to provide some sort of interactive tool that will help me express what my priorities are when it comes to the federal budget--something I've done in the past.</p>
<p>It makes me very happy to see the federal government budget expressed in a machine readable way on Github. Every city, county, state, and federal government agency should be publishing their budgets in this way. PDF is not longer acceptable, in 2015, the minimum bar for government budget is a CSV on Github&mdash;let&rsquo;s all get to work!</p>

<p>I was having a Twitter conversation with John Sheehan(<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) about the easiest way to generate interactive API documentation this weekend, without getting all tangled up in having to get into the weeds of <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>. I love me some Swagger UI, something I think has transformed how we engage with APIs, but the JavaScript for it can be inaccessible, and difficult to customize--to say the least.</p>
<p>There are other UI solutions to API documentation, projects like <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate from Tripit</a>, from <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme.io</a>, and some cool <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">UI stuff over at OpenFDA</a>, but really I haven&rsquo;t seen much evolution beyond Swagger UI. Sure, <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a> has a great UI, but it isn&rsquo;t the portable, customizable vision I have in my head (they are working on this, BTW). I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">envision a whole gallery of simple, UI templates that you can choose from</a>, driven by machine readable <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint </a>API definitions.</p>
<p>Looks like the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">gov hackers over at 18F</a> feel the same way, and are working on something like this&mdash;"<a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-static">a suite of tools and templates that faciliate the generation of static, human-readable documentation to replace SwaggerUI</a>&rdquo;. <a href="https://github.com/shawnbot">Shawn Allen</a>, has created two repos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-template">swagger-template</a>, just some HTML files that should theoretically be useful for generating static HTML documentation for a Swagger-compliant API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-enhance">swagger-enhance</a>, a little Node utility for grabbing a Swagger API's JSON and "enhancing" it with JSON data from each of its own endpoints (confusingly, "apis", in Swagger parlance).</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes me happy to see some brainstorming to push the conversation forward. I&rsquo;m able to deploy Swagger UI pretty quickly to support my APIs, using Github Pages, but when it comes to extending, and transforming the UI, I hit a wall pretty quickly. I've created some custom UI solutions, to help me manage my own infrastructure, driven by Swagger, but nothing that contributes to the larger conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see API design, deployment, and integration tools I depend on like <a href="http://studio.restlet.com/#/">Restlet Studio</a>, and <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> provide more support for easy deployment of UI elements, driven by machine readable API formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. Making API documentation more interactive with Swagger UI was an important step forward, but we are ready for the next step in the evolution of API UI generation.</p>

<p>As I work to r<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">edefine my world using microservices</a>, I have this sudden realization how important my API management infrastructure is to all of this. Each one of my microservices are little APIs that do one thing, and do it well, relying on my API management infrastructure to know who should be accessing, and exactly how much of the resource they should have access to.</p>
<p>My note API shouldn&rsquo;t have to know anything about my users, it is just trained to ask my API management infrastructure, if each user has proper credentials to accessing the resource, and what the service composition will allow them to do with it (aka read, write, how much, etc.) My note API does what it does best, store notes, and relies on my API management layer to do what it does best--manage access to the microservice.</p>
<p>This approach to API management has llowed me to deploy any number of microservices, using my API management infrastructure to compose my various service packages&mdash;this is called service composition. <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">I employ 3Scale infrastructure for all my API / microservice management</a>, which I use to define different service tiers like retail, wholesale, internal, and other service specific groupings. When users sign up for API access, I add them to one of the service tiers, and my API service composition layer handles the rest.</p>
<p>Modern API management service composition is the magic hand-waiving in my microservice orchestration, and without it, it would be much more work for me to compose using microservices in this containerized API world that is unfolding.</p>

<p>In 2010, when I started API Evangelist, I sat down to create a logo, and after six hours of frustration in photoshop, I eventually just typed out my logo as a basic JSON representation, kind of as a joke, which I eventually planned on changing, but it stuck.</p>
<p>With the latest batch of t-shirts I've ditched the "logo" portion, but will keep this legacy version floating around, here and there for nostalgic purposes. Along the way, I've added what I consider the function version of the logo, which I use for each of my research sites.</p>
<p>I'm starting so many new research areas lately, I decided to create a logomaker API, so I can make new logos, and anyone else can make their own as well. There are three API endpoints for the <a href="http://logomaker.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist logomaker API</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=[value]" target="_blank">http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=[value]</a></li>
<li><strong>Key/Value</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/keyvalue/?key=[key]&amp;value=[value]" target="_blank">http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/keyvalue/?key=[key]&amp;value=[value]</a></li>
<li><strong>Function</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/function/?name=[name]" target="_blank">http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/function/?name=[name]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The API is completely open, but I will be cleaning out the images each day, so if you truly want to keep one, save it locally. Have fun playing. I will actually be using it to generate headers for my research sites. If you want to use any of my logos, make sure you follow my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/branding-guidelines.html">branding guidelines</a>. ;-)</p>

API skeptics also give me material for stories, so I thoroughly enjoy coming across them, and telling these stories is how keep polishing my argument for the next API skeptic encounter at campus IT, at the higher educational institutions that I visit.</span></p>
<p>During the discussion I was posed several interesting questions, and one of them was: why would you ever give students API access to the Student Information System (SIS), and let them build un-sanctioned apps that we will end up have to support?</p>
<p><strong>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</strong><br /> FERPA gives students the right to review, control disclosure, and request amendment of their education record. Increasingly this is going beyond just via a web interface, PDF, or printed copies. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">President Barack Obama mandated that all federal agencies begin providing information in machine readable formats</a>, and many cities and states are putting it into law as well. A student should always have access to their data, and they should be able to choose to do this via campus applications, or be able to obtain a portable copy of their record for storage in a location of their choosing, or possible use within a 3rd party system of their choice&mdash;it's their data. Period.</p>
<p><strong>Un-Sanctioned App Concern Is Just A Red Herring</strong><br />Modern API management infrastructure like <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a>, provide an unprecedented level of control over managing API access, requiring secure on-boarding of new developers, the establishment of service composition definitions, which provides rich real-time analytics on how APIs are used, and by whom&mdash;while also seamlessly integrating with existing identity and access management solutions. The university gets to choose who has access to which services, revoke access when abused, while also better understanding how resources are really being accessed and put to use. Ideally this applies to all campus-wide usage, as well as with external 3rd parties&mdash;modern approaches to API-centric operations, include the management of internal, partner, and public resources in this way.</p>
<p><strong>A More Balanced Governance Across Campus Resources</strong><br /> Modern API management was born out of traditional IT governance, but is something that is more focused on giving access and control to the end-users who are the actual owners, of the valuable data, content, and other digital resources being made available.  Legacy campus IT models provide a governance model that involves IT, administrative and faculty stakeholders, but rarely includes the students. APIs give students secure access to their data, and standards like <a href="http://oauth.net/">oAuth</a> opens up the ability for them to have a vote in who has access to their data, with oAuth scope being defined by existing institutional governance efforts. When APIs enter the conversation, governance expands to be more self-service, real-time, and within the control of students, as well as administrators, faculty, and campus IT.</p>
<p><strong>Possibility Of Good Things Happening Closer To The Student</strong><br /> In the current educational environment, where students are often more tech savvy than faculty and administrators, why would we want to eliminate serendipity, and the possibility that new things might happen. Solutions to problems that students actually face everyday, that campus administrator may never think of, because they see technology through a very different lens. The days where IT knows best, regarding what devices, browsers, apps, and websites are optimal for getting things done, are in the past. Shadow IT demonstrates this, where students, and even faculty are using un-sanctioned solutions to get their work done. Campus IT should be empowering students, encouraging a more digitally literate individual who soon will be entering the workforce, not suffocating this.</p>
<p><strong>Easy For Campus IT To Miss The Big Picture</strong><br /> I am a recovering IT administrator, so I understand the challenges a skeptic campus IT administrator faces, but ultimately by restricting access to campus resources just makes your job harder, making you the bottleneck that everyone's so commonly complains about, when it comes to IT. APIs don&rsquo;t create more work for you, it makes you much more agile and nimble in how you integrate systems, build new web and mobile applications, and provide 3rd party vendors access to campus resources&mdash;as well as potentially opening up self-service access to students.</p>
<p>With an API-centric approach you will know exactly who is accessing resources, and how they are using them--in real-time. I&rsquo;m betting that you don&rsquo;t have this visibility across all of your IT resources right now. When I put on my IT director hat, I prefer the API model, because then all resources are self-service, available to only those who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHOULD</span> have access, all without them having to talk to me. I&rsquo;m left alone to do what I do best, and can also monitor new signups, real-time usage, and manage support tickets in accordance with wider IT support strategies.</p>
<p>I understand you are a skeptic about APIs being a thing students should have access to, and in reality most students will not care, but there will be a long tail of student users who will do things you never imagined, and potentially change how you look at scheduling, document management, or other staples of campus operations&mdash;something that will never happen if you don&rsquo;t make students a priority when it comes to your digital resource management.</p>

What A Security Risk!</a></h3>

<p>I went up to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/talking-apis-up-at-california-state-university-channel-islands/">California State University Channel Islands the other day to talk APIs with their tech team</a>, and I was happy to find at least one strong API skeptic on the team. API skeptics also give me material for stories, so I thoroughly enjoy coming across them, and telling these stories is how keep polishing my argument for the next API skeptic encounter at campus IT, at the higher educational institutions that I visit.</p>
<p>During the discussion I was asked several interesting questions, the first one was: why would you want to list of your web services (APIs) for your public university, out in the open, via a central portal?? What a security risk!!</p>
<p><strong>Sorry, But Security Through Obscurity Is Not A Strategy</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m sorry, hiding things, and hoping nobody finds them is not a valid IT strategy. You are a public university, and you should have a sophisticated identity and access management, as well as well tight approach to security. If you can&rsquo;t properly secure an API resource available at a public URL, you shouldn&rsquo;t be running campus IT, sorry.  You should be able to provide a public description, of what resources are available, without giving away the farm.</p>
<p><strong>The Feeling You Have &mdash;It Comes From Legacy Power And Control</strong><br /> As an IT professional, if you don&rsquo;t acknowledge that power and control exists within classic IT processes, you are in denial. I&rsquo;ve taken over numerous company IT operations, and there is ALWAYS political struggles between IT and the rest of operations. If you list all digital resources in a single portal, and make them available in a self-service way, it disrupts existing power and control structures. When you make things hard to find, you play a central role in people finding these resources, and you are in power&mdash;adding to decades of legacy stories about IT being a negative force in operations. Self-service access to campus resources is the future, no matter how much you resist.</p>
<p><strong>Centralized  Location To Aggregate All Digital Resources</strong><br /> A centralized API portal provides a single place for anyone to discover or share their digital resources. Like the main website, administrators, faculty, students, parents, and the public will know there is a single place to find machine readable versions of campus resources. API portals are more than just a listing of APIs, it includes documentation, code samples, widgets, buttons, spreadsheet connectors, visualizations, blogs, twitter accounts, and other resources that can turn a simple portal into an active ecosystem where everyone collaborates around campus resources.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Service Access For 3rd Party Vendors Delivering Vital Campus Services</strong><br /> It takes resources to engage with 3rd party vendors on campus, and a single, self-service portal provides a standardized way for vendors to access the institutional resources they need to deliver the services they are bringing to campus operations. There is no reason that IT or departmental contacts should ever be bottlenecks in delivering the information vendors will need. API portals should provide them with the access they need, along with proper identity and access management, and monitoring of exactly how vendors are accessing, and putting campus resources to use (or not).</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/web-services-listing.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Interoperability Between Higher Educational Institutions</strong><br /> Most higher educational institutions are part of a larger network of institutions, and at the very least have relationships with other schools, in which information, and resources are shared. As with vendors, much of this can be provided via a self-service API portal, where institutions can find the data, content, and other resources they need, able to access only the resources they are supposed to during the fullfillment of established relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Smoother Interactions With Local, State, And Federal Government</strong><br /> Higher educational institutions have regular integration points with local, state, and federal government agencies. Data is reported on a regular basis, back and forth, and a central API portal is excellent for aggregating the commons resources a government agency will be asking for. API portals are not just for student hackers, or 3rd party developers, they are increasingly how government agencies are sharing, and getting what they need to regulate, monitor industry, and govern more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>It Is About People Getting Access To What They Need</strong><br /> Central API portals are about making sure people get access to what they need, and at a public university, this should be priority number one. You have data, content, and other digital resource students, faculty, administrators, vendors, government, parents and alumni need, and because you aren&rsquo;t confident in securing it, from a handful of hackers you are going to hide this away, and forgo all the benefits? I&rsquo;m sorry, the perceived negatives just don&rsquo;t out-weighs the positives. There are proven ways to secure APIs, and for much of university operations, it won&rsquo;t hurt to provide a title, description, and location of a resource, and let identity and access management handle who should be able to get at resources&mdash;or not.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing IT Out of Shadows Across Campus Operations</strong><br /> Security is a concern, and should be front-and-center in all conversations, but it is too often used to hide away insecurities, incompetency, and shortcomings in security, rather than actual address the root of security concerns. If a resource is accessible via Internet protocols, over campus networks, it should be mapped out, with the definition made publicly available in a sensible way. This conversation should involve careful consideration what resource should be public, and what should remain private, with a heavy emphasis on transparency at a public university.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2007, we start seeing a shift of IT services into the cloud, and much of this has happened, as un-sanctioned shadow IT, by administrators, faculty, and students looking to get their work done, because IT hasn&rsquo;t been able to keep up.  The cloud evolution of IT has been all API driven, and making IT resources available to the public at Amazon sounded insane at first, but it has changed not just how Amazon operates, but has evolved the entire world deploys software architecture&mdash;using APIs.</p>
<p>There are many great examples of leading companies, making personally identifiable information, banking, healthcare, and other vital data and content available on the open Internet, in a secure way. It is not a security risk to share information, and provide access to your valuable resources, in a central, publicly available portal--if you do it right. Who knows, if you do open up, there may be some unintended consequences, leading to IT being seen as positive influence on the education process, as opposed to the roadblock image it often has on campuses across the country.</p>

<blockquote><strong>A) </strong>The heart of an APIs.json, providing a name, description, image, and tags for API platform and collection.<br /> <strong>B)</strong> The technical details of where this APIs.json came from, which version it is, and when it was created and last modified.<br /> <strong>C) </strong>Similar to the overall APIs.json collection, each API gets a name, description, image, and tags, but also as the default URL people should go to find the API, as well as the base URL actually make calls to the AP, which is used as the API identifier.<br /> <strong>D) </strong>Properties collection for the API. This is where the flexibility in the APIs.json comes in, and you can define any type of URL you wish. Ideally we establish a core set of machine readable properties, but providing human links to blog, documentation, etc are essential too.<br /> <strong>E) </strong>X-blog - a link to the Fitbit blog, providing a direct link that users can use to read the blog.<br /> <strong>F) </strong>X-blog-rss-feed -a link to the RSS feed, providing a machine readable link to stories, and updates for the platform.<br /> <strong>G) </strong>X-github - a link to the official Github account for the Fitbit platform, when you consider the Github API, this becomes a machine readable link to multiple aspects of API operations.<br /> <strong>H) </strong>X-twitter -  a link to the official Twitter account for the Fitbit platform, which again, using the Twitter API, this becomes a machine readable resources for accessing platform communications, updates, and resources.<br /> <strong>I) </strong>Contact information for the Fitbit API team, which they route you to a forum. Some platforms put their Twitter handle here, and others put an email or phone number.<br /> <strong>J) </strong>Maintainer for the APIs.json, which since it is Fitbit, helps provide authority, showing this APIs.json comes from the source, and is not a collection built by someone else, which includes the Fitbit API.<br /></blockquote>
<p>The initial APIs.json from Fitbit is simple, and while there is potential for additions like a Swagger or API blueprint definition, or maybe terms of services, and client code, would be an excellent start.</p>
<p>So what now? What does this do for Fitbit?</p>
<p>It makes the definition of their API portable. It acts like a sitemap.xml for their API program, allowing search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> to index Fitbit along with other APIs. You can also develop embeddable widgets, allowing the API information to be displayed on any site, and using Github and Twitter APis, and the Blog RSS, you could also pull other relevant information for display, and search within the widget, on any website or mobile application.</p>
<p>We are just getting going with APIs.json tooling, that will help add to the benefits of having one. I know of several projects in the works, developing internal APIs.json search engines, directories, and when you include API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint in your APIs.json, things get even better. I&rsquo;m using APIs.json for microservice discovery, navigation, and indexing, and as a way to connect API interfaces  with containers that deliver on the promise an API is supposed to deliver.</p>
<p>I am seeing more API providers begin to deploy APIs.json for their providers, and I have two of the leading API management providers about to release APIs.json as a native part of their API management workflow, with others in the works. It is good to see APIs like Fitbit see the potential of indexing their API operations with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, something where the benefits are only going to grow over the coming years, as new tools, and services emerge that depend on APIs.json for engaging in the API economy.</p>

<p>I started doing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/25/doing-the-research-in-preparation-for-my-patent-on-a-patent-api/">research on API patents recently</a>, and after about 5 days of processing XML files from the US Patent Office, I'm going to stop processing at the year 2004 (way back). This gives me 2005 through present day, and provides more than enough information for me to evaluate the role APIs are playing in the patent process, and inversely how patents are affecting the API space.</p>
<p>In 2004, the XML data files I'm processing start to change, and I'm getting errors, resulting in me having to reconfigure my script, in addition to downloading the numerous, large XML files. I think I have enough of a sampling to start building a wider awareness of what is going on with patents and APIs, I can always come back and download 1995 through 2004.</p>
<p>So far, I have found 16,485 patent applications that had the phrase "application programming interface" in either the title, abstract, or full description for the patent. I found <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html?filter=name">151 patents that specifically mentioned API in the patent title</a>, and <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html?filter=abstract">569 that specifically said it in the abstract</a>. Here is the breakdown by year:</p>

</ul>
<p>I'm going to continue my API patent journey by reading the 151 patents that specifically mentioned API in the patent title, and the 569 that specifically said it in the abstract. From there, I will expand into the other patent applications and try to understand if the API is more hardware API, or more API adjacent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a lot of learning ahead, so I don't want to make to many assumptions early on, but looking at the <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/companies.html">list of companies who have filed patents</a>, it becomes very clear to me that if you want to conduct business in the API economy, you are going to have to at least take a defensive patent stance for your APIs, or these companies will bury you in legal attacks.</p>
<p>There are a number of thoughts swirling around in my head around patents, but a few of them that keep floating to the top are around how damaging the antiquated patent process could be to the API economy, and around why there hasn't been much conversation in this area, as the world of APIs has been heating up over last four years.</p>
<p>After I read more of the patents, I'm hoping I'll better understand what companies are up to, and possibly the motivations behind the patents. Then I'll begin making my own assumptions about how positive or negative patents are to the API economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I can say now, is what a strange world to try and make sense of. In my opinion the concept of patents apply to a very physical world, and much like Creative Commons has helped evolve the world of copyright in an Internet era, we need something to bring patents into a digital world. A conversation that gets even more complicated when you start thinking about the Internet of Things.</p>

APIs.json provides a simple, machine readable way to index the technology, business, and political elements of each microservice I deploy.</p>
<p>As I was auditing the <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">18+ microservices I&rsquo;ve setup for my core operations</a>, I wanted to audit each one, and make sure I had included various elements in each APIs definition, like where developers can onboard, terms of service, and where to find related code samples. To accomplish this, I was able to just compare each microservice APIs.json, with a master APIs.json template I had established while planning my original microservice stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it is just as important to know what is missing, right alongside what is available for all of my microservices, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> is proving to be a simple way of understanding this layer of my API operation at scale.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/kin-lane-ciu-2.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spent the day yesterday up in Camarillo, at<a href="http://www.csuci.edu/"> California State University Channel Islands (CI)</a>. Half my time I spent speaking with a mix of folks from the campus tech team about APIs, and the other half I spent learning about video production at the university. I wanted to thank , Chris Mattia (<a href="https://twitter.com/cmmattia">@cmmattia)</a> Director of Academic Technology, CSU Channel Islands, Michael Berman (<a href="https://twitter.com/amichaelberman">@amichaelberman</a>) VP Technology &amp; Communication, California State University Channel, Mikhail Gershovich (<a href="https://twitter.com/mgershovich">@mgershovich</a>) for having me up.</p>
<p>The conversation I had with their tech team around APIs reflected other conversations I&rsquo;ve been having with other higher educational institutions. It was a mix of business and technical talent from the school, ranging from instructional technologists, to front-end, and backend data people. The spectrum of personalities range from the API literate, to API curious, and of course the API skeptic&mdash;which demonstrates their is a healthy balance to the tech team the university, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I walked everyone through the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">history of APIs</a>, and showcased a couple of <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/universities.html">the other universities putting APIs to work</a>, then I just opened up the conversation to the technology, business, and politics of APIs on campus. The leadership at Channel Islands can see the potential of APIs, but just like every other sensible institution, they have to cautiously evaluate where the low hanging fruit is, get some small API wins, before tackling any larger API projects.</p>
<p>These types of conversations are something I will be encouraging more of in 2015, and I&rsquo;m looking to bring together the 10 institutions I&rsquo;ve had discussions with so far together for an API event, while also opening up invitation other institutions who might want to participate. If you would like to jump start an API discussion at your higher education institution, please let me know.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> is a simple, <a href="https://github.com/APItools/monitor">open source</a>, API middleware that allows you to &ldquo;track, transform and analyze the traffic between your app and the APIs&rdquo;. With just a few clicks you can proxy any API you use, and when you make calls through the proxy, you get a bunch of valuable  information in return.</p>
<p>One thing APITools does, that is extremely valuable to me, is it generates Swagger definitions, mapping out the surface area of an API, with each call I make. These API definitions have a wide variety of uses for me, ranging from better understanding the API designs of popular services, to providing API search services through open API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p>If you are regularly developing against a public API, can you take a moment to swap the baseURL with one created in APITools, make all of your calls to the API, then send me a copy of the Swagger definition? I would sure appreciate the help in creating Swagger definitions for all of the popular APIs available today. Don&rsquo;t worry all your work is openly available on both <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API Stack for re-use and forking by anyone</a>.</p>

<p>I was struggling with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">exactly how much API surface area can exist for a service before it stops being micro</a>&nbsp;the other day, and while I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever find a precise measurement for this, I&rsquo;d like to have a fluid definition that I can use to automatically evaluate, how big an API is.</p>
<p>So, what data can I gather, to help me quantify the surface area of my API? I&rsquo;ll start with each endpoints, then count each verb, parameter, and potential response. Since I use <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> for all of my API definitions, I can easily do this, and I can also understand each API response better because also I have them linked to the underlying data model.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how this surface area definition will work, ultimately I&rsquo;d like to be able to separate verbose APIs by different layers, like the number of endpoints or parameters, or maybe the lack of verbs, or responses (not what is there, but what is missing)--I'm not sure. I&rsquo;m just getting going with my API surface area map.</p>
<p>My goal is to be able to list 20-30 microservices, and generate a basic visualization showing the approximate scope. Then I can use this in my decision making around whether or not I add features to an existing service, or spin it out as an entirely new service.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the rise of Twitter bots. Little automated bundles of social media joy, built to spew mostly nonsense, but everyone once in a while you find nuggets of wisdom in the Twitter API fueled bots. Personally I have never built a Twitter bot, only because I don&rsquo;t need another distraction, and I can see the addictive potential of bot design.</p>
<p>My partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), who has hands on experience building her own bots, said something interesting the other day while we were partaking in our daily IPAs&mdash;the wordnik APIs it the base building block of any Twitter bot.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when you search &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=twitter+bots+wordnik">twitter bots wordnik</a>&rdquo; on the Googlez, you get a wide variety of python, nobde.js, php, and other recipes for building Twitter bots, with almost all of them using the Wordnik API as the core linguistics engine for the bot.</p>
<p>Two overlaps with other stories I written here. 1) <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/04/twitter-api-is-gateway-drug-for-internet-of-things/">I feel the Twitter API holds a lot of potential as a training ground for IoT connectivity</a>, and 2) I think APIs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/01/i-find-it-interesting-that-wordnik-created-the-api-definition-format-swagger/">specifically the Wordnik API, and the work to come out of Wordnik, like Swagger, has a significant role to play</a> in the future of the Internet.</p>
<p>I know many of us technologists have grand visions of where the Internet is going, and would like things to happen faster. but I think the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; everything we are looking for is going to take some time, and is something you can see playing out slowly in things like Twitter bot design. I&rsquo;m sure there are many negative incarnations, but many of the Twitter bots I&rsquo;ve seen have been interesting little nuggets of API driven (Twitter &amp; Wordnik) chaos, driving us towards an unknown, but definitely Internet connected, online world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/swagger-api-docker.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm rebuilding my underlying architecture using microservices, and docker containers, and I'm <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">using APIs.json for navigation and discovery within these new API stacks</a> that I use to make my world go around. As I assign each microservice, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json file</a>, taking inventory of the building blocks that make the service operate, I also begin including docker into the equation, and I find myself using Swagger definitions as a sort of fingerprint for my docker powered microservices.</p>
<p>Each microservice lives as its own Github repository, within a specific organization. I give each one its own APIs.json, indexing all the elements APIs of that specific microservice. This can include anything I feel is important, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Signup -</strong> Where to signup for the service.</li>
<li><strong>X-Twitter -</strong> The twitter account associated with the service.</li>
<li><strong>X-Samples -</strong> Where you can find client side code samples.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you put X- before the property, you can put anything you want. There are only a handful of sanctioned APIs.json property types, and one of them you will find in almost all my APIs.json files generated for my platform is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger -</strong> A reference to a machine readable Swagger definition for each API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another one I&rsquo;m starting to use, as I&rsquo;m building out my microservice infrastructure, is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Docker-Image -</strong> A link to a docker image that supports this API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of my microservices I have a supporting Docker image that is the backend for each API. Sometimes I will have multiple Docker images for variant back-ends for the same API fingerprint. Using APIs.json I can go beyond just finding the API definition, and other supporting building blocks. I can also find the backend needed to actually deliver on the API I have defined by a specific Swagger definition. I&rsquo;m just in the early stages of this work, and this series of posts reflects me trying to work much of this out.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">browse my work on Github</a>, most of it is public. The public elements all live in the gh-pages branch, while the private aspects live within the private master branch.  It is all a living workbench for me, so expect broken things. If you have questions, or would like more access to better understand, let me know. I&rsquo;m happy to consider adding you to the Github organization as collaborator so that you can see more of it in action. I will also chronicle my work here on the blog, as I have time, and have semi-interesting things to share.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m rebuilding my underlying architecture using microservices and docker containers, and the glue I&rsquo;m using to bind it all together is <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>. I&rsquo;m not just using APIs.son to deliver on discoverability for all of my services, I am also using it to navigate around my stack. Right now I only have about 10 microservices running, but I have a plan to add almost 50 in total by the time I&rsquo;m done with this latest sprint.</p>
<p>Each microservice lives as its own Github repository, within a <a href="https://github.com/kin-lane">specific organization</a>. I give each one its own APIs.json, indexing all the elements APIs of that specific microservice. APIs.json has two main collections, "apis" and "include". For each microservice APIs.json, I list all the properties for that API, but I use the include element to document the urls of other microservice APIs.json in the collection.</p>
<p>All the Github repositories for this microservice stack lives within a single Github organization, which I give a "master" repo, which acts as a single landing page for the entire stack. It has its own APIs.json file, but rather than having any API collections, it just uses includes, referencing the APIs.json for each microservice in the stack.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/kin-lane-api-navigation-2_png.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>APIs.json acts as an index for each microservice, but through the include collection it also provides links to other related microservices within its own stack, which I use to navigate, in a circular way between all supporting services. All of that sounds very dizzying to write out, and I&rsquo;m sure you are like WTF?  You can <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">browse my work on Github</a>, some of it is public, but much of it you have to have oAuth access to see. The public elements all live in the gh-pages branch, while the private aspects live within the private master branch.</p>
<p>This is all a living workbench for me, so expect broken things. If you have questions, or would like more access to better understand, let me know. I&rsquo;m happy to consider adding you to the Github organization as collaborator so that you can see more of it in action. I will also chronicle my work here on the blog, as I have time, and have anything interesting things to share.</p>

<p>I spend time each day reviewing about 15 different press release distribution websites, looking for API related news for <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, and potentially seeds for stories elsewhere on the API Evangelist network.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m noticing a lot, are companies who reference their API as bullet point in a release, or sometimes as a footnote in their about section at the end of the release, but when you go to their website you can&rsquo;t find any mention of API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing for many, they just haven&rsquo;t thought about making the API something that is front and center, relinquishing it to just "feature status". There are also others who do not believe in the whole &ldquo;public&rdquo; API thing, and see their API as more secret sauce, something that should be kept close to your chest.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, I&rsquo;m looking to better understand how I can help companies be more public with their API presence, even if the API itself isn&rsquo;t open to the public. My first instinct is to just email the company, and ask why they aren&rsquo;t more public with API, but I know from experience it isn&rsquo;t the best approach. ;-)</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ll be exploring new ways I can encourage companies to be more public with their API presence, and help them understand the benefits of this approach&mdash;let me know if you have any good ideas.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>

<p>I have most of the core platform that I run API Evangelist on <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">re-engineered as individual microservices</a>, defined on Github, and running using Docker instances. I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery">APIs.json for discovery, navigation</a>, and to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-swagger-as-fingerprint-for-my-microservice-docker-containers">connect swagger API definitions, to their docker backends</a>.  So far I have 18 microservices, which I define as very simple APIs, that do one thing, and focus on doing it well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very critical about any feature I add in, working hard to keep each service as micro as I can, reducing complexity, and bloat in any single API.  However, with each service I reach the point where I have to cut off feature creep, and establish an entirely new API definition--I am at this point with my link service.</p>
<p>I have a pretty bloated link management system in the legacy version of my platform, something which handles links for functions ranging from <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kinlane">Pinboard</a> integration, to handling linkrot on my public website. My legacy system runs using an API too, but it is a sloppily designed API, with a wide surface area, something I&rsquo;m looking to prevent in the next version.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve broken out a single API into three separate microservices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link -</strong> A dead simple link management tool, allowing me to add a title, and url to a simple link data store, for future use.</li>
<li><strong>Curated - </strong>A service to manage links I curate from many sources, including additional bells &amp; whistles, like pulling text body, taking screenshot, and much more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Linkrot -</strong> A link storage system designed for a singe purpose&mdash;to address link rot on my public websites. The API works with a simple JS library to store, monitor, and take screenshots of websites I link to across my network.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have about five other simple, link related, microservices I&rsquo;m planning, but these three designs represent the main link resources I need to make API Evangelist work. All of the microservices I&rsquo;m designing will be open sourced at some point, but the linkrot implementation is one I may also be offering as a service. I&rsquo;m enjoying the feature across my sites, and is something that I think has some viability as a basic service.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my own definition of what a microservice is--will evolve, ebb and flow, but for now the first rule of microservice club for me, is keep things doing one thing, and doing it very well&mdash;enforcing simplicity in every decision.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-mobile-security.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I cringe, when I think about the number of mobile applications out there, that people depend on in their personal and professional lives, that are using insecure APIs, allowing&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">personally identifiable information (PII)</a> to flow across the open Internet. I&rsquo;m a big advocate for helping <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">mobile developers understand the important role that a public API can play in this situation</a>, but another side of the discussions that also scares me is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that also emerges as part of this conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered recent security and privacy involving mobile usage of APIs at <a href="http://101.apievangelist.com/2014/01/08/are-your-api-security-practices-in-better-shape-than-the-snapchat-api/">Snapchat</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">Moonpig</a>, and was processing the API news this morning for inclusion on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, when I came across this press release, <a href="http://api.report/2015/01/27/wandera-finds-official-nfl-app-to-be-leaking-users-personal-data-just-days-ahead-of-the-big-game/">Wandera Finds Official NFL App to be Leaking Users' Personal Data Just Days Ahead of The Big Game</a>. I can get behind the NFL securing their users personal data, but have a hard time jumping on the bandwagon when this is used as PR for a mobile security service, in the lead up to the Superbowl.</p>
<p>Understanding how everyday mobile apps are using APIs to communicate in the cloud is important. Sharing stories about how to map out this very public surface area, and secure it properly, while giving end-users more awarness and control over their PII is critical. Doing this in the name of marketing, PR, or to ride a fear hype wave is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not ok</span>. Yet, I fear this will become commonplace in coming months and years, as security breaches, cybersecurity, and privacy are front and center in the media.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/api-security.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>As we get close to wrapping up the first month in 2015, it is clear that Internet security and privacy will continue to be front and center this year. As technology continues to play a central role in our personal and business lives--security, transparency, and respect for privacy is only growing more critical.</p>
<p>I know I'm biased in thinking that APIs will continue to take a central role in this conversation, but I feel it is true. Many of the existing conversations around security about platforms like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">Snapchat</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">MoonPig</a>, are directly related to APIs, while other security scope at companies like Sony, JP Morgan Chase, and beyond could easily be reduced with a sensible API strategy.</p>
<p>Companies are increasingly operating online, but do not act like any of information lives in an online environment. Adopting an API approach to defining company resources, helps map out this surface area, acknowledging it is available over the Internet, and works to define, secure, and monitor this surface in a healthier way.</p>
<p>Mobile users need access to their data, and by applying an API centric approach, providing account management, data portability, and access and identity controls using oAuth, you can increase transparency, while also strengthening overall security. If your company operations is centered around customer and end-user data transactions, you should be making all data points available via an API, accompanied by a well oiled oAuth layer to help end-users manage their resources, playing a significant role in their own privacy and security.</p>
<p>I'm not delusional in thinking that APIs provide a perfect solution for all our security and privacy woes, it doesn't, but it does set a tone for a more healthy conversation about how companies are doing business on the open Internet, and how we can better secure the online web, mobile, and device-based applications we are increasingly depending on in this new world we have created.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you start talking about generating server or client side code for APIs, using machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, many technologists feel compelled to let you know, that at some point you will hit a wall. There is only so far you can go, when using your API definition as guide for generating server-side or clienit-side code, but in my experience you can definitely save some significant time an energy, by auto-generating code using Swagger definitions.</p>
<p>I just finished re-designing 15 APIs that support the core of API Evangelist, and to support the work I wrote four separate code generation tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP Server - </strong>Generating a Slim PHP framework for my API, based upon Swagger definition.</li>
<li><strong>PHP Client -</strong> Assemble a custom PHP client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Client -</strong>&nbsp;Assemble a custom JavaScript client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL Database - </strong>Generate a MySQL script based upon the data models available in a Swagger definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Swagger, I can get myself 90-100% of the way for most of the common portions of the APIs I design. When writing a simple CRUD API like notes, or for links, I can auto-generate the PHP server, and a JS client, and underlying MySQL table structure, which in the end, runs perfectly with no changes.</p>
<p>Once I needed more custom functionality, and have more unique API calls to make, I then have to get my hands dirty, and begin manually working in the code. However auto-generation of code sure gets me a long way down the road, saving me time doing the really mundane, heavy lifting in creating the skeleton code structures I need to get up an running with any new API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also exploring using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, complete with <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> references, and Docker image references to further bridge this gap. In my opinion, a Swagger definition for any API, can act as a fingerprint for which interfaces a docker image supports. I will write about this more in the future, as I produce better examples, but I'm finding that using APIs.json to bind a Swagger definition, with one or many Docker images, opens up a whole new view of how you can automate API deployment, management, and integration.</p>

<p>With the other other 1231 mentioning application programming interface or API in the description of the patent.

I will work to read, and separate out the hardware related APIs, but only slightly off to the side, as I still think hardware APIs are extremely relevant with the latest IoT evolution. During the process, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll come up with other buckets to put APIs into, but ultimately looking to understand the role that APIs are playing in the patent game.</p>
<p>I suspect that downloading the last 20+ years of patents, processing them looking for the phrases &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;, or the acronym API, is just the beginning. As I read through the patents, learn about the ideas, people, and companies behind them, I&rsquo;m sure my understanding will expand greatly. I&rsquo;ll check in with more data after each import of files, and discovery of any new insights, and as always, you can find my <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">patent API research repository on Github</a>.</p>

<p>David Berlind&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/dberlind">@dberlind</a>), <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/amid-api-copyright-controversy-api-patent-claim-surfaces/analysis/2015/01/23">Amid The API Copyright Controversy, An API Patent Claim Surfaces</a> story from this last Friday, planted some ideas in my head around APIs and patents&mdash;something that once takes hold, becomes hopeless for me to resist, and 48 hours later, here are my initial thoughts.</p>
<p>Before I begin, let me state, patents and APIs, much like copryight and APIs, are not concepts I subscribe to, but because they are concepts that are being wielded in the API space, I am forced to enter the conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you read David&rsquo;s piece on Pokitdok&rsquo;s claim regarding their &ldquo;patent-pending API&rdquo; for yourself, something I find very troubling (about Pokitdok). My post is about my journey, after I read David's story, resulting in yet another&nbsp;<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">research project into the politics of patents involving APIs</a>. After reading David's story this Saturday AM (yeah I need a life), I started &ldquo;googling&rdquo; the concept of API patents, just to educate myself&mdash;my eternal mission at API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I was very surprised to find the number of results that come up when you search <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl#tbm=pts&amp;q=application+programming+interface">Google Patents for the term &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;</a>&mdash;about 552,000 results (0.32 seconds), to be precise. What does this mean? I start reading, and 48 hours later I&rsquo;m still reading. Sure there a number of older patents for hardware APIs, and even many APIs that were established during the web service heyday of the late 90&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s, but there is much more than that. I was surprised to see the number of patents with APIs as the main focus from API sector leaders like AWS, Twilio, Apigee, and Google.</p>
<p>I have to start with two of the most ironic API patents i have found so far, during my search:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google</strong> (<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2012/04/google-acquires-unisys-patents/">Through Unisys Patent Portfolio Acquisition</a>) - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7437740?dq=Generation+of+Java+language+application+programming+interface+for+an+object-oriented+data+store&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5qDFVKq2BIaGyQTRyIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA">Generation of Java language application programming interface for an object-oriented data store</a></strong> - An embodiment of the present invention is a technique to interface to a repository. A connection between a client and a repository database is established. The repository database has a repository application programming interface (API). The repository database contains objects related to a project management process. The repository API is communicated with to perform an operation based on parameters passed from the client via the connection. A return value associated with the operation is returned to the client.</li>
<li><strong>CopyRightNow</strong> - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20140214700?dq=Disclosed+herein+is+a+method+and+system+for+providing+copyright+protection+for+creative+works+from+within+a+running+content-creating+software+application&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IqHFVOqDDIOxyQSorIKwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA">CopyRightNow Application Programming Interface</a></strong> - Disclosed herein is a method and system for providing copyright protection for creative works from within a running content-creating software application by assembling and submitting a copyright application on the creative work to the United States Copyright Office through the use of a portable application programming interface, which may be utilized by third-party content-creating applications.

Additionally disclosed is a method and system for accessing and sharing copyright-protected creative works through a web accessible software application.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent most of the day Saturday looking through API patents, trying to separate the hardware from software, and the API adjacent to the specific API patents. I began my journey at <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl">Google Patent Search</a>, and eventually find myself using <a href="https://developers.google.com/patent-search/">Google Patent Search API</a> (now deprecated), until I hit the wall, and I end up at the original data source, processing XML files. I&rsquo;m only now getting to year 2013, after 24 hours or making sense of, writing a processing script, and downloading of patent XML files&mdash;so far I have 428 patents where &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo; shows up in the title, abstract, description, or anywhere else in the content of a patent application.</p>
<p>You can view the <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">entire patent listing here</a>, and get the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/patents/blob/gh-pages/data/patents.json">JSON file driving the listing here</a>--as I process each year, going back to 1990, I will publish the resulting JSON.</p>
<p>My head is swimming. Once again I find myself neck deep in a concept I fundamentally disagree with, in hopes of understanding where the battle line exists within the API space, and educate myself enough so that I can articulate a line on this battlefield, in a war I refuse to participate in, yet I find myself sucked into.</p>
<p>From what I can see, API related patents are not something that that will happen in the future, it is already happening, and has been for quite some time. Sure there are many things that need separating when evaluating the 550K API related patents, but after 48 hours of research, I have to say that APIs are being patented at an increasing rate, and is something we just don't talk about publicly.</p>
<p>As I read through many of the titles, and abstracts, of the patent applications within each XML download I&rsquo;ve been processing, I feel like I&rsquo;m reading the antithesis of API Evangelist. On my blog I work every day to better understand how APIs are being used across each business sector, while looking to educate everyone about what is possible, sharing the best practices I discover along the way&mdash;when I read through the API patent abstracts, I see some very educated, and other not so educated bets on how APIs are being used, and where the future might be going, hoping to lock in these ideas, and extract value at some point in time.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand that patents are a necessary evil in the world of big business and in startup-land, but it doesn&rsquo;t change my contempt for them. I&rsquo;m sure many of my API heroes like AWS and Twilio are just submitting patents in a defensive stance, but yet again it doesn&rsquo;t shift reduce my concern. To channel my worr around patents being applied in the world of APIs, I&rsquo;m kicking off <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">deeper research, and monitoring in this dark, un-discussed alley of the API economy</a>.</p>
<p>To help me with my research I dowloaded all of 2014 patent submissions,  pulled out all the API related ones, and published as a patent API. To keep up with the amount of patent absurdity that I have read over this beautiful weekend, I have to state my own intent to submit a patent on providing patent APIs. I will take my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/patent/swagger.json">patent API design</a>, and ensure if you intend to ever organize your patents, and make accessible via APIs you have to pay the piper&mdash;cause you know, this is how this shit gets done!!</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately, playing around with different approaches to deploying APIs in Docker containers. Part of this is because it is the latest trend in API deployment and management, but also because I&rsquo;m preparing for my talk at <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days in Sydney Australia</a> next month.</p>
<p>I am always working to keep my keynotes in sync with not just my own work, but in alignment with where the wider conversation is going in the API space. I&rsquo;m building off my talk at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag last November</a>, which was titled, "<a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/defrag/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies.html">containers will do for APIs what APIs have done for companies</a>".</p>
<p>The title of my talk at API Days in Sydney is, <em>"The Programmable World With APIs And Containers"</em>. While some of my talk will be inspirational, trying to understand where we are headed with APIs and containers, much of it will also be rooted in my own work to run my own business world using APIs and Docker, and using APIs.json and Swagger to help me orchestrate my resources.</p>
<p>I apologize for the gaps in my normal writing, and the heavy focus on Docker lately, but it is where my mind is at, from an operational standpoint, in preparation for the conversation in Australia, and from what I&rsquo;m seeing, it is in sync with the wider API and cloud computing conversation.</p>

<p>The API space is continuing its rapid expansion, and along with the number of API design, deployment, management, and integration providers, and the number of API conferences, there are some new sources of discussion around APIs--one as a YouTube Channel, and the other as a SoundCloud podcast.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">API Workshop</a> -</strong> We'll discuss topics around API Design, including: sustainability concepts: how to design APIs that last, new ideas in API design, voices and posts from the API blog world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsUncensored</a> -</strong> The official home of the APIs Uncensored podcast, a monthly series where Ole Lensmar and Lorinda Brandon blather about all things APIs with experts in the industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>API Workshop is a production by J(a)son Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>), and APIsUncensored is from the smart folks over at <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a>(when describing them I always feel tricked into saying they are smart). I was honored to have mentions in both of them, and you can read <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/rest-api-design-bridging-what-we-have-to-the-future-by-organizing-the-json-junk-drawer/">my response to API Workshop here</a>, and to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/23/a-conversation-about-my-subway-map-api-on-the-apisuncensored-podcast/">APIsUncensored over here</a>.</p>
<p>In my opnion, it is a healthy sign for the space to see more video and audio outlets emerge&mdash;the space needs as many open voices, educating the masses as it can possess. Maybe soon we'll need an aggregator of all the sources of great information! (get to work on that please)</p>
<p>I posted a video in response to my reference in the API Workshop episode, in addition to my blog post. Something I&rsquo;m working on for APIsUncensored as well, continuing to expand my presence on these important channels. Personally I&rsquo;m a big podcast listener, over YouTubing, but everyone has a different set of frequencies they tune into, and I think it is important to maximize the reach.</p>
<p>Now if only we could get the next episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic &amp; Weather!</a> Wink, Wink!</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/subway-map-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is a new podcast on SoundCloud called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsUncensored</a>, from the folks over at SmartBear. I was honored to have a mention in the first episode, where they brought up a project I did a couple of months back, which I called the <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">Subway Map API</a>. I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/my-turkey-holiday-project-a-subway-map-api/">published a full story on what I was doing</a>, and launched  supporting Github repo, and API, but the work was very much a weekend side project, and something that will need a lot more love before it goes anywhere.</p>
<p>Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>) admitted that when he introduced the project, he didn&rsquo;t really get it, but ultimately in their segment, they accomplished what I was looking to do&mdash;stimulate conversation. The Subway Map API isn&rsquo;t about the ideas I plotted on the map for API Evangelist, it is about the format for grouping, and mapping out iof deas&mdash;then evolving them through conversation. Don&rsquo;t get hung up on my groupings of API design, deployment, management, etc., because my mission is to help introduce people to the world of providing and consuming APIs.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to provide a platform where anyone can step up and frame a conversation about the lifecycle that means the most to them, their company, their products, and industry. When I first published the proejct, I quickly sent it out to two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a></strong> - Life-cycle to 3Scale is about helping people manage the APIs they&rsquo;ve deployed, and I will be helping create a v1 map, based upon great work that Manfred has done on this subject.</li>
<li><strong><a title="SmartBear" href="http://bit.ly/1oy8CIN">SmarBear</a></strong> - Life-cycle to SmartBear is about helping people monitor, test, and understand the APIs they posses, and if you guys have any stories on your blog to help me see this vision, I can help translate into a map.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get hung up on the maps I created, and don&rsquo;t even get hung up on it being a subway map. As Ole mentioned you can add bus routes, train routes, etc. Via the API you can control the color, shapes, direction, connectors and labels for every aspect of the map. If you want to draw a straight line with 10 dots in a row, go for it. If you want to draw a big circle with 10 stops along the way, going all the back to the beginning, go for it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">Subway Map API</a> project was a fun thing I did for the weekend, and was looking to jump-start the conversation, something I think I did--eventually I&rsquo;d love for someone to build an interface for facilitating this conversation. John Musser nailed it when he articulated the overall objective, and that is to create the most meaningful visual as possible, to help someone understand a Wycliffe related to the world of APIs. Think of John&rsquo;s series of hockey stick API growth charts, or his API business  models diagrams, these have become ubiquitous in API discussions, and if you create the next generation one for API design, deployment, management, integration, or other&mdash;you win!</p>
<p>I'll work on a video response to go with this story. I&rsquo;m neck deep in API-micro-service-docker-land, and don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to pull head up, I love the conversation!</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Httphub-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I come across a lot of API related companies during my monitoring of the space, which I queue up, and as I have time, I work to explore and understand what they do. One company that I&rsquo;ve had open in a tab for the last week is <a href="https://www.httphub.com/">HTTPHUB</a>.</p>
<p>HTTPHUB is very interesting. It starts by giving you a root namespace, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://kinlane.httphub.com</span>, and from there I can add on any resources on, and make it either public or private&mdash;then I can POST any JSON to this resource in the body. So I could create <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://kinlane.httphub.com/notes/</span>, and craft a simple form + script to post any data I submit to my HTTPHUB resource.</p>
<p>I think that HTTPHUB captures the simplicity of APIs. Obviously the system will have some limitations, but ultimately it makes on boarding with the concept of APIs, and getting up and running with an API backend as frictionless as possible. HTTPHUB also gives you logging, and user management for your namespace, adding some other essential elements you will need for your API backend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Httphub-examples.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some of the features of an HTTPHUB account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited requests (rate limited)</li>
<li>3Gb of storage space</li>
<li>300.000 resources</li>
<li>3.000 namespace users</li>
<li>3Mb Max POST size</li>
<li>Signup and quota management for namespace users</li>
<li>Authenticate with credentials or IP address</li>
<li>Register up to 5 different accounts using the same email address</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTPHUB also provides a pretty slick demo feature, using demo test data, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>. They provide you with a link to the Postman Chrome app, and a link to a collection file that you can import. This gives you a listing of all of the base endpoints for HTTPHUB, which you can then use to expand, and manage your HTTPHUB API backend--no programming necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/">HTTPHUB</a> is most interesting to me because its simple, intuitive, and potentially something you could self-define exactly the backend resources you need, as you need them. Imagine if applications could grow its own backend? Allowing end-users to add to their world, changing how they store contacts, or take notes&mdash;using a backend that flexes, grows, and fits end-users needs like a glove.</p>

<p>I've been a <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> user for a while, as a tool for quickly making API calls against the APIs I use most, and explore the new APIs I discover daily. As I use Postman, I can't help but think the concept of assembling collections of API calls using Postman, is in sync with part of our vision for <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>--we just need a common way to communicate.</p>
<p>APIs.json is not just for defining the API operations that exist within a specific domain, which is the most common approach, it is also about assembling collections of multiple APIs, for a specific purpose. In my mind, the motivations for assembling Postman collections, and APIs.json collections are definitely in alignment.</p>
<p>Similar to providing resources for translating between popular API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, I want to make sure and translate between emerging API discovery and collection formats. While I&rsquo;d love for APIs.json to become the default standard for API discovery, I&rsquo;m happy to embrace other formats, designed for other API tools&mdash;as long as they are striving to be as open as they can.</p>

<p>I sign up for a lot of APIs, and when I encounter a frictionless on-boarding process, I feel the need to showcase, and help everyone understand how important it is to make the process as easy as possible. I'm still amazed at how many new APIs make this really, really hard. I will write a separate story after this about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how not to on-board with an API</span>, but for now lets take a look at a kick-ass example.</p>
<p>This example comes from the&nbsp;<a href="http://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/">National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API</a>. When it comes to signing up for API access, the only thing that can make this easier is providing an API for the process, but for right from the home page you can signup for an API key.</p>

<p>Once I provide my first name, last name, email, and optionally some details on how I will use the APIs, I am given my API key. I don&rsquo;t have to click again to find my API key, and I&rsquo;m given an example API call, complete with my API key.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My first click gives me the instant gratification I am looking for via a simple API call, resulting in an example JSON response. I do not have to work to find my key or figure out how to make my first API call, it is all given to me immediately.</p>

<p>I'm up and running with the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API in two clicks. I don't have to fill out a long form, wait for access, or work to find my keys, and fumble with how to make my first API call. To reenforce this, I look in my email inbox, and there is an email providing my API keys again, along with the link to make my first API call.</p>

<p>Like I said above, the only thing that would make that easier, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">is for all of this to be a series of API calls, which would make the on-boarding process programmatic</a>. Eventually I could see this being essential, but for now I'm happy to see them not only standardizing API on-boarding across federal agencies, but making it as dead simple as you possibly can.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of frictionless API on-boarding, and I applaud NIH and 18F for their work on the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API. I will keep an eye on future releases, for more stories on healthy patterns I'm seeing in API deployment in the federal government.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>I'm aware I left my keys in these pics, it was easier to reset them, then to blurr them out, and I think it helps with point. ;-)</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/#introduction"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ridb-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I referenced the <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</a>, in my story late last year, when I was <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/">asking for your help to make sure the Department of Agriculture leads with APIs in their parks and recreation RFP</a>.  I'm not exactly sure where it fits in with the RFP, because the RIDB spans multiple agencies.</p>
<p>Here is the description from the RIDB site:</p>
<blockquote><em>RIDB is a part of the Recreation One Stop (Rec1Stop) project, initiated as a result of a government modernization study conducted in 2004. Rec1Stop provides a user-friendly, web-based resource to citizens, offering a single point of access to information about recreational opportunities nationwide. The web site represents an authoritative source of information and services for millions of visitors to federal lands, historic sites, museums, and other attractions/resources.</em></blockquote>
<p>When I wrote the post last October, I referenced the <a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/RIDB_API_Requirements_20150113.pdf">PDF for the REST API Requirements for the US Forest Service Recreation Information Database (RIDB</a>), but this week I got an update, complete with <a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/#introduction">fresh links to a preview of a pretty well designed API</a>, complete with <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">documentation developed using Slate</a>.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually hacked on the endpoints, but I took a stroll through the docs, and my first impression was it is well designed, and robust, including resources for organizations involved with the RDB, recreational areas, facilities, campsites, permit entrances, tours, activities, events, media, and links.  The RIDB documentation also includes details on errors, pagination, version, and a data dictionary, and the on-boarding was frictionless when looking to get a key.</p>
<p>Everything is in dev mode with the RIDB API, and the team is looking for feedback. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they wanted me to publish as story on API Evangelist, but I figure the more people involved the better, as I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll get around to actually hacking on the API. I&rsquo;m happy to see such a quick iteration towards the next generation of the RIDB API, and it makes me hopeful to be covering so many new API efforts out of the federal government in a single day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBXsmSrKE8"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/REST-API-Design-Avoid-future-proofing-with-the-JSON-junk-drawer-YouTube.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API storyteller J(a)son Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>) has a new YouTube channel up called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">API Workshop</a>. He's going to be publishing regular API design workshop episodes, with the latest one titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">REST API Design: Avoid future proofing with the JSON junk drawer</a>. J(a)son provides a nice overview of how you should be structuring the JSON for your API, focusing on the usage of key / value stores. Ironically he uses APIs.json as an example of why you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SHOULD NOT</strong></span> use custom key / values within your JSON. What is ironic about this, is that he makes the case for APIs.json properties, giving me a great starting point for helping folks better understand <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and why properties are key to its evolution, and flexibility.</p>
<p>The process J(a)son outlines in the portion of this segment that referred to APIs.json, describes the lifecycle of an APIs.json property, towards becoming more of a "first class property". There are three phases of an APIs.json property:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>X-Property - </strong>A user defined property, allowing anyone to craft exactly the properties that matter to them</li>
<li><strong>Property - </strong>An official machine readable APIs.json property element, acknowledging its wide usage, potential as common blueprint</li>
<li><strong>"First Class Property or Collection"&nbsp;</strong>- Baking a property into the specification as default property of APIs collection, or establishing as sub-collection for the API</li>
</ol>
<p>The lesson J(a)son provides, describes the journey of each APIs.json property, the difference is in that his lesson provides best practices for API providers who are designing new APIs, helping them avoid the creation of a junk drawer, and the APIs.json property format is being applied to define the junk drawer that we have (aka the public API space). This represents the fundamental separation between my approach to defining the space vs. many other technologists&mdash;I am trying to map out what we have, and get us the next step in our evolution, while others are working hard to define where we should be going.</p>
<p>When Steve and I originally hammered out the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a>, we couldn't 100% agree on what should be first class properties and collections for each API defined using an APIs.json file&mdash;what you see in version 0.14 is what we agreed to, the rest needs to be defined by the community, through actually implementations and discussion on the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">APIs.json Github repo</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-recycling.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you are crafting the JSON, for a new API, J(a)son&rsquo;s lesson is very important, but when you are evaluating hundreds of APIs, and trying to define a common pattern for representing not just the tech, but the business, and politics of an API&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have as much control over how things get defined. I&rsquo;m not worried about the overhead involved with adding a little more complexity to my code, to bridge the well-defined aspects of API operations with the lesser-defined parts of the space.</p>
<p>Ideally, in one of the next iterations of APIs.json, the official properties of Swagger, RAML, Blueprint, and WADL can move up into a first class collection for each API called definitions, and maybe also consider moving API Commons up to be a first class licensing collection as well.  I&rsquo;m also looking to graduate some X-properties to official status, based upon <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">creating APIs.json for over 700+ companies</a>, and having identified almost <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/properties.json">150 separate properties that can be used to describe API operations</a>. All of this represents the API sector coming into focus, and I do not think all of these properties should become "first class" properties or collections&mdash;I am just trying to make sense of the "junk drawer" that we have, and help provide a blueprint for a machine readable formats that can help us evolve it towards the future we want.</p>
<p>I have been asked by several folks to better explain Steve and mine APIs.json vision, and J(a)son&rsquo;s story gives me the opportunity to help kick off this storytelling. In an effort to keep this story short, I&rsquo;m going to follow J(a)son&rsquo;s lead and move the rest of this story on to YouTube, so if you want to better understand APIs.json properties, you can watch my video response to J(a)son's story, which augments this post, and hopefully provides some better examples, along with narrative.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-no.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote a piece earlier today about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/this-is-how-you-onboard-with-an-api/">kick-ass on-boarding process at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API</a>--within two clicks I had my API key and was making an API call. To contrast this post I wanted to provide an example of how not to on-board with an API.</p>
<p>I am always amazed at how hard people make it to sign up and play with an API in 2015. Today's example of on-boarding with the most friction you can imagine comes from the <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/wellness-api/request-the-api/">Garmin Wellness API</a>--I think their API signup form speaks for itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.garmin.com/wellness-api/request-the-api/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/garmin-onboarding-form.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I understand you are worried about what people might do with your API, but that is kind of the whole point of doing an API. If you are looking to encourage innovation on your API, this is not how you want to on-board your developers, and make a first impression.</p>
<p>There are other ways to manage API integrations without restricting users from day one. Make sure and help make API on-boarding as frictionless as possible, there is no reason to use a form like Garmin has.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/NIH-3D-Print-Exchange.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is an very interesting new 3D Print Exchange API from the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>. The NIH 3D Print Exchange is designed for publishing "biomedically-relevant" 3D models, that anyone can download and use as blueprint for printing on a their 3D printer.</p>
<p>I've been <a href="http://3d-printing.apievangelist.com/companies.html">tracking on 3D printing APIs since 2011</a>, when I started profiling <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/19/api-driven-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">how APIs were being used by printing, and 3D printing providers</a>. It is interesting to see an industry focused 3D printing API emerge, which I feel is a sign the space is maturing, and will continuing to evolve in 2015.</p>
<p>Another thing to note in this story, is simplistic approach the NIH took in deploying their API. The 3D Print Exchange API has all the essential building blocks to help you understand what the API does, on-board with the API (another story), and get the support you need throughout integration via <a href="https://twitter.com/nih3dprint">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/niaid/3dpx_api">Github</a>, and <a href="mailto: 3dprint@nih.gov">email</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/">3D Print Exchange API</a> has all the fingerprints of <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> on it, demonstrating that APIs in the federal government will continue to pick up momentum with the assistance of 18F of the Presidential Innovation Fellowship (PIF) program out of the White House and GSA.</p>
