{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was reading several stories yesterday about the State of California cutting funding for libraries across the state.These kind of budget cuts really make me worry for the future of our children and our communities.I say it is time that we all come together and figure out a way to re-invent our libraries, and one possible way forward is to remake our local libraries as hacker space.Here are a few ideas I had today about this: Dedicated Hacker Spaces - Each community could have a space to have hackathons that could be used for locally driven events as well as a place for out of town organizers to throw events.Hackathon Model - Libraries could adopt a hackathon model for throwing small or large events in any area, allowing kids and adults to organize and participate in hackathons in any topic area.</p>
