{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’ve come across several APIs lately that rely on getting their data from web scraping. These API owners have written scripts that spider page(s) on a regular schedule, pull content, parse it and clean it up for storage in a database.Once they’ve scraped or harvested this data from the web page source, they then get to work transforming and normalizing for access via a RESTful API.  With an API they can now offer a standard interface that reliably pulls data from a database and delivers it in XML or JSON to any developer.  These API owners are still at the mercy of the website source that is being scraped.</p>
