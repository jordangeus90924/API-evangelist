{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive written about the essential building blocks necessary for a successful API, and there are other great posts like, What Developers Say About API Documentation from Peter Gruenbaum of SDK Bridge.Everyone seems pretty unanimous that a RESTful API, with simple and complete documentation, qualitiy code samples in the popular languages, and real API support from the owner and the community are the ingredients for a successful API.Iparticipatedin a chat about APIs on Twitter, where amix of API influencers, owners, advocates, evangelists and developers hung out for about an hour, answering questions posed by @retailigence.Overall there were about seven questions asked, but the second one was simple, and thought provoking: What is the most important characteristic of an API?The common building blocks were rattled off (by myself included): REST, quality documentation, code samples, while other said more innovative things like API explorer or Masherys I/O Docs.</p>
