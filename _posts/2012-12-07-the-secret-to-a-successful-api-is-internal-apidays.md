{% include JB/setup %}<p>I had the pleasure of speaking at API Days in Paris, France this week.The organizers originally asked me to do one talk, but after some speaker shuffle, I ended up with three separate talks on APIs.The second talk I did at API Days was The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal. This material was evolved from past stories Ive done on Amazons and Netflixs success with internal APIs.  I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs.</p>
