        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2021/02/11/gathering-my-thoughts-on-api-discovery/">Gathering My Thoughts on API Discovery</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Feb 2021</span>
        
<p>I am working to load up all my API discovery experiences into my head for some upcoming conversations. So I sat down and pulled together a summary of my API discovery research to date to help refresh my memory of what has happened and how we got here. API discovery is the one of the few layers of the API space that I am personally committed to helping move things forward and being able to see all the moving parts together helps me keep doing this. Let’s take a stroll through my memory of the evolution of API discover over the last fifteen years so that I can speak more coherently about all of this with a variety of folks.</p>

<h3>ProgrammableWeb</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> was the first source of being able to discover API, and in 2020 it is still the place you go to find APIs. Really not much has changed in the last fifteen years with ProgrammableWeb except for the owners and operators, and the look and feel of the site. It is still where you go to look for new and existing APIs, and where you find APIs when Googling.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/programmable-web.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<p>I have fond memories of writing for ProgrammableWeb, and the site is still a great source of information for me, but I am left frustrated that PW hasn’t moved forward the API discovery conversation in any interesting ways over the years. I just think it is a missed opportunity, and reflects much about the API space that I think holds us all back.</p>

<h3>Mashape -&gt; Rapid API</h3>
<p>After ProgrammableWeb, the next evolution in the API space when it came to API discovery was Mashape, which is now known as <a href="https://rapidapi.com/marketplace">Rapid API</a>. The API marketplace was born out of the age of API management and provides basic management capabilities alongside with API discovery services. Providing a pretty rich set of APIs you can search and onboard with using the Rapid API marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><a href="https://rapidapi.com/marketplace"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/rapid-api.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<p>Mashape and Rapid API definitely moved forward the API discovery conversation a bit, but much like ProgrammableWeb, it stopped there. RapidAPI is definitely giving ProgrammableWeb a run for their money when it comes to the SEO game, but there really hasn’t been much out of RapidAPI beyond the fundamentals of a simple API marketplace—-that is fine, but I’m always looking for forward motion.</p>

<h3>US Federal Government Data.json Index</h3>
<p>Next I am going to take a little detour, but it relates to API discovery, I promise. In 2013 I went to work for the Obama administration to work on helping federal agencies publish their public data assets using APIs. I was dedicated to the Department of Veterans Affairs, but also spent time working with other agencies to follow the presidential mandate to publish what is called a data.json file in the root of the web site domains for the 15 executive agencies—-you can still find the fifteen files available today.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/us-executive-branch-data-json-indexes/overview">I have setup a workspace to pull all fifteen of the data.json files</a> and I am working to process them to see what has been published, and understand the state of the work that I began back in 2013. I learned a lot about data discovery and the realities of doing it within large bureaucracies as part of this work, something that I brought home with me after my tour was done and began applying to what I wanted to see when it comes to mainstream API discovery.</p>

<h3>APIs.json / APIs.yaml</h3>
<p>Shortly after leaving Washington DC I created a new API discovery format with Steve Willmott from 3Scale called <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>. Like the data.json file, APIs.json would provide an discovery format for APIs, but I would evolve to better fit what I felt was needed to help move the API discovery conversation forward inside and outside of government. Providing a way to index individual APIs, collections of APIs, workflows, and other ways we are needing to discover and put APIs to work in automated and manual ways.</p>

<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/apis-json.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<p>I am about to move the specification forward to the next version, and will keep working to evolve the specification. <a href="https://github.com/api-network/organizations/tree/main/_data">I have over 40K APIs.json files for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies</a> I have identified of having an API, working with APIs, or being suspect of having an API. I will keep working to iterate upon each of the entries I have in the list as I continue to expand the ways in which I am crawling and discovering APIs.</p>

<h3>APIs.io</h3>
<p>When we launched APIs.json we also launched <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>, the first API search engine. We wanted an implementation of the API discovery specification to show what was possible pushing API providers to learn more about, and begin publish the specification as part of their operations. APIs.io was also beginning to poll for updates to APIs.json files it indexed, as well as beginning to consider how to search for new ones. Making it the first API search engine that allows you to search for APIs, while also looking for updates, and expanding the catalog in an automated way.</p>

<p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/apis-io.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<p>Sadly I know that APIs.io isn’t maintained. People are still adding APIs to it, but if the site goes down I am guessing there is nobody home to get back up and running. The site got lost in the shuffle of Red Hat acquiring 3Scale and then IBM acquiring Red Hat. While the site isn’t a living part of the API discovery conversation it still plays a role in shaping the discussion.</p>

<h3>API Specifications</h3>
<p>Alongside the evolution of ProgrammableWeb, RapidAPI, and the introduction of APIs.json and APIs.io, a variety of specifications emerged to help improve the API lifecycle, which all contributed to making APIs a little more tangible and ultimately discoverable. Each of these API specifications have made it easier to find APIs, whether you are looking on the web, via Github, or somewhere on your local network. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI (Swagger)</a> - OpenAPI provides an artifact that is discoverable and is organized by a variety of marketplaces, directories, and hubs to make them more discoverable. </li>
<li><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> - While API Blueprint hasn’t one the API specification war, it did significantly contribute to the API discovery conversation because .apib extensions are easy to find.</li>
<li><a href="https://raml.org/">RAML</a> - Like API Blueprint, RAML files are pretty easy to discover and find on Github and powering documentation, helping make APIs much more discoverable.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.postman.com/collection/">Postman Collections</a> - The Postman platform uses collections to define APIs, and with over 13M developers making collections, they’ve become a great way to find and share APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>API specifications provide a pretty critical building block when it comes to API discovery. These machine readable specifications describe the surface area of an API, while providing a title, description, and other metadata that help make an API more discoverable. Organizing API specifications into a marketplace, directory, or hub would turn out to be the next definitive step in the API discovery conversation.</p>

<h3>SwaggerHub</h3>
<p>After Smartbear put Swagger into the Linux Foundation as OpenAPI, they launched <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/">SwaggerHub</a> to help API providers publish their OpenAPIs, making them available for discovery. The platform does as it says, provides a hub for Swagger, and now OpenAPI. Allowing developers to publish and search for different types of APIs, while also being able to edit and orchestrate using them across the API lifecycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/swaggerhub.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<p>SwaggerHub is definitely an API discovery solution, but it focuses on it from a very different postition. It is more about editing and designing APIs, then making them available across multiple stops along the API lifecycle, including discovery. Building on top of the leading API specifications, but focusing on how it will be put to work across the API lifecycle.

<h3>APIs.guru</h3>
<p>Similar to SwaggerHub, another more open source approach emerged with <a href="https://apis.guru/">APIs.guru</a>, which also aggregates Swagger and OpenAPI definitions, but does it as a GitHub repository, with a simple search website built on top. Providing a rich catalog of OpenAPI definitions for some of the most known APIs. Providing a single place you can go to download or fork the OpenAPI for a variety of APIs, making search dead simple.</p>

<p><a href="https://apis.guru/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/apis-guru.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<p>I like the APIs.guru approach. API discovery on Github makes sense to me. GitHub isn’t just for managing code and provides a wealth of features you can use to move forward different APIs using OpenAPI and other specifications. You can fork the entire APIs.guru OpenAPI catalog, making it pretty portable and forkable API discovery solution that you can run anywhere.</p>

<h3>Postman Network</h3>
<p>As all of these other things were happening, Postman published their own API directory that is called the <a href="https://www.postman.com/explore">Postman API Network</a>. Providing a listing of different APIs which are defined by Postman’s own API specification called collections. Postman users can publish their collections to the API network, then consumers can browse APIs by category, or search for APIs by keyword.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/explore"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-network.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<p>With the latest release of the Postman platform you can now find APIs defined by OpenAPI, RAML, or GraphQL, as well as collections, monitors, mock servers, and other components in publish workspaces. Think Github repositories but designed for APIs. Additionally the search for the Postman network has evolved to provide a more detailed look at public APIs, but also APIs you have available privately within personal or team workspaces.</p>

<h3>More API Catalogs</h3>
<p>Then we began to see more API directories and catalogs emerge. There has been a lot more than these which ultimately have gone away, but this shows a nice cross section of the types of API discovery solutions that have emerged--helping all of us find the APIs we are needing in our applications.</p></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://any-api.com/">Any API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://smart-api.info/">Smart API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yappes.com/">Yappes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apistack.io/">API Stack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://public-apis.xyz/">Public APIs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Most API directories launch, then receive waves of updates, then go dormant or disappear entirely. I’ve launched several directories myself, only to take them down once they go stale. Keeping API catalogs fresh and up to date takes a lot of work and there really isn’t much money to be made in doing--at least not yet.</p>

<h3>API Discovery with a Purpose</h3>
<p>More recently we’ve begun to see a fresh wave of API discovery solutions emerge, but this crop of solutions isn’t just about simply finding APIs. It is about finding APIs so that you can meet some other more pressing needs like security or compliance. Here are handful of the new types of approaches to finding APIs, helping us make sense of our very abstract and invisible infrastructure we are increasingly dependent on that is growing exponentially around us.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.api.expert">API Expert</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apitracker.io/">API Tracker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.traceable.ai/use-cases/api-discovery-and-risk-management">Traceable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cloudvector.com/api-shark/">API Shark</a></li>
<li><a href="https://resurface.io/">Resurface</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apidiscovery.teejlab.com/">Teejlabs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://useoptic.com/">Optic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/">Akita</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.consul.io/api-docs/discovery-chain">Consul</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You see a whole mix of why we need to discover APIs represented here. I feel like search to just discover an API isn’t enough to take API discovery to the next level. We are needing other reasons to discover the API infrastructure that is emerging all around us. APIs are often growing so fast that we can’t keep up with documentation and other more traditional ways in which we see and discover APIs.</p>

<h3>Just Google It</h3>
<p>In reality, most APIs are discovered by a simple <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google search</a>. It is something that I think will always remain a reality, and something I think Google will continue to invest in to help us find the APIs we need. However, this will only help us surface the public APIs we are looking for. We will need solutions that help us find public APIs, but also the private and partner ones we depend on which aren't discoverable using a Google search.</p>

<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google.png" width="100%" /></p>

<h3>The Joy of Finding New APIs</h3>
<p>There really aren’t many ways to be introduced to new APIs on a regular basis. You can learn new ones by reading Techcrunch, tuning into the right slices of the Twitterverse or Reddit, but I’d say that <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/topics/apis?order=most-upvoted">Product Hunt</a>. You can also tune into ProgramambleWeb and get introduced to new APIs using their steady drip of new APIs, but I ultimately wish that there were more ways of being introduced APIs, but is probably the way that is the least likely to be monetizable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/topics/apis?order=most-upvoted"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/product-hunt.png" width="100%" /></a></p>

<h3>The Further Semantics of Discovery</h3>
<p>Adding another layer to this discussion, driving how APIs are discovered via Google and other search engines, are some machine readable building blocks that help us better describe the resources we are making available via APIs. There are a couple of ways we can markup, add metadata, and provide more detail that help make our APIs more discoverable by default.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a></li>
<li><a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/web-api-discovery/">WebAPI Discovery Group</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge with all of these building blocks is that they take a lot of work to add to each of our APIs, and it is highly unlikely API providers are going to find the time to do it. So it is up to service and tooling providers to mark things up, and augment API definitions with common elements like Schema.org, JSON-LD, and other rich formats that help us make sense of the digital resources and capabilities we are making available.</p>

<h3>A Peak At Laneworks API Discovery</h3>
<p>I have made several attempts to provide an API discovery solution over the years, and APIs.json only recently started to move forward again. I have a few other solutions that have come and gone, with the most recent evolution being part of my internal platform I have built which I simply call Laneworks. This latest investment is all about API discovery and finding new and interesting APIs on the web and investing them for inclusion into a directory. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Search</strong> - I crawl for Swagger and OpenAPI definitions to discover new APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Postman Collection Search</strong> - I crawl for Postman collections to discover new APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary / Dictionary</strong> - I have a robust dictionary for seeding my searches for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - I try to organize key words and phrases into different domains I can work within.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Search</strong> - I apply my dictionary to searching across Github for API artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Bing Search</strong> - I apply my dictionary to searching for APIs using the Bing search API.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am retiring the v1 of my Laneworks approach to automating API discovery and I am reworking it to operate within a public workspace. I moved my couple thousand of OpenAPIs and resulting collection to a couple thousand public workspaces. Then I’ll be reworking this automation as Postman collections that run as monitors on a schedule, allowing me to discover, harvest, parse, rank, and organize via workspaces for discovery.  When I have this on it tends to uncover a lot of interesting APIs, which can be easily catalogued, but the final touches on polishing and making available has always taken time, something I haven’t historically had--who knows what the future will hold.</p>

<h3>New API Discovery Tooling</h3>
<p>I put this at the end because it just happened a couple weeks ago, but it is a very promising sign of progress in the API discovery conversation. It is a new open source discovery solution that is the most sophisticated open source approach I’ve seen to helping solve the discovery of both public and private APIs.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/01/the-api-registry-api.html">Google API Registry</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I always wondered why Google hand’t gotten into the API discovery game. They own the search market, and they have had a discovery solution for their own stack of APIs, but this open source approach shows the potential of something more. I still have to play with the Google API Registry to understand what it does, but I think it is significant enough to include in this API discovery narrative.</p>

<h3>Important Questions to Ask</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with API discovery to date is that there are many dimensions to grapple with. It isn’t just about search or discovery of APIs. It is about being found. It is about how well you describe what you do. It depends on who you are and what your motivations are. There are a handful of questions that I ask to help me understand the multiple dimensions of the API discovery conversation so that I can see it all.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is searching? Provider or Consumer?</li>
<li>Where are they searching? Publicly or Privately?</li>
<li>Why are they searching for APIs?</li>
<li>Is human searching, or is it a computer searching?</li>
<li>What is the popularity, quality, reliability of the API?</li>
</ul>

<p>The answers to these questions will shift what API discovery is in any given moment. There are many other things to consider, but these areas reflect the common ways I have seen muddy the API discovery waters over the years. Making it something that is difficult to actually provide an easily solution for or explain to folks what it is all about. Honestly, I need to regular checkins on what is happening, and do regular refreshes so that I can even make some sense of things. Sometimes I feel like nothing has happened when it comes to API discovery, but once I do refreshes like this I realize just how much has been happening—-it is just more incremental.</p>

<h3>API Discovery Drivers</h3>
<p>Now that I have all of this loaded up in my head I wanted to think a little bit about what drives API discovery. I want to understand the motivations behind why people are looking to discover APIs, and why those who own APIs are looking to have them discovered, and what is empowering these searches. I am looking to understand where in the lifecycle API discovery is needed most. Scanning down this post, here are the different elements I am thinking of as I try to make sense of where we stand with API discovery in 2021.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - Having a search box handy is central to API discovery, whether that is in application, via local network, or on the open web using a search engine.</li>
<li><strong>Specifications</strong> - OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman Collections, and JSON Schema will continue to play central role in the API discovery combination.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary</strong> - Having a formal vocabulary for discovering new APIs in an automated way, while also using it to markup meta data for APIs is important.</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - Bounded contexts are critical for not just designing APIs, but also organizing and making them available as part of API discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Semantics</strong> - APIs need to be augmented with rich semantics that help us understand the resources and capabilities being made available to users.</li>
<li><strong>Ease</strong> - API discovery has to be easy no matter who you are, and something that has to consider personas, context, and much more under the hood.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - You can’t secure what you don’t know about, so security will continue to be one of the most important reasons why we do API discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Change</strong> - Managing change across the enterprise is the biggest challenge teams face, and API discovery needs to consider how things change or not.</li>
<li><strong>Traceability</strong> - We are in desperate need of the ability to trace out what is going on with the big ball of API yarn we’ve spread across our organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong> - Finding the vulnerabilities across our infrastructure before bad people do is a top priority for the API discovery conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance</strong> - Being compliant when it comes to our API operations is a central concern for those in charge, especially as things keep expanding.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation</strong> - When it comes to GDPR and other regulations emerging, we are increasingly going to be able to discovery exactly the resources we need.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Including monitoring data for all APIs as part of API discovery plays a big role in understanding the uptime and availability of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Augmenting monitoring data, a range of testing data needs to be included as part of the search and discovery of each and every API.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> - You want to find the APIs that are reliable when searching for 3rd party or public APIs, and find those that aren’t reliable internally.</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> - The overall quality of each API across many dimensions has to be included in the overall API discovery index that powers what we discover.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic</strong> - API discovery in all forms has to be automated. It is clear that we can’t count on humans to catalog and make APIs available for discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - Despite concerns public APIs will continue to dominate and driver the API discovery conversation because it is the easiest to reference.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong> - Private API discovery is where we are seeing the most growth and demand for API discovery solutions in the last five years.</li>
<li><strong>Identity</strong> - Who you are and what credentials possess, and the policies applied to those credentials will keep driving the API discovery conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Being able to apply or at least consider authentication at the API discovery layer will help reduce friction at the discovery layer.</li>
<li><strong>Editor</strong> - Being able to edit API definitions, metadata, and other elements used in discovery seems to be a significant part of how we discover and work with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Rating</strong> - We are going to need a multi-part sophisticated approach to rating APIs so that we can focus on just what matters to use when it comes to discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Forkability</strong> - The ability to fork the APIs we are discovering, and sort and rank based upon what we’ve forked and merged will continue to drive search.</li>
<li><strong>SEO</strong> - The search engine optimization game will continue to drive the API discovery conversation, and keep shaping how we describe the APIs we have.</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> - The narrative for each API and it’s consumes and applications play a big role in helping us discover what is going on around each API.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will have to simmer on these elements before writing much more. There is definitely a lot more to API discovery than organizing APIs into a catalog and providing a search mechanism, but I’m still not sure what the next evolution of API discovery will be. I definitely feel a lot better when it come to thinking nothing has happened with API discovery in the last decade-—plenty has happened. As always in the API space the trick is always about aggregating everything together and reading the tea leaves to figure out what is happening, and considering what the needs of API publishers and consumers are--which is what this blog post is all about.</p>

<p>I am always skeptical of my views of API discovery. I am an analyst, as well as a publisher and consumer of APIs. I am also API obsessed. Which puts me into a whole different category when it comes to wanting to find APIs. I don’t think the average business or technical person cares about APIs—-they are just trying to get work done in their worlds. I think search is central to API discovery, but there are a number of other mechanisms at work that will make that search relevant or not relevant to whole mix of different personas who have often competing motivations for why they want to find APIs, or have their APIs found. In the end, I think the default mode of API discovery is still just “Googling it”. I am not sure if this is more about web search and discovery than it is about API discovery, or there is something deeper to consider. Regardless, I think API discovery still needs to heavily consider this when it comes to API discovery for public APIs, but when it comes to private APIs I have other ideas-—more to come..</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2021/02/11/api-storytelling-with-mike-and-aidan/">API Storytelling with Mike and Aidan</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Feb 2021</span>
        
<p>If you have followed my work you know that I like telling stories. Stories are the single most important tool in my Chief Evangelist and API Evangelist toolbox. None of the code matters in my opinion, and the stories surrounding the code is what makes the actual impact on our reality. The stories we tell each other, as well as the stories we tell ourselves. Everything in the world of technology and APIs is made up of stories. I am hovering around 5000 stories here on API Evangelist, which reflects everything I am when it comes to API Evangelist. Stories are how I make sense of the API world that has unfolded in the last twenty years. Storytelling is how I work through all of the things I do not understand, moving everything API from a very abstract realm into something that is more tangible, visible, and sometimes more meaningful to me in the real world. I couldn’t have done any of this without stories.</p>

<p>Throughout my storytelling as the API Evangelist I have also taught myself to work through my own personal baggage over at <a href="http://kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>. Applying the same methodology to my past and figuring out who I am today. API Evangelist has always been very much a performance, but the storytelling I engaged in as part of the performance went much deeper than being just a business production. Over the years, both of these streams of storytelling (apievangelist.com &amp; kinlane.com) have influenced others in the world, having an impact on their storytelling, or help them embark on their own storytelling journey. I’ve learned a lot from these engagements, and made a lot of friends around the world because of a shared love for storytelling. This shared storytelling journey has recently manifested itself as a video conversation between Mike Amundsen (@mamund) and Aidan Cunniffe (@aidandcunniffe), which we are simply calling API Storytelling. We only have one discussion under our belt and we aren’t quite sure where we are going with this, but the result for me is a nourishing 60 minutes of storytelling goodness.</p>

<div align="center"><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Mfq2xdW7ik" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>Why did we choose APIs? We talk about it a little bit in the video, but APIs are something that can be associated with almost every aspect of our world, making for a pretty good switchboard for endless storytelling. The three of us are all API storytellers, but we also have witnessed first hand how storytelling helps you personally grow and make sense of the world as well as ourselves. I love hearing how Mike and Aidan wrestle with storytelling and how it works in their world. Listening to how they use storytelling to break down their business worlds, but also their personal life. We don’t have a plan for our API storytelling conversations. We are just showing up with our storytelling bag and sharing little bits this and that and seeing where it all goes. If you watch the first edition of this API storytelling conversation you’ll see that we talk about what we’d like to see this turn into, as well as just the wandering through each of our views on storytelling.</p>

<p>We are going to do another API Storytelling session tomorrow. I am curious to see where we go with things. I can’t articulate just how important storytelling is in my life. I know it sounds corny, but it is true. It is what keeps me going in this crazy world. Stories are really the keys to everything for me. I am also very happy to have others to share this with. I am fascinated to learn how Mike and Aidan approach their version of telling stories to keep moving forward. I am not sure if this is anything that others will want to tune into but it is something that I am glad to have happening right now. I feel like there needs to be a while lot of storytelling going on in this moment, and somehow this is what will elevate us out of this very strange set of times we find ourselves in.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2021</span>
        
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-gauge-on-aircraft-carrier.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I have to admit something. I don&rsquo;t fully grasp the entire landscape of API testing. I mean, I have a pretty decent awareness and experience in testing APIs, but I can&rsquo;t close my eyes and coherently break down each layer or type of testing, let alone competently navigate the many different types of services and tooling available on the market for API testing. Like most other dimensions of the API universe the content and guidance on the subject of API testing is all over the place. After a couple of hours Googling and making my way through my bookmarks, I uncovered a pretty expansive dictionary for what I&rsquo;d consider to be under the umbrella of API testing.</p>
<p class="p1">First off, I have to talk about API testing in the most general sense before I get into the more and less formal API testing approaches. It was a dimension of API testing I hadn&rsquo;t considered before I began working at Postman, but API testing meaning that I am just kicking the tires on a API, learning what it is all about, and how you use it. This is what the majority of Postman&rsquo;s 13 million users are doing when they say they are testing an API with the Postman platform. THis experimental and curious approach to API testing provides a great onramp to the world of API publishing and consumption, but does little to help us articulate what API testing is or isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond just &ldquo;testing out&rdquo; an API, from what I can gather across about 25 separate API testing articles, there are 25 different layers to the API testing onion:</p>
<ol>
<li class="li1"><strong>Validation Testing</strong> - I am guessing a general type of validation &mdash; seems pretty broad.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Functional Testing</strong> - Adopted as part of code testing practices, applied to unit of code.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Component Testing </strong>- Similar to functional, but testing based upon small unit of compute.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>User Interface Testing</strong> - Testing of the API in the context of the end user interface.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Load Testing</strong> - Seeing how many requests each API is able to handle in a timeframe.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Performance Testing</strong> - Overlapping with load testing, but benchmarking the API performance.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Reliability Testing</strong> - Understanding the overall reliability of each individual API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Runtime Error Detection </strong>- Focusing specifically on errors encountered at runtime.</li>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-gears-pipes-plumbing.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" />
<li class="li1"><strong>Security Testing</strong> - A broad umbrella for testing the layers of API security that is present.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Authorization Tests </strong>- Focused on testing the authentication for each individual API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Penetration Testing </strong>- Seeing you can actually get into an API through alternate ways.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Fuzz Testing</strong> - Blasting an API with garbage, noise, and other junk to see what it does.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Interoperability Testing</strong> - Testing how well an API plays with other external APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Integration Testing</strong> - Testing an API based upon its dependency on external APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Discovery Testing </strong>- Understanding the discoverability of an API as part of operations.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Usability Testing </strong>- Testing an API from the perspective of how usable it is to consumers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Behavioral Testing </strong>- Driving testing based upon external views of what is expected of the API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Acceptance Tests -</strong> Tested defined by the consumer based upon what is meaningful to them.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>End-to-End Testing</strong> - Testing the entire API stack from backend to front, and back again.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Contract Testing </strong>- Deriving specific business contracts for an API and testing them out.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Scenario Testing</strong> - Building tests that reflect specific business scenarios that are relied upon.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Workflow Testing</strong> - Another way to define a test for a series of API calls that reflect a business need.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Omni-Channel Tests </strong>- Testing out multiple channels of consumption like web, mobile, and devices.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Documentation Testing</strong> - Verifying that an API possess valid and up to date documentation.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Data-Driven Testing </strong>- Relying on data to define and drive the testing of each API.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Don&rsquo;t count on any of these descriptions being accurate. They are more about be trying to make sense of each one. I will be doing more research into what each of these mean to services and tooling providers, but I wanted to try and at least get all of them on the table, and try to squint and see if I could find any interesting patterns across them. There are a mix of personas, intentions, and perceptions about where the value and pain lie in the API stack present in this API testing vocabulary. Seeing all of these types of API testing really doesn&rsquo;t help me understand much, or be able to better articulate it to my readers and Postman customers. It really is just a dizzying amount of activity going on across this slice of the API universe.</p>
<h3>Considering API Governance as Part of API Testing</h3>
<p class="p1">Everything I have covered so far is about testing API instances. Making sure each individual is doing what it should be.However, over the last decade a new dimension of testing has emerged that isn&rsquo;t about testing each individual API and it&rsquo;s requests and responses, but testing the surface area of the API, making sure it is consistent with the overall organizational strategy or industry standards. API governance tends to focus on the design of each API, making sure they are consistently designed across teams, but there are a mix of dimensions that API governance looks that overlap with areas above. Here are some of the types of things being tested when it comes to API governance.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Specification</strong> - Is the specification provided for each API a valid representation of the spec.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Information</strong> - The naming, description, and details of an API, making sure they are sufficient.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Versioning</strong> - Making sure that each API is using the same approach to managing change.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Paths</strong> - Considering the overall design of available API paths available across all APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Requests</strong> - Ensuring that the structure of API requests are following a common set of patterns.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Responses</strong> - Ensuring the the structure of API response are following a common set of patterns.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Schema</strong> - Making sure the common schema are applied across requests and responses.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I can get finer grain on requests, responses, and other aspects of governance, but this provides a general set of what I&rsquo;ve seen when it comes to tangible API governance testing. The discipline of manual or automated API governance testing isn&rsquo;t as mature as other areas of API testing, but this will prove as a nice base for considering API governance as part of the overall API testing suite. The big difference with these types of tests is that you aren&rsquo;t testing the results of each API instance, you are testing the surface area of the API and comparing it against all the other APIs, and an organizational, or industry wide set of specifications and standards.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-fire-hydrant-water.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Considering How we Test API Operations</h3>
<p class="p1">Now I want to continue pushing the notion of we are testing. I want to imagine where API testing needs to go to continue stabilizing how we deliver APIs across an organization or an industry. This is the dimension of API testing that isn&rsquo;t about any single API, or about the design of all APIs, and more about the entire API operations. The overall quality and reliability of APIs aren&rsquo;t just about the APIs themselves, and is often about how APIs are delivered across their overall lifecycle, as well as the resources available to operate and support each one. You can have an API that passes all of its instance testing and overall governance, but if other aspects of API operations are falling short, it doesn&rsquo;t matter--here is what I am imagining testing looking like at the operational level.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Documentation</strong> - This is a duplicate from above, but I feel like belongs here and not in the list above.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Testing</strong> - Actually testing what testing is in place for each API, making sure APIs are consistently tested.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Having consistent approach to scheduling or automating testing across API operations.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Workspaces</strong> - Making sure all APIs possess a known workspace where everything about them can be found.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Discovery</strong> - Another one from above that I think belongs in the overall operational view of testing.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Management</strong> - Applying consistent authentication, plans, rate limiting, and reporting across all APIs.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are other dimensions of API operations I could advocate testing for, but this reflects the most important dimensions of what is happening across API operations today. You see two of these areas already reflected in the types of testing that I cam across studying API testing above. Each of these areas of operations possess infrastructure that have their own APIs, which also provide machine readable artifacts that can be tested. Either adding a 3rd layer to this API testing conversation, or as I see it, just another set of API tests that should be run, but can be categorized into separate buckets. Historically I have seen all of these things as different aspects of API Operations, but now I am beginning to see them as just a suite of different tests being run, that test each individual API instances, the surface area of all APIs, or testing using the infrastructure behind API Operations.</p>
<h3>Bringing a Little More Clarity to API Testing</h3>
<p class="p1">Obviously all of this is going to take a lot more work before I get it into a more coherent state. I am not confident in my understanding of all of the API testing types listed above, and I am sure that there are other ways that I want to be able to articulate governance and operational level API testing in better detail. I also want to think about the common patterns that exist across all of the existing types of testing before I move to far down the road. I see some like business value and who is testing, but I want more time to dive into each individual area and do more research, before I make any assumptions. Really I think the big revelation of this post for me is where the artifact we are testing originates, which is from one of these three locations:&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><strong>API Instance</strong> - Testing the request and response of a specific API instance.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>API Surface&nbsp; </strong>- Testing the design and surface area of each individual API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>API Operations -</strong> Testing the operations that exist around all APIs.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">I can envision different categories of tests existing across these three areas. I feel like next major dimensions of this conversation will be who is doing the testing, and the tangible business value associated with each test, or bundle of tests. I am also thinking that the delivery mechanisms for testing will heavily influence this conversation, providing a different set of realities if we are running tests manually, scheduling via a monitor or agent running in some cloud region, as part of a CI/CD pipeline, or some other event that gets triggered as part of API operations. I have a lot more research and thinking to do on this subject before I&rsquo;ll reach the levels of clarity I am looking for here, but this post really helped me get things rolling. Being able to see each of these dimensions of what we are testing has set in motion a whole other set of thoughts for me, depending on whether we are testing the API instance, surface, or operations.</p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-bed98a94-7fff-e873-5913-eb2d7c8fc0d2"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I love the word entropy. It means so many things to so many different people. In means different things in the physical realm versus the informational or virtual realms. It is one of those big words you can say to confuse people, or actually get yourself in trouble being able to actually defend your position on what entropy means when around smart people. It is said that famed mathematician John Von Neumann had told fellow mathematician and creator of Information Theory that he should use the word entropy instead of information because that no one understands entropy and then you can win arguments about your theory. I also read that Shannon and Norbert Weiner also dueled over the meaning, seeing it in very opposite ways. I like the word for all of these reasons, but mostly because of its relationship to uncertainty.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the realm of physics entropy means, a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system In the more virtual realm of information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information, surprise, or uncertainty inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. While I could easily use entropy as a metaphor for APIs in the physical sense, it is really the appropriation of it for information theory that really brings it home for me. Entropy in Shannon&rsquo;s time was centered around noise or static in communication, but when you look at how APIs enable communication between systems, and allowing web, mobile, device, and network applications to communicate, this static or noise reveals itself as friction, errors, outages, instability, unreliability, and misaligned business and political priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;Think about the level of information one encounters when it comes to putting APIs to work these days. Consider the surprise one encounters when seemingly similar API resources speak entirely different dialects or behave inconsistently. Stop to think about the amount of uncertainty that exists between each version of an API, let alone each version of an API across the increasing number of APIs your average organization depends upon today. The velocity at which an organization moves, or should be moving, considered alongside the velocity of each individual API being published or consumed, reveals the reality of API entropy on the ground within your average enterprise organization, as well as the industries in which they operate. When an API and resulting integration or application is brand new API entropy is usually relatively low, but as momentum increases, and the number of consumers increases, entropy will ultimately increase and contribute to the eventual decline of&nbsp; an API, the applications they power, and even platform that they operate on.</span></p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/nazi-invasion-seattle-public-market_36725946605_o.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>APIs work best where the cognitive load involved with putting them to work is low, where common patterns are employed, and predictability and reliability are high. The reduction of API entropy within API operations and communities can come in many forms. Popular API documentation tooling like Swagger UI, Slate, Postman, and Redoc help reduce API entropy by taming the information surrounding each API. API specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema help reduce API entropy by standardizing the surface area of each API and reducing it to a common vocabulary that an increasing number of developers, commercial services, and open source tooling are familiar with. OpenAPI forces API providers to reduce the information a consumer needs to digest when integrating with an API, and has the potential to reduce surprise and uncertainty throughout the life of each API, and the journey of each consumer putting it to work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When you also deliver APIs using common standards that are defined using open specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema, you further reduce API entropy across operations and within an industry. PSD2 defined using OpenAPI and JSON Schema reduces API entropy for banks, and across the European (and UK) financial sector. The CFPB in the United States considers the adoption of similar rules here in the US will further reduce entropy for banks and the financial sector on this side of the pond, but ultimately globally. FHIR defined using OpenAPI and JSON Schema will reduce API entropy for healthcare providers, and the entire healthcare sector in the United States. Something being driven by agencies like CMS, HHS, and the Department of Veterans Affairs through regulatory guidance and adoption of FHIR, while also actively using OpenAPI as part of their API lifecycle. We are seeing this play out in the travel, transportation and other leading sectors that are looking to reduce the resources it takes to deliver web, mobile, device, and other infrastructure, while also ensuring that enterprise organizations are more agile, nimble, and competitive, and the industries they operate in are more healthy, active, and interoperable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>API entropy is experienced as friction throughout the API lifecycle. High API entropy within business sectors that power our economy can be seen in the lack of access and interoperability between vendors, institutions, and government agencies. When you are down in the weeds of an organization API entropy just looks like API chaos, and from the position of someone who studies the 250K of how APIs are evolving, you begin to see API entropy as something similar to what is happening to our physical natural environment(s), something that long ago reach unsustainable levels, but is something that can be managed if more of us realize that we are all in this together, and get to work on more specifications, standards, and guidance, while centering our commercial services and open source tooling around these standards. Keeping API entropy low is needed to continue API growth and expansion at the current velocity, and will be something that slows the growth in key industries and large sections of our economy if we don&rsquo;t reduce the entropic pressure that exists across the API factory floor that first emerged in leading technology companies, but in the last decade has emerged within every mainstream company, organization, institution, and at all levels of government.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2021</span>
        
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/norman-rockwell-ruby-bridges-border-crossing-through-fence.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" />&lt;p&gt;I am preparing for the next version of APIs.json and I am taking another pass over what the specification is, but also taking a fresh look at why the specification exists. Part of this fresh look involves assessing what I consider to be the low bar for an APIs.json index, as well as what the entire scope might look like. To help me (and you) understand the scope of what <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> or <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yaml</a> can do when it comes to indexing our API operations and making them discoverable in a machine readable way.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember about APIs.json is that it is all about indexing API operations in a way that acknowledges that there are two sides of this API integration game which need to be indexed and made discoverable across an organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Readable</strong> - Providing URL references for the aspects of API Operations that human stakeholders will need to understand what is happening with APIs and how to put them to work in applications.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Readable</strong> - Providing URL references for aspects of API Operations that are system and applications can use to make sense of API Operations, accessing as a machine readable definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.json is about indexing all of these human and machine readable aspects of our API Operations with an emphasis on evolving human readable elements to also be machine readable so that as much of the surface area of our API operations is indexable by other systems and applications as possible.</p>
<p>There is another dimension of APIs.json as a specification that is helpful to understand beyond the human and machine readable elements, by providing a vocabulary for describing two separate scopes of API operations, helping define the scope of information provided.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> API Specific Properties</strong> - References to details about a specific API, providing human and machine readable details about an API, so that consumers understand everything that is possible.</li>
<li><strong>Common Properties </strong>- References to details that support all APIs being indexed, providing information about how to onboard with a platform, and understand what is possible across A?PIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to migrating human readable elements to be more machine readable, I’d say the goal in this dimension is all about standardizing our API operations across all of the APIs being made available, providing common set of resources across operations, while providing only what is needed to define the surface area of each individual API—helping be consistent in the business and technology of our API operations.</p>

<p>To demonstrate what is possible with APIs.json when it comes to indexing operations I want to have an example of what I’d consider to be the minimum viable example of what an API Operations might look like in the wild.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/0c8a3418bc5339dbc6714e2ab26a0474.js"></script>

<p>That represents what I’d like to see from all APIs, providing the minimal amount of details and operational resources that any API should possess, acknowledging that the API itself isn’t enough, and there will always be other supporting elements needed.</p>
<h3>An Example Minimum Viable APIs.yaml File</h3>
<p>Because there are many situations where having a YAML edition of the index for your API operations is preferred, here is an example of the same minimum viable document, but in a YAML format, allowing the index of APIs operations to remain machine readable, but also be a little more human readable at the same time.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/e62d3c1d7f4dec68bb0c5b2567043b2d.js"></script>

<p>This minimum viable example APIs.yaml provides the same baseline as the APIs.json move, providing a human and machine readable artifact that can act as a blueprint for how API providers can think about their operations, while then also providing an index that describes what is happening after the blueprint is followed.</p>
<h3>An Example Landscape APIs.json File</h3>
<p>Moving all the way to the other end of the spectrum, I wanted to demonstrate the full scope of APIs/.son or APIs.yaml, and the many different aspects of API operations I see across the existing API landscape. Providing a robust look at what an API index might contain when it comes to more mature API Operations.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/bb86a80caa06d4a66daa5db9afd0fdd6.js"></script>

<p>It is unlikely any single API operations would have all of these characteristics, but it does inform the most common aspects of API operations that are already being applied, as well as some advancements and forward looking properties that point to where we should be going with our API operations.</p>
<h3>An Example Landscape APIs.yaml File</h3>
<p>Similar to the MVP APIs.yaml, I also want to provide an APIs.yaml example of the full landscape index, showing how the full scope of API operations can be defined as YAML, helping make it more accessible to human and more specifically non-developer muggle types of humans.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/bf782ed888c5e782221692ea5699d383.js"></script>

<p>I have organized the specific API, as well as common API properties into logical groups, and named them so that they are self explanatory, helping articulate their purpose, so that I can assess the role they play in overall operations. Showing what all of the different properties of APIs operations might look like depending on the types of resources being made available via APIs.</p>
<h3>Indexing the API Operational Spectrum</h3>
<p>This set of artifacts helps me see the entire spectrum of API operations from not just a discovery perspective, but also as a checklist or blueprint for how API providers should be thinking about their operations. Like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema, APIs.json doesn’t just do API discovery, it helps you think more deeply about your API operations in a standardized way that will reflect other API operations, and is something that will be more familiar to API consumers. One of the reasons there is still so much chaos in the API space when it comes to API discovery, on-boarding, and other aspects of a speedy integration, is that we don’t have a common vocabulary for describing and communicating around our API pperations--Steve Wilmott and I intended on changing that.</p>
<p>I will use these two distinct APIs.json and APIs.yaml artifacts to help articulate what is possible with the specification, but also use to define the spectrum of the API landscape when it comes to how we should be publishing a suite of human and machine readable artifacts describing our operations, with a perpetual forward motion towards making our API operations more machine readable. I will use these artifacts to inform how I work to on-board new API [roviders to the concept of APIs.json, while also using it as a point of reference for where I’d like to be moving the conversation when it comes to API discovery across enterprise organizations as well as the industries they operate within. Leveraging APIs.json to index enterprise API operations, but then also provide the discoverability needed for the public and industry layers of our API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2021</span>
        
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/birth-of-a-nation-chess-in-the-park-with-pigeons.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am giving some much needed love to my <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yaml</a> and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">API.json</a> API discovery format while using the work to also just think about the wider API landscape. This is the original intent behind APIs.json&hellip;to help me make sense of the API landscape.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most folks are thinking about APIs as a producer, or as a consumer&mdash;hopefully both. However, there are fewer people who also pay attention to the entire API landscape, and APIs.json emerged out of this need for me in 2014. In 2020 I find myself totally immersed in the API landscape as part of my API Specification Toolbox project which grew out of Postman becoming a member of the OpenAPI Initiative, and I wanted toht spend why Saturday afternoon (I know I have a problem) thinking about the API landscape at the 250K.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>APIs.json API Property Types</h3>
<p>Using APIs.json or APIs.yaml you can define the properties of one or many APIs for a variety of purposes. Each API you describe can have an array of properties which can be common human readable elements like documentation or sign up, as well as machine readable properties like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or JSON Schema. APIs.json property types are intentionally human or machine readable with the intent on evolving every human readable element to have a machine readable element&mdash;think the relationship between documentation (Human) and OpenAPI (Machine) when understand the objective.</p>
<p>I have several thousand API Providers and API service providers in my API Evangelist database. I track on the properties of all of these companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies that I come across. When I group the property types across the thousands of APIs I have indexed, I end up with this default set of building blocks for API providers, grouped by different areas of the API lifecycle.</p>
<h3>Onboarding</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/birth-of-a-nation-escalator-close-in.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>These are the properties of any API operation that help consumers, or any other party onboard with the concept of an API, begin using the API, as well as allowing them to return on a regular basis to get what what they need for integration.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>About</strong> - The overview of what an API or provider offers to consumers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Getting Started</strong> - How you get started with actually consuming an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Authentication</strong> - What is involved with authenticating with an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Documentations</strong> - The human readable documentation for APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Plans</strong> - What the pricing, access, and rate limits are for each API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Signup</strong> - Where you sign up to actually begin using an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Login</strong> - How you login back into the platform for each API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Dashboard</strong> - The landing page for consumer after logging in.</li>
</ul>
<p>These API property types are essential to helping API consumers understand what is possible and assisting them in getting up and running with each API. As the number of APIs each of us depends on increases, friction at any of these areas might be the deciding factor for whether a consumer successfully onboards with an API or not.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>These are the common machine readable API specifications in use by API Providers, offering a suite of ways for API providers to define and communicate what their APIs actually deliver. Providing a common vocabulary for describing the surface area of our APIs in a way that can be used across every stop along the API life cycle. Here are the leading specifications that are defining each individual public, partner, or private API being delivered.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - The leading specification for describing HTTP 1.1 request and response, or REST APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>AsyncAPI</strong> - The leading specification for describing event and message driven multi protocol APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>JSON Schema </strong>- The default standard for how you define and validate each schema being used.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Postman Collections</strong> - A dominate format for executing and realizing what is possible with each individual API.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an industry we are doing well at providing machine readable definitions for each individual API instance, describing the surface area of each API, the payloads, and the technical details of integration and consumption. However, as I&rsquo;ll explore later, we are don&rsquo;t such a good job at ensuring all the building blocks of our API operations are machine as well as human readable&mdash;something APIs.json is looking to change.</p>
<h3>Developers</h3>
<p>When it comes to the more developer centered, and more technical aspects of APIs operations I see API providers offering, there are a handful of ways they are incentivizing developers to put their API resources to work. These are the most common technical building blocks of API operations I have captured over the last ten years of mapping out the API landscape.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>SDKs</strong> - Providing a complete list of SDKs available in every available programming language or popular platform.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>CLI</strong> - Offering up command line interface tooling for developers to use as part of integration and the CI/CD process.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Open Source</strong> - Having a dedicated page to showcasing the open source solutions that are available for developers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Github</strong> - Embracing the social coding platform Github when it comes to managing code and the relationship with developers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Applications</strong> - Providing a directory or showcase of applications that are built on top of an API, highlight what has been built.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Integrations</strong> - Offering up a ready to go suite of integrations with other APIs for consumers to put to use in a simple way.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Allowing web hooks to be triggered upon relevant events that occur across a platform, making APIs a two-way street.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the meat on the bones of successful API integrations. This is what developers and end uses depend on to successful put a platform to work. Currently APIs.json is just linking to each of these pages, providing a URL for a human to follow. You can describe web hooks using OpenAPI or AsyncAPI, but there will need to be a lot more evolution from human to machine readable in coming years if we are going to keeping scaling this Frankenstein of an API ecosystem we&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<h3>Change</h3>
<p>Change is inevitable in the API universe, and those who are better at communicating around change are almost always the ones who are better at managing it, while reducing the negative impact of change on API consumers. There are the handful of ways in which I see API Providers actively communicating about the change that is happening across their API-driven platforms.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Versioning</strong> - Providing all the information needed to understand the semantic, or other versioning applied to an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Road Map</strong> - Being more organized and communicative about defining where an API is headed, as far into the future as possible.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Change Log</strong> - Ensuring that everything that has changed with an API is documented, leaving a trail of everything that changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one area that will also have to get more machine readable if we are going to scale APIs to meet the demands of the global economy. We will have to learn to to programmatically navigate change if we are going to further automate integration. Applications will need to be equipped to make their own decision about which versions of an API they use. Ideally, there would be hypermedia baked into our API design to help mitigate against change, but alas that isn&rsquo;t always present. ;-)</p>
<h3>Communications</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/birth-of-a-nation-satellite-dishes-pointing-up.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Being able to communicate with consumers is one of the most vital characteristics of an API provider. If you aren&rsquo;t able to provide a regular stream of communication around of the value offered by an API, and able to keep consumers informed, you probably won&rsquo;t be very successful in operating an API. While these channels may shift when it comes to partner or internal APIs, the need for communication remains the same&mdash;here are the most common public API communication property types.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Newsletter</strong> - Providing a regular email newsletter about what is happening with an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Blog</strong> - Having an active blog with a feed for consumers to tune into around an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Twitter</strong> - Providing an active presence on Twitter, being social with the API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Having a professional presence for an API using LinkedIn.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Youtube</strong> - Publishing or aggregating videos around an API on Youtube.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Press</strong> - Providing an inventory of press regarding the business value of an API.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I like about this section is that every one of these API property types have APIs, except usually press. Blog have RSS and Atom, and Twitter, LInkedIn, and Youtube all have APIs. I have a wealth of other communication property types that I track on, but these reflect the most dominant channels that API Providers are using to deliver one side of the API feedback loop that is essential to an APIs success.</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>The other half of the API feedback loop is about ensuring you are adequately supporting your community and API consumers. There are a wealth of common as well as creative ways API Providers support their communities, but these are the top ways I am tracking on when I profile and index each API I track on.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>FAQ</strong> - A well defined and organize list of common questions and their appropriate answers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Email</strong> - Simply providing an email address for consumers to use when looking to get support.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Contact Form</strong> - A URL to the contact form to use for submitting support requests for an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Tickets</strong> - Allowing consumers to submit a support ticket and get help with API integration.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Issues</strong> - Using Github or other issue format to allow the public or private submission of issues.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Stack Overflow </strong>- Leveraging the popular Stack Overflow platform, outsourcing your support.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Forums</strong> - Operating your own forum to support the community around an API.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Status</strong> - Maintaining a 24/7 status of the uptime and availability of all APIs over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>These support centered property types complete the feedback loop for API Providers, processing everything &ldquo;heard&rdquo; from support and including it as part of the API road map, while then using it to informing the communication side of the feedback loop, establishing a virtuous cycle between provider and consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/birth-of-a-nation-docks-ships-cranes.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>You can always tell when an API provider has invested in their platform and community because there are always a wealth of resources available to support the community. These are the leading resources you will find in a modern API provider&rsquo;s community, further adding to the information available to put a platform to work.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Case Studies -</strong> Simple overviews of how a platform has been put to work by another consumer.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Tutorials</strong> - Easy tutorials that walk consumers through different aspects of how an API works.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Webinars</strong> - Live session educating consumers about what an APIs, with videos posted afterward.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Streams</strong> - Providing unscripted problem solving live streams that help demonstrate the value of an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Videos</strong> - Offering up videos on a variety of relevant aspects of what an API will do for consumers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Podcasts</strong> - Publishing or participating in audio podcasts that help relay what an API does for consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a look at Twilio if you want to see how to do API resources. All of these resources help educate consumers about what is possible, and help not just reduce friction when integrating with an API, but also helps when it comes to expanding the consumption of API resources by existing applications.</p>
<h3>Legal</h3>
<p>Now for the boring, but essential legal layer of API operations. These API property types have a profound effect on what is possible with an API, and while we have the beginnings of investment in the legal side of API operations, we have a lot of work to help make all of these API properties something a machine can understand.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> The legal terms of use / service that guide all usage of a platform.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Privacy Policy </strong>- How the privacy of developers and consumers are defining for a platform.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Licensing</strong> - The licensing that exists for data, backend code, the API definition, and client code.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Service Level Agreement -</strong> What the agreed upon SLA that exists between provider and consumer.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Security Policy </strong>- Being upfront regarding what the security practices and policies for an API are.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the area that is furthest out of view for most developers, and it is something that will continue to define the relationship between end-user, developers, and the provider. We are seeing significant contributions to the machine readability of licensing, SLA, and security side of API operations, but we need a lot more work when it comes to making sure the terms of service and privacy policies are something that can be processed programmatically.</p>
<p>I track on a couple hundred property types for API providers, but this reflects the cream off the top of the essential API operational characteristics. One of the most misunderstood aspects of APIs.json is that most people think it is for describing APIs, but it is really about describing API operations, providing a snapshot of the technology, business, and the politics of APIs. This list is defined by ten years of crawling, harvesting, and profiling APIs, studying what the healthy and not so healthy aspects of their API operations are. APIs.json has always been about mapping out this aspect of individual API operations, but more importantly entire business sectors, and the overall global API landscape&mdash;something I will be kicking into high gear by doing even more research on how the landscape is currently being mapped out using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema, while being realized at throughout the API lifecycle with Postman collections.</p>
<h3>Types of API Extensions</h3>
<p>The list of API property types for APIs.json has always been defined by how API providers are doing what they do to support their communities. Overlapping with this work, but emerging from a variety of OpenAPI focused projects I am working on, and stemming from me assuming my role as co-chair of the business governance board (BGB) for the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI), I find myself further studying the ways in which the OpenAPI specification is currently being extended. <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/toolbox/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anew-extensions">After looking through the OpenAPI extensions from 14 different providers</a> I was able to break down a short (ha!) list of the ways in which API Providers are extending the specification to meet their needs for each API, but also their needs across the entire API lifecycle. Here is the breakdown of OpenAPI extensions I found while doing the work to add them to the API Specification Toolbox.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/birth-of-a-nation-gears-pipes-plumbing.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>

</ul>
<p>I tried to organize all of these OpenAPI extensions into groups and failed, but I did manage to generalize them a bit. Some of the extensions were very specific, while others were very broad. It is definitely like looking at apples and oranges, but it does provides a rich look at how API providers are bending the OpenAPI specification to meet their operational needs. It is something that should definitely inform the OpenAPI road map, but for me, from the operational vantage point of APIs.json, I have a lot of questions about this list regarding where each extension should actually exist. Asking if each extension be part of each individual OpenAPI, or it should it be overlaid, or maybe just exist as part of some other looser coupling. I won&rsquo;t be able to answer these questions until I think more deeply about how each of these extensions apply to each individual API as well as across the lifecycle of the API. This list of extension is very OpenAPI centric, and I&rsquo;d like to put some more thought into whether this extension should also be applied in AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, or maybe a Postman collection&hellip;or maybe D) all the above, or E) none of the above.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>An API.json Index</h3>
<p>The easiest way to understand why we created the API.json specification is to think of each definition as an index of a publicly available API. A single machine readable index for Twilio, Twitter, or more revealing&mdash;Slack. Something that each API provider creates to define their API Operations, or something that is created by someone like me to index a single API, and entire industry or universe of APIs. However, when you when you start looking at all of the API extensions above you see elements that may also be defined by an API consumer, or for the benefit of an API consumer, and not the API provider. Pushing the purpose of an APIs.json and leveraging it as something that benefits both API provider and/or consumer. However, after profiling thousands of API using APIs.json I began to also see that a more robust and mature APIs.json for an API operations can also become a sort of blueprint, and something that can be used as a checklist for delivering and operating an API.</p>
<h3>An APIs.json Blueprint</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/birth-of-a-nation-city-skyline-bright.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>After you see more robust APIs.json indexes like from <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/twilio/blob/master/apis.json">Twilio</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/stripe/blob/master/apis.json">Stripe</a>&nbsp;you begin to see that they can become a blueprint for how to deliver APIs. If you just swap out the OpenAPI and Postman collections for each of the Twilio and Stripe APIs and add your own, you realize that have a blueprint that you can follow when operating your own API. This is all I have done with the APIs.json property types listed out above&mdash;I have defined APIs.json for thousands of APIs, then providing a distinct and grouped set of the most common property types applied by API providers. Adding the list of the API extensions to this list helps us further understand how API providers are not just operating their APIs on the ground on their API factory floors, it also reveals how they are trying to standardize how they do what they do, and more effectively communicate it using the OpenAPI specification.</p>
<h3>An APIs.json Orchestration</h3>
<p>Beyond defining existing APIs, as well as delivering new APIs that are consistent and possess all the properties needed for success, APIs.json can be used to define a suite of different APIs that are used as part of a larger orchestration or delivering web, mobile, device, and network applications. If I am defining a specific type of integration that utilizes a mix of different APIs, orchestrating across APIs one time or over a longer period of time via a scheduled or CI/CD actions, or delivering a specific type of application, it will benefit me to have everything articulated as a single APIs.json definition. Further pushing how not just APIs.json or APIs.yaml works, but demonstrate how multiple machine readable specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman collections can be used to orchestrate operations. Pushing all of these API specifications to work more like Terraform or Ansible, but for specifically defining the API landscape and API operations.</p>
<h3>Seeing the APIs Landscape Using APIs.json</h3>
<p>Assimilating all of the details I outlined above into a single coherent index, blueprint, orchestration, or other APIs.json definition will take a lot of work. However, I would like to take what I&rsquo;ve learned with this round of assessment of APIs.json property types, and research into current state of OpenAPI extensions and establish a base APIs.json definition that I could use as a lens for me to look at the both the world of APIs, but also the API specifications that are used to define that world. This APIs.json, or more specifically APIs.yaml file isn&rsquo;t meant to be a real world index, blueprint, orchestration or other type of definition, it is just meant to be a sort of API landscape toolbox for me to use as I make sense of the space today, and where it might be going.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/bf782ed888c5e782221692ea5699d383.js"></script>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t meant to describe a single API. It is unlikely any single API would or should possess all of these individual or common properties. This is just meant to be a snapshot what is possible when it comes to operating, consuming, and orchestrating with one or many APIs. It provides me with the scaffolding to process and lay each of the extensions I discovered above, helping me evaluate whether each of the individual extensions should indeed be augmenting the OpenAPI, or maybe the AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, or possibly stand on its own legs as an independent specification or overlay. I am looking to establish a more formal way for me to process extensions that I find across the API sector, as well as better understanding how services and tooling are using API specifications to do what they do.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I am not pulling all of this out of thin air.It is based upon mapping out the API landscape for over ten years--recording what I see. The OpenAPI extensions, and continued research into how API providers and service providers are extending the specification also reflects the realities on the ground across API operations. Additionally when you take into account that the infrastructure we use to design deploy, and manage APIs across the API lifecycle also have APIs, you begin to see how much of the machine readable meta data we need to fill out this APIs.json already exists, and all we need is a place to hang it. This isn&rsquo;t an artifact that you will be crafting by hand. It is one that we will have to rely on API service and tooling providers across the spectrum to output and publish for us.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I will pause there. Next I will begin to hang all of these extensions on this APIs.json scaffolding I have developed. I will need to add the bones of each of the existing machine readable APIs.json property types like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman collections. Then work my way through the OpenAPI extensions and evaluate whether they indeed should be hung within the OpenAPI, or possibly somewhere else. This is what I mean by being able to see the API landscape using APIs.json. It will help me more coherently be able to apply each individual extension, but instead of being siloed within the context of the OpenAPI namespace, I will be able to consider each of the extensions in a multi-protocol way, while also thinking about each stop along the API lifecycle in a single or multi-protocol way. Helping me better understand the API landscape, but also the current API specification landscape, and make more educated decisions around where I or we invest. Providing me with a more structured and disciplined approach to contributing to the API present and future.</p>

<p class="p1">The word &ldquo;open&rdquo; gets thrown around so much in the API space I find myself needing to regularly ground myself in what it actually means. It gets thrown around in so many different ways that I find eventually I start to believe the bullshit and regularly have to pause and recalibrate. It is one of those words that has been captured and used by people looking to manipulate the space so often it often means the exact opposite of what we all think it means, but it is also such an important word that I think we have to fight to keep it in our vocabulary. I feel like I am perpetually fighting with some invisible force over one of the front doors to the house we all live in, and I am determined for the door to not get completely shut, and I have to make sure the door actually ends up go where someone expects when they do open the door.</p>
<p class="p1">Let&rsquo;s begin by actually taking inventory regarding the many different ways people use the word &ldquo;open&rdquo; to describe the world of APIs. Gathering all the ways it gets wielded in service of publishing and consuming APIs. Some of the ways in which it gets wielded are good, and some of them are bad. At this point I am just looking to be able to see the spectrum of use, and I am not looking to entirely pass judgement on anyone who uses it in specific ways. Here is the laundry list of ways &ldquo;open&rdquo; is wielded that impact the landscape I pay attention to on a daily basis, and have been helping shape for the last decade.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><strong>Publicly Available </strong>- Open means something is available to anyone in the public, allowing them to use an API, and any resources around them.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><strong>Access</strong> - An API or supporting resource is open for access by the public or the developer community in general, making it something they can use.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><strong>Business</strong> - Stating that a digital resource is open for business, and consumers can purchase or be purchased in an ongoing way using an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><strong>Source</strong> - Focusing on the code behind or in front of an API, and acknowledging that APIs are built upon and evolved using open source code.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Specifications</strong> - Applying to API specifications like OpenAPI or OpenID, and ensuring that the specs we leverage across our APIs are always open.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Standards</strong> - Looking at specific industries and business sectors, and ensuring that the standards that are in place for industries are available openly.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Licensing</strong> - The word open is regularly applied to the legal side of the API world, which leverages the lawyers to loose up or tighten down the open screws.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Exploitation</strong> - Many APIs and the platforms they reside upon are open for exploitation, or possibly open to the exploitation of API consumers and end-users.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Discovery</strong>&nbsp;- Can I find the API? Is it easy to discover and explore for any potential consumer, and able to find via common, well-known channels.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Portal</strong>&nbsp;- Is the landing page or portal for the API accessible to the public, partners, or a private audience allowing them to learn about the API.</li>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-imperial-inn.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<li class="li1"><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- Is there complete, up to date API documentation for the API that is accessible, providing an honest and open view of what an API does..</li>

<li class="li1"><strong>Sign-Up Scope</strong>&nbsp;- How much information is required from developers to be able to get access to an API, or will I need to share my entire life story to get access.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Sign-Up Approval</strong>&nbsp;- Do developers have to wait for access and be approved before they can obtain keys to access, making open very subjective in reality.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with authentication, and is the technical bar set too high for some developers, compared with the digital resources.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;- Is an API intuitive, easy to understand, and accessible to everyone using it, or is it cryptic and hard to learn, and only understandable by a few.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Consistency</strong>&nbsp;- Are API patterns consistent across all APIs, alleviating extra work to put any of the APIs to work, or is each part some new to have to learn.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Rate Limits</strong>&nbsp;- What limitations are placed upon developers access to an API, limiting the usage of any individual API, putting full usage out of reach.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Rate Ceilings</strong>&nbsp;- Are there not just limits, but entire ceilings I cannot overcome at any point in development, rendering APIs not open to growth and scale.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Sandbox</strong>&nbsp;- Can developers access all APIs in a sandbox, so you do not have fear of only working with live data, restricting openness due to only a production state.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Status Codes&nbsp;</strong>- Are standard HTTP status codes returned allowing for understanding what each response means, leveraging the shared open meaning of the web.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Error Messages</strong>&nbsp;- Are there standardized and coherent error messages associated with each API, making things understandable, making failure more open.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;- Is there large periods of time when the API is not available for use within applications, leaving a platform only open during specific times.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Reliability</strong>&nbsp;- Is the availability of the APIs reliable, making it something developers can count on and put to use, and open in a reliable way across consumers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Performance</strong>&nbsp;- Is the API performant and something you can actually receive responses in an acceptable time frame, and open to operating at speed we need.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>API License</strong>&nbsp;- Is the interface for an API openly licensed so I can confidently integrate and use in my code, ensuring the surface area of the API is truly open.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Data License&nbsp;</strong>- Is data returned as part of API responses licensed in an open way allowing developers to use, keeping the data exhaust involved as open as possible.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Code License</strong>.- Are the cod made available as part of an API openly license for wide usage within applications, keeping backends and frontends as open as possible.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Tooling</strong> - Developers need to have access to the open source tooling they need to get their immediate job done, and meeting their day to day needs for this to work.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Usage Costs</strong>&nbsp;- Are the costs associated with usage of an API within reasonable ranges for developers, leaving it open to smaller players as well as larger ones.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Cost Increases&nbsp;</strong>- Are there regular cost increases that might move an API out of range of access, pushing the boundary for what is open out of range<span>&nbsp; </span>for some.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- Can I get access to support when it comes to accessing and using an API, and is a platform open to supporting it&rsquo;s consumers at the levels needed.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Communication&nbsp;</strong>- Is there anyone home behind an API helping communicate about what is happening, providing a regular open heartbeat for consumers to hear.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Feedback</strong> - Are API operators open to feedback, ensuring that consumer feedback is a regular part of API operations, leaving the road map open to feedback.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Road Map</strong>&nbsp;- Is there any visibility into what the future will hold when it comes to the development road map, providing more openness to what the future holds.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Ideas</strong> - Does a platform foster the open creation, development, and cross pollination of ideas across the platform between API publisher and consumer.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Censorship</strong>&nbsp;- Is data or content actively being filtered or censored as part of API operations, and open are the filters that are in place on API infrastructure.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Privacy</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a privacy policy in place that protects developers and their usage of an API, regulating how open individuals lives are when on a platform.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Terms of Service</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a TOS in place that governs the API, and what are the constraints in place, and how open is the language used for terms of service.</li>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-seattle-public-market_36725946605_o.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<li class="li1"><strong>Service Level Agreement</strong>&nbsp;- Are there any guarantees In place that govern the availability and costs associated with an API, being open about exceptions.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Regulations</strong> - The constraints of regulations will define how open or closed a specific business sector will be, setting the tone for open across APIs in that space.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Auditors</strong> - The transparency, openness, and observability of regulatory auditors will define each business sector being defined by the coming API regulations.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Investment</strong> - The accessibility of investment will continue to define the API space, opening up the building of the next generation of API instructor and applications.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This reflects the &ldquo;open&rdquo; knobs and dials that get used to control the open or closed nature of APIs we build and use each day. Open is a dance between provider and consumer and end-user when it comes to API, but also across providers and consumers within a specific sector or industry. In order for &ldquo;open&rdquo; to have meaning or not is about the trust that exists (or doesn&rsquo;t) within a space.<span>&nbsp;</span>How a platform dials things in along these lines will define how open or closed they are, and this playing out across all the players within a sector will determine how open or closed the entire industry is. Each of these knobs and dials will reduce or introduce friction across the API factory floor for an enterprise organization, as well as within the industries they operate within. It represents where we can individually make a difference, as well as collectively, to put the open in not just APIs, but also across every part of our world that is being touched by technology&mdash;which is pretty much everything.</p>
<p class="p1">Ironically &ldquo;open&rdquo; is not a boolean in the world of APIs. In my experience the APIs that declare themselves &ldquo;open&rdquo; usually aren&rsquo;t. However, I don&rsquo;t want this to bias me, and I want to still believe that when folks use the word they have the best intentions. I want people to feel like they can use it without being immediately suspect. However, I want people to understand that the usage of this word comes with responsibility. That you will have to prove yourself. That there is a certain amount of accountability required here. This includes myself. I like to use the word open to describe a significant portion of what I do in the API space. I am an open storyteller. I am an open evangelist. 75% of the APIs I develop I would call open. I believe in the importance of open in the API space. It is why all of this works. However, I also understand the importance of doing some things in a proprietary or closed way, as long as it is done deliberately and for the right reasons. I believe in the role that open APIs plays across all of these levels, but I also understand that open is just a reflection of what is closed. I don&rsquo;t see open as good nor bad. I see open as a meaningful way in which we can leverage the web to accomplish our individual and collective objectives and missions. I also am very skeptical of anytime open gets wielded, and will keep working to define what it means and doesn't mean as part of the API economy.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I looked at the 250K view of what is going on with APIs across federal government agencies in the United States. Since working for the Obama administration in 2013 I am perpetually on a quest to map out what is happening across federal agencies, helping drive the conversation forward. I belieive APIs can make the most impact when our federal government helps lead the way, and I am looking to help push things forward in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep mapping out the Federal Government API Landscape</strong> - I am determined to produce a map of the APIs that exist across federal agencies and keep the list alive and active.</li>
<li><strong>Establish Public API Workspaces for Federal Agencies -</strong> I am looking to establish public API workspaces for agencies who are implementing APIs--helping do some work from the outside-in.</li>
<li><strong>Refresh My Memory of What is Happening -</strong> I thrive on knowing what is going on across federal agencies, and doing these reviews pushes me to refresh my awarenss of APIs at this level.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Up new Conversations -</strong> These sotries always rise up in the SEO game and bring in new conversations with folks who are doing interesting things with APIs in government.</li>
</ul>
<p>I always learn a lot looking through the different government agencies. I learn even more wading through the different datasets, databases, and various incarnations of APIs. There is way too much work here than one person can handle, and much of what I come across labeled as an API really isn't an API, but could be with a little work. While doing these roundups I always reach a point where I feel like I am not doing enough, but ultimately I have to strike a balance between being comprehensive and just scratching the surface. Providing just enough information to allow me to plant seeds that might grow into new conversations down the road, while not spend all of my days sifting through the backwaters of federal government websites. This is my latest attempt to map out what is happenign with APIs across federal agencies in 2020, with some learnings and ongoing thought about what else can be done down below.</p>

<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or sometimes USEPA) is an agency of the U.S. federal government which was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress. The EPA was proposed by President Richard Nixon and began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the president and approved by Congress. The current administrator is Gina McCarthy. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.</p>

<p>This represents about two days worth of work, which is also upon some work I've done over the years. There are definitely more APIs out there that I couldn't easily catalog, but I've begun setting up workspaces to help me continue building on this work in an ongoing, community driven way. This sprint is just meant to get all of these federal agencies loaded up in my brain again, stir up thoughts about what is happening, and push me to propose some next steps for specific agencies, but also the overall API conversation. After doing this work here are a few of my thoughts about what is going on and what might come next.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth In APIs -</strong> There are definitely more APIs that when I last looked across agencies, and there are some agencies you can tell have embraced an API way of doing things.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of 404s -</strong> There are a lot of 404s when I look through legacy lists of APIs I was familiar with, and it can be tough to actually tell if there is anyone home behind some of the APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Templates Matter -</strong> The agencies who have provided portal templates, and open blueprints for publishing APIs makes a big difference, making their APIs much more consistent and usable.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger Usage Has Grown - </strong>There is a significant uptick in the usage of Swagger across agencies, including adoption of OpenAPI 3.0, demonstrating the value of the specifications across government APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Huge Data Opportunity (As Always) - </strong>I included a link to any agency's data landing page because some of them have APIs I may not have indexed yet, but also because they represent the API opportunity across data.</li>
<li><strong>Standardized API Management -</strong> The usage of API Umbrella by GSA and it's standardized usage across agencies has made an impact on working with APIs, and reduced friction when it comes to onboarding with APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I went into this work fairly depressed about what I might find at the close of the current administration, but I left fairly optimistic about the work that is going on across agencies. Don't get me wrong, the overall API conversation across federal government is still in a pretty sad state. There is a massive wealth of data resources available, but discovery and integration with these datasets are not at all standardized, and there are few of the affordances we often take for granted in the private sector. I always view federal government as being a minimum of 5-10 years beyond what is going on in the private sector, but we are going to need a huge amount of investment in APIs across federal agencies if they are going to play catch up, let alone begin to lead in the API conversation.</p>
<h3>Getting to Work on APIs Across Federal Agencies</h3>
<p>I could spend months profiling the APIs that exist across the agencies profiled above. I could spend 1000x that amount of time turning the data resources available across these federal agencies into APIs. I have begun setting up workspaces for the agencies who had Swagger and OpenAPI available, while also allowing me to begin reverse engineering some of the easier APIs using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo">Postman Interceptor</a> -- helping me create collections and OpenAPIs just by using an API. I will be spending time each week working within the public workspace fore each of the federal agencies and begin setting up new workspaces for some of the other agencies. I finally have the time, resources, and the platform to begin making a dent in this work. Historically I have been profiling APIs for federal agencies, but it was more just about bookmarking whatever I have found and organizing them into lists. Now, with Postman public workspaces I can conduct this work out in the open while also potentially sharing the load with the community, while getting more precise in how I define and map out each of the APIs using the Postman platform.</p>
<p>GitHub has made a massive impact on the federal government over the last decade and I am confident that Postman public workspaces are going to take the API conversation across federal agencies to similar levels. I can keep mapping out the APIs that exist, which is something I will keep doing, but I also want to provide resources to help the people doing the hard-work behind these APIs and datasets understand the benefits of publishing consistent, simple, and usable APIs by default. There is too much work out there for use to do after the fact, or from the outside-in. Ultimately we need the stewards of all of this valuable information to be API literate, understanding what is possible when we are publishing APIs in a consistent way, and help them get beyond talking about it, and actually doing it. It is extremely important that federal agencies not just do APIs across the board, but also be there to lead conversations. Similar to what we are seeing with the <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/fast-healthcare-interoperability-resources-fhir/overview">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a>. While there is still a huge amount of work to be done here, the API specification is finally seeing the type of industry wide adoption needed to make an impact on the healthcare space. We need to begin doing this for every other industry, helping stabilize and standardize the API conversation across all of the top business sectors. The most important investment our federal government can make in the next administration is to invest in API education and training across the board, taking the lead when it comes to the valuable resources our economy need to stay ahead of the curve.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">Sometimes I need to do bulk updates to Postman collections and there is no better way to automate this than to use a Postman Collection that uses the Postman API&mdash;inception level stuff, so be careful ;-). <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/collections/overview">I have setup a dedicated public workspace where I am building out these utility type operational level collections</a>&nbsp;that help me manage the API lifecycle out ahead of what the Postman GUI is capable of doing. Some of the things I am doing will eventually make its way to the Postman UI, but some of them will not. Either way, I am too impatient to wait, and one of the things I love about Postman is that I can hack my way forward through just about any situation using the Postman API.</p>
<p class="p1">Building on my base collection for pulling and updating collections, I added two differents requests that will help me capitalize the first letter of each word in a folder or request name of a collection.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/collections/request/35240-3d426d91-2654-459b-8827-66a80963e382">Apply Title Case to All Folder Names in a Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/collections/request/35240-b8905789-8a91-46d0-9dbc-9a93c9b687a6">Apply Title Case to All Request Names in a Collection</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">To run, all you have to do is make sure you&rsquo;ve entered a collection ID (pulled from URL or info tab), and hit run&mdash;it will loop through each folder and request and capitalize the words, and then save the collection using the Postman API. So you can immediately put to use the same collection with the changes you desired.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have any questions on the collection for pulling a collection and making changes using the Postman API, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the collection workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other collection related collections within this workspace. You can also fork the collection and use in your workspaces, and submit back any enhancements you&rsquo;d like to see as a pull request. If you have any questions that you don&rsquo;t want to see in the comments for the collection, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com"><span class="s1">info@apievangelist.com</span></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization">The Federal Trade Commission is sueing Facebook, alleging that they are illegally maintaining a monopoly on the personal social network space using a continued series of anticompetitive behavior</a>. The suit includes a coalition of attorneys general of 46 states, bringing the latest wave of regulatory scrutiny into the social media platform, highlighting three main dimensions of how Facebook has engaged in a systematic strategy of anticompetitive practices that has resulted in their current dominant position online.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Instagram</strong> - Facebook purchased Instagram to remove what they saw as one of the biggest threats they faced, while also purchasing market dominance in the image and photos sharing space.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp</strong> - Fsacebook purchased WhatsApp to remove what they saw as one of the biggest threats they faced, while also purchasing market dominance in the messaging space.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - Facebook used their API to cut off access to applications they saw as a threat, and to generally suffocate anything else they saw as a threat to their business model.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The anticompetitive nature of Facebook&rsquo;s Instagram and WhatsApp purchase isn't really in my wheelhouse, but how the API was used for anticompetitive activity most definitely is my speciality. I am happy to see the FTC finally elevate the abuse that has been going on at Facebook via it&rsquo;s APIs, not just because of the impact on the Facebook developer community, but more importantly the wider tech sector. Facebook&rsquo;s approach hurts wider competition across the tech sector, but also hurts the space API sector--ultimately giving APIs a bad reputation. To help me speak intelligently to what is occurring as part of the FTC&rsquo;s lawsuit, offer my advice on what a remedy might be, while also contributing to the future of regulation in the tech sector, I wanted to gather my thoughts in a post here on the blog.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Anticompetitive Conditioning Using The Facebook API</h3>
<p>The acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook to neutralize threats in two keys areas are a critical part of this filing and Facebook&rsquo;s strategy to dominate, but it is their API that has the biggest impact in suffocating out competition in the areas of photos and messaging, but every other dimension in which other companies can compete with Facebook via their own API. I think the FTC filing sums it up best in section 22 with the phrase &ldquo;anticompetitive conditioning&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>22. Anticompetitive Conditioning. In addition to its strategy of acquiring competitive threats to its personal social networking monopoly, Facebook has, over many years, announced and enforced anticompetitive conditions on access to its valuable platform interconnections, such as the application programming interfaces (&ldquo;APIs&rdquo;) that it makes available to third-party software applications.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This sums up the slow roll suffocation of competition that exists as part of the politics of APIs across not just Facebook, but also other leading platforms via their API ecosystems. Companies who view their API developer ecosystems as an asset use the API management layer of their APIs to incentivize developers, where companies like Facebook who have reached a size and scope where they view a significant portion of their API consumers as a threat will choose to engage in widespread anticompetitive conditioning via the management layer of their APIs.</p>
<h3>Removing Facebook API Access for the Competition</h3>
<p>The FTC filing focuses on the most overt and visible anticompetitive behavior from Facebook at the API layer, in particular the turning off of access to API consumers when they are viewed as a threat to their platform business. It is commonplace that API consumers have to register and obtain keys for access to API resources. This is a known aspect of API management, the API provider and consumer dance on Facebook and beyond, and it is common to revoke the API access keys of consumers who violate your terms of service. However, many API providers like Facebook also use this practice to &ldquo;condition the competition&rdquo;. The FTC filing focuses on two main consumers who Facebook cut off access, first in section 153 with Path.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>153. First, Facebook targeted promising apps that provided personal social networking. For example, Facebook took actions against a personal social networking competitor, Path, which was founded by a former Facebook manager. In or around April 2013, Facebook terminated Path&rsquo;s access to Facebook&rsquo;s APIs, and Path&rsquo;s growth subsequently slowed significantly.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>After Path, there was another high profile competitor (Twitter) that was moving into their territory, which the FTC filing outlined in section 155.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>155. Similarly, in January 2013, Facebook&rsquo;s Director of Platform Partnerships and Operations wrote to colleagues: &ldquo;[T]witter launched Vine today which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video. As part of their NUX [new user experience], you can find friends via FB. Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today. [W]e&rsquo;ve prepared reactive PR, and I will let Jana know our decision.&rdquo; Mr. Zuckerberg replied: &ldquo;[Y]up, go for it.&rdquo; By cutting off Vine, Facebook prevented it from accessing APIs that would have helped it grow.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Path and Vine were just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Facebook&rsquo;s campaign to cut off access to competitors when it came to their APIs, as the FTC filing outlines in section 156.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>156. The third group of targets were promising apps that offered mobile messaging services, that were existing competitors of Facebook Messenger, and that ultimately threatened to develop into competitive threats to Facebook Blue. Throughout 2013, Facebook blocked mobile messaging apps from using commercially significant APIs. For example, in August 2013, Facebook undertook an enforcement strike against a number of messaging apps simultaneously, with the Head of Developer Enforcement directing colleagues to restrict them from &ldquo;accessing any read APls beyond basic info[,</em>]&rdquo; instructing that &ldquo;we will not be communicating with the [developers] in any way about these restrictions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This reflects direct action taken by Facebook to snuff out the competition by removing access to their increasingly valuable resources by the competition. It becomes much more difficult to measure the indirect chilling effect all of this had on developers within the Facebook API ecosystem who would self-censor, and avoid developing applications that may get the attention of Facebook, even if they weren&rsquo;t directly competing with the giant. Sometimes you just didn&rsquo;t know if what you were building was emulating Facebook features and it would be better to just not build your application at all.</p>
<h3>Anticompetitive Tones Set By API Terms of Service</h3>
<p>The terms of service (TOS) for API platforms always set the tone for engagement between API provider and consumer, but it is something that Facebook has wielded with great success when it comes to their anticompetitive practices across their developer community. There are several consecutive sections of the FTC filing that highlight the chilling effects TOS changes have had to the Facebook developer ecosystem,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>138. From July 2011 until December 2018, Facebook publicly announced and imposed a set of anticompetitive conditions governing access to Facebook Platform.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>139. On July 27, 2011, Facebook introduced a new policy that &ldquo;Apps on Facebook may not integrate, link to, promote, distribute, or redirect to any app on any other competing social platform.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>141. Following that, Facebook imposed several other policies restricting app developers&rsquo; use of Facebook Platform, including Facebook APIs. Through these policies, Facebook used its control over APIs to deter and suppress competition.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>142. September 2012: no exporting data to competitor social networks. On September 12, 2012, Facebook introduced a new policy: &ldquo;Competing social networks: You [developers] may not use Facebook Platform to export user data into a competing social network without our permission[.]&rdquo;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>143. January 2013: no promotion / data export to any app that &ldquo;replicates a core Facebook product or service.&rdquo; On January 25, 2013, Facebook added a new condition to prevent developers from &ldquo;replicating core functionality&rdquo; (i.e., competing with Facebook), or assisting others who might do so: Reciprocity and Replicating core functionality: (a) Reciprocity: Facebook Platform enables developers to build personalized, social experiences via the Graph API and related APIs. If you use any Facebook APIs to build personalized or social experiences, you must also enable people to easily share their experiences back with people on Facebook. (b) Replicating core functionality: You may not use Facebook Platform to promote, or to export user data to, a product or service that replicates a core Facebook product or service without our permission. (Emphasis added.)</em></p>
<p>These types of TOS practices make for a very confusing environment within the Facebook developer ecosystem. As a developer using the API to develop an application you are faced with the task of trying to speculate on what constitutes a competing feature and what does not in a very fast moving sector. It also gives Facebook a pretty wide spectrum to choose from when it comes to determining which API consumers have violated their TOS, and which have not. Making for a pretty fraught relationship when it comes to building on the Facebook platform, and a pretty terrifying uphill battle when it comes to actually taking on the tech giant when it comes to any aspect of their current or future business.</p>
<h3>The Role APIs Have Played in Facebook&rsquo;s Dominance</h3>
<p>The FTC filing does a great job outlining the role that the API community has played in Facebook&rsquo;s evolution as a platform, and the role the platform plays in developing web and mobile applications across almost every business sector.&nbsp; As outlined in section 135 the API community was the vehicle for Facebook growth over the years and resulting dominance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>134. Further, third-party apps helped Facebook grow and provided other forms of value to Facebook by promoting Facebook around the internet, via the Facebook plug-ins and by directing social data, such as &ldquo;Likes,&rdquo; back to Facebook Blue. Since launching its Facebook Platform and Open Graph initiatives, Facebook has grown significantly, adding at least 150 million monthly users each year and serving over 2.7 billion monthly users worldwide today.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In the early years of Facebook, as with any platform, they needed their API developer community to build out new features, and deliver critical integrations with other platforms. But as the power of Facebook grew, it slowly, and then more rapidly began to assert the power it has over the trajectory of applications being developed by the community, as outlined in section 135.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>135. With the success of Facebook Platform, Facebook became important infrastructure for third-party apps and obtained immense power over apps&rsquo; developmental trajectories, competitive decision-making, and investment strategies.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Fully aware of it&rsquo;s increased power, and growing even more hungry for power, Facebook would begin to see innovation within its own community as a threat, rather than an asset as it had in earlier days. Weaponizing the very thing that had helped it grow from the tech giant it is today, eliminating anything it saw as a threat within its own community.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>151. Moreover, Facebook knew and expected that API access was sufficiently important to affect the incentives of developers and the developmental trajectories of their apps. Developers were incentivized to make decisions that would not jeopardize their access to Facebook&rsquo;s APIs. An internal Facebook slide deck dated January 2014 dealing with Facebook Platform policies directly acknowledged the importance of API access, asking whether Facebook was &ldquo;[c]omfortable altering / killing prospects of many startups[.]&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In the early days of any platform your API management layer is designed to secure your digital resources, requiring developers to register and obtain access keys before they can begin making API calls from their applications. API management is about striking a balance between API provider and consumer, agreeing to fair and equitable terms of service, as well as sometimes a price for providing access to digital resources and capabilities. It is how much of the growth we&rsquo;ve seen in Facebook, Twitter, and other leading platforms has been built out, but once a platform has seen enough growth, investment, and power accrue, there always seems to come a time where leaders begin to see the community as a threat--which is something Facebook has taken to entirely new levels.</p>
<h3>The Weaponization of API Change Management</h3>
<p>One of the greatest challenges any online platform or digital service will face comes in the form of managing change. Platform code and APIs are perpetually evolving, requiring some fairly advanced strategies for dealing with change using a well planned road map, while also actively addressing technical debt that accrues as part of legacy code that must be either evolved or deprecated. Version control is one way that platforms help manage and communicate change when it comes to making resources available via web APIs, helping manage the forward motion of a platform, while keeping API consumers moving along at the same speed. Change management is something Facebook has employed, but due to the overall tone being set by their leadership, they have also managed to weaponize something that is usually not so politically charged, as outlined in section 146.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>146. May 2014: Platform 3.0 launches. A new approach&mdash;dubbed Platform 3.0&mdash;launched on May 2, 2014. At that time, Facebook terminated all apps&rsquo; access to certain APIs, which included restricting third-party apps from accessing information about their users&rsquo; friends who were not already using that third-party app.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Major releases are not that unusual, but deprecating legacy resources and forcing developers to migrate to a major release is less common. Versioning and change management is something that is hard under any circumstance, requiring a great deal of communication between API provider and consumer. It is something that is often further balanced by giving developers an extended period of time to make a migration, before older APIs are deprecated. Facebook is notorious in the API industry for committing many of the sins that we collectively agree upon in the industry should be avoided when it comes to striking a balance in our API ecosystems.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Communication</strong> - Facebook long has a reputation of poor communication around it&rsquo;s releases, ensuring API consumers are prepared for the future, and are given enough time to evolve their integrations to keep pace with the removal of services. Communication is essential for helping keep an API developer community moving at the same pace as the platform, and is something that can easily be weaponized when it comes to keeping some partners informed of what is happening, while keeping others in the dark, making it difficult for competitors to keep up.</li>
<li><strong>Velocity</strong> - Mark Zuckerberg crafted the phrase, &ldquo;Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.&rdquo; This mantra is reflected in how they run their APIs, moving fast, making lots of changes, and quickly disposing of technical debt. This is something that makes it difficult for the API developer community to keep pace with, especially without proper communication and notification of what the future may hold.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking Changes </strong>- One of the core tenets of API development is that you do not introduce breaking changes in the design of your API with a release, unless it is deemed a major release (ie. 1.0, 2.0, 30). Again, Facebook is notorious for releasing mysterious breaking changes as part of their release process without much communication between why, breaking integrations along the way. When you are the one breaking things it is easy to make sure your applications and integrations keep up, but if you aren&rsquo;t, your applications are always going to be left behind and be unreliable.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecation</strong> - API providers have different views of how long you keep older versions of APIs around before you deprecate them. Google often gives 18 months, while others will support in perpetuity -- I believe Salesforce still supports many of its original APIs. However, Facebook regularly deprecates older versions of APIs shortly after the release of a newer version, giving developers months, weeks, or no notice before an API disappears, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/12/04/facebook-quietly-deprecates-the-audience-insight-api-used-to-automate/">as Facebook did with their Audience Insight API in 2017</a>, giving no heads up that the controversial API would disappear, something you won&rsquo;t find in their road map or change log -- it just went away after regulatory scrutiny.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to deal with change is how you remain competitive. Weaponizing change on your platform so that you can punish and introduce friction for competitors is how you unfairly stay ahead in a fast moving game. Facebook&rsquo;s anticompetitive practices were not limited to cutting off access to APIs, and setting an anticompetitive tone within the API community. It is also about weaponizing change and making it impossible for not just the competition to keep up, but also making it difficult for other application and integration developers to even get a foothold with their new and novel contributions to the market--something that hurts everyone, including Facebook.</p>
<h3>Finding a Remedy for Anticompetitive Behavior at the API Layer</h3>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s anticompetive behavior is not original. It is a common abuse amongst platforms, and something I&rsquo;ve seen and written about numerous times over the last decade. Facebook&rsquo;s sins can be also seen on Twitter,and other platforms whose business models rely on advertising, rather than subscription or more direct approaches to revenue. The stakes are always higher when a platform is built using user-generated content and monetized via eyeballs and engagement. These are always the platforms whose APIs are wide open in the early days, and become more locked down and exploitative once the value, importance, and investment increases. APIs are a great way to build a platform, while incrementally over time ensuring that all or most of the value flows in your direction, and exploiting developers and end-users for the labor needed to generate all of the value.</p>
<p>As stated by section 29 in the FTC filing, Facebook has been savvy in backing off or at least being more secretive about some of its anticompetitive practices, and even if there are repercussions for their acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, there is nothing stopping Facebook from continuing with their strategy, and finds ways to morph their anticompetive behavior by obfuscating it at the API layer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>29. Today, Facebook&rsquo;s course of conduct to unlawfully maintain its personal social networking monopoly continues, and must be enjoined. Facebook continues to hold and operate Instagram and WhatsApp, and continues to keep them positioned to provide a protective &ldquo;moat&rdquo; around its personal social networking monopoly. Facebook continues to look for competitive threats, and will seek to acquire them unless enjoined. Likewise, Facebook&rsquo;s imposition of anticompetitive conditions on APIs continued until suspended&mdash;at least for the time being&mdash;in the glare of attention from governments and regulators around the globe. Facebook will resume those policies or equivalent measures unless enjoined.</em></p>
<p>Facebook is in the business of constant evolution. It will keep morphing and evolving its strategy for dominating the personal social network, photo sharing, messaging, and any other dimensions it sees a key to its success. Facebook&rsquo;s API layer has been how the platform has done this in the past, and it will be key to how it does it in the future. APIs are how Salesforce, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and others have built their platforms, and it is how they, and other tech platforms deal with change, remain agile and nimble, and remain competitive in a digital landscape. To help make sense of this fast moving, ever changing digital landscape you have to use the same tools that these platforms are employing to make sense of what is happening. You have to employ the very same tooling Facebook and these providers are using to their advantage, tapping into the APIs, and more specifically the API management layer that already exists to begin stabilizing the Internet using regulation in the same ways we stabilized energy, telecommunication, automobile, and other critical industries our economy and society depends upon.</p>
<h3>A Quick Primer on API Management</h3>
<p>The infrastructure Facebook uses to manage developer access to their APIs is widely known as API management infrastructure across the tech sector. API management began as a formal approach to managing API consumption in 2006 with the introduction of a startup called Mashery, which was eventually sold to Intel, and then to Tibco. Shortly after Mashery launched a wave of API management providers emerged to help companies secure and manage APIs at scale. After some consolidation of API management providers by 2015, API management has quickly become something that is baked into the fabric of the cloud, and is a fundamental offering on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure, Google, IBM, and other cloud infrastructure platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API management is how you secure your digital assets and capabilities as an enterprise organization. It is how you strike a balance between making these resources accessible on the Internet and being able to retain control over who has access to these resources and the value that is generated around them. API management is defined by a couple of key features that you will find played a key role in shaping Facebook&rsquo;s anticompetitive strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Accounts</strong> - Every developer is required to signup for an account if they expect to have access to an API, providing a minimum of name and email before they can gain access to any valuable API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Every developer is required to submit a definition of their application, providing a name and description of its purpose at a minimum, outlining what each developer will be building on top of an API.</li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong> - Once an account and application is approved, a set of keys are issued to a developer. These keys must accompany every request made to an API, providing essentially a user and password that authenticates a user, but also can be used to aggregate and report of usage by each developer.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Plans</strong> - APIs can be organized into different access tiers or plans by the API provider. Providing a way to standardize access to digital resources and capabilities by different groups of API consumers. Defining what can be accessed by consumers, and what the business model (or lack of one) that will exist as part of the agreement between API provider and consumer.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong> - All API access is rate limited, allowing consumers to only access what their plan or access tier will allow. Ensuring that API consumers don&rsquo;t overuse and abuse access to digital resources, without it being in alignment with the platform's goals, while also protecting end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong> - All API calls are logged, including the API consumers keys used to make each call, and the fingerprint of the application behind the consumption. Keeping a record of every call made to each API, and the consumer application behind each request.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong> - API management is all about providing awareness of who is accessing what API resources, allowing both the API provider and in some cases the API consumer a dashboard of how APIs are being put to use, which resources are being access, and a whole range of other data points that are gathered on a regular basis as part of API operations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>API management isn&rsquo;t some new technological trend. It is a fundamental part of the cloud and how digital resources are made available in web, mobile, and device applications today. It is how digital resources are made available, while also keeping API consumers honest about how they are putting digital resources to work in their applications. API management quantifies and helps us visualize the value that is generated via platforms, measuring API activity in real time. API management is used to strike a balance with your API developer ecosystem, keeping a platform growing and evolving. It can also, as Facebook has demonstrated, be used to identify threats within your own ecosystem, then shut down or at least introduce friction into the applications you feel are a threat to your operations, making API management where you pull the knobs and levers of your anticompetitive digital strategy.</p>
<h3>API Management Driving Anticompetitive Behavior</h3>
<p>I have been studying APIs and API management for a decade now. I have seen this layer of platforms be used in many creative and innovative ways. I have also seen this layer of platforms be used in many anticompetitive ways. The API management layer is how Facebook sees the threats that exist on it&rsquo;s own platform, and ultimately how it punishes it&rsquo;s competitors. The API management layer is how Facebook requires API consumers to agree with it&rsquo;s terms of service, and how it enforces it&rsquo;s TOS. It is where Facebook decides to deprecate older versions of it&rsquo;s APIs, while forcing everyone to migrate to newer versions. The API management layer is how, as the FTC filing states, Facebook is applying the anticompetitive conditioning portion of their business strategy. While the acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp are the most visible outcomes of Facebook&rsquo;s anti competitive strategy, the API management layer is where most of this behavior is playing out, and it where it will continue to morph and shape shift its strategy in coming years.</p>
<h3>Lack of Observability Around API Access Onboarding</h3>
<p>Facebook knows exactly how many developers it has access to their APIs. They also know exactly how many applications are accessing their APIs. The wider Facebook community, and government entities have no visibility into who does or does not have access to Facebook resources and capabilities via their APIs. There is no official accounting of who uses Facebook APIs outside of Facebook, helping shine a light on which countries applications operate in, what industries they are applied to, or any other insights about what the landscape, let alone the competitive landscape looks like across the Facebook ecosystem. All of this information exists at the API management layer within Facebook, it is just that there is no motivation for Facebook to share this information with the public, or with regulatory authorities.</p>
<h3>Lack of Observability Around API Access Termination</h3>
<p>Like onboarding with APIs, there is no observability into who gets their access to the Facebook APIs terminated. There is no accounting of who was terminated or why. All of this information exists at the API management layer at Facebook, but there is no incentive for Facebook to share this publicly or with regulators. There is no official accounting of who loses access to Facebook API, or whether or not this termination was justified or fair. There is no due process or official approach to contesting your loss of access to Facebook APIs. It is completely up to Facebook to terminate, and up to them whether they want to provide a reason, or whether the reason was honest and fully communicated. The API management layer provides us with everything we need to quantify whether Facebook, or any other platform is being fair and balanced in the termination of access to their APIs, we just need the will to make it available.</p>
<h3>Observable Regulatory API Management as a Remedy</h3>
<p>The answers we are looking for to help us understand in an ongoing way if Facebook, or other platforms are engaging in anticompetitive practices via their platforms exists today within the API management layer. The only thing lacking is that platforms are not compelled to make the outputs of their API management layer observable by outside interests. <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">There is a precedent in the United Kingdom for a more observable regulatory version of API management, within the banking industry </a>The UK government mandated that all banks adopt a set of standardized APIs across common resources like ATM locators, bank account, and credit card APIs, while also participating in an API management layer that is operated by a neutral entity, which brings the following elements to the regulatory table.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>API Definitions </strong>- Providing the definitions for each of the digital resources and capabilities being made available via APIs, so that which APIs are made available, as well as each version, are agreed upon in the interest of everyone involved.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts</strong> - API account signup and login are managed by a neutral authority, providing observability into who all of the actors are, as well as who onboards or is terminated as part of the regular goings on across the API ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - The authentication by developers with APIs is handled using a common set of industry standards as defined by the neutral entity, ensuring that all access is secured using common standards, and consistently applied across all APIs being regulated.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - A directory of all API consumers is available, making a subset, as well as summary data available publicly, but also providing discoverability to regulators and other government stakeholders when it comes to defining the landscape of an API community.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - The API management layer is standardized and externalized as part of the regulation of APIs. Each API provider, banks in this case, are required to implement the management layer as part of their operations, but the definition and oversight of what is API management is agreed upon and reported upon by the central body.</li>
<li><strong>Dispute Resolution </strong>- When API access is terminated, or other challenges arise within the API ecosystems, the central body provides dispute resolution between the provider and consumer, helping bring observability but also standardization and fairness to the discussion around termination or continuing the access to API resources by applications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>API management provides us with many of the controls we need to put in place to help regulate the API access to digital resources and capabilities--it is how leading platforms have gotten where they are. We also have a precedent for how this ubiquitous approach to managing APIs can be externalized and run in a neutral way through a public and private sector partnership. We have the makings for a pretty straightforward approach for helping prevent Facebook from engaging in the same anticompetitive behavior they have been engaged in for the last decade--we just need the will to properly begin regulating the tech industry using their own infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Adding a Government Access Plan to API Management</h3>
<p>API management service providers deliver their API provider customers with a dashboard, and ironically, API access to this layer of their infrastructure. Meaning there is an API for accessing the logs behind who is accessing APIs. There is no reason that a regulatory access tier could be added to the API management layer by default, providing a summary of what is going on across a platform. This can be done in a way that protects the intellectual property of a platform like Facebook, as well as the privacy of end-users. It can be done in a way that doesn&rsquo;t impact the performance of applications, or introduces friction into the already challenging work API developers encounter each day. All of the answers the FTC seeks to understand if Facebook is continuing to engage in anticompetitive behavior already exists, we just lack the API management plan to give them the access they need.</p>
<h3>Adding a Researcher Access Plan to API Management</h3>
<p>Facebook is going to continue to innovate, move fast, and break things when it comes to their platform, and API ecosystem. The company has made it clear they have very little interest in changing their behavior, and have only gotten better at apologizing and obfuscating along the way to stay off the radar of regulators. Even if regulators did impose a more observable approach to API management, Facebook is going to continue to innovate in how they reward partners and punish competitors when it comes to doing business on their platform. The pace and speed at which Facebook and other platforms move it will be also necessary to mandate a research plan at the API management layer where approved researchers can gain access to platform wide digital resources access and usage at the API management layer. Allowing researchers from universities and other institutions to come in and help quantify and make sense of what is happening in real time, helping bring operations into focus, while also helping regulators keep pace with Facebook and their strategy. Providing a secure, observable way to make sense of what is going on in real-time, helping minimize future abuse.</p>
<h3>All Access to Digital Resources and Capabilities Go Through APIs</h3>
<p>The first thing any tech person in the know will say to everything I have laid out is that Facebook will just route access to digital resources and capabilities outside the view of API management. Providing direct database and system access to trust partners, applications, integrations, and ensuring that only above the board activity shows up with the API management layer. Fair enough. Then Facebook should be required to route ALL external access to their digital resources and capabilities through their APIs. APIs are already the preferred approach of platforms when it comes to moving digital bits around, and making them available to partners--there is no technical or business argument for stating that APIs can&rsquo;t be used. Platforms will make claims that APIs will slow things down, but there are plenty of high speed solutions available in the API toolbox, and API management can be done without injecting latency into API activity at any scale. Again, we have what we need to solve this problem, we just need the will to mandate that observably managed APIs become the normal mode of doing business today.</p>
<h3>Solving Platform Illnesses Beyond Just Anticompetitive Practices</h3>
<p>While outside the scope of this FTC filing, the adoption of regulatory practices at the API management layer would have wider implications when it comes to addressing some of the illnesses that plague our online world today. Having a more observable API management layer would help address a couple of the top concerns we have when it comes to depending on platforms like Facebook.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Data Exploitation</strong> - An observable, regulated API management layer would help reveal the type data exploitation of end users as we saw in the Cambridge Analytic scandal. To conduct it&rsquo;s questionnaires and obtain access to the data of Facebook users, Cambridge Analytica had to sign up for API access, and provide a reason for their application. There is also an accounting of the number of OAuth tokens their applications would accrue every time a Facebook user provided access to Cambridge Analytica. The problem is Facebook wasn&rsquo;t interested in punishing this type of behavior in the moment, until it became a problem for them. With a more observable API manamange layer, regulators and researchers could help identify these problems as they emerge, as opposed to willfully being blind as Facebook was because they were more concerned with their anticompetitive strategy, than they were with protecting end users.</li>
<li><strong>Breaches</strong> - If all digital resources are routed through APIs, and all API access is managed in a standard and observable way, the chances of a breach will be much lower. Breaches often occur via custom, unmaintained, and legacy infrastructure. If all applications and integrations are forced to go through a standardized API layer, possessing a standardized API management layer, situations like the Cambridge Analytica abuse which technically wasn&rsquo;t a breach (but it was), and other malicious activity can be identified and addressed, even if it isn&rsquo;t a priority of the platform provider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Modern API management infrastructure has been proven to help standardize and streamline how data, content, media, algorithms, and infrastructure can be securely made available online. APIs are behind every major shift of the last twenty years, and are at the heart of how Facebook rose to dominance, and executed their anticompetitive strategy. Leveraging these approaches to managing APIs would help in ensuring personal social networking, photos, messaging, and every other area of our online lives that Facebook touches enjoy healthy competition--which we all can agree will be better for everyone involved.</p>
<h3>Now Is the Time for Sensible, Observable Regulation of Technology Using APIs</h3>
<p>I know that I am going to upset many people I know in the tech industry with this post. It is unforgivable in many libertarian corners of the tech sector to call for regulation of our industry. I disagree. Now is the time. If you look at other transformative industries like electricity, telecommunications, and transportation, which all were heavily technology driven, regulations have played an important role in not just taming and controlling industry, but also made them safer and more accessible for everyone. More importantly, it laid a more solid foundation for these industries to grow way beyond what their early entrepreneurs or investors envisioned. I am guessing that all of these people on the ground floors of these industries claimed the same thing in the early days of regulation of electricity, phones, and automobiles. Wildly missing the scope of how these technological advances impact our lives, and the role that government would play in actually making these the world changing industries they are today.</p>
<p>I am writing this post, not because I believe in regulation, or hate Facebook. I am writing this because I believe in the potential of APIs when they are done in a balanced and observable way. I have witnessed APIs invade and alter almost every aspect of our now online, but also our offline lives over the last twenty years. I could see the potential of APIs when it came to commerce, social, cloud, mobile, and other major recent shifts in how our world works by 2010. But, by 2015 I was witnessing some pretty alarming behavior by leading API providers like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others. To the point where I am pretty embarrassed by helping be a spokesperson of this industry. I am not trying to stick it to the tech sector with this suggestion that we use APIs and API management to regulate things. I am trying to take back the positive outcomes of using APIs from the greedy clutches of a few short sighted technology platforms. Ultimately I am convinced that there is even more money to be made, and even more innovation to occur, if we get down to the business of installing sensible regulation for the technology sector, and in my opinion, APIs are the key to getting it done. I am not under any delusion that this will be a quick fix for all that ails us, and I am pretty sure that initial legislation will not be sufficient. Not because we don&rsquo;t have the right tools in our toolbox, but because of the lack of will and understanding among politicians, and the control the tech sector has over our government. However, this won&rsquo;t stop me from trying, and I am guessing, based upon my experience so far in working with folks in DC, that I will be writing many more of these posts over the years, and working with waves of lawmakers wishing to make any change, until we reach a point where we can balance things back out a little bit, and wrestle back control from the tech platforms who dominate our lives today.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/bf-skinner-thinking-man-statue.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been neck deep in the release of <a href="https://blog.postman.com/introducing-postman-public-workspaces/">Postman public workspaces</a> lately. So much so, I haven't had much time to gather my thoughts about what exactly they are, and why they matter. Time for a burst of storytelling to help me make sense of just what is a public APIi workspace. One of the most common responses I've heard from folks that I talk with about public workspaces is that they are most comparable to a public GitHub repository, but designed just for APIs. Fair enough. While I see Postman public workspaces as much more than a Github public repository, it provides a great place to start when it comes to helping folks understand the potential. To help me be more articulate when it comes to speaking about why public workspaces matter, let me compare them to public repositories, and speak of the impact that GitHub has had on my reality, as well as on the wider API community.</p>
<h3>GitHub Changed My Life</h3>
<p>I have been using Github since 2010, but beginning in 2014 I began operating a significant portion of my API operations via GitHub. I ran all of my public presence there from 2014 through 2020, and I still regularly use it as a base for many API projects, and for publishing JSON and YAML files. In the last year I have pulled back much of my web presence for API Evangelist back from Github, but I still depend on it for most of my projects for the following reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong> - It is free to publish repos to Github, making it a pretty sweet place to publish APIs, schema, JSON, YAML, code, and other artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong> - The network effect of Github is huge. Developers get it, and the access and discoverability that comes with the platform are worth it.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - The social layer GitHub added to Git is really what makes the platform as powerful as it is, making things more collaborative by default.</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong> = Github is designed to be the source for code, but it works just as well for OpenAPIs, JSON Schema, and other artifacts you are managing.</li>
<li><strong>README</strong> - The readme for each repository provides a great hello world for each idea and project, allowing everything to be born as a repo.</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong> - I use Github issues for everything! It is how I aggregate tasks, features, bugs, and engage with people via the hundreds of repos ii have.</li>
<li><strong>Pages</strong> - Github Pages combined with Jekyll has transformed how I publish data-driven websites, dashboards, and tools for others to use.</li>
<li><strong>SEO</strong> - Early on GitHub repos didn't index well, but eventually it became better to publish things to Github than it was to your own properties.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Github changed my life. Github is how I built API Evangelist. Github is how I made sense of the API lifecycle. All my ideas for the last five years have been born and raised as a Github repository. Repositories provided me with a standardized, yet extensible way to define and move forward an API. A repo, combined with Github Pages, Jekyll, and powered by the Github API gave me a robust platform that provided me with about 60% of what I needed to manage my API operations. Github was the factory floor of my API operation, as well as the public performance of those operations. It is not an understatement to say that Github changed my life&mdash;it did.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Comparing Postman Public Workspaces to GitHub Public Repositories</h3>
<p>Github gave me a pretty extensible base for my API operations, but I found myself always hacking at the edges of what the platform could do to actually deliver what I needed. I had a lot of custom code running on AWS that was required to automate and orchestrate the API factory floor I was operating on Github. This comparison between Postman public workspaces and Github public repositories provides a good starting point for many conversations, but will quickly fall short when it comes to actually describing what is possible. Yes, public workspaces are publicly available like public repositories, and you can store and collaborate around artifacts, but Github was designed for developing open source software and Postman is designed explicitly for APIs. Providing a much more powerful set of tools that help you define the factory floor of your API operations, with each workspace possessing the following resources.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>APIs</strong> - Defining APIs using Swagger, OpenAPI, GraphQL, and RAML, providing the contracts for each of the APIs you are providing or consuming as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Collections</strong> - Developing and generating collections of API requests which may or may not be defined by OpenAPI contracts, and used across the API lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Environments</strong> - Defining different sets of key / value pairs that provide variables that can be applied across collections, applied to authentication and other needs.</li>
<li><strong>Mock Servers </strong>- Generating mock servers from collections, providing mocks of APIs that can be used to design, develop, and testing of APIs across operations.</li>
<li><strong>Monitors</strong> - Allowing for the running of collections on a schedule via different cloud regions, executing collections across the API lifecycle to automate operations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I can store OpenAPIs, collections, and other artifacts on Github, but it doesn't provide me with the ability to execute and iterate upon the purpose of each of those artifacts. GIthub provided us with a number of things that help us change how we deliver software, by opening things up, making things more social and collaborative. There is definitely an essence of Github repos present in Postman workspaces, but we are taking what we've learned about optimizing the software development lifecycle, and community aspects of the open source world, but then applying them the next generation of the API lifecycle, which in turn will continue to define how we deliver software applications. To understand the implications of these API centered resources available within Postman public workspaces, it helps to walk through a handful of use cases for public API workspaces, and see them in action.</p>
<h3>API Provider Public Presence Workspace - Salesforce</h3>
<p>Like with the Postman public API network, the first place people will go when thinking of a public API workspace will be providing a place for public API providers like Salesforce to publish their APIs, collections, and engage with their consumers. While there is just a lone collection in <a href="https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/workspace/salesforce-developers/overview">this official Salesforce public workspace</a>, I think it represents how we'll see most API providers begin their public API workspace journey.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/workspace/salesforce-developers/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/salesforce-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>One of the things our partners are dealing with in their own way is how complete, ready, or polished a workspace needs to be. With some of them realizing that it is first and foremost a workspace, which means it will be a place to do the work to complete, ready, and polish the APIs, collections, and other moving parts of a public workspace. Realizing that iit is a journey, and you are best to just get something stood up, then spend the time polishing what is happening using the feedback from your community--not opting for the perfect workspace.</p>
<h3>API Provider Public Support Workspace - Dropbox</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/dropbox-api/workspace/dropbox-public-workspace/overview">Dropbox has also published a public workspace</a> under their team page, but they have applied a different level of prioritization when it comes to what they are publishing to the Postman network, but also to their workspace. In the Dropbox public workspace you'll find a single collection designed for supporting Dropbox admins, helping automate some of the most common support requests from their admin API consumers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/dropbox-api/workspace/dropbox-public-workspace/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/dropbox-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>This reflects where I think that API providers should be headed with their API collections as well as public workspaces. Every API provider should start by publishing an OpenAPI and/or a reference collection for all of their APIs, but then quickly get to work on collections that put their APIs to work to solve real world business problems. I think the Dropbox approach demonstrates the diversity that will exist even amongst this most common definition of what a public workspace i'll be for an API provider.</p>
<h3>API Blueprint Public Workspace - Products</h3>
<p>When I first got the ability to publish a public workspace I immediately thought about being able to use demos, webinars, and workshops to show people how to build APIs. I have one private workspace that you will see me use in all of my demos to demonstrate an API-first lifecycle, and the potential of Postman as an API development tool--a reference implementation for a simple product API. <a href="https://www.postman.com/cs-demo/workspace/products-api-blueprint/overview">Something I made sure to fire up as a public workspace</a>, showing one possible way to develop APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/cs-demo/workspace/products-api-blueprint/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/products-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I feel like this is the type of workspace that will have the greatest impact on the API community, but I am a little biased towards workspaces being educational. Regardless, I plan on publishing a variety of these types of public workspaces to demonstrate how someone can approach the API lifecycle in a more structured and consistent way using Postman public workspaces, using OpenAPI, collections, and other key Postman platform resources.</p>
<h3>Industry API Standards Public Workspace - UK Public Banking</h3>
<p>One project I am working with our runtime partner <a href="https://apimetrics.io/">APIMetrics</a> on is showcasing how API regulation is being applied in the United Kingdom to make banks more transparent, observable, and consistent. Resulting in a <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/uk-public-banking/overview">UK public banking API workspace</a> with a handful of OpenAPIs and collections for a handful of the public APIs in which the UK government mandates all banks possess.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/uk-public-banking/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/uk-bank-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>This type of API workspace demonstrates how APIs can be standardized to help drive a specific industry. Showing how one OpenAPI can be used in conjunction with Postman collections to move forward the design of APIs, but also move them forward across the API lifecycle, and demonstrate how they can be applied across multiple API providers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Industry API Standards Public Workspace - FHIR API Specification</h3>
<p>Continuing to build on this type of industry public API workspace for defining an API that can be used by many API providers, I fired up <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/fast-healthcare-interoperability-resources-fhir">a public API workspace</a> for the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a> API. With this workspace I am looking to demonstrate how a workspace can be used to move forward an industry wide standard for the healthcare space, while also showing it in action with documentation, mock servers, and suite of testing to validate the instance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/fast-healthcare-interoperability-resources-fhir"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/fhir-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>The FHIR API specification is one of the most important API specifications out there right now. You can see this API being applied as part of the <a href="https://developer.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) APIs</a>, as well as <a href="https://bluebutton.cms.gov/">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Blue Button APIs</a>. LIke many of the workspaces listed here, there is a lot of work needed on this OpenAPI, it's collection(s), examples, and other moving parts of demonstrating what is possible with the API.</p>
<h3>Municipal API Standards Public Workspace - 211</h3>
<p>Following a similar approach to the UK banking and FHIR API public workspaces, next up is the Human Services Data API (HSDA) which is used to deliver 211 services within cities. Helping make human services across the community accessible by those who need it to deliver a variety of web and mobile applications. I am the technical lead on the HSDA API, and will be using <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/open-referral-human-services-data-api-hsda/overview">this workspace to move forward the specification</a>, while demonstrating what is possible with the API.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/open-referral-human-services-data-api-hsda/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/211-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>HSDA is a pretty critical API for helping ensure our communities are healthy and liveable. Ensuring that critical organizations, locations, and services are accessible by citizens within a community. Providing a common interface that can be used within a single community, but also used to harmonize web and mobile applications across many different cities.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Municipal API Standards Public Workspace - 311</h3>
<p>Complimenting the HSDA 211 API above is the same but for 311 services, helping provide a common API that communities can use to engage with the community around the reporting and servicing of non emergency events that occur across a community. Adding to the stack of API standards that municipalities can use to effectively manage a city and all of the goings on across them each day via a <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/open311/overview">311 public workspace</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/open311/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/311-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I am working with the technical lead, and other stakeholders of the 311 standard to move the specification forward, showcase the cities that have embraced the standard, and demonstrate what the potential is when you put this API standard to work. Both the 211 and 311 API standards provide us pretty solid examples of the importance that APIs and public API workspaces can play in making our lives more livable.</p>
<h3>API Business Sector Public Workspace - Commerce</h3>
<p>I am working my way through the thousands of APIs I have indexed and publishing and aggregating APIs into a variety of business sector public workspaces. I started with all of the commerce related APIs I have available, and publishing the OpenAPI for each one, then generating a collection for the purposes of documentation as part of a single workspace. Making it easier to browse through and kick the tires on all of these APIs, side by side in <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/commerce/overview">a single public workspace</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/commerce/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/commerce-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Commerce is the original reason for doing APIs, so I figured I'd start here when it comes to showcasing the potential of public workspaces. Seeing APIs side by side like this, then being able to assess the potential available across all of them is something that is going to continue to evolve how I see APIs in these sectors, but also how I see public API workspaces.</p>
<h3>API Business Sector Public Workspace - Message</h3>
<p>After commerce I was eager to see all of the messaging APIs side by side to better understand this sector. Aggregating all the different types of SMS, email, and other APIs <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/messaging/overview">into a single public workspace</a> so that they can be used together, or just used to understand this slice of the API pie.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/messaging/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/messaging-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Messaging is one of the most relevant sectors of the API space, providing a suite of APIs that will resonate with a wide audience. Providing a public workspace that I can use to help drive conversations with developers as well as business users. Messaging comes in many shapes and sizes, and this workspaces helps bring the sector into focus for me, and I will keep aggregating, publishing, and evolving APIs to show what is possible.</p>
<h3>API Topic or Trend Public Workspace - COVID-19</h3>
<p>Driven by the success of our&nbsp;<a href="https://covid-19-apis.postman.com/">COVID-19 resource center</a>, as soon as public workspaces were available we <a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/covid-19/overview">published the best of the collections from the resource center into a single public workspace</a>. Showing how a single topic, trend, or other bounded context can be applied to a public workspace, making a variety of APIs available in a single place for developers and other users to put to use in their applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/covid-19/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/covid-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I am looking forward to adding more automation, visualizations, and other elements to this workspace. Showing how public workspaces can be used to make these types of APIs available, but can also be used to better make sense of what is happening around the world when it comes to COVID-19.</p>
<h3>API Topic or Trend Public Workspace - US Election</h3>
<p>After we launched the COVID-19 resource center we wanted to apply the same approach to making sense of the US election this year. Aggregating the best of the election related APIs into <a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/us-2020-election/overview">a single workspace where developers can fork and put to use</a>, while also engaging with each other when it comes to getting their questions answered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/us-2020-election/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/election-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Now that the election is over I am looking forward to showing why these APIs matter during an election, but also afterwards to help us make sense of what is happening. Demonstrating the importance of APIs in each election, and that we should be investing in standards as well as individual implementations in perpetuity, not just as we ramp up for the next election.</p>
<h3>API Automation and Orchestration Public Workspaces - OpenAPIs</h3>
<p>I spend a lot of time answering OpenAPI related questions which are a collection. Helping demonstrate a specific aspect of working with OpenAPIs to Postman customers and the community. To help me be more organized around publishing, evolving, sharing, and collaborating around these collection driven capabilities <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/openapi">I published a single workspace for managing my OpenAPI collections, orchestrations, and automation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/openapi"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/openapi-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>As the number of my workspaces increases the importance of having these types of collections organized in a single workspace becomes even more important. I normally would just organize these across a variety of personal and team workspaces, then share them as needed, occasionally publishing to the API network as a template, but now that I have a public workspace I am being a little more organized about publishing them to a single place and then linking to them via a single URL.</p>
<h3>API Automation and Orchestration Public Workspaces - Collections</h3>
<p>I spend a lot of time answering collection related questions. Helping demonstrate a specific aspect of working with collections to Postman customers and the community. To help me be more organized around publishing, evolving, sharing, and collaborating around these collection driven capabilities <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/collections/overview">I published a single workspace for managing my "collection collections", orchestrations, and automation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/collections/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/collection-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>As the number of my workspaces increases the importance of having these types of collections organized in a single workspace becomes even more important. I normally would just organize these across a variety of personal and team workspaces, then share them as needed, occasionally publishing to the API network as a template, but now that I have a public workspace I am being a little more organized about publishing them to a single place and linking to them via a single URL.</p>
<h3>Government API Public Workspaces - Federal Election Commission (FEC)</h3>
<p>One area of the API economy I am keenly interested in is when it comes to government, and after publishing the FEC API to the US election public workspace, I figured I'd add it to a workspace for the agency. <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/federal-election-commission-fec/overview">Providing a single workspace</a> where you can find all of the APIs from this very critical federal agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/federal-election-commission-fec/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/fec-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>For me, a workspace provides a reference to each government agency, helping remind me to invest some time in researching what is happening with APIs at this government agency. Allowing the workspace to drive work around the government agency, helping keep things up to date and representing what is going on with APIs and open data in government.</p>
<h3>Government API Public Workspaces - Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)</h3>
<p>Next up to demonstrate the potential of APIs in government is out of one of the government agencies that is near and dear to my heart, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/department-of-veterans-affairs-va/overview">I took all of the OpenAPIs the VA provides as part of their developer area and imported them into a single workspace</a>, generating collections from them to help document what is available.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/department-of-veterans-affairs-va/overview"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/public-workspaces/va-public-workspace.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>The VA Lighthouse effort is one of the solid examples of APIs making a difference in government, and I am keen on demonstrating how public API workspaces can be used to help the VA better serve veterans. Providing a pretty compelling use case for public workspaces that can help make a difference in the lives of Americans.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Just the Tip of the Iceberg of What is Possible</h3>
<p>It took me building out different types of public workspaces before I began understanding what a public workspace is. Honestly, I don't think I've even touched on 10% of the possibilities with these examples. Like GitHub, it will take me several years, and building out hundreds or thousands of public workspaces before I'll have a handle on what is possible. Honestly, I am hoping that the community will show me what is possible, as I don't always trust my imagination when it comes to mapping to the reality on the ground across enterprise organizations, institutions, and government agencies. I am betting on the innovation and ingenuity of developers to show what is possible within a public workspace when it comes to helping them better achieve their objectives in making APIs available to a public audience. As usual, I am just hoping that my storytelling might just light the fire under the imagination of folks with these examples.</p>
<h3>Bringing Collaboration To API Operations</h3>
<p>Collaboration is one area public workspaces reflect a public repositories. It is definitely one of those areas that the open source movement has impacted how we engage across the API lifecycle. However, the public workspace is much more API centered, focusing on the API contracts and the collections that deliver and validate these contracts throughout their lifecycle. Here are a few of the collaborative aspects of public workspaces, that contribute to bridging the gap between provider and consumer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Watching -</strong> Being able to watch APIs available in the public API network, and receive updates when it changes.</li>
<li><strong>API Commenting -</strong> Being able to comment on APIs, and the parts of APIs, establishing a feedback loop around APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Commenting -</strong> Being able to comment on collections, and the parts of collections, establishing a feedback loop around collections.</li>
<li><strong>Team Member Mentions -</strong> Being able to mention team members in API or collection comments, allowing for engaging with specific team members around APIs and collections.</li>
<li><strong>Forking -</strong> Allowing team members and the public to be able to fork a collection to their own private or team workspace, and put to use, or make changes to their forked copy.</li>
<li><strong>Pull Requests -</strong> Submit any changes made to a collection back to the collection owner, allowing them to potentially accept and merge changes back in.</li>
<li><strong>Merging - </strong>Allowing the owner of a collection to accept pull requests from team members or public users, merging any changes back into a collection.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong> - Encouraging team members to share APIs and collections to workspaces where they will be needed, or share the URL of a collection to others via email or other messaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>These collaborative features are available within each workspace, rolling up to the activity feed for team members across workspaces. Making the API lifecycle a much more collaborative process, allowing team members and the public to tune into what is happening around APIs, and then engaging with the process throughout the API lifecycle. Bringing API development out of silos and helping make it much easier for developers and other API stakeholders to work in concert, and stay in tune with what is going on across an organization.</p>
<h3>Automating the API Factory Floor with Public Workspaces</h3>
<p>CI/CD have become synonymous with software delivery lifecycle, and while the deployment of APIs has benefited from this evolution, we are going to need much more automation, orchestration, and establishment of repeatable processes as part of the API lifecycle if we are going to continue to reliably deliver the API infrastructure at the scale we'll need for the next generation of applications. Postman workspaces provide three distinct approaches to automating the collections that are defined and available via the API workbench that exists within a private, team, or public workspace.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Runners</strong> - Manually running a collection and all of the requests it contains in a single motion, triggered by a Postman team member.</li>
<li><strong>Monitors</strong> - Scheduling the run of a collection on a specific schedule and from different cloud regions, automating any possible collection.</li>
<li><strong>Pipelines</strong> - Executing a collection as part of a pipeline weaving API automation into the existing automation used in the software delivery lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of a public workspace as that microbrewery restaurant that has the view into how the beer you are drinking is actually brewed. Letting everyone see the entire process from start to finish, instilling confidence in consumers that they are getting the best possible beer, made from the best possible ingredients, using the most streamlined process possible--it is so good, we want to show you all how it works.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/bf-skinner-factory-road.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<h3>Observability By Default with Public Workspaces</h3>
<p>In addition to the collaborative possibilities of public workspaces, they inject observability into the conversation by default. All workspaces have outputs that can be used to understand what is going on in real time across operations. Allowing API operations to be understood by capturing the exhaust from regular activity, then using it to stay in tune with what is going on, and respond to changing conditions. Introducing more visibility and accountability into the API lifecycle, without making people do anything extra, other than just getting their regular work down around providing and consuming APIs--here are the elements of a public workspace that contribute to observability out of the gate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workspaces</strong> - Just the fact of having a workspace provides a place to find out what is going on within a single bounded context.</li>
<li><strong>History</strong> - Showing all of the requests made by collections across team members, recording every API call made, and allow it to be filtered and used.</li>
<li><strong>Activity</strong> - Having real time visibility into all the activity from across all elements of a workspace, providing true API observability using the Postman platform outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong> - Providing default reporting all the elements within a workspace, providing a visual dashboard for what is going on in real time across teams.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizer</strong> - Using the visualizer tab for each request, making API calls to better understand what is going on with each API, or across APIs, and rendering using a custom JavaScript library.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - If conversations are localized to workspaces, and made even more precise around the parts of each API and collection defining the API lifecycle, you end up with a powerful feedback loop that makes operations more observable by all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to understand API operations using the outputs of your API operations is essential to developing an awareness of what is going on at scale. APIs are abstract and difficult to see. When you have hundreds or thousands of APIs, the challenge becomes even greater. API observability begins with monitoring the APIs themselves, and the infrastructure behind them, but then observability should mature to be also about what teams are up to, and being able to observe, guide, and respond to what is happening across operations in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Multiple Dimensions of API Collaboration</h3>
<p>One of the things that stands out for me across these example workspaces I've created is that there are multiple levels of collaboration, depending on what you are looking to accomplish with your public API workspace. I am sure there are more dimensions than what I have fleshed out here, but these three dimensions of collaboration that really stand out for me as how we optimize operations to work for eveyrone involved.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provider</strong> - API providers can use workspaces to better define the different parts of their operations, being more public in their operations when possible--walking the walk when it comes to operating the API infrastructure in a way that you want to showcase to others.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer</strong> - You don't have to be an API provider to operate a public workspace, and as shown above you can aggregate, automate, and orchestration using many different workspaces via a dedicated public workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Standards</strong> - Public workspaces are great for moving forward API standards, helping ensure there is the necessary collaboration in place to move a specification forward, while also demonstrating how an API works to providers and consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can accomplish this type of collaboration via Github repositories, but you just won't find this level attention to the API details in a repository. Github is designed for an open source software development lifecycle. Postman public workspaces have been defined by both API providers and consumers over the last 5+ years, resulting in a workspace approach that already works for industry, government, and other standards bodies looking to guide both API providers and consumers to all move within the same direction--using a tool that is already ubiquitous across development teams.</p>
<h3>API Discoverability Baked Into API Operations</h3>
<p>Public workspaces makes your APIs, collections, and the working occurring around them more discoverable. The new Postman search takes discoverability to an entirely new level all by itself, but operating your APIs in a public way adds a whole new level of discoverability. The ability for APIs to open up enterprise organization and push teams to evolve beyond their internal siloes is one of the reasons I started studying APIs in the first place. There are benefits of letting the sunlight into our operations, and operating our API infrastructure out in the open. Sure, not all APIs should operate this way, but most will dramatically benefit from being exposed to the watchful eye of the community it serves. Making the workspace in which APIs, collections, documentation, testing, mock servers, monitors, and other moving parts of our operations public by default helps ensure consumers can find APIs in the first place, but then it also goes a long to build and maintain trust with consumers without doing much more than being more discoverable, accessible, and transparent in everything you do.</p>
<h3>The Versatility of Collections and Environments</h3>
<p>There are so many possibilities of what a public API workspace can be because of the unlimited possibilities in how a collection can be defined. Anything an API can do, a collection can do. Once you start daisy chaining multiple APIs together within a collection the possibilities become pretty dizzying. Transcending what is possible with any single API resource or provider and really showing the potential of a distributed API economy. A collection isn't like an OpenAPI in that it tends to represent a single set of API resources or capabilities, it is something that can reflect a series of API calls that reflect a set of business objectives. Providing a unit of valye that can be applied one time, on a schedule, or as part of the regular software development lifecycle. Once you begin to establish abd evikve a=tiyr workbench for crafting, evolving, collaborating and orchestrating out in the open with your community around APIs, and collections around them, the possibilities really are limitless.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pulling Back the Curtain of Our API Operations</h3>
<p>Public API workspaces have the potential to pull back the curtain of our API operations. I know that this makes some folks nervous. If your APIs are being consumed by 3rd party applications and integrations you should be working to be as public with your efforts as you can. The least amount of distance between you and your consumers is optimal for putting APIs to work, as well as evolving them. Having a feedback loop in place around each of your APIs, but also the moving parts of your API operations like documentation, mock servers, testing, and other elements helps grease the wheels of your operations. Supporting API consumers in this way will be foreign for some API providers, but as I said before, it will let in some much needed sunlight on your operations, bring your API consumers closer, and give them a voice in the design and delivery of your API infrastructure. The distance between API consumer and producer, as well as the lack of a two way feedback loop is the top deficiencies that plague API platforms tidat. Public API workspaces help pull back the curtain on your API operations, helping bring in the communication that is required to optimize your API factory floor, as well as the supply chain betweeb you and your consumers.</p>

<h3>Emulating the Best API Patterns Across the Landscape</h3>
<p>After playing this API game for over a decade I notice that most people just emulate what they see. If people have consumed a number of different APIs, and are exposed to a wide variety of conversations around APIs, they tend to provide APIs, and run their operations similar to what they've seen. If people haven't consumed a number of different APIs, and have been exposed to a variety of conversations, they tend to not understand what makes APIs work. The more isolated API providers are in their API journey, the more friction and instability will be present across API operations. APIs are all about using the web to make digital resources and capabilities available to the widest possible audience, while striking a balance between being publicly accessible, but secured and generating revenue, ensuring APIs remain sustainable for everyone involved. Being comfortable with operating your APIs out in the open takes a certain amount of confidence and expertise, but it is what helps an API ecosystem thrive. It allows all of us to learn from each other. I help us share the healthiest patterns for operating our APIs. Not just telling people how they should operate their APIs, but demonstrating how to do it. Then API providers can decide which approach suits their needs, and will help them best serve their consumers. Allowing us all to emulate the best of what we are exposed to, pushing us all to be a little better in our own operations because we know that our consumers, and the wider community are watching.</p>
<h3>Using Workspaces to Define Your API Narrative</h3>
<p>A public API workspace is just that, a workspace. It is a place to work on your APIs. A public workbench is for defining the contracts for your API, as well as the collections you need to document, mock, and test your APIs. Then the environments, runners, and monitors you need to move each API forward from design to production, while also providing you with what you need to manage change across this API factory floor. How big or small your workspaces are is up to you. Just exactly what goes into a workspace and how it operates is up to your team. You can have as many or as few workspaces as you need to get the work you need done around providing and consuming the APIs you depend on. APIs are a journey, and not a destination. You will never be done delivering APIs. You will never be done with needing to discover and use 3rd party and partner APIs.You will never be done with using APIs if you are going to do business in a digital world. Public API workspaces reveal that this work is never done, and that we will need to setup and maintain private, team, and public workspaces for defining all the digital resources and capabilities we need to do business each day.</p>
<p>I am very accustomed to operating in a very public way. Not because I am in search of page views, more followers, or user signups. I am public in this way because I know that I learn more from this type of production, and that others in the community will learn from it as well. I depend on the feedback loop it creates to find new people, work, ideas, and energy to keep going. Github was one the top platforms from the last decade which have transformed the way I do business, and influenced how I see and use APIs. I am fully aware that I am biased, but I see Postman public workspaces doing this as well. Public workspaces have already changed how I do my storytelling. You'll notice many of the blog posts I am writing now contain a link to one or more APIs or collections in a Postman workspace. You'll see that some of the overview pages for my public workspaces contain todo lists of collections I want to build, as well as the stories I want to tell. Public workspaces are making my storytelling more hands-on, interactive, and even forkable. I see this as being transformative in not just how I support my community, but how API providers and API service providers support their communities as well--seismically shifting how we engage with each other in this API-driven world.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_12_05_at_4.20.41_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p3">I have long been fascinated by the <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/creating-run-button/">Run in Postman Button</a>. A Run in Postman button can be published from any Postman collection, organizing a single, or a series of API calls into collection of API requests, and then letting them be imported and ran locally by any consumer, as a cloud monitor, or via a pipeline. Run in Postman buttons are a common way for API providers to onboard new developers with their APIs, and stay engaged with active developers through collections they&rsquo;ve download via Run in Postman buttons. These embeddable goodies attached to Postman collections and potentially environments are very powerful unit of API execution, but I am finding that the label &ldquo;run&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t sufficient in articulating what is possible with each collection, and I a looking to get a little more precise when it comes to my vocabulary attached to each Postman button I publish.</p>
<h3>The Run in Postman Button Fundamentals</h3>
<p class="p3">A <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/">Postman collection</a> is basically a portable folder of API requests. Using Postman, developers can define the parts of one of many API requests, including the URL, parameters, headers, body, and authentication, then roll them all up as a collection that can be shared with other developers, and published as documentation, as well as using a Run in Postman button. This embeddable HTML or markdown button can be published alongside documentation, or more dynamically as individual buttons on any HTML or markdown page, attaching each button to the following elements:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Collections</strong> - Each button can execute a single collection of one or many API requests, complete with pre-request and post-request scripts.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Environments</strong> - Each button can possess a single environment that can contain a variety of key / value pairs for authentication, and other purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">You can <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tools-and-libraries/using-postman">find Run in Postman buttons sprinkled across Twitter API documentation</a>, providing one click import of collections into each developers own workspace, where they can manually run, or automate using a monitors, or trigger via a pipeline using the command line runner. This powerful combination allows for an almost unlimited number of possibilities when it comes to crafting a collection, environment, and then publishing using a &ldquo;Run in Postman&rdquo; button&mdash;something &ldquo;run In&rdquo; just does not adequately represent when articulating what is really possible.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Exposing the Semantics of Each Collection</h3>
<p class="p3">The label &ldquo;run in&rdquo; provides a powerful, yet generic wrapper for each collection. I&rsquo;d like to see a semantic layer emerge for Run in Postman Buttons, allowing me to better define and articulate what is happening within each collection. Yes, each collection is being &ldquo;ran&rdquo;, but I want to be able to get more precise about what is happening within each collection, moving beyond the notion of a &ldquo;reference collection&rdquo;, or just a buffet menu of what is possible with an API, to very precise capabilities that are enabled by an API. Here are a few labels I would use for some of the collections I currently use across my work.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Deploy Using Postman </strong>- I have a variety of collections that will take a fresh OpenAPI and publish it to AWS API Gateway, Lambda, RDS and / or DynamoDB.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Clean Up Using Postman</strong> - If an API I have deployed is ephemeral I will have a second collection that I can use to tear down and clean up an API deployment.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Harvest Using Postman -</strong> I have collections that will harvest data for me from Twitter, GitHub, and a myriad of other APIs I am regularly pulling data from.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Sync using Postman -</strong> I have collections that I use to sync data between two platforms using APIs, running one time or on a schedule to migrate data.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Publish Using Postman -</strong> I have many static sites that run on GitHub using GitHub Ages, and I schedule the publishing of JSON or YAML data via a collection.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Scan Using Postman -</strong> There are a collection I use to scan the surface area of APIs looking for vulnerabilities and other security issues across my APIs.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Test Using Postman - </strong>I have many different types of tests that live as Postman collections, allowing myself, or others to run tests manually or on schedule.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Postman collection defined API capabilities I need to run, share, and publish with other people. I am regularly answering questions around how to do something with APIs, OpenAPIs, JSON Schema, and other API lifecycle challenges, helping provide a solution as a single collection. I have diverse vocabulary when it comes to how I run my collections and it would be nice to be able to expose the semantics of my APIOps as simple buttons that I could publish in documentation or as part of the storytelling here on my blog.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-cloks-many-of-them.jpg" alt="" width="47%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>The Automation of API Capabilities Using Collections</h3>
<p class="p3">While the semantic of each collection and its underlying requests ands scripts would be better exposed via a semantic label on a button, each API capability could be executed in a variety of ways using existing Postman platform functionality. Starting with the ability to discover and learn about a specific API capability via documentation or wherever buttons are published, but then quickly move beyond manual actions, helping automate all of these capabilities via these methods:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Single Run - </strong>Allowing a user to run a collection combined with an environment a single time upon clicking the button.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Scheduled</strong> - Enable a user to schedule by the minute, hour, day, week, or other dimension, baking schedule into button.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Pipeline</strong> - Embedding the capability into an existing pipeline, ensure that the capability is run in the moment it is needed.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Events</strong> - Triggering the run of a capability when a specific event occurs, leveraging a web hook to execute the collection.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">I would have to explore how the vocabulary of a button label could be expanded beyond just the semantics of what the collection can do, and consider how the variety of approaches to executing an API capability via a collection might be expressed. Schedules would need to be defined, pipelines indexed and made extensible, and events registered for triggering of web hooks that set each collection + environment into motion. Ultimately I am looking for an embeddable link or button that has a label that describes the entirety of what is possible with each collection, and the method of execution, helping provide a suite of single click capabilities that developers and non-developers can use to automate the world around them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-docks-water-front-ships-containers.jpg" alt="" width="47%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>The Observability of API Automation and Orchestration</h3>
<p class="p3">Right now I can tell you the number of times a collection was viewed or downloaded for any collection in the Postman network. This provides a reliable way for API Providers to track the onboarding of new users, and since they have API management in place, they can link this onboarding to API activity by each user onboarded. Providing two of the classic metrics for any API platform--new and active users. However, I can&rsquo;t help API providers confidently implement, measure, and report upon what actually is activating each API consumer. Adding a semantic layer to each collection, exposed via it&rsquo;s published button, provides me with a more precise dimension to report upon when it comes to quantifying how users move to differnt levels of ctivation, and different levels of activation, based upon the type of collection being employed. Giving me with more tools to help API providers experiment and quantify how to best reach API consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Capability Collections -</strong> API Providers can develop precise collections that speak to a specific business value their API enables.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Service Composition -</strong> Each collection can contain one or many individual API requests that map to the API management layer.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Collection Reporting - </strong>With a semantic layer added to each collection, my views, download, and execution means much more.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Experience Journeys -</strong> As an API provider I can craft many different collections that enable a variety of journeys for API consumers.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Operational Landscape -</strong> I&rsquo;ve added another semantic layer to the reporting for my APII operations, that better define my API landscape.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">I really haven&rsquo;t done anything groundbreaking here. All I am doing is adding a semantic layer to each collection that helps them convey more meaning to both API provider and consumer. It helps me move beyond just the buffet menu nature of existing reference collections which show API consumers everything that is possible, and then expects them to just go figure it all out. It helps be get more structured in how I am defining the capabilities of my API platform, and share, publish, and articulate those capabilities to consumers. While also letting me better report upon, develop an awareness, and evolve my API strategy to better meet the needs of my consumers, and of course my platform.</p>

<h3>Expanding My API Vocabulary and Then Putting at My Fingertips</h3>
<p class="p3">This notion of expanding the Run I Postman button vocabulary has been kicking around in my head for a couple of years now, but it was until we launched our new search recently that I could see the possibilities. How I name my collections matters a lot more now because of the expanded search available in Postman now. Being more thoughtful about how I name collections to ensure maximum discoverability, triggers my desire to help API providers better articulate and communicate the value that is contained within each Postman collection. Increasingly I am generating many derivative collections from an OpenAPI definition, looking to create more tangible and usable executable units of API value that speak to a wide variety of developers, but more importantly non-developers. The label on a button might seem insignificant, but really with each button you have a finite, but powerful surface for articulating the endless possibilities that exist within each Postman collection it is attached to, but also the value generated from the APIs defined as part of that collection.</p>
<p class="p2">The release of public workspaces has let in some sunlight on my chaotic and disorganized approach to creating collections for a variety of purposes. Publishing documentation and run in Postman buttons has always been the public layer of this chaotic performance of API Evangelist, but also now the Chief Evangelist at Postman. Exposing my wealth of APIs and collections via workspaces, then trying to use the new Postman search to find what I need, and recall the many different API-driven capabilities I have laying around has really shown me the importance of being able to properly label each collection in a way that is meaningful to me, but also to my audience. Next, I am going to continue working on how I design, develop, and label my collections, while also putting more thought into how I can publish as buttons, but maybe add my own custom layer which exposes the value contained within each collection &ldquo;run&rdquo;. Really, you could launch an entire button, as well as execution layer using the Postman API, managing collections and environments there, while doing the execution using monitors. I&rsquo;ll spend some time tinkering, and see what I can come up with. Who knows maybe I will be able to influence the road map with this work. Or better yet, maybe you&rsquo;ll build this, tell me about it, and I&rsquo;ll help you influence the road map. ;-). I have too much work as it is. ;-)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">Sometimes I need to do bulk updates to Postman collections and there is no better way to automate this than to use a Postman Collection that uses the Postman API&mdash;inception level stuff, so be careful ;-). <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/collections/overview">I have setup a dedicated public workspace where I am building out these utility type operational level collections</a> that help me manage the API lifecycle out ahead of what the Postman GUI is capable of doing. Some of the things I am doing will eventually make its way to the Postman UI, but some of them will not. Either way, I am too impatient to wait, and one of the things I love about Postman is that I can hack my way forward through just about any situation using the Postman API.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Building on my base collection for pulling and updating collections, <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/collections/documentation/35240-6231fa2a-fb8a-45f1-96a1-f1a6e235362e">I added five specific requests that will help me conduct a find and replace on each API request host, path, and the query parameter key, value, and description</a>. There are other dimensions I am looking to cover with future requests, but this gets me what I need right now. You simply add a value to the request for a find and replace value, make sure you&rsquo;ve entered a collection ID (pulled from URL or info tab), and hit run&mdash;it will conduct the appropriate find and replace, and then save the collection using the Postman API. So you can immediately put to use the same collection with the changes you desired.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have any questions on the collection for pulling a collection and making changes using the Postman API, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the collection workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other collection related collections within this workspace. You can also fork the collection and use in your workspaces, and submit back any enhancements you&rsquo;d like to see as a pull request. If you have any questions that you don&rsquo;t want to see in the comments for the collection, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com"><span class="s1">info@apievangelist.com</span></a>.</p>

<h3>What is an API?</h3>
<p>An API is a digital interface for sharing data, content, and algorithms with web, mobile, and device applications using the Internet, building on web technologies to make digital resources available across many different applications. APIs have been around since computers and their networks first gained a foothold back in the 1960s, but with the rise of the web since 2000, a new breed of APIs have emerged which has changed how we build and use technology, and introduced entirely new ways of doing business, but sadly, they have also introduced entirely new ways of exploiting an destabilizing the physical world around us. APIs aren&rsquo;t the latest techno solutionism, although they are oftentimes billed as that, they are the digital currents that flow around us each day. APIs power the web and mobile applications we depend on each day, while also steadily working to redefine our physical worlds by connecting everything to the Internet&mdash;reshaping our virtual and physical worlds, while also remaking who we are as humans along the way.</p>
<h3>Websites Are for Humans</h3>
<p>The web as we know it has been evolving for over 50 years, but in the 1990s it became something we were able to access in our homes and businesses, laying the foundation for the ubiquitous web of applications we now access in our homes via laptops, televisions, and other appliances, as well as our cars, in our businesses, and across our communities in the form of security cameras, traffic infrastructure, digital signage and much more. Websites are hypertext markup language (HTML) that are designed to be rendered for humans in a browser, making the text, images, and other media consumable by humans using their eyes and ears, and navigated using our fingers via touch screens, keyboards, and increasingly voice controls. Websites provide us with a user interface that each person can put the web to use in their personal or professional worlds, connecting us with the digital world that has emerged before us, and increasingly throughout our physical world as well.</p>
<h3>APIs are for All Other Applications</h3>
<p>As the web has expanded over the last twenty years beyond simple web pages accessed via desktop computers, the builders of the web realized they needed to develop ways in which data, content, and algorithms could be reused across many different web and mobile devices. To accomplish this, developers began adapting web technologies using HTTP to make data, content, and algorithms available in much more standardized and machine readable ways so that the data and content could be used across many destinations. Separating the user interface from the data, content, media, or algorithms, widening how and where the digital resources could be applied, using them to power their primary web, mobile, and device applications, but also making the increasingly valuable digital resources available to partners and 3rd party developers, generating entirely new revenue streams from data, content, media, and algorithms which had limited value before. Resulting in a layer of application programming interfaces (APIs) on top of the existing low cost web infrastructure companies were already using to deliver their existing web applications.</p>
<h3>History of API - Commerce</h3>
<p>The early web API pioneers were all interested in expanding the reach of their commerce networks, making their products and services available to affiliates, resellers, partners, and 3rd party developers looking to build the next killer application. Salesforce, eBay, and Amazon were the first technology companies who began investing in API infrastructure in the early 2000s, setting into motion a whole new way to make digital resources available via the web. Translating the sale of physical products and services from our physical worlds into the online world were the most straightforward and widely understood way to apply the web to reach new customers, but it also quickly translated to more distributed approaches to selling products and services through many different applications and digital networks via simple web APIs. By 2005 a significant portion of Salesforce, eBay, and Amazon&rsquo;s revenues were beginning to flow through their APIs, laying the commercial foundation for what many folks like to call the API economy, but many who were tuned into this shift would soon realize there were some other critical ingredients needed to get us where we are today.</p>
<h3>History of API - Social</h3>
<p>As the commerce phase of the API evolution was being set into motion another aspect of the API economy was taking shape, leveraging APIs to not just sell products and services, but to further define how humans use the web to stay connected and get their information, showing the social value of APIs. In 2003 the image sharing platform Flickr realized they could rapidly expand the reach of their platform to the growing blogosphere by offering 3rd party developers API access to their increasingly valuable media platform&mdash;realizing this was much more than just a technical advancement, but also a business one they dubbed business development 2.0. Shortly after Flickr realized the potential of APIs the world saw both Twitter and Facebook introduce two API-driven seismic shifts that we are still working to understand the impacts of in 2020. Much of the growth of Twitter and Facebook over the last fifteen years has been built on top of their public APIs, providing a self-service way for partners and 3rd party developers to extend the reach of the network, helping build buttons, badges, widgets web, mobile, bots, and device applications that would extend, augment, and strengthen the importance of these social networks, and as we&rsquo;ve seen in the last decade also the automation, orchestration, and introduction of bots who continue to define the tone and balance of these online platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>History of API - Cloud</h3>
<p>While the social phase of the API evolution was ramping up, one of the early API pioneers forever changed how we&rsquo;d deploy our software infrastructure using APIs, with the introduction of what we now call &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; from Amazon Web Services. After finding success with APIs to support their commercial ambitions Amazon had internalized APIs in a way that would demonstrate how you could use web APIs to do more than sell products, blog, and share posts with your friends on a social network. With the introduction of AWS S3 and EC2 in 2006, Amazon showed us that you could also deploy global infrastructure using APIs, opening the floodgates of the types of digital resources you could make available through web APIs. It wasn&rsquo;t just data, content, and media anymore. You could use web APIs to deploy servers, store previously unheard of amounts of data, as well as configure the DNS and network for your applications in real time. This API-driven cloud gave us the modular resources we would need to build applications for the future, but it also gave us the scale and scope we needed to deliver the distributed applications we would need to do business in the digital age. Adding another important dimension to the API conversation that would make the next seismic shift possible, moving the Internet from servers in data centers into the cloud, and then into our pockets with mobile applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-city-clouds-waterfront.jpg" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<h3>History of API - Mobile</h3>
<p>With the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the Android mobile phone shortly after, a whole new world of applications emerged. Moving applications from our desktops and laptops into our hands, mobilizing common applications and platforms we used so that we could take them with us, expanding the reach of the web to wherever we could get a cellular signal. Developers quickly realize that they could deliver the same data, content, media, and algorithms they used in their web applications to the new mobile applications they were delivering. Realizing that they could deliver digital resources once using APIs then reuse over and over in many different web and mobile applications, while also making them available for use by trusted partners, and 3rd party developers when it m made sense. Using web APIs to deliver the digital resources needed to power mobile applications allowed application providers to use the same low cost web infrastructure they used for their websites to deliver mobile applications, helping reduce overhead and become more agile and nimble when it comes to delivering new applications, but also iterate upon each version of existing applications. The table for the API economy was being set, and APIs were becoming the preferred approach developers needed to deliver the digital resources used in web and mobile applications, but soon would expand to anything that could be connected to the Internet, pushing APIs beyond the digital world, lighting up common everyday physical objects with the ability to read and write data via wireless networks.</p>
<h3>History of API - Devices</h3>
<p>APIs demonstrated that data could provide a rich experience via mobile devices, and it didn&rsquo;t take too long for developers to push these capabilities to a new breed of Internet connected devices, giving birth to a new wave of wearable devices, home automation appliances, digital signage, and the connecting of everyday objects from our personal and business lives to the Internet. Wearable activity trackers, home cameras, thermostats, television, and other Internet connected devices are all using APIs to send and receive data, establishing entirely new sources of rich and increasingly valuable data from entirely new digitally enabled objects. Giving birth to an Internet of things that would produce entirely new markets for home, surveillance, environmental, agriculture, and other emerging API-driven device data. Devices were telling us the temperature in our homes or the wind speeds on the farm, helping us measure, track, and understand our physical world using Internet connected devices that send data back and forth using expanding wireless networks that were covering every corner of our physical world. APIs weren&rsquo;t just for expanding your affiliate networks to sell more products, or to publish an image to your blog. You could now deploy global infrastructure to support the needs of humans via mobile applications as well as a growing number of automated connected devices that were being used to further blur the line between the online and offline worlds.</p>
<h3>Every Online Shift In Last Twenty Years Have APIs Behind It</h3>
<p>Every major online shift of the last twenty years have had APIs behind it. E-commerce, social networks, the cloud, mobile phones, and the Internet of things has changed every business sector, and has forever changed how we live our lives.&nbsp; All of these shifts have contributed to making things like ridesharing and food delivery something we now take for granted. APIs have changed how we buy things, how we communicate and connect online and offline. APIs are transforming every existing business sector, while also creating entirely new business sectors, disrupting many aspects of our lives from how we date, to how we vote in an election. APIs allow for the dismantling of what was, and reassembling it into entirely new digital assets that can be bought, sold, and turn people&rsquo;s everyday behaviors and activities into something that also can be bought and sold online. While the cloud and their APIs exist just beyond the view of the average consumer or citizen, the commercial, social, mobility, and device enablement is front and center for everyone to help quantify the impact APIs are having in their lives. Each of these seismic shifts introduced by APIs are large by themselves, but it really is the collective momentum they all bring to the table together. Mobile and device applications would be much more difficult to deliver without the cloud, and many of these new types of applications become more of the natural flow of our live because of the social connectivity woven into them. All working together to shift more of our everyday lives online so that they can be quantified, tracked, monetized, and all contributing to a real or perceived forward motion enabled by the Internet.</p>
<h3>APIs Are What Makes a Platform</h3>
<p>APIs are the Internet enabled pipes behind each of the major platforms dominating the business and political landscape today. Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Netflix, Instagram, WhatsApp, Pinterest, Salesforce, Expedia, and other top brands are using APIs to power their businesses and their growth. The public APIs are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to APIs on their platforms, and for every public API from these companies publish, there are probably 100 others internally and providing partner access to valuable digital assets. While the growth of these platforms over the last twenty years have been driven by their public APIs, internal APIs are also a critical aspect of how their business operates. Enterprise capabilities are increasingly being measured by the quantity and adoption of internal APIs. While these brands have emerged as part of the last wave of Internet enabled businesses over the last twenty years, a growing number of more traditional businesses are in the process of also redefining themselves as platforms. Remaking businesses that have been around for fifty or a hundred years, breaking down operations into small API defined bits, then making them available across all of the enterprise applications where they are needed to conduct businesses on any given day. APIs are what turn a web application into a platform, making an application or suite of applications much bigger than the sums of its parts by ensuring digital capabilities are available across many different channels and domains.</p>
<h3>Delivery Digital Resources to Web, Mobile, and Device</h3>
<p>Most businesses are doing APIs, they just were not doing them in any organized way by 2010, but the introduction of mobile increased the number of domains in which companies were having to deliver data, content, media, and other resources to power a growing number of applications. Web applications were also growing much more complex by 2010, but it was the need to support one or more mobile applications that really pushed APIs into the foreground. Businesses needed to get more organized about not just how they delivered data, content, media, and algorithms to the growing number of applications, but they also needed to get more organized about how they were creating, storing, and making sense of the growing amount of data being generated from all of these new endpoints. Then alongside all of this happening companies were getting asked by partners for access to the same digital resources and data exhaust, while also facing pressure from new players who were being much more public with their API-driven performance, further leveling up the urgency when it comes to doing APIs, but also ensuring they are as performant and easy to put to use as they possibly can internally and externally.</p>
<h3>Delivering Digital Resources to Partners &amp; 3rd Party Developers</h3>
<p>As the value of data, content, media, and algorithms grows on any platform, the demand for those digital resources increases. As popular platforms like Salesforce, Flickr, Twitter, Facebook, Google Maps, and others grew, the demand for access to their valuable resources by partners and 3rd party developers increased dramatically. This wasn&rsquo;t exclusive to these platforms. Other companies who were finding success with their web, mobile, and device applications were facing the same challenges. As platforms grew and expanded, so did the demand for access to those resources in a standardized, and oftentimes developers demanded it in a self-service way. Companies needed to meet their own needs for delivering web, mobile, and devices applications, but also the needs of partners and developers who were looking to build the next generation of applications. Amidst all of these real world demand on business to deliver and manage data, content, media, and algorithms across multiple channels, and their desire to satisfy the needs of partners and 3rd party developers, companies are having to get more strategic and organized in how they manage their own digital resources, resulting in many benefits, as well as a whole industry of services and tooling that help companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies manage their API infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Organizational Efficiency, Agility, Reuse, Traceability, and Provenance</h3>
<p>There are many more reasons enterprise organizations do APIs, but over the years we have seen some consistent benefits that organizations realize when it comes to operating their businesses using APIs to engage with partners, customers, and the public. Being able to quickly and efficiently discover and apply digital resources where they are needed bring a certain agility to teams when it comes to being able to deliver new web, mobile, and device applications, and more predictably evolve existing ones to meet the changing needs of a platform. Having an organization's digital capabilities defined as APIs, helps improve efficiency and the agility of an organization, but it also allows for the reuse of digital resources, which allows for better traceability, provenance, and management of dependencies across the applications and integrations that depend on them. APIs provide more visibility into who is using data, content, media, and algorithms, by establishing a real-time feedback loop between the backend systems, and the applications putting resources to work, or generating data, content, and media from platform users. APIs aren&rsquo;t just about developing web, mobile, and device applications, they are about managing the digital resources applied across applications in a more organized way, while developing more awareness of what is actually going on under the hood of a platform and the organization behind.</p>
<h3>Recapping the API Fundamentals</h3>
<p>To help illustrate what an API is, let&rsquo;s look at a simple products SaaS platform, where our digital resources are products that we want to sell via an e-commerce platform. To access our products via the web you would simply go to<a href="https://example.com/products/">&nbsp;https://example.com/products/</a>&nbsp;in your browser and you would see a list of products rendered using HTML. Our products API will use a similar URL pattern of<a href="https://api.example.com/products">https://api.example.com/products</a>, but instead of returning HTML for rendering in a browser, it returns either XML, JSON, or a CSV. Allowing the product catalog to be used to generate HTML, or be rendered into any other application, or integrated into other systems for other uses. The HTML product listing can be easily used in browsers, the CSV product listing can easily be used in a spreadsheet, and the XML and JSON can easily be applied by developers into a wide variety of use cases. This approach can be applied to any digital resource, not just products. For the purposes of this discussion we are focusing on our resource being a product, but this could just as easily be a task list, videos, images, payments, or any other resources that are being made available online. APIs allow us to consistently define a variety of digital resources in a consistent way that leverages HTTP to make data, content, media, and algorithms available using the same low cost infrastructure that powers the web. Early API providers realized quickly that they were going to need their resources available in more than one place on the web.d After building out large web sites or applications, they created affiliate and reseller networks, or were looking to cultivate, grow, and benefit from growing developer communities who were using their APIs in their applications. As early API providers realized the potential of APIs, and continued their investment in developing them they quickly realized that they were going to have to get a little more organized about how they managed their API infrastructure if they were to maximize value within their developer communities, and across their platforms.</p>

<h3>The Emergence of API Management in 2006</h3>
<p>As APIs were getting started as part of the commerce, social, cloud, and mobile phases of evolution a new approach to managing APIs emerged to help API providers do better APIs. Companies like Mashery, Apigee, and 3Scale emerged to provide a standardized suite of tooling to help secure, manage, and develop an awareness of how APIs were being put to work. By 2012 API management was a viable segment of the tech sector, and by 2016, after some consolidation, API management had become baked into the cloud, and is something that is available as part of AWS, Azure, Google, and other cloud platforms. There are a number of features provided by API management platforms that help API providers better operate their APIs, including securing, rate limiting, and reporting upon API usage, but more importantly API management is about defining and generating value being generated using APIs. API management when used properly helps API providers develop more awareness about how APIs are being used, but also being able to properly manage the value exchanged between a platform and the applications and integrations that exist on top of a platform. Making API management a pretty significant part of the overall conversation when it comes to what is happening across an organizations applications, as well as engagements with partners and the public.</p>
<h3>API Management Requires Everyone to Have an API Key</h3>
<p>One of the tenets of API management is that they help API Providers secure all of their APIs, requiring all consumers signup to receive a key or token that they need to pass in with each API call they make. Providing a single token that is present in all API requests and responses which is attributable to each API consumer. Allowing access to all digital resources be tracked, rate limited, reported upon, and used to better understand what consumers are doing with the valuable data, content, media, and algorithms being accessed via APIs, while efficiently tracking all data, content, and media being generated by consumers across web, mobile, and device applications. API keys control access to APIs, but this key also acts as a fingerprint on every action a user makes via a platform, allowing their usage to be understood on an individual consumer level, or wider as part of personas, groups, and larger subsections of consumers who are putting APIs to work. API keys have become a ubiquitous way for API providers to providers to define who has access to resources, and how they are putting them to work across applications, but they have also become commonplace for API consumers, and are an expected part on the API onboarding process, when the APIs and the underlying API management layer offers value to consumers.</p>
<h3>Giving End Users a Voice with OAuth and Access Scope</h3>
<p>Most APIs only require partners and 3rd party developers to signup for access and receive their API keys before they can access API resources, but once they have keys they can usually obtain access to most resources. However, there is an additional layer of security that some API providers employ when there is sensitive platform user data being accessed via an API. Over the last decade OAuth has emerged as a standard for providing not just a set of tokens for accessing an API, but also the scope of usage that is required when it comes to API access to data, content, and media. Facebook, Twitter, Salesforce, and other common API-driven platforms use OAuth to govern access.giviing their end users a voice when it comes to opening up 3rd party access to their data via a platform. Allowing them to authorize the issuing of keys to a 3rd party developer to be able to access their account data, content, and media. While the APIs, and the scope of access are defined by the platform, the end users has a say in who is able to access their data via the platform, initiating what is considered to be the &ldquo;OAuth dance&rdquo; to give access to an external platform or application. While imperfect, OAuth provides the best solution we have for brokering the access to valuable platform data by 3rd party developers, while keeping end users in the equation--helping automated and manage the access of valuable resources using publicly accessible web APIs.</p>
<h3>Defining the Business of APIs Using Service Plans and API Composition</h3>
<p>Since the beginning, API management has provided the ability to group APIs into different access plans, composing exactly the right mix of API defined digital resources and rate limits for consumers. You see this evolution branded on the approaches of software as a service (SaaS) solutions with their free, pro, team, enterprise, and other mix of self-service or direct engagement pricing plans and tiers. API management allows you to put one or many APIs into a plan, put usage limitations on the plan, and then apply it to one or many users, allowing API providers to compose plans for each type of API consumer persona, often providing free public tiers, but then also crafting additional plans for other levels of customers, partners, or even for internal usage across different groups and teams. In my experience all APIs should only be accessed via a well defined, metered, and reported upon usage plan, requiring all developers whether internal, partner, or public 3rd party to obtain API keys that are associated with a well defined API access plan. No API should go without being measured as part of a plan, and no API consumer should be accessing digital resources across an organization without having a key. There can be limited use free and public access to some resources without signing up, but once you need access to more resources, and higher volumes of each resource, history has shown us that you want to have visibility into what digital resources are being made available and who has access, and are putting these resources to work. Without this visibility into how we are putting API resources to work across web, mobile, and device applications, it becomes increasingly difficult to secure and define the value being delivered.</p>
<h3>The Role HTTP Methods LIke GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Play</h3>
<p>Each page we load on the web uses what is called an HTTP GET&mdash;the technical standard for retrieving an HTML page. GET is the most common HTTP method used today, which is all about consumption of data, content, and media. However, there are numerous other HTTP methods available which allow for not just retrieving, but creating, updating, deleting, and other verbs we may need to use in web and API design. The second most common HTTP verb is POST, which is what we use to create a digital resource. We POST to the web and via APIs all the time. We POST contact forms. We POST Tweets. We POST our location. APIs are really good at using HTTP methods, and employ POST (Create), GET (Read), PUT (Update), and DELETE (Delete) to manage the state of data, content, media, and algorithms using the web. When you require that all API consumers must possess a key to access APIs, this ensures that all consumption can be attributed back to each individual consumer, opening up the ability to report on usage by HTTP method, and see and understanding who your consumers are, and who your creators are. Providing one of many dimensions opened up my using API management, but one that tends to reflect a very meaningful to determining who is creating value and who is just consuming.</p>
<h3>API Awareness and Reporting from API Management</h3>
<p>Layered on top of the authentication, service composition, and rate limiting, API management solutons provide a suite of reporting for API providers to tune into what is happening across the APIs they are serving up. Reporting upon multiple dimensions of consumption, quantifies what each user is accessing, but also breaks things down by the API resource, HTTP method, errors, time frames, geographic region, and many other dimensions that help API providers develop an awareness of what resources are getting used and how they are applied in applications. This awareness is the biggest benefit of doing API management because it makes the API landscape across an organization more observable, helping providers make sense of the growing sprawl that is enterprise API infrastructure. This awareness isn&rsquo;t just at the API provider side of the conversation, and most API management solutions allow API providers to share reporting with API consumers as well, helping them understand their own usage across their applications and integrations. Helping provide dashboards for API providers and API consumers to see API usage, visualizing the very digital and abstract API layer that exists behind everything we do online each day. Ensure we are in tune with the API infrastructure we depend on each day, and are able to quantify the value that is being generated each day.</p>
<h3>Invoicing for Value, Usage and Consumption via API Management</h3>
<p>The final feature of modern API management solutions that help define the value being generated by APIs each day is the ability to invoice each API consumer for their usage each month, charging them varying rates based upon their API plan, and how much they have used. As the types of API resources being made available have expanded over the last twenty years, the approaches to pricing, invoicing, and generating revenue from these API resources have expanded as well. While many API providers charge based upon the number of API calls made, many other providers have pushed the boundaries of API monetization to include per megabyte transferred or stored, by timeframe, or other dimension of each resource being served up. The ability to develop and evolve different API plans, meter, report, and then invoice upon how API consumers access APIs has created entirely new types of business and revenue streams from existing businesses. Think about what Amazon has done with the cloud by making servers, storage, databases, and other infrastructure available as a pay for what you use model. APIs have created entirely new ways to generate revenue from social media and other user data or user generated content, with providers like Twitter giving away low volume data access for free, but then charging high volume data consumers based upon what they consume. Invoicing for API usage isn&rsquo;t just about charging for API usage, and can be used to signal value exchanged, without actually exchanging money, or even be used to pay those who contribute, while charging those who just consume.</p>
<h3>Considering the API Management Fundamentals</h3>
<p>API management is software you stand up in front of your APIs to secure access to your API resources, meter, measure, and report upon their usage. You do this with what is called a gateway, proxy, or sometimes a connector. API management has evolved to include other elements over the years, but continues to revlve around a portal where publish your APIs, a registration and login flow for developers to sign up when accessing a service, then providing them with the keys and sometimes code they need to actually consume an API. All API consumption is measured, rate limited, and reporting upon in real-time, as well as according to designated billing and subscription cycles. API management stands in between an API provider's digital resources and an API consumers desktop, web, or mobile application and integration. We can stand up an API management solution in front of our products API we showcased earlier, requiring all developers register and obtain keys before they can use, select an access tier, and in some cases put in a credit card to be billed for what they use. API management secures digital resources from unwanted usage, defining the acceptable limits of value being exchanged, rewarding desired behavior, and blocking or shutting off undesired behavior. Leading API providers have mastered the API management layer to benefit their bottom line, and drive the lion share of the value inward towards their companies. Attracting developers with valuable digital resources, but making sure the platform wins when it comes to generating value and revenue. Striking a balance between making digital resources available to exactly the audience you wish, protecting yourself from unwanted access and usage, while also developing insight and awareness about how consumers are putting resources to work.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_2.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<h3>The Beginning of an Open Data Movement</h3>
<p>As the API economy was getting its footing with commerce, social, cloud, and mobile, another movement was occurring that was focused entirely on making public data available from city, county, state, and federal government agencies as well as non-government organizations, non-profits, and other institutions. Around 2010 you began to see more emphasis on publishing data on the web as compressed downloads, or as XML, JSON, CSV, and other machine readable formats. This movement was born out of the tech industry in the San Francisco Bay Area, but quickly spread to cities around the United States, with similar movements emerging in Europe, Australia, and around the globe. Government agencies were looking to stimulate innovation across the private sector with this data, and the tech sector was looking to build the next killer app on the data being made publicly available. By 2013, governments in both the US and UK were mandating that government agencies publish data, and in 2020, while there has been many ups and downs in the open data movement, many public entities are still publishing data online as download and via APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Considering Public Data Download Versus API Consumption</h3>
<p>Even before the popular open data movement was picking up speed by 2010, making data available as a single large, or series of large downloaded compressed files was common. When data was available as smaller datasets, they might also be made available as downloadable machine readable files. Along the way, some data stewards who were aware of the emerging world of APIs were also making data available as simple web APIs, returning XML or JSON responses, adding a more advanced query layer. Downloading data as files proved to be effective for developers who have the resources to download and process them, but the process remained disconnected from the stewards of the data, and rarely possessed any kind of feedback loop that would help improve, evolve, and move data forward to meet the needs of consumers&mdash;it was a one way street. Most agencies, organizations, and institutions publishing data were unaware of the wider API movement, and the benefits of establishing a connection with consumers. Data consumers with the most technical resources tended to also be the most vocal about keeping things as they were, pushing back on the need for APIs because they had the resources to download and process the data, and didn&rsquo;t want any friction when it came to accessing the growing wealth of public data resources that were being made available.</p>
<h3>Government Mandating Machine Readable by Default</h3>
<p>In 2013, then President of the United States Barack Obama issued a directive that top level cabinet agencies In the United States would have to go machine readable by default when it came to publishing data publicly. Instead of publishing data as spreadsheets and PDFs, they needed to publish it as XML, JSON, or CSV. This would have a significant effect on federal agencies, but also trickling down to states and cities, as well as helping lead when it comes to other countries around the world. Demonstrating that by making data available in machine readable ways you would be able maximize the value and usage of the data in both the public and private sector. Making data available in standardized machine readable formats would extend the reach of research, markets, and the many other efforts underway in the public sector. Leveraging the web to make data available for use in web, mobile, and device applications, helping lead the way when it comes to ensuring the web would continue to be an engine for the economy and society. Using the public sector to drive innovation in the private sector, which would then in turn fuel the growth and impact of government through a healthy economy and a growth in tax revenue. Helping make all levels of government machines readable by default so that data can be easily shared between systems, stakeholders, and constituents across the web, mobile, and device applications they depend upon.</p>
<h3>Realizing Open Data and Open APIs Are Open for Business</h3>
<p>When people speak of open data they most often refer to open being about access. Meaning it is openly available on the web for anyone to download. While this is the intent of most open data providers, it isn&rsquo;t the intent of many open data consumers. Many wanted it open so that they could freely use these valuable public resources for use in their commercial applications, allowing them to tap this new data resource like it was a mineral, forest, or oil and gas natural resource that had become available in this growing public sector digital landscape. Open data meant open for business when it came to the digital economy, and the growing number of entrepreneurs who needed the public sector to power their apps, providing the life blood of the tech sector, continuing to build on fifty years of public sector investment in the ever growing private tech sector. This arrangement has always benefited the technology sector, but as the value of data increases, the appetite for public data only grew. Resulting in a vocal minority that is extremely passionate about public data being made available, but rarely motivated to contribute back, pay for data, or have anything getting in their way when it comes to accessing the digital resources they had developed an appetite for. Which has had a chilling effect on the overall growth and velocity of the public data movement, actually working against private sector innovation, but is something that the tech sector isn&rsquo;t always open to seeing and understanding. There has been a lot of money made with commercial applications of public data, but because there isn&rsquo;t a feedback loop in place, little value ends up back at the source, again operating as a one way street.</p>
<h3>Considering Commercial Usage of Public Data With Google Maps</h3>
<p>One of the&nbsp; most significant examples of the value extraction that occurs on public data resources can be found with Google Maps. The ubiquitous mapping solution is built on public data, and continues to harvest public data resources to fuel the commerce solution without giving much back beyond "free" usage of the service. Google Maps depends on federal, state, and municipal data to operate, dominating the conversation around travel, transit, neighborhoods, businesses, and many other dimensions of the public sphere. After over decade of growth, Google Maps is a juggernaut, making it something that government agencies, institutions, and organizations often need, even if they simultaneously are feeding data to the giant Google Maps machine. Real time transit feeds, census, business registry, and other public data is essential to the Google Maps machine continuing to operate and grow to cover the entire world at the global level, but all the way down to the neighborhoods within our communities. The often cash strapped agencies and organizations that provide Google with public data are not given any support from Google, a commercial entity, even if continuing to provide the data requires significant resources. It makes sense for public data to remain freely available, but when you have the resources Google does it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for things to be such a one way street, with all the value being generated for the public sector flowing into and enriching Google. Public sector data should provide a solid foundation for private sector tech innovation, and help stabilize the data life blood of the leading platforms and applications, but this shouldn&rsquo;t just be flowing one way. Yes, taxes play a significant role in funding the creation of public data, but in the current state of corporate taxes this isn&rsquo;t a fair argument, and with public data being a living, evolving, and expanding landscape, there needs to be some value going back into the public sphere for it all to keep growing and expanding.</p>
<h3>API Realizations From the United States Census Bureau</h3>
<p>As long as the United States Census Bureau has been conducting its surveys of the American population it has also been making the data from it available to other government agencies, institutions, organizations, and commercial enterprise entities. In 2011 when I asked the Census Bruearu why they don&rsquo;t have an API for the massive amount of data it possesses, they simply responded that they are meant to be neutral stewards of the survey data and they couldn&rsquo;t place any of their own opinions on the public data, something that applying API design might very well do. However, after launching their API shortly after they realized that there was a whole other class of consumers that existed, ones who had lacked the resources to download and process the massive data survey files, and were not able to get at exactly the slice of the census data pie that they needed. With the new web APIs, spreadsheet connectors, and other API driven census survey resources, the Census Bureau was able to reach an entirely new audience. More importantly they were able to establish a feedback loop with consumers that did not exist before with consumers who simply downloaded the large data files for the expansive surveys. When asked if they knew of the interesting projects like the Google Flu Project and other applications that were built on census data, the US Census Bureau said they had no visibility into how the data was being used&mdash;something that changed with the introduction of a feedback loop around the current Census APIs. The US Census Bureau had realized the awareness making data available as web APIs introduces, bringing consumers closer, and planting the seeds for more value exchange to be flowing both ways, from the Census Bureau to consumers of the survey data, and then back to the Census Bureau in the form of discussion&mdash;eventually, with more investment it could be something significantly more than just feedback from developers.</p>
<h3>Managing Public Data Like We Manage Public Lands</h3>
<p>In the United States we enjoy an amazing patchwork of public lands and parks that are owned by all citizens and managed by our Department of Interior. These lands are available to every citizen to use. While some are free to use, most require parking and other fees to take advantage of the trails, roads, parking lots, and other ways we engage with public parks and lands. While public lands are available to every citizen, if you are McDonalds and you want to begin selling burgers at the Grand Canyon you have to obtain permits and even share revenue with the federal government. Why are digital public assets different than physical public assets? Public lands require ongoing maintenance even though they already exist. Public data&nbsp; requires maintenance and further investment to keep fresh, alive, and evolving. While Google may pay more taxes than the average citizen, it doesn&rsquo;t pay more into the government to fund public data than the value it extracts, comparatively to the value extracted by individual citizens. Current views on public data from the tech sector are exploitative and extractive, and do not respect or give back to the valuable digital commons that are emerging. Similar to the reasons why public lands exist in the first place, we need to protect the value that exists within public data resources. There should always be a commercial aspect of why public data exists in the first place, but like public lands it has to be a managed revenue sharing relationship that allows for a shared value expanson between the public and private sector. Times have changed, and it is time that we begin to look at our public data differently, otherwise like our environment we might find us in an unsustainable state.</p>
<h3>Stepping Back to Look At The Public API Management Fundamentals</h3>
<p>Shifting gears beyond our example products API, helping illustrate the potential of APIs coupled with API management in the public sector, let&rsquo;s consider how a 311 API can be offered by a municipality or other civic organization, providing programmatic access to non-emergency incidents that occur across a city and the neighborhoods within. Our digital resource in this case is a 311 service request, providing access to a list of requests that have been made via official municipal 311 channels (ie. Phone or Web). Now that we have a published 311 API providing a listing of service requests, we can also stand up an API management solution in front of it, not because we are looking to make a profit, but because we are looking to secure resources, and maximize the value exchange that is going on between municipal API providers and the different types of API consumers that would be interested in the data. We will still offer a limit on free public API calls by IP address, limiting to 100 per day, then requiring users who want more to signup and get access to a free tier that is rate limited at a much higher rate of 1000 per day. We will also then establish higher tiers of access that require API consumers pay for access to APIs beyond 1000 requests per day. Also providing some additional API endpoints providing access to historical data, multi-city sources, or other valuable dimensions for companies and researchers looking to understand what is happening within communities at scale. There is a wealth of knowledge within the 311 service requests across communities, telling stories of class, race, corruption, and what people are needing to achieve a certain quality of life. This data should be available across every city, and the stewards of this valuable data should be able to serve their constituents with free access to the data, but then also generate much needed revenue from commercial providers who are looking to make a buck off of public data. Modern approaches to delivering APIs and API management solutions provide us with the mechanisms we need to make public data available, but also protect the value that it possesses. Ironically, using the same mechanisms that commercial providers are using to protect their own digital resources, and maximize value generation occurring via their own platform.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_3.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<h3>In 2010 It Was All Tech Leaders Doing APIs</h3>
<p>In 2010, when I first started studying the API sector full time I was studying leading API providers like Salesforce, Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook. Enterprise organizations were still doing the much more rigid version of APIs called service oriented architecture (SOA), where the next generation tech companies were beginning to embrace the web and leveraging HTTP APIs to power their platforms. But then, &ldquo;API as a product&rdquo; companies like Twilio, Stripe, and others had emerged to show the potential of generating entirely new types of revenue from APIs. These are the companies in which the world of APIs were cultivated from, providing the first looks at how APIs can be used to make not just data available via simple web APIs, but how you could transform existing digital objects into small bite size digital commodities that can be exchanged via HTTP, at a pricing model that was affordable to a wide audience. These are just a handful of the companies who showed that APIs could be used to connect everyday physical objects to the web, helping us better measure weather, water quality, our health and activity. However it would still be a few years before this new formula for defining digital services and making them available to the market would break out of the tech echo chamber, and be something that people would be talking about beyond Silicon Valley. The early days were all about defining a blueprint that was simple enough that others could follow, refining, distilling, and standardizing how we define our digital assets, then securely and cost effectively make them available to the masses.</p>
<h3>By 2016 APIs Were Going Mainstream Across All Business Sectors</h3>
<p>By 2016, I wasn&rsquo;t just studying and talking to the tech sector elite when it came to doing APIs. I was talking to the Capital One, Mutual of Omaha, Ford Motor Company, Center for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS), and other public and private sector enterprise entities. The mainstream had woken up to the need for doing web APIs, and doing them well across a large enterprise organization. I do not spend my days convincing people that they should be doing APIs, everyone is doing them. I spend my days educating people about what APIs are, and what the benefits of doing them well are. In a digital world all types of businesses are being forced to become a technology company, and are required&nbsp; to redefine who they are in a market that operates entirely on the web. APIs are a ubiquitous aspect of doing business today, but unfortunately many still don&rsquo;t fully see the API pipes used beneath everything we do each day. Many developers who are building web, mobile, and device applications with APIs do not fully see and understand what APIs are. APIs have gone mainstream, but there is still a lot of work to be done when it comes to helping companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies understand how to do APIs simply and consistently, making them something everyone can access and put to work as part of business operations, or within your own personal realm to take more control over your own professional life.</p>
<h3>In 2020 APIs Are Making a Mark on Everyone&rsquo;s Life</h3>
<p>In 2020, everyone is being impacted by APIs. APIs power all those apps on our phones, connecting our homes and cars, and are perpetually automating and connecting the world around us. APIs impact our world at the local level by helping us order food for delivery, all the way up to influencing how we vote in an election. APIs are impacting everyone&rsquo;s life and defining who we are in this new digital world, bit by bit, but also increasingly defining who we are in the physical world. APIs are much like our financial system, where not everyone needs to understand how the entire banking system works, but everyone should have a handle on where their personal data, content, and media lives, and who has access to, much in the same way we have a handle on where our cash, credit, and debt lives, and who has access to this financial layer of our world. Our personal and professional lives are increasingly defined by APIs, and the more awareness of APIs we have, the more control we will have over creating, managing, moving around, and even deleting our digital bits when we want. With an awareness of this layer of our life we will posses more control over who we are online and offline, without it, we are open to exploitation, abuse, and influencing by the myriad of people and corporations who are wielding power online today&mdash;giving over a piece of who we are to an increasingly minority group of tech elite.</p>
<h3>APIs Are Behind Every Application We Are Using</h3>
<p>Every application on our desktops, laptops, and mobile phones use APIs to communicate with the platform behind them. If you proxy your laptop or mobile phone with a piece of software or hardware that records every bit of traffic coming and going, you will see a steady stream of API calls being made behind the scenes. Hundreds or thousands of API calls are made each day with or without you consciously triggering each request. Once you turn on software like <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a> you will see a steady stream of API calls being made from each application even when you aren&rsquo;t doing anything. Chatting with their platforms, syncing information, pinging home, and doing a variety of other tasks you had no idea were even occurring. Then once you actually begin to surf a variety of web pages you&rsquo;ll see multiple API calls occurring for each page you visit, calling content and advertising APIs, populating widgets and other elements on the screen. Web and mobile applications behave the same way, using APIs to publish content, and submit your messages, upload your images and videos, allowing you to do what you do on the web each day. It is no exaggeration to say that APIs are everywhere in 2020. Parking meters, gas pumps, cash registers, signs, surveillance cameras, and other common objects are connected to the Internet using APIs, and while everyone doesn&rsquo;t have to understand how it all works, there should be at least enough awareness that APIs exist to be able to understand that our data and personal information is being shared.</p>
<h3>All Of The Top Brands You Know Are Using APIs</h3>
<p>If you look down the list of Fortune 500 companies you will see all of the companies working to redefine themselves using APIs in 2020. Starbucks, Nike, Ford, McDonalds, AT&amp;T, Fedex, and others are actively using APIs to deliver the web and mobile apps they are using to expand the reach of their businesses. Some are even embracing public API models, allowing 3rd party developers and trusted partners to take data, content, and media and build entirely new applications with the valuable resources&mdash;syndicating, extending, and franchising their valuable digital resources. Top brands and platforms are using APIs to define their businesses, but they are also using them to define their competition and customers. APIs are how we define, track, measure, and reach our customers in a digital world. Management, automation, and orchestration of advertising and marketing is becoming commonplace within any business, demonstrating another evolving API landscape across enterprise organizations that may not immediately reflect internal IT APIs, external public APIs, but are actively defining brands trying to compete online, and the markets in which they are battling for. APIs are how brands are iterating on proven business models lie marketing, advertising, communication, lobbying, finances, and other bedrock aspects of how we do business, pushing them to reflect a much more fast moving stream of ongoing digital transformations that brands must keep up with in order to stay relevant.</p>
<h3>With Many Online Platform We Are The Customers</h3>
<p>APIs helped usher in an entirely new way to sell software called software as a service (SaaS), defined by their tiered, pay for what you use pricing plans, which were&nbsp; just a reflection of the API management defined pricing plans we defined earlier. All of this expansion increased the number and types of software services available across the landscape while widening the number of services we subscribe to as part of our regular business operations or personal experience. All SaaS companies are using APIs to deliver their services, and a majority of them offer up partner and 3rd party access to those APIs, with APIs also defining the ability for the many different services you use to work with each other via API integration. In this new SaaS economy we are the customer. We are directly sold a service plan that we put in our credit card, and we get the level of service we paid for, subscribing to it for an agreed upon period of time. We are the customer in this SaaS driven world. APIs are defining the underlying resources being delivered, allowing us to access the CRM, document, image, video, or other service as a subscription through a useful web and mobile application, while ensuring they integrate intelligently with each other using their developer APIs. Shifting forever how software gets built, sold, maintained, and evolved, allowing us to subscribe to the services we desire, and effectively manage our digital resources across many different platforms.</p>
<h3>With Some Online Platforms We Are The Product</h3>
<p>If a platform is offering their services for free via a web or mobile application and via an API, it is likely that instead of being the customer, end users are actually the product. Platforms are increasingly using web and mobile applications to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE the digital bits of their end users, while then leveraging APIs to make the user generated content, profile, location, and other data available to partners and 3rd party developers. On these free API-driven platforms, the end users are the product. They are what is being harvested and sold. Keeping platform users on a digital hamster wheel, generating valuable digital resources that can then be organized, enriched, and then sold and used for a variety of applicaiton. There are many ways in which our personal data and online activity is organized, aggregated, and packaged up for sale to the highest bidder online. APIs play a significant role in helping define this landscape ranging from powerful advertising APIs on Facebook, Twitter, and Google, to these 3rd party APIs that allow for surveilling, defining, and targeting platform users across the web, and increasingly our physical worlds. All by oneself our data isn&rsquo;t worth a whole lot, but in aggregate, and over time, this value becomes very significant to defining emerging markets and the next generation of businesses. Leveraging APIs to produce and access the rich data, content, media, and algorithms that are the future commodities of the digital economy.</p>
<h3>GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Are Used To Define Us</h3>
<p>API providers use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to define their digital capabilities. As an API consumer, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE define who I am and what I am building on top of the digital resources I am consuming from one or many different API providers. As an end user of these platforms and applications, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are how my digital self is put to work each day on the digital hamster wheel. Defining what we create and consume as we move through our days. Each API defines how we express ourselves online. The POST of a Tweet on Twitter. The POST of a video on Youtube. The GET our bank account balance. The PUT of our LinkedIn profile when we are looking for a new job. We DELETE that Instagram photo from when we drank too much last night. HTTP methods define an API provider, and which methods an API consumer puts to use will tell a story about what they are looking to do across their applications. These two dimensions of the API conversation have the most control over what is happening, and unfortunately most end users are left to just operate within whatever they are given, letting each platform and application developer define who they are, and what becomes of the data, content, and media that gets generated each day. Depending on the type of API resource being served up, such as a message, image, or video, and the platform making it available, each HTTP method can mean a variety of things. Adding a video on Youtube from a birthday party versus from a black lives matter protest. An image of your baby versus an image of your car as it drives through an intersection after being captured via a traffic camera. HTTP methods via APIs are shaping our behavior each day, and defining who we are, as we work and live in an Internet connected world. To help you see the importance of this conversation, think about those psychological tests Cambridge Analytica employed to harvest the data of millions of Facebook users via their API. That should help illuminate the psychological implications of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE via APIs at scale each day.</p>
<h3>APIs Allow Us To Define Personal Digital Assets</h3>
<p>APIs are defining our personal digital assets from our bank accounts to our family photos. Our personal lives are spread across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The digital exhaust from our days are captured via the desktop, web, and mobile applications we operated each day. Creating text, images, video, audio, location information, and other virtual bits that tell our narrative each day, and can be used to potentially predict our futures. More and more of our lives are being stored in the cloud and in the datacenter rather than in our closets, photo albums, and garages. The last twenty years of our lives has increasingly been captured, digitized, and made accessible online by us, or by companies, institutions, and government agencies targeting us. APIs define our digital reality as it is created and transmitted into the cloud for further processing, packaging up, and used in other systems and applications. APIs are being used to capture, define, and guide us throughout the world each day. And this is just our personal world. APIs are increasingly being used to capture, define, and direct our professional lives as well. In both our personal and professional capacities an awareness of APIs, and the ability to put them to work can have a profound impact on how much control we have over our personal and professional worlds. APIs can give us an edge in getting hired for a job, or being able to find success with a project at work. APIs can help us take more control over our health care data and our finances. Knowing that a SaaS solution you use has an API, then realizing you can use it to keep two separate services in sync, will incrementally give you more control over your online reality at home and work.</p>

<h3>APIs Allow Us To Define Our Corporate Digital Assets</h3>
<p>APIs define enterprise digital assets and capabilities. They provide the menu of what is possible when it comes to a company doing business online, and the maturity of APIs and the overall lifecycle employed to deliver APIs will define how fast a company is able to evolve, pivot, and respond to changing business conditions. If you want to see the important role APIs play as the menu for what is possible with an enterprise organization just look at Facebook or Amazon APIs. An API menu for how you change the world, and dominate the technological landscape. APIs are how you break down the monolithic business processes and software development of the last fifty years and you begin redefining, organizing, automating, and orchestrating with them in new and innovative ways. API management is how companies map out this API landscape that exists across an organization, and optimize how those API resources are made available to internal, partner, and public entities for integrating into other systems and applications. APIs are how businesses move their enterprise organizations forward. APIs are how businesses work with their partners. APIs are how businesses define and engage with their customers. The savviest companies out there today have been using APIs to transform themselves to not just stay relevant, but stay ahead of the pack for the last twenty years. It is how Amazon went from an e-commerce bookseller to dominating so many different business verticals while also powering half of the Internet with their Amazon Web Services. APIs are how Twitter goes from a fun social media platform to the global nervous system for the planet. APIs are how corporations are defining themselves, and redefining global markets today.</p>
<h3>APIs Are Defining Our Institutional Digital Assets</h3>
<p>Government agencies, universities, non-governmental organizations, and other institutions have all been leveraging the web for a greater part of the last twenty-five years, and those who are further along in their journey have realized that APIs are essential to their mission as well.. Most government agencies have APIs of some kind, and you will see more APIs emerging out of universities, first via their libraries, then from IT, faculty, and even student organizations and projects. All of this movement is just one slice of the digital pie when it comes to institutional adoption of APIs, where just like the rest of us, they also are increasingly dependent on APIs for the software as a service (SaaS) solutions they use each day. Leveraging Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and other API-driven platforms to operate each day. Institutions in 2020 are both API providers and consumers, but many are only becoming aware of this recently. Most institutions are 5-10 years behind the rest of the private sector when it comes to Internet technology, leaving them ripe for vendor lock-in and extraction of value when it comes to the digital resources they possess. It is hard for institutions to say no to Google or Microsoft. Institutions find it difficult to avoid usage of social media, file sharing, and other popular tech platforms. Which leaves them open to some of the same predatory platform practices that the rest of us face when it comes to mining and harvesting of our data, just the stakes are much higher when you are a municipality, federal agency, or higher education institution. In 2020 all institutions are doing APIs, but like many companies they just aren&rsquo;t doing them well, or as part of any overarching strategy, leaving institutions behind when it comes to the digital evolution.</p>
<h3>APIs Are Used To Define Our Public Digital Assets</h3>
<p>The public commons began changing substantially after it moved online. In the early days of the World Wide Web (WWW) things were much more free and open, and the web held such promise when it came to information sharing that benefits all, instead of just a handful of corporate entities. While there is a growing number of public data APIs emerging on a regular basis today, we are not seeing the coverage, maturity, and scale that we will need to have the desired impact on both the economy and the institutions behind them. Public data platforms rarely see the investment they need to be successful, with many commercial entities taking more than they give back in direct investment, as well as indirect tax funding of the public commons via trusted institutions. Public data and content is a vital and an increasingly valuable resource in free markets, but we don&rsquo;t always see the investment and protection required to keep these resources available in a sustainable way while ensuring the value generation is going to the widest possible audience it can. If high value public data makes its way into the markets, it is just as likely to be captured and locked up by commercial entities, than it is to be successfully published as self-service, tiered access resources ensuring those who can&rsquo;t afford access can get what they need, and those with more resources can also get what they need, but they also are required contribute back in some way that helps ensure an public API is sustainable for every stakeholder. Public data doesn&rsquo;t just mean all data should just be publicly available. Public data means that it should be accessible and benefit the entire public. We&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface when it comes to enriching the public commons with rich data, content, media, and algorithms, and with the right investment and protections in place, similar to the ones we&rsquo;ve public in place for our physical public assets, we can ensure public digital assets continue to be published, evolve, and benefit both the public as well as the private sector.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Open&rdquo; and &ldquo;Public&rdquo; Can Mean Many Things on the Web</h3>
<p>The words &ldquo;open&rdquo; and &ldquo;public&rdquo; mean different things to different people, both on and offline. Open and public lands will elicit different responses from individuals you ask from Wyoming to New York, as well as if you are asking a small outdoor tour operator and a big oil and gas company. It is even more diverse in a digital word. Google views US Census data very differently than a small grassroots organization trying to improve their local community or region. Open in many entrepreneurial circles means open for business and free in the monetary sense, where others might see it more about access and ability to use. Open source, open data, and open APIs are seen by the majority of consumers as something you take and use, and to a much smaller group as something you contribute back to. It is easy to see the web as about giving, because all the users of the web are getting the information they seek. When in reality there lies a lot more nuance to how data, content, and media gets created, shared, bought, and sold. It is easy to pretend that open or public data should remain free of charge, but data is rarely ever in a finished state, and it costs money to gather, organize, maintain, evolve, and serve up public data. Yes, taxes pay for this to occur, but like public lands and other physical infrastructure, there is further value to be generated and maintained. Value that shouldn&rsquo;t just be siphoned off to a few, but be something that benefits everyone. Companies are using APIs and public APIs to redefine themselves in a digital age, employing not just APIs, but sophisticated API management practices to generate as much possible value as they can from their digital resources, while keeping the lion share of the value for themselves. There is no reason that public institutions can&rsquo;t do the same to manage their own digital resources, but also leverage API management to maximize the value exchange, while also keeping the lion share of the value within the institution, helping them better achieve their mission.</p>
<h3>Acknowledging the Role Public Resources Play In The Evolution Of Internet Technology</h3>
<p>Everything we do on the web today owes a debt to public resources. The Internet was born out of federal government funding, and built on the backs of public universities. Despite popular liberatarian belief that the web is some free market utopia, it is built primarily on the backs of publicly subsidized infrastructure and programs, from our telecommunications network to grant money making companies like Google possible. The technology sector depends on public resources, and it is important that we acknowledge the role that digital data, content, media, algorithms, and other public resources play in making all of this working. Think about what GPS has done for the tech sector. That is what strong and healthy public data commons can do for the future of our economy. APIs are how corporations are redefining the landscape, and it will be how organizations, institutions, and government agencies redefine the landscape as well. Allowing the public sector to employ some of the same practices and tooling to deliver value around digital resources, empowering the next generation of applications, while also generating enough revenue to sufficiently fund the future we all envision. Public digital resources are a critical base for many commercial applications, and it also provides an essential counterbalance for end users of these applications that doesn&rsquo;t always exist in free markets--requiring other non-commercial entities to step in and help keep everything balanced.</p>
<p>APIs are defining who we are in 2020. Enterprise organizations are aware of this. Developers are aware of this. End users and consumers of online technology are not so aware that every moment of every day is being defined as a never ending stream of API requests. It is widely recognized that data is seen as the &ldquo;new oil&rdquo; by entrepreneurs. An endless resource that can be mined, extracted, and transformed into an endless array of new products. The only problem with this analogy is that tihs new resource exists in each of us and the public institutions that we give rise to as a society, which means there is good money to be made in mindlessly mining and extracting value from our personal lives and the public commons in which we all depend on to live our lives. I am not advocating that we employ APIs for everything in our personal worlds and the public space because I think APIs are a good idea. I am advocating this because we have to become more API aware and literate to help us better navigate the digital world around us. APIs already exist--we need to be more aware of them. I am also advocating that we use APIs and some of the same API management practices use by the private sector to help quantify and protect public digital resources from exploitation by commercial interests. Our economy depends on a steady flow of data and other resources from the public sector, and APIs are how we are going to continue to quantify, defend, and evolve this value generation, ensuring that our collective public resources continue to benefit everyone, and not just the few technically savvy entities dominating the global business landscape in 2020.</p>

<p class="p1">I am using Postman to do more governance on my OpenAPI definitions as part of their API lifecycle. This is a top request of customers I am talking to, so I want to get better at make these individual API lifecycle capabilities much more modular and reusable as Postman collections. In Postman, the OpenAPI is the truth for each API contract throughout the API lifecycle, but each collection has become how you automate each stop along the API lifecycle. Resulting in me needing the OpenAPI for each API I am automating, and being able to pull the OpenAPI truth using the Postman API within each collection I am defining to mock, document, test, and govern each API.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.postman.com/apievangelist/workspace/openapi/documentation/35240-55e13485-0280-46ad-b24e-19ae293af5f6">You can find a single collection for pulling the OpenAPI for an API from the Postman API using it&rsquo;s name</a> (boy that is a mouthful). The collection is designed to abstract away three separate API calls into a single request. Ideally Postman will provide a similar API endpoint, but until that happens I have this collection to help make things easier. The documentation for the collection should provide you with everything you need to get up and running with the collection, pulling the API into a Postman environment for reuse. It is up to you to decide what you will do with the OpenAPI after that, possibly making multiple changes, and then saving back to Postman using the API.</p>

<p class="p1">I am managing more collections via hundreds of different workspaces lately. As part of my work I am needing to make bulk changes to collections based upon a variety of properties. Sometimes I need to find and replace variables, and other times I need to rewrite or append to the descriptions for each collection. Whil I am sure eventually there will be capabilities to do some of this via the Postman interface, I find creating maintenance collections that use the Postman API to do what I need is the quickest way to get what I want, without having to wait for the Postman road map to catch up to my work.</p>
<p class="p1">I have a whole list of automated changes I want to make to Postman collections that I am generating from OpenAPI definitions, and to help me quickly work through this list I wanted to create a base collection that I could use to augment with common and some unique scripts for making changes to any collection, and then save the results back using the Postman API. <a href="https://www.postman.com/apievangelist/workspace/collections/documentation/35240-1eb1d94c-0f99-444e-bcd7-d0f146c1be8d">You can find this collection in my public workspace for managing my collection work</a>, where you can fork it and apply to the changes you need to make to collections.

<p class="p1">I am having an increasing number of conversations around how the leading API specifications work together, and what the role of each are when it comes to various stops along the API lifecycle. To help drive conversations I wanted to create a single blog post I can link to, while also loading up all of my fresh thoughts about API specs into my old brain. All of these API specifications are continuing to see massive adoption across API providers and consumers, and they are all in forward motion being iterated upon by the specification owners, so it helps to pause once or twice a year and take a look at what is going on, and work to understand how all of these API specifications work together (or don&rsquo;t).</p>
<h3>What Are The Leading API Specifications</h3>
<p class="p1">There are a handful of API specifications that are relevant to delivering APIs in 2020, helping provide a vocabulary for stakeholders in the process to use when describing what each API does, so that a common definition can be applied through the API lifecycle, consistently delivering API infrasture across many teams. Here are the API specifications I am focusing on as part of my API Specification Toolbox conversations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a></strong> - A specification for defining the surface area of HTTP 1.1 web APIs using JSON or YAML.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI</a></strong> - A specification for defining the surface area of HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, TCP, MQTT, and AMQP APIs using JSON or YAML.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a></strong> - A specification for defining the underlying models in use for APIs, adopted by both OpenAPI and AsyncAPI.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/collection/">Postman Collections</a></strong> - A specification for defining executable collections of HTTP 1.1 web APIs for running in services and tooling</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/">Postman Environments</a></strong> -<span>&nbsp;A specification for defining key / value pairs that get applied across collections at execute time.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://raml.org/">RAML</a></strong> - A YAML format for describing the surface area of your HTTP 1.1 APIs, and the the underlying objects.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a></strong> - A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries on top of data and content.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a></strong><span>&nbsp; </span>- A messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information across web services.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">SOAP has been around for a number of years, but OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, RAML, and GraphQL have emerged within the latest decade. OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema have all evolved in concert with each other, where RAML, GraphQL, and SOAP developed in isolation. I am including all of these because I think they need to be discussed in relationship to each other, and we need to work harder to understand the overlapping layers of how we deliver APIs, as well as the common needs when it comes to the lifecycle usage of these API specifications(ie. design, documentation, testing). The success of OpenAPI ,AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema is largely due to overlapping, sharing, and reuse across the specifications, which sets a tone for how things should work we move forward and iterate upon each of these specifications, or introduce new ones.</p>
<h3>Reasons Why Each Specification Sees Adoption</h3>
<p class="p1">There are a number of reasons why API providers and API service providers adopt each of these specifications, but here are a few of the most common reasons why you will find these API specification in use across the enterprise. Hopefully these help you make a decision between what specification you are using.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">Of course, there are many other reasons why developers are adopting these API specifications, but this covers the primary reasons behind API providers and consumers are choosing to adopt each one. While there are other specifications that are relevant to the conversation, to help keep some immediate conversations focused, these are the API specifications that are dominating the conversation today, and for me are relevant to what I am doing as part of the evolution of the Postman platform.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">The majority of folks I am talking to are producing OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman collections as part of their regular API operations. These are the API specifications I am most concerned with fleshing out, as well as mapping to a modern API lifecycle. I&rsquo;ll be producing more storytelling around each of these specifications as I work to flesh out each of their ecosystems and audiences, and work to move some balls forward within the realm of each specification. The next decade is going to be pretty active when it comes to moving these specifications forward, but more importantly, developing the most meaningful services and tooling that help move APIs forward across the API lifecycle which supports each of these API specifications.</p>

<p>Managing the size of an OpenAPI is a common challenge for API development teams. I have regular conversations with teams about the ways in which you can minimize the overall scope of an API, breaking things down into more manageable chunks, while also reducing redundancy&mdash;then encouraging reuse. Like other dimensions of the API space there are differing opinions on whether it is better to have one single OpenAPI for all of your APIs, or whether it makes more sense to break things down into well defined bounded contexts. You can see this debate occurring in Monolith vs Microservices, and MonoRepo vs Multi-Repo discussions across the API space. In this game, there are no right or wrong answers, just different approaches that work well for different organizations, teams, and individuals. My goal is to help folks understand the trade-offs by informing them enough to make their own decisions and set into motion API design practices that keep the API factory floor moving along.</p>
<p>The size of your APIs matter. The size of your OpenAPI for your APIs matters. The scope, complexity, and consistency of your APIs will define how easy they are to maintain and put to work. Organizations that do not use OpenAPI struggle with being able to define the API landscape at all, let alone being able to define the scope of individual APIs or groups of APIs. It is common for API providers who are moving into the OpenAPI realm to slam into the brick wall of API scope right away, realizing their OpenAPI definitions are too big to work with in some services and tooling, and become a maze of complexity when it comes to maintenance and consumption. While there are many ways your API design practices can reduce or at least better define the scope of your APIs and resulting APIs, there are a handful of ways you can slice and dice your APIs up to make them easier to manage, or settle in with accepting that there is one monolith OpenAPI to rule them all!</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-dark-city-street.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Paths</h3>
<p>The design of your resource-centric HTTP APIs will help or hinder your ability to spread the scope of your APIs across multiple files. Depending on the underlying schema model, and the types of resources being made available, as well as the API design training and guidance given to teams, the number and scope of API paths being served up will vary. If you have a coherent resource and sub-resource strategy it becomes easier to break things down into more manageable groupings. Helping break your APIs and the OpenAPIs that define them into much more meaningful and reusable chunks. API paths will define your OpenAPI journey, and define the complexity and breakdown of your API lifecycle, so make sure you are thinking about the design of API paths across all teams throughout your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>How you use your HTTP methods as part of the API design process will help you downstream when it comes to breaking things down in your OpenAPI. Efficient use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE will help your OpenAPIs be more coherent, but it can also dictate the scope of other OpenAPI elements like parameters, headers, and the schema used within your request bodies. Your API design choices impact the overall scope of your API, something you might not realize until you've had to spend the time generating or crafting a complete OpenAPI definition for your API. How you express the methods of your API will help you define the scope of your APIs, the OpenAPIs that define them, as well as all the downstream effects of delivering and consuming an API&mdash;make sure you have a plan for this layer.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>Adding to the dimensions of how your API design will define the scope of your API and OpenAPI, your usage of path and query parameters, as well as headers will shape how big or small your APIs are. Having an overall organization API design strategy will help lay the groundwork for the scope of the parameter layer of your APIs. Using common parameters for as much of this dimension will help you reuse parameters across APIs, and centralize them as part of your OpenAPI. Each unique parameter will add baggage to the surface area of an API, which is something that will have to be defined in an OpenAPI, adding to the overall scope of each API and resulting OpenAPI. Parameter sprawl is an easy trap to fall into, but once you spend the time laying out an overall API design strategy it is something that will become much more manageable for your team.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-surveillance-over-the-city.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>OpenAPI helps teams map out the surface area of their APIs so that they can see it. OpenAPI tags then allow you to start defining the bounded contexts in which each API path and method operates in. Providing you with the ability to begin slicing and dicing legacy API infrastructure into more meaningful groupings which can then possibly be segmented into separate OpenAPI files, and then versioned and evolved to become more in alignment with the overall API design strategy. Helping you define, understand, manage, evolve, then sensibly reduce or increase scope across the API landscape. OpenAPI tags are how you are going to do this work, and begin making sense of the API landscape that exists across your organization, but then also be able to become more coherent in how you community across teams when it comes to delivering and consuming APIs.</p>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>The components object represents the greatest opportunity for API providers to be moving from Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0, and begin to get a handle on the scope of APIs, and your OpenAPI. The OpenAPI components object lets you centralize common schema responses, parameters, examples, request bodies, headers, security schemes, links, and callbacks, and then just reference them across your OpenAPI wherever they are needed with a $ref. This component centralization and reuse will become your biggest ally when it comes to managing the scope of your API. Components provide you with a single reusable toolbox of the components you need to apply across each of your APIs, providing an in-file components library that helps you logically define the scope of your API with well planned lego bricks rather than every part of your OpenAPI being a custom block.</p>
<h3>Files</h3>
<p>Once you begin getting your API design house in order, and get more organized about how you use the OpenAPI specification to map out your API landscape, including having your APIs well tagged with logical bounded contexts, you will become more efficient with breaking your OpenAPIs up into separate files. Leveraging your tag work you can split up monolith OpenAPI documents into separate OpenAPI files which can then be used independently of each other. Helping you load balance the scope of your OpenAPI across many files, providing a well organized selection of smaller, more precise OpenAPIs rather than relying on everything being in a single file. Of course, there are tradeoffs to having to navigate multiple files, but it depends on whether you like your complexity vertically or horizontally--either way you will have to work through the paths, schema, and other parts and pieces.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-dark-city-buildings.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>External $ref</h3>
<p>Once you have things broken into separate files you can begin to use external references to each of the moving parts. One place to begin is to break out the schema for your APIs as separate JSON Schema files which can be referenced using an external $ref where they are applied within an OpenAPI, but then you can also use this individual JSON Schema files for validation and other purposes across your operations. External references allow you to break things up into separate files, potentially setting up a centralized components library, which can just be referenced from wherever they are needed. In addition to the schema sprawl introduced by this approach, not all OpenAPI enabled tooling will support external references, requiring the rehydration of files before imported or put to work within services and tooling, further balancing out the tradeoffs around API scope.</p>
<h3>Start Managing OpenAPI Scope Today</h3>
<p>I know that many folks will just opt for the easier route of having a single monolith OpenAPI, but that will just push the technical debt and complexity down the road. At some point you will have to manage OpenAPI scope and you are better off starting as early as you can. As stated several times, having an organizational wide API design strategy will inform how you manage the scope of your API, but thinking about scope at the path, method, and parameter levels, while leveraging tags and components to optimize the scope of each of your OpenAPIs can bring a lot of benefits. You can still remain a mono OpenAPI, but actively work to manage scope. However, if you have thousands of APIs being developed, iterated upon, and delivered across your organization I highly recommend beginning investing in separate files and external references, as this is where you will begin to see the biggest bang for your buck when it comes to managing the scope of your OpenAPIs.</p>
<p>The scope and complexity of your OpenAPI will be a mirror of your API scope and complexity, which is a mirror of your organizational scope and complexity. If creating and managing an OpenAPI seems unwieldy it is because the design and complexity of your API has become unwieldy. Most people who begin on their OpenAPI journey do so to deliver API Documentation, but then they quickly realize how OpenAPI is much for than just documenting what is going on for consumers. Managing your OpenAPI becomes about managing your API operations and the lifecycle you employ to deliver, iterate upon, and support your APIs. OpenAPI scope is often an illusion based upon operating for years without being able to see the entire API landscape--once you generate that first OpenAPI and begin to get intimate with all the moving parts, you quickly begin to see a bigger picture where scope is more about the lack of visibility and manage practices in the past, which is something that becomes radically amplified by the maturing of your API design and governance strategy&mdash;but that is another story.</p>

<p>title: ‘Using API Mocks as Part of an API-First Workflow’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mock_story_1.png</p>

<hr />

<p class="p1">I owe an answer on my thoughts about mocking APIs to my coworker Andy, and I don&rsquo;t want to incur his wrath, so I figured I&rsquo;d write it up and share wider as I was getting back to him. I don&rsquo;t have the original question cause it was in a Zoom chat, but it was something to the effect of using mock APIs to move forward the design of an API versus using them to drive application development conversations as well as push testing forward. I&rsquo;d say that using a mock as part of an API-first design process reflects where I am pushing mocks to work for me more often. I still use them to demo, prototype applications, and as part of API testing, but using them to actually evolve the contract for an API is really where I feel that a mock server will really shine, and can shift how we are delivering APIs. However, there is also a lot of education and awareness needed before I get all the folks I am having conversations with on board with this concept&mdash;to help in these efforts I wanted to flesh out<span>&nbsp;</span>a little about what I mean when it comes to API-first usage of mock APIs.</p>
<h3>Mocking From Postman Collections</h3>
<p class="p1">The first part of this conversation involves the concept that you can generate a mock server from any Postman collection. There is a three step process involved with producing a mock API in Postman using a collection. First you create a collection with the path and parameters you would like to use as the definition of the API you are mocking.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mock_story_1.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have your path you can select examples up near the send button and add a new example for this request. It will take your path with parameters and map to a new example where you can add a JSON example to represent what should be returned by your mock server for an example.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mock_story_2.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">You should now have a single request, and the example that should be returned when the API request is sent. Now you can select to mock the collection, giving it a name, mapping to an environment, making private, and a handful of other settings that will help us manage the mocked representation of our API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mock_story_3.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">Once complete you will be given a URL for the mock server, which can be added to the environment or collection and used for any requests. This is the baseline of mocking of an API using Postman, which can be used as part of an API-first process, but there are a couple of other dimensions to this that will help truly strengthen mocking as a critical stop along an API-first lifecycle.</p>
<h3>Generating Mock Collections From OpenAPI</h3>
<p class="p1">For the first part of this I am just generating a mock from a standalone collection. Using Postman you can also generate a collection from an OpenAPI definition, and identify the purpose of that collection is for mocking. If you identify it as existing for the purpose of a mock servers when generating it will link the OpenAPI, as well as generate the mock server for you upon generate.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mock_story_4.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">This gives you the ability to derive one or many collections from an OpenAPI, using the OpenAPI as a central truth in the discussion. Then use those collections to power mock APIs, as well as a variety of other usage. Which helps define the difference between OpenAPI and Postman collections, but also demonstrates how they can be used in tandem, opening up other doors in the API-First conversation.</p>
<h3>Validating Mock Collections Against OpenAPI</h3>
<p class="p1">With my mock API collection(s) derived from the OpenAPI, Postman knows that my collections are linked to the API contract and I can choose to validate them, letting me know if my mock collections, or collection used for any other purpose are in alignment with the central contract.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mock_story_5.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">When there are issues it will show them to me, and when the collections are in alignment it will show a green checkbox letting me know each of them are in alignment, helping keep every stop along the API lifecycle in alignment with the central OpenAPI contract.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mock_story_6.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">When issues are found between my collection(s) and the OpenAPI, I can review these issue one by one, fixing them individual, or opt to select all changes and make them all at once, forcing the changes on the collection, treating the OpenAPI as the truth and each collection as an API lifecycle endpoint that needs regular syncing.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mock_story_7.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">These changes are downstream from your OpenAPI, meaning you can only add or remove changes to the generated collection, and not pull changes from your collections into your OpenAPI. This allows you to keep iterating upon the OpenAPI contract, and then push those changes downstream. Next, I will be exploring using how collections can be used as part of the contract iteration process to help clarify what is possible and what is not currently.</p>
<h3>Iterating Upon the OpenAPI Contract</h3>
<p class="p1">Bringing this home to a point where I can intelligently respond to Andy's question about using a mock API as part of the API-first process. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yes</strong></span>, you can use it as part of the API-first conversation. I can generate a collection(s) from my OpenAPI contract and publish a mock server, along with documentation to share with stakeholders that I am collaborating with in an API-first way. This mocked API plus documentation will help make things more tangible and real for the conversation, but it falls short of where I&rsquo;d like to be with allowing these stakeholders to actually fork and submit pull requests on the collections I am using to drive the mocked API. Meaning that I can&rsquo;t allow stakeholders in the API-first development process to fork and submit pull requests to iterate upon the design of the API, they can only do this with stops along the API lifecycle like docs, testing etc. If someone wants to submit a pull request on the OpenAPI contract for an API and suggest changes to the structure and design of the API they&rsquo;d have to do this via Github and make sure the OpenAPI is synced with Postman, and then Postman validation would alert and potentially sync any changes with downstream collection.</p>
<p class="p1">Ok, I think I have this loaded up in my old brain now. My immediate answer to Andy was going to be hell yes, just use mocks to drive the API-first development of an API. But, this comes with some limitations (for the time being) that needed to also be noted. We can use the mock to drive the API-first conversation, and we can be generating mocks and docs for each iteration, but we can&rsquo;t be using collections, and pull / merge requests against a collection to drive and sync with each iteration on the OpenAPI. My initial response is to push on the product team to prioritize this &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; sync capabilities, but my experience tells me to slow my roll and think a little more about how this works. For now, using collections to mock APIs, and even using an OpenAPI as the source of truth for these collections, to inform the API-first process. If changes to the design of an API are made, they need to be made to the OpenAPI contract via the Postman interface, API, or via Github where the OpenAPI is synced. I am thinking I am going to need another post to Zoom out on this process and include the GitHub piece, but for the moment I want to make sure I answered Andy&rsquo;s question, and can think straight about this as I am going into other API-first conversations with customers.</p>

<p class="p3">API deployment is the OG stop along the API lifecycle, but is still the most underserved when it comes to API service providers providing solutions, and as part of the full lifecycle API management conversation. I remember back in 2011 folks asking me which of the API management providers would help them deploy their APIs, which at the time none of them would, being a pretty regular concern when it came to doing APIs at all, let alone doing them well. I have seen many &ldquo;API deployment&rdquo; solutions come and go, and after a decade I see some movements forward, but overall API deployment is still really difficult in ways that just doesn't make sense.</p>
<h3>Data APIs</h3>
<p class="p3">Making data available via simple APIs is the most common type of APIs you will come across out there, and the most common reason for providing as well as consuming APIs. Deploying data APIs are pretty straightforward to do, and there have been a wide variety of services and tooling made available to help developers deliver these types of APIs. Even with the simplicity of this type of APIs, I haven&rsquo;t seen too many platform successfully monetize a data API deployment solution, or deliver a dead simple, widely adopted, single push of a button solution to delivering data APIs. It really is one of those areas that should have been 100% solved by now, and would be if it was for the incentive models that exists behind most platforms, but also due to some pretty widespread unhealthy practices when it comes to managing and publishing data, making a lot of data pretty messy to work with when it comes to making available data APIs.</p>
<h3>Content APIs</h3>
<p class="p3">These types of APIs often overlap with the world of data APIs, but I want to highlight them separately because of content delivery network (CDN) considerations, as well as movements in the headless CMS world when it comes to enabling dead simple API deployment. I would say that the headless CMS movement is one of the more significant movement forward in this area, and I am looking hard at solutions like <a href="https://flotiq.com/">Flotiq</a> and <a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a> to help me take the next big steps when it comes to deploying APIs from within Postman. Another significant difference between data and content APIs is who these words are meaningful to, and the business prioritization these individuals possess. Meaning data is going to mean more to developers and data folks, where content is going to be more meaningful to marketing and business folks. These things matter when it comes to having the budget to pay for a solution, which is something that ultimately drives what I am talking about when it comes to the overall state of API deployment.</p>
<h3>Algorithms and Business Logic</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-under-socialism-working-on-railroad-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p3">The third main bucket of APIs that usually throws a monkey wrench into the overall API deployment conversation is when there is actual code, business logic, and algorithms being deployed as part of an API. Meaning it isn&rsquo;t just about pulling data from a database or content from a storage location, and you actually need to have code working some magic behind the scenes, doing calculations, and bringing that secret sauce to what our APIs are doing under the hood. Once you have business logic and algorithms in play, the complexity of an API goes up significantly. Source control becomes much more of a reality, and automation of the API deployment process can become much less streamlined, requiring more resources to make happen. This type of business logic and algorithm crunching often operates along side pulling data from a database and pulling content from a CDN or other system, further adding the complexity, and often times leading to API providers just sticking with hand-crafted APIs done by competent programmers.</p>
<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
<p class="p3">It is the programming language where the API deployment universe widens in ways that create a significant amount of friction. I can&rsquo;t remember who said the quote, but it is something about there not being too much difference between each programming language, but there are massive differences between each of the programming language communities. This is where 60% of tech dogma exists. The auto-generation of server and client side code has eroded about 10% of the friction that exists here, but since most of them do not actually get you to a deployed API and you still have to wire things up, there is still so much work to be done by developers. Honestly, the programming language layer of the API deployment needs to be abstracted away and removed from the conversation. It has caused more problems than it has solutions over the last decade. As an API consumer I do not give a shit about what language your API is written in, but as an API provider this is often the number one challenge when it comes to streamlining and automating how APIs are deployed. Something that I am hopeful for the API gateway and serverless layers of all of this to help dispose of much of the legacy baggage that exists, which is mostly because of programming languages.</p>
<h3>API Frameworks</h3>
<p class="p3">One layer up from the programming language portion of this is the framework discussion. There are a wealth of frameworks in almost every programming language that will help you quickly bootstrap the deployment of your APIs. Some are simple, while others are complicated. Some are simple, while others are robust. This is an area where your programming language beliefs will drive your decision making process. Whether a frameworks speaks to your API deployment needs will depend on how you view the world through your programming language lens. API frameworks have been around for a long time and aren&rsquo;t going anywhere soon. They are the favorite way for developers to deploy their APIs, but is something that keeps the API deployment conversation in the hands of the wizards, and not something that is accessible by muggles. Which is one of the reasons why the overall API deployment conversation hasn&rsquo;t moved much over the years, because the wizards like to keep things within their control and will keep fighting to keep this knowledge and capability out of the hands of normal business folks, and keeping things complicated and abstract is one way we do this.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/bf-skinner-working-on-railroad-2.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Compute</h3>
<p class="p3">Once you have your API defined, next you need to be able to power it, something that was historically done just like web applications using physical servers in racks, but then it migrated to scalable compute instance in the cloud, and then further being evolved upon using API gateways, containers, and serverless. The compute layer underneath APIs will speak to how performant it is, and ultimately what type of load it can handle. It is something that is becoming much more easy to define, scale, and orchestrate with containers and Kubernetes, but we have just begun to see the scalable automation we need to streamline how we deliver APIs, and while Kubernetes is powerful at scale, it still isn&rsquo;t something that the majority of wizards can put to use when it comes to API deployment. We have all the parts and pieces to solve this aspect of API deployment, we just have to bring it all down to a level that works for everyone across the spectrum.</p>
<h3>Serverless</h3>
<p class="p3">I&rsquo;d say that serverless makes my top list of positive movements forward in the API deployment conversation. It is abstracting away some of the friction that exists across programming languages, frameworks, as well as the compute layer of deploying APIs. I think we will keep seeing significant advances in the area of API deployment due to more investment in the serverless layer of the cloud, and serverless will move beyond just being a trend and become a core part of how we deploy our APIs. Serverless APIs isaresomething that all API providers should be exploring, and something that they should begin with learning about via the cloud platform of their choice, but then quickly begin looking at how cloud vendor lock-in can be quickly addressed by going multi-cloud and looking to open source serverrless solutions. It will continue being one of the bright spots in this conversation, and helping us make API much more push button and scalable without much additional effort.</p>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p class="p3">The database is a cornerstone of the API deployment conversation, and create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) APIs are ubiquitous. I have seen more database API deployment solutions come and go in the last ten years without much forward motion at all. The deployment of an API from a database should have been completely solved by now and just be part of the fabric of the cloud. Overlapping with the serverless conversation we are seeing the serverless model being applied to the database layer, but even with this evolution we haven&rsquo;t seen the fruits of all of this emerge when it comes to API deployment. The database layer of API deployment shouldn&rsquo;t still be of concern after all this time and is something I&rsquo;ll hopefully do a deeper dive into to better understand, because I know these challenges aren&rsquo;t technical, and they are likely due to business or political friction.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/birth-of-a-nation-working-on-railroad-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p class="p3">Right after the database, having a heavy object storage strategy, as well as a foundation for the content delivery strategy, continues to define the API deployment conversation. Having a coherent, shared, scalable strategy for handling images, videos, files, and other objects as part of API operations continues to slow the advancement of API deployment automation and orchestration. APIs should just deploy and have database and storage built in by default&mdash;this is something that developers shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about. Like serverless, the storage needs that goes along with API deployment should be abstracted away and made something that is part of the fabric of the cloud. Storage shouldn&rsquo;t be an afterthought, and always be a well planned portion of how APIs are delivered across an organization.</p>
<h3>Gateway</h3>
<p class="p3">API gateways have been a fixture of the API space for the last couple of years, but in recent years they have gotten smaller and become more baked into the fabric of the cloud with the consolidation of API management space by 2015. Their continued adoption of OpenAPI as a standard has further evolved the API deployment conversation using a gateway. While you often times still have to wire up backend systems and databases, with most modern gateways you can deploy all the scaffolding for an API with a single OpenAPI. However, like other areas, even with all of these advancements, push button API deployment via gateways is still elusive. I&rsquo;ve done it with AWS API Gateway and Lambda, RDS, or DynamoDB using a Postman collection, but frictionless API deployment using gateways isn't the silver bullet many of us figured it would be out of the gate. With a little more work though I predict in the next couple of years we will see most of the rough edges with API deployment shaved off and the it become much easier to deploy and scale APIs as needed across any cloud platforms.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Protocols</h3>
<p class="p3">Another area of fragmentation and expansion that continues to impact the API deployment conversation is at the protocol layer. While HTTP 1.1 APIs are the dominant approach to deploying APIs, HTTP/2 and now HTTP/3 are gaining speed, as well as continued expansion into the TCP, MQTT, and AMQP realms. Like other stops along the API lifecycle this expanding API toolbox is putting pressure on the services and tooling space, expanding their road map, but also making it more complex for their customers to put to work. All of these challenges aren&rsquo;t going anywhere soon, and the need to deploy multi-speed and multi-protocol API experiences is only going to grow. It is just another reality we have to content with when it comes to realizing our dreams of push button API deployment.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/citizenship-working-on-railroad-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Specifications</h3>
<p class="p3">The great API specification wars of 2011 to 2016 took its toll on the API conversation. While everything has settled on OpenAPI being the API specification you should be using across the API lifecycle, the growth of AsyncAPI represents the protocol challenges I spoke of a little bit ago, and JSON Schema and Postman collections reflect other API lifecycle challenges and opportunities when it comes to making all this work consistently at scale. You can deploy a new data or content API 100% from an OpenAPI definition today. I would argue you can also do this with more algorithmic and business logic APIs with a handful of OpenAPI extensions, but we still lack a viable, widespread, commercial solution to realize our API deployment dreams. Like some of the other areas discussed, we are real close to some complete API deployment solutions driven by API specifications, but there are still a lot of rough edges to smooth off before we are where we need to be.</p>
<h3>Source Control</h3>
<p class="p3">Depending on the combination of building blocks in play to deploy an API, source control may be needed. While some API gateway solutions made be &ldquo;codeless&rdquo;, it is likely, even if it is serverless that you will need to have a source control strategy. GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket have define this layer of the software development lifecycle, and they&rsquo;ll continue to define the API deployment lifecycle, but we will need to establish more streamlined approaches that speak to API deployment specifically, catering to the evolution of how APIs are being deployed, scaled, and made available across an organization. Without source control, API deployment will become just as unwieldy as other aspects of our legacy operations that existed before we developed modern source control approaches.</p>
<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p class="p3">Overlapping with source control, managing the deployment of multiple versions of an API, as well as the specifications and code that powers them continues to clog the API deployment pipes. While there are many proven approaches to versioning an API, many teams still struggle with doing consistently and effectively across their fast changing API infrastructure. It will continue to be something that slows push button API deployment, but when service and tooling providers are able to abstract away the challenges with versioning we will see API deployment rise to new levels across all business sectors, taking away the uncertainty that exists around change today.</p>
<h3>Pipelines</h3>
<p class="p3">CI/CD is default when it comes to delivering software in 2020, and that includes API infrastructure. While there are many enterprise organizations who are still playing catch up in this area when it comes to their legacy processes, it has also has captured such a significant mindshare when it comes to API deployment, that I find people have difficulty thinking beyond it. CI/CD is essential for delivering repeatable API deployments that providers and consumer can depend upon, but when it comes to API gateway driven deployments and Kubernetes orchestrated implementations, we are going to have to make sure our definitions of what CI/CD is is elastic. There are other ways to ensure that deployments are repeatable, and like other legacy practices we have to make sure existing definitions of CI/CD do not define the future of API deployment. As of 2020 they are the default mode of deploying reliable APIs, but their use as part of serverless deployments is already seeing shifting views, but this is something that will continue to be blown out of the water when it comes API deployment at scale using API gateways.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p class="p3">Testing any APIs that are deployed should always be the default. You should never deploy something you don&rsquo;t have tests written for, and any API deployed into production should always have those test run natively as part of the deployment process. These tests should also be available to developers to execute whenever they need, while also being able to run on a schedule in the cloud from any region around the world. The maturation of the API testing landscape will contribute to us providing push button API deployment solutions in coming years, making all the investment we have been doing over the last five years well worth it. Testing is a critical stop along the API lifecycle, but is also a fundamental ingredient in deploying APIs in a consistent, repeatable, and reliable way.</p>

<h3>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h3>
<p class="p3">One important doorway in this discussion involves where the API deployment process is initiated, and for many developers this means being able to make happen from within our IDEs. This is where we live. This is where we spend our days defining each stop along the API lifecycle, so it makes sense that each of the areas of this API deployment should be accessible from within the most common integrated development environments (IDE) out there. While API deployment will increasingly be set into motion via other interfaces by developers and non-developers, APIs will continue to be born from within the IDEs of development teams across many different industries for years to come.s</p>
<h3>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>
<p class="p3">All aspects of API deployment should be available via the CLI. Like the IDE, this is where many developers live, but it is also how much of the automation and orchestration of API deployment will be done. CI/CD depends on the CLI, and to reliably automate all the moving parts we&rsquo;ve discussed, the API deployment process will have to be exposed via the command line, putting each action required right at the fingertips of developers with a single command. Any tools or service that are being employed as part of the API deployment process which does not have a CLI dimension won&rsquo;t be around for very long, as our need to scale the number of APIs we deploy increases exponentially.</p>
<h3>Application Programming Interface (APIs)</h3>
<p class="p3">Welcome to the inception portion of the API deployment conversation, and recognizing that APIs should be deployable using APIs. Like the CLI, every facet of the API deployment process should be accessible via an API. I can deploy an API from within Postman using the AWS API Gateway, Lambda, RDS, and DynamoDB APIs today. While it would take me a significant amount of work to make this execute reliably with a push of a button using a Postman runner, it is possible. API deployment using APIs exists today, API providers just don&rsquo;t always see their APIs as just another API resource and treat the same as they do the rest of the software development lifecycle. APIs are essential to us automating and orchestrating the future of APIs&mdash;helping us effortlessly deliver the thousands of APIs we are going to need to conduct business in coming years.</p>
<h3>API Deployment is Complicated</h3>
<p class="p3">Not all of these dimensions of API deployment apply in all API deployment scenarios. However, they do reflect the overall complexity involved in moving forward API deployment across many different business sectors which are being impacted by the overall API industry. I can develop entirely new solutions for moving this conversation forward and they won&rsquo;t mean anything on the ground across enterprise organizations because they aren&rsquo;t even seen or fathomable in the current state on the ground. Ultimately you have to find the right blend of these building blocks above which makes sense to large enterprise organizations and make incremental adjustments to how they are already doing things. There will be a handful of organizations you will have green field opportunities to move the API deployment conversations, but mostly it will be about understand the existing software development lifecycle and map to hat, slowly evolving and shifting the conversation while investing in the education of developers and architects along the way. It takes time, and understanding the realities on the ground in the moment to actually make change.</p>
<p class="p3">I see this list as a sort of bingo card for bringing a new API deployment solution to market. I am finally in a place after a decade of work where I have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the API deployment conversation. I don&rsquo;t think I will have to develop anything. I just have to understand state of things at enterprise organizations, and then find the right mix of API deployment solutions already being developed and delivered to invest in and support. I don&rsquo;t think Postman needs to build the next great solution. I think Postman has to just stitch together the most meaningful offerings from across our partners and then bake it into the Postman platform in just the right way. Ideally, it is a suite of solutions that cover all of the cloud platforms, the top programming languages, and the leading gateways, helping orchestrate using the most logical mix of services and tooling that is as closely aligned with how organizations are already delivering infrastructure, but then move forward in the most tactical way. It is a pretty exciting time to be in the business, cause I feel like we are experiencing a sort of second or third wind when it comes to not just API management, but the entire API lifecycle, but and more importantly the single most stop along the way&mdash;API deployment.</p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">I have been conducting weekly discussions around API specifications each Friday mornings which I call <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/home">the API Specification Toolbox</a>. The goal is to just identify ways in which we can drive more discussion and participation in API specifications, focusing on OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL, and Postman Collections. My goal is to help increase awareness of these specifications, but more importantly get more people sharing what they are working on and invest more time and resources into supporting the specifications. I conduct an hour of informal discussions from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM PST each Friday, and <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/home/issues">we record as many of our ideas and talking points on Github using issues</a>. Some interesting ideas have emerged from the discussion, and I am taking some of the lowest hanging fruit from these ideas, organizing them, and working with the OAI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman team to try and bring some of these ideas to life.&nbsp; There are many other ideas that didn&rsquo;t make my starter list of project, but these are the ones I feel are the most important, would have the the greatest impact, and be achievable in small bursts of work, and to help drive some conversation I am having, I wanted to flesh out some of the top ideas here on the blog.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I cleaned up the titles for each of these ideas, and grouped them based upon the type of project, and I would like to flesh out a little more, identify how they overlap and are related&mdash;then work to actually push them forward without me doing all of the work. I feel like with some assistance from the wider API community, and some investment from the OAI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman, these projects could make a pretty significant impact on what is going on across the API landscapes. My objective with this post is to show how all of these projects can feed each other, and see what I can convince the community, and each specification to help move forward. Providing me with the words I am going to need to sell these ideas to anyone who will listen, and potentially help make things actually happen.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Mapping The Landscape</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I feel this area is one of the cornerstone deficiencies that slows the forward motion of the specifications, services, and tooling. In my opinion, everything is dependent on these four areas, meaning if we can clearly articulate the services, tooling, and people involved with these API specifications, and understand how they are extending the specification, all of these specifications and resulting tooling will lurch forward without any clear vision or coherency. As a community, we need to be able to efficiently profile and publish directories of services, tooling, people, and extensions, and do it in a way that can paint a full picture of what is going on. These are the four core projects I feel are needed to map the API specification landscape.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">I pulled together a simple Jekyll single page application that runs 100% on Github for service providers and for tooling, and can apply the same &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes/toolbox">toolbox</a>&rdquo; approach to people and extensions. It provides an open format that anyone can fork and replicate, publishing their own full or sub-directory. Next, I wanted to identify a handful of things that will be needed to move these forward to help drive some conversations about more investment in making these directories happen&mdash;here is what I am thinking about right now.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"><strong> Single Page Application </strong>- I already have a blueprint for these single page catalogs that are driven using the APIs.json specification, and use Jekyll and Github Pages to allow them to run 100% for free on Github. I have written up the approach, and will be working to apply to these projects as work gets done.</span></li>
<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"><strong>Intake Questionnaire -</strong> We need an intake questionnaire for each of these directories that can be used when approaching service providers, and tooling creators, as well as a checklist when profiling people and vendor extensions, making the process that anyone can do to help move things forward.</span></li>
<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"><strong>Discovery</strong> - While I have pulled together a seed list for service providers and tooling, there will be a lot more work ahead to find new ones, as well as work to find interesting people and what the different extensions are for each of the specifications, bringing new entries to each of these API specification catalogs.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"><strong>Outreach</strong> - We will need one or many people to actually reach out to service providers and tooling creators, and encourage them to fill out the intake questionnaire, then add the information to the APIs.json data stores behind each of the directories, building out the catalogs and ensuring information is correct.</span></li>
<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"><strong>Research</strong> - It will take a significant amount of research to find people who are doing interesting things with API specifications, and discover the extensions that exist out there, with an emphasis and focus on OpenAPI extensions to begin with, demonstrating how folks are extending the specification.</span></li>
<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"><strong>Evangelization</strong>&nbsp;- It will take some serious evangelism to help get the word out about these directories as they are being built, pushing the service providers, tooling, and people to help spread the word as they are being engaged, as well as invest in ongoing storytelling and amplification about the directories in an ongoing way.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I am using GitHub to move each of these projects forward. There should be an issue added for each service provider, tool, person, and extension. This provides a feedback loop to be established that people who are working on the catalogs can use to record activity and engage with the community. Each issue can be used to handle intake for each entry, evolve each of them, and provide an ongoing feedback loop for each entry, as well as each catalog. It is going to be tough to put a scope and price tag on all of this work, but it seems like there should be a set amount of hours each month that can be dedicated to this work, and recruiting volunteers as well as a handful of paid workers. As I will demonstrate, this work will lay the foundation for other projects I am advocating for, as well as help strengthen and grow the entire API economy.</span></p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Self-Service Virtual Storytelling</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The next group of projects I would like to see invested in after mapping out the landscape, involves telling the stories and incentivizing conversations about why API specifications matter, and what people are doing with them. All three of these ideas overlap with each other when it comes to content, topics, and potentially coordination. Making them pretty ripe for doing all together, helping provide a rich set of ongoing conversations about the specifications and what they enable.&nbsp;</span></p>

<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"><strong><a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/home/issues/25">Podcast #25</a></strong> - This could be a pure audio version of the same video interviews above. Maybe we only do one of the formats, but ideally they are done as video interviews, and the audio gets mixed and published as a podcast, covering a wider spectrum of viewers and listeners who may want to engage in different ways.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These interviews, conversations, and forums could be cultivated from the work above on mapping the API landscape. Bringing in service providers, tooling creators, and people doing interesting things across the space, and getting them involved in doing the interviews, participating in the conversations, and leading the forums and workshops. Here are some of the elements that will be needed to help move some of these things forward as part of these projects.</span></p>

I really see this self-service virtual storytelling and the mapping of the API landscape all working together in a virtuous cycle that expands the awareness and literacy around API specifications.</span></p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Information and Propaganda</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The last grouping of ideas I&rsquo;d like to see happen. I am dubbing information and propaganda because it is all about further expanding the narrative and visual storytelling that exists around the specification. Rounding of the virtual storytelling above with a regular heartbeat from a newsletter, as well as more static longer form content and visual storytelling that helps reinforce what API specifications deliver, and the impact they are making across the software development lifecycle. Here are the three projects I&rsquo;d love to see get some investment from the community as well as the API specifications themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>

<p dir="ltr">I have already started pulling together <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/newsletter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anewsletter">a handful of pilot newsletters</a>, fleshing out <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/newsletter">the format and topics</a>&mdash;I just haven&rsquo;t sent them or built the lists. I haven&rsquo;t done any work on the white papers or propaganda posters, but would like to actually start detailing what they may be about. I think these are great projects to bring together the community and the specifications, while providing a regular drumbeat about the space, and reliable content that newcomers can use to get up to speed, and keepsakes that the most passionate can collect to capture a piece of this moment. To help move these projects forward, here are some of the areas I would need to work on fleshing out a bit more.</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-204f1252-7fff-d286-85aa-b8554015fd20"><strong> Newsletter Format </strong>- I have already pulled together a proposed format outline for the newsletter, and pulled together issue one and two, trying to seed this project.</span></li>

<p dir="ltr"><span>These are just talking points I can use to help drive some of the conversations I am having. There will be a lot of things to do that I am not seeing, but I wanted to make a first pass at what the scope of these projects might be. Clearly the newsletter will take an ongoing effort, but the white papers and propaganda will take a heavy one time lift, with light touches after that. While we may not be tackling all of these, I wanted to lay them out in hopes that we can at least tackle one or two of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Stabilizing and Amplifying the API Specification Toolbox</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The service provider, tooling, people, and extensions directories would help us define the API landscape. This would have a stabilizing effect on the conversation. Helping people understand what exists, but more importantly help us stabilize what will and should come next. Then the virtual events, information, and propaganda will help amplify this increasingly well defined API specification driven landscape. It is crazy that there isn&rsquo;t an authoritative source of services and tooling, and I am always amazed at how interested folks are into talking and sharing knowledge about the API specifications, with so few outlets for all of this to occur. I am regularly amazed at what I come across going on with OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman collections as I do my work as the Chief Evangelist for Postman, and API Evangelist each day. I come across compelling stories coming out of top tier API providers about how they are using all of these specifications, with an appetite for telling these stories, and there are very few specification centric outlets to point them to. There is <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openapi-asc/">the API specification conference</a>, which was born out of my event API Strategy &amp; Practice, but beyond this there isn&rsquo;t anything else dedicated to the growing API specification dimension of the API economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman Collections are defining almost every industry in 2020, mapping out the data, content, algorithms that are powering business today. These API specifications are defining the resources behind the desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications powering our personal and professional worlds. API specifications have grown significantly over the last ten years, and we are going to have to ramp up our investment in these specs if we are going to take things to the next level and realize the potential of what we have all been calling the &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;.&nbsp; I feel like this list of ideas represents how we can light the fire under all of this and begin stabilizing the conversation and driving it all forward. I just have to figure out how to make it all happen without me carrying the entire load. I am already moving some of these projects forward in one way or another, but to be able to do it at the scale we need I am going to need more people and investment from the specifications, services, and tooling providers. Alright, now back to the dog and pony show around this production, selling it to the people I need to help me move this stuff forward&mdash;more to come as I further refine each of these ideas and come up with actual plans for executing on them.</span></p>

<p>title: ‘An API Lifecycle Collection Playbook’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/1_playbook.png</p>

<hr />

<p class="p1">I have a single API request that is becoming the first call I make on a growing number of Postman ccollections. It is a call to the Postman API to pull the OpenAPI for any API I am managing using Postman. This gives me the OpenAPI contract for an API so that I can move forward as part of a variety of stops along the lifecycle, starting with mocking, documentation, and testing as part of an API-first approach, but then also potentially monitoring, securing, generate client code, or even deployment and management of an API. I am working with a number of API service providers to define Postman collections that go well beyond the common APIs you will find in the <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Postman API Network</a>, helping develop entirely new categories of collections that are designed to deliver different stops along the API lifecycle, so I am looking to develop a playbook for how you create one of these new types of collections, baking your API services into the Postman platform.</p>
<h3>Publish a Team Page</h3>
<p class="p1">Any partnership with an API service provider and the Postman platform begins with publishing of a team profile to the Postman network. Providing a logo, name, and description for your company, creating your official team profile on the Postman platform&mdash;here is my reference API implementation team page from the Postman API network.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/1_playbook.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">You can manage your team profile under your team settings in your Postman dashboard. You can upload a logo, choose a name, and provide a description. When ready, you can choose to make your profile public, choosing a subdomain for your company on the Postman platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/2_playbook.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">This is the profile for your API services on the Postman platform, accessible by 13 million developers via their desktop application and on the web. All the collections and template you publish for your services will show up here, and be discoverable via Postman and Google search, providing more exposure for the services you are making available to API providers.</p>
<h3>API Lifecycle Collections</h3>
<p class="p1">Most of the Postman collections available in the API Network are from API providers like <a href="https://explore.postman.com/356847">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://explore.postman.com/salesforce-developers">Salesforce</a>, but as we are ramping up our partnering across the API lifecycle, we are looking to get a lot more DevOps, DevSecOps, and APIOps collections available that push the API network beyond just SaaS and product APIs. As Postman is expanding to become a full lifecycle API management provider it is partnering for many of these stops along the API lifecycle. Postman&rsquo;s roots as an HTTP client, debugging, and testing tool provides a base, and we&rsquo;ve rolled out the builder, documentation, mocking, code generation, and other portions of the lifecycle over the years. But, we aren&rsquo;t about to reinvent the wheel when it comes to API deployment, management, security, and other more established portions of the API lifecycle, and we are depending on you to deliver these capabilities for us. So, let&rsquo;s walk through the anatomy of an API lifecycle collection that can help you deliver API lifecycle capabilities to our 13 million users.</p>
<h3>Anatomy of the API Request</h3>
<p class="p1">When it comes to an API lifecycle collection, it can have as many API calls to your API service provider API as you desire, but there should be a certain anatomy to a request within an API lifecycle collection that focuses on improving upon the life of the API being designed, developed, or managed, leveraging the OpenAPI definition that exists within Postman, as well as the other building blocks that help bring that API to life. Here are the suggested moving parts of an API you can offer as part of an API lifecycle collection.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Providing a Descriptive Resource</strong> - Make your API request as meaningful to the API lifecycle as possible, providing a clear action like monitor, scan, secure, mock, etc. helping the user understand the value being delivered.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Pulls OpenAPI from Postman API</strong> - Include details about the name or id of the API in question as part of the API request, so that you can easily pull the OpenAPI contract using the Postman API, providing the bones of the request.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Deliver the API Lifecycle Value </strong>- Take that OpenAPI and perform some meaningful stop along the API lifecycle, by mocking, documenting, generating tests, generating SDKs, scanning, fuzzing, securing, monitoring, or any other value to API providers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Publish Results to Environment&nbsp;</strong>- Publish all relevant data I will need from the value generated as part of this API call to a Postman environment for me to use. If you mock or deploy my API, provide me with a base URL, if you test, monitor, or secure, provide me with the results.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Return Appropriate Reponse -</strong> Then return an informative response with the appropriate status code, allowing me to easily respond to what just happened when it came to moving my API forward along an established API lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can use this blueprint to create any number of API calls that help move an API forward as part of your organizations well established (or not so well established) API lifecycle. Just ensure that each API request leverages the OpenAPI contract for an API, performs some magic, and then returns all actionable data to an environment so that the results are available at my fingertips within Postman. Allowing me to move forward my API in some meaningful way, then build upon that value using other services you or another API service provider offers, getting me where I want to be with the evolution of my API.</p>
<h3>Publish to Network</h3>
<p class="p1">After you have published your team, and built a useful API lifecycle collection&mdash;<a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/add-api-network/">publish it to the Postman API network</a>. Make sure you provide adequate documentation for your collection, explaining what it does, and how you will need to obtain any credentials, keys, or tokens to make it happen. When ready, publish it to your team profile, making it available to 13 million Postman users.</p>
<p class="p1"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/3_playbook.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">Repeat this for every API lifecycle capability your company brings to the table. Sure, you can make a single collection for the entire surface area of your service's API, but it is even better if you make single executable representations of each capability, publish to the Postman API network, and enable users to execute using a Run in Postman button from across all of the documentation for your API services.</p>
<h3>Explore API Lifecycle Collections in the Network</h3>
<p class="p1">With all of the API lifecycle capabilities you offer as an API service provider defined as Postman collections and published to the Postman network, anyone using Postman can discover via search and browsing, then add to their own workspaces with a single click. With meaningful titles and robust, informative descriptions for all API lifecycle collections, developers can discover exactly that step they need to move forward their APIs according to the API lifecycle they have defined. Picking from a menu of full lifecycle API solutions from Postman, but also from across a diverse range of API service providers who add value&mdash;while leveraging Postman as the factory floor for moving each API from idea to production.</p>
<h3>Run in Postman</h3>
<p class="p1">Once a Postman user finds your API lifecycle collection in the Postman API network, and clicks on the Run in Postman button to add to their workspace, they will need a couple of things before they can actually put to work as part of the API lifecycle. While there may be other details needed, ideally the user only needs two important keys to accomplish whatever they are looking to do as part of managing their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Adds Postman Key </strong>- They will need to obtain their Postman API key from their account and provide, otherwise the Postman API will not be able to be access for pulling the OpenAPI and publishing the environment as mentioned above.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Adds Service Key </strong>- Next they will need the appropriate keys for the service being provided. Ideally, like Postman, this is just a single API key, which then provides the second half of this API lifecycle collection coin, connecting the dots.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">As an API developer I should be able to onboard with a new collection with as little friction as possible. Ideally, I can add keys for all of the API service providers I use to a single or set of Postman environments, and then apply seamlessly across many different API lifecycle collections. Providing the keys to the API factory floor that turn on all stops along the API lifecycle across all APIs and services being developed, then also leveraging the same environments for storing, aggregating, and acting upon all of the results and exhaust of each stop along the way.</p>
<h3>Working With Postman to Deliver the Full API Lifecycle</h3>
<p class="p1">Postman can&rsquo;t deliver every stop along the API lifecycle. We are depending on our partners to deliver many of the stops we don&rsquo;t offer, like deployment, management, and security. We also encourage partners to step up and build upon the services we do, and augment them with industrial grade capabilities that go beyond what we offer. This type of collection might seem like pretty lofty stuff, but it isn&rsquo;t. Once you begin to realize that our APIs are just managed using APIs, this type of collection makes a lot more sense. Postman collections aren&rsquo;t just for making requests to a single, or multiple APIs using a runner, monitor, or in the pipeline with Newman. Postman collections are also using APIs to mock, document, test, secure, govern, and deliver every other stop along the API lifecycle. These are the Postman collections I am looking to populate the Postman API network in coming months. Working with partners to help me deliver all of the capabilities our developers are going to need to move their APIs forward in a consistent and scalable way across their teams.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have questions about how all this works, feel free to reach out. When it comes to reaching developers with your API services, doing it within the tools they are already using makes a lot of sense. Postman is ubiquitous across startups all thew ay to enterprise organizations. It is how developers are making sense of the rapidly expanding API landscape around them, so it make sense for them to also use to make sense of the API lifecycle. Helping them more rapidly move forward the APIs they are developing, in a consistent way across teams, with quick access to any of the new services they will need to iterate upon the API infrastructure they are delivering. I am going to keep working on this API lifecycle collection playbook until I have a short, concise way to demonstrate how API service providers can reach Postman developers with their API services, using Postman collections that leverage OpenAPI contracts to move each API forward across the factory floor, until it is ready for production.</p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-77011fc3-7fff-7a63-23da-e5b3132d98a6"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I am pushing forward a handful of conversations with enterprise organizations about how to better formalize their API lifecycle workflow. To help me load up my talking points in my head I wanted to publish a post here on the blog. Using Postman I am finally able to actually execute on my API lifecycle visions in the most tangible way since I started doing all of this in 2010. Postman is a Swiss Army Knife that allows me to approach the API lifecycle in a variety of ways depending on the situation I find myself in. While there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to doing APIs, there are also a lot of common patterns to use, and this is an exploration of these standardized approaches, allowing me to articulate them tomorrow during some discussions.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Workspace</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It may seem obvious, but I am finding that having a well defined workspace to define, design, and manage APIs is essential to doing APIs well. Having a single place where you can find the contract and supporting artifacts that define each of the stops along the API lifecycle is needed to do all of this at scale, and consistently collaborate and move APIs forward. There are a handful of elements needed to define an API workspace when you are using Postman.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Name</strong> - You'd be surprised at how important the name of an API can be when it comes to making it discoverable and usable by consumers--how you name your API will define a lot about it.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A well written description for an API is your first impression when it comes to onboarding consumers. They shouldn't be a novel, but it should provide enough information for a consumer to understand what it does.</li>
<li><strong>Administrative Team Members </strong>- Have your leadership team identified, make sure they are plugged in and know what needs to be done, giving them the control and observability they need.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborator Team Members -</strong> Define all the other stakeholders who should have direct access to the workspace, and be able to provide feedback, and iterate upon each of the APIs being delivered.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Do not underestimate the importance of a dedicated workspace that is designed for iterating upon your APIs. You should be able to access your OpenAPI, and the collections driving docs, mocks, tests, as well as all of the orchestration applied using runners and monitors via a single shareable URL. You'd be surprised at how much a workspace can anchor the evolution of your APIs, providing the cornerstone needed to move things forward in a logical, coherent, and collaborative manner.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Machine Readable Contracts</span></h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-under-socialism-factory-road.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The centerpiece of any workspace should be one or many OpenAPI contracts defining what is possible with an API. Providing the details of each request and response as a single human and machine readable contract, that can be versioned, evolved, and used across the API lifecycle. Postman allows you to place the contract for your APIs at the center of your workspace, providing a dashboard where you can manage and collaborate around the evolution of the two dimensions of your API contracts.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>OpenAPI</strong> - OpenAPI 3.0 is the default specification in use across the API sector. While its last version, known as Swagger, is still the dominant in usage, OpenAPI 3.0 is being adopted by all of the top API providers--making it the natural choice for defining APIs.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Schema</strong> - OpenAPI 3.0 uses the latest draft of JSON Schema, providing the ability to define the underlying objects used as part of API requests and responses, helping stabilize how data, content, and algorithms are made available via the web.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Don't underestimate the power of fully fleshed out OpenAPI definition. An incomplete one will cause all kinds of friction downstream, and a robust, well defined OpenAPI will enrich your documentation, provide robust mock servers, and deliver robust contract, integration, performance, security, and other types of testing. Invest in your OpenAPI definitions, and your JSON Schema, making them discoverable via the one or more workspaces where teams are doing what they do best.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>API Contract Management</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Even once you publish the first draft of your API contracts, you will then need to iterate upon them, and put them to work driving the different stops along the API lifecycle. Postman provides a variety of features that make the management of APIs more collaborative, and automated, helping reduce the load when it comes to the mundane work of delivering APIs. Here are some of the contract management capabilities available when it comes to moving APIs forward as a team, within one or many known API workspaces.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Naming</strong> - How you name your APIs can play a role in how you manage it, helping make it discoverable, groupable, and more manageable.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Filtering</strong> - It is easy to filter APIs based upon their name, allowing you to type a couple of characters and have exactly the aPIs you need available for managing.</li>
<li><strong>Version(s)</strong> - Managing change is the only way you will be able to get a handle on the rapid iteration of API contracts across teams, providing a framework for moving forward without breaking the past.</li>
<li><strong>Autocomplete</strong> - Being able to autocomplete your API contracts helps speed up the evolution of API contracts, putting all of the OpenAPI objects at your fingertips when it comes to moving them forward.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong> - Knowing in real time whether or not your contract follows the OpenAPI specification to the letter, making sure each of your API contracts will work in other tools and services across the API lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Watching</strong> - When you are managing many different APIs it helps to be able to follow only the APIs you need to stay in tune with, providing a steady stream of relevant details about what is happening with each contract.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log </strong>- You have to be able to stay in tune with what has happened with each API being defined, leveraging the change lot to understand the movement made by each API team without asking each of them for an update.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - The ability to communicate around each API is essential, but being able to comment on the API, as well as the moving parts of the API, will help keep the feedback loop self contained.</li>
<li><strong>Reports</strong> - You will need reporting on top of the evolution of your APIs, to help- you stay in tune with how they are being used throughout the design, development, and deployment of your APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> - API contracts need to be shared. They should be shareable via other workspaces so that they can be worked upon and applied in a variety of different contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Sync</strong> - API contracts might also be needed in other services, tooling, and as part of an organizational source control, making GitHub two-way sync a pretty critical link in the chain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you have managed an OpenAPI contract for an API you know how much detail work is involved. Having a workspace, with a variety of digital capabilities to help you manage your OpenAPI is essential. It will take you 10X the effort to do it all by hand. Postman helps to put the automation and workflow in the management of OpenAPIs in a way that can be wielded in a variety of different ways depending on how you are looking to deliver your APIs, allowing for teams to do things differently to suit their specific needs.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>API Lifecycle Collection</span></h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/bf-skinner-factory-road.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In Postman, from each OpenAPI you can generate one or many collections that help you deliver on a variety of stops along the API lifecycle. The OpenAPI is the truth of each API, but collections are how you realize that APIs potential across the API lifecycle. For each collection, there are a number of ways in which they can be leveraged within Postman to help move forward the conversation around each API, providing a standardized approach to delivering APIs across teams.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Naming</strong> - Like your APIs, the naming of your collections will help define the value they deliver and make them discoverable and usable by team members.</li>
<li><strong>Filtering</strong> - The name will feed into the filtering of collections as well, allowing you to only see the collections you need, depending on how you have planned the naming of your APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong> - You will need to be linking each collection with each version of your APIs, keeping them in lock step when iit comes to managing change across each layer of your API infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong> - With the ability to generate one or many collections, you will need to automate the validation of each collection, ensuring they are always in alignment with the central API contract it serves.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Collections in Postman natively have documentation built in, but then you can also use it to publish documentation that can be shared via a URL with any consumer or other stakeholder.</li>
<li><strong>Mock Server</strong> - Collections can also be used to generate mock servers, leverage the examples included within each OpenAPI to mock the functionality of each API being delivered so it can be used to test and iterate upon each API.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Testing</strong> - The prerequisite and test scripts for each individual collection, folder, or request can be used to actually test the contract for each API, ensuring each API stays in alignment with the contract.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Visualization / Exploration </strong>- The Postman visualizer available for each individual API request can be used to make the overall API more visual, explorable, and interactive for consumers trying to put it to work.</li>
<li><strong>Forking / Pull Requests / Merging </strong>- The ability for team collaborators to be able to fork, submit pull requests, and merge changes with collections, allows for each aPI to be evolved in a more collaborative way.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - Like the feedback loop around APIs, the moving parts of each collection should allow for commenting, and team engagement, providing a feedback loop for each stop along the API lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> - Collections can be shared between workspaces like APIs, but they can also be shared via URLs and Run in Postman buttons, making each stop along the API lifecycle shareable and reusable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Each collection reflects the OpenAPI it was generated from, but provides the ability to execute upon a variety of stops along the API lifecycle. The collection provides the details you need to inform the road map of the API, but also publish documentation, power mock servers, and more importantly be able to test all aspects of how an API operates. Each collection represents a portion of the enterprise API factory floor that is in use across teams, driving the delivery of API infrastructure.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Operational Collection(s)</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Beyond the lifecycle collection that moves each API forward, there is another operational level collection that helps define an API throughout its lifespan. Providing a blueprint for the overall design and maturity of an API, that can be used to see how well, or how badly an API is progressing--allowing them to move forward in an orderly fashion.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Governance</strong><span> - This collection actually tests the surface area of an API, and ensures the design of the API actually matches what is expected of each API across an organization. Helping test the structure rather than the instance of each API, and just it's request and response.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>An API governance collection is just one example of what operational level collections can do. Demonstrating how collections can be used to mature and harden APIs, impacting not just a single API and it's consumers, but also impact overall API operations, and affecting how a platform works, or doesn't work.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>API Environments</span></h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/copper-circuit-factory-road.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Environments are used as a governor against each collection used across the API lifecycle. Allowing the base URL, keys, tokens, and other essentials to be abstracted away from each collection, then applied using variables as part of the execution process. Environments help define each stage of an APIs life, using them to design, develop, operate, and manage the maturation of each API.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Mock</strong> - Providing a mocked representation of an API as it is being designed, developed, and for use to test an API in production.</li>
<li><strong>Staging</strong> - Allowing for an API to be staged and moved from development into production, and verified as it becomes available for use.</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - Providing the details of an API as it is available in a production environment and available for integration with applications.</li>
<li><strong>Govern</strong> - Managing the stage of governance for each API, providing a blueprint of the maturity of each API that is running in production.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Environments allow for separation of each stage of an APIs evolution, as well as the overall maturity of the API. Providing a snapshot of it during design and development, deployment, and while in production, then also keeping track of each of the details along the way helping ensure that APIs are in alignment with the bigger picture across an organization--moving APIs forward in concert, helping keeping the API factory floor operating at full speed.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Observability</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>THe API lifecycle needs to be observable across all APIs if they are to be moved forward in concert. APIs do not do well when designed, developed, and operated in a silo. Observability is all about monitoring APIs using their existing outputs, capturing the exhaust from their evolution and operation using a handful of mechanisms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Monitoring</strong> - Being able to monitor each aspect of an APIs operation, from contract testing to security testing, everything should be able to be monitored on a schedule from any region.</li>
<li><strong>History</strong> - History should be default. You shouldn't have to chase it. The exhaust from the usage of APIs across the lifecycle should be available to use to evaluate the overall health of each aPI.</li>
<li><strong>Activity</strong> - The regular activity of the API factory floor should be accessible showing how each API, collections, environments, mock servers, monitors, and other moving parts are being configured.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Platform observability should be default, configurable, and extensible. Allowing for the exhaust and activity from the API factory floor to be used to optimize operations. Helping fine tune the engine of operations by being able to see into what is going on with each API without having to chase things down, ensuring observability isn't an afterthought, and something that is essential to managing the direction you are headed with your API infrastructure at scale.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Automation</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Alongside observability, automation should be a default, and part of each stop along the API lifecycle. Automation is how you make the API factory floor move and produce at scale. With Postman, there are three distinct ways in which the API lifecycle can be automated, allowing you to move each API forward, but also keep them aligned and scheduled to produce what is needed to achieve the optimal workflow.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Runners</strong> - Each component of the API lifecycle that is defined as a collection should be able to be run manually by a developer as part of each API workspaces.</li>
<li><strong>Monitors</strong> - Each component of the API lifecycle that is defined as a collection should be able to be run on a schedule from multiple regions around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Pipelines</strong> - Each component of the API lifecycle that is defined as a collection should be able to be run as part of an existing CI/CD pipeline, weaving the API lifecycle into existing operations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Each API should leverage automation for defining and delivering itself. Moving it forward while also keeping it observable and governed throughout it's life. Automation is the conveyor belts for the factory that keep APIs evolving forward, but also the digital capabilities they enable. Allowing each stop along the API lifecycle to be defined as a collection, then executed manually, on a schedule, or as part of the existing software development lifecycle.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>OpenAPI Factory Orchestration</span></h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/leaflets-of-the-russian-revolution-factory-road.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Everything I have covered lays the foundation for the API factory floor, but the teams that operate the factory floor will need to have a certain baseline of knowledge and understanding of the big picture to make it all work. Beginning with having a strong understanding of the OpenAPI specification which specifies the contract for all APIs in motion on the factory floor, but also why quality matters when it comes to positively impacting everything downstream from them across API operations and the applications and integrations that depend on them.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>OpenAPI Training </strong>- Every team member should have a strong grasp of what OpenAPI is all about and be able to understand why the specification matters when it comes to the API lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Quality </strong>- Every team member should be able to understand why quality matters when it comes to making it all work, and your API lifecycle is only as good as it's OpenAPI core.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Downstream </strong>- Each team member needs to intimately understand what the downstream effects are of a complete OpenAPI, and the friction introduced when you don't deliver a robust OpenAPI for each API.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>OpenAPI is essential to the narrative of the factory floor, and the API lifecycle. It is the script you write for the orchestra. If your teams aren't properly trained in the OpenAPI driven details, they will never communicate effectively across your operations. OpenAPI will be the background music for your API operations, and provide the hum of the factory floor dictating how the gears move or do not move when it comes to rolling out new APIs, evolving existing APIs, and ultimately deliver the digital capabilities they enable.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Defining the Lifecycle for Your API Factory Floor</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Your OpenAPIs provide the contracts for your businesses API factory floor, and collections provide the unit of execution that bring these contracts to life. Ensuring the factory floor also has the necessary automation and observability it needs to move APIs forward, keeping them producing and delivering as desired. All of this will dictate the life and presence of each API, setting in motion their evolution forward, while keeping them serving the applications and integrations that are designed to support them. All of the knobs and dials articulated above provide the gears you need to build and operate a factory floor at any scale, allowing you to scale up or down as needed to achieve desired results.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Next, I will be taking all of this and applying to specific APIs for customers. I will also be fleshing it out and turning it into relevant training material so I can turn it into a workshop. I need to figure out how I can teach it to teams across an organization in a series of internal workshops that help move an organization forward by making sure teams have the training and tools they need. Now that I have the tools to actually deliver the API factory floor that matches the successful practices I've identified over the years, I am looking to roll it out more formally as part of the conversations I am having. I just need to keep hammering on it and refining it down to something that can be shared with others--helping them see the potential of a well defined API lifecycle delivered across a scalable and consistent factory floor.</span></p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-under-socialism-subway-train-125th.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">When you sign up to access most APIs you will have to sign up for an account, create an application, and retrieve a set of keys and / or tokens before you will be able to use the API. This is standard practice that is baked into the home grown as well as Commercial API management solutions available across the landscape. This is a concept that was introduced back in 2005 by Mashery, and is something that hasn&rsquo;t changed much over the years, despite what we build on top of APIs, and use APIs for having changed significantly over the last decade. In 2020, this relic of API management past needs to evolve if API providers and consumers are going to use APIs to their fullest potential&mdash;something API management service providers are going to have to take the lead on, and get back to work innovating and not just being a commodity.</p>
<p class="p1">When I sign up for Twitter&rsquo;s API I have to create an application before I can get the tokens I need to begin using the application. I have to provide a name, purpose, and other details about what that application is&mdash;even if I do not fully understand what that is. Most API provider&rsquo;s notion of an application means web or mobile application, but in reality it can be the &ldquo;application&rdquo; of the data, content, and algorithms being made available via an API in a variety of ways from just pulling data to integrating in real-time with other systems. As an API analyst and storyteller I rarely am building an application, but just looking to kick the tires and understand what is going on&mdash;being forced to define an application is nothing but a road block for me. I may be a small group of API consumers, but there are many other edge cases which are similar to my situation in that we represent the long tail of API consumption in the unknown unknown API usage quadrant&mdash;meaning we are still figuring out why we need an API.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">The most significant breakdown in the concept of defining an application is that it is designed for use by developers. In an iPaaS, BPM, and API automated business world, the legacy API management application definition doesn&rsquo;t work. It is bad enough that an application stands in between a regular user of a platform and getting access to their data, content, and the useful algorithms that exist, but we often also hide all of this in some other completely separate developer area, excluding them from the conversation&mdash;instead of just making the API, and access to the API a natural part of the platform account management and settings. This separation between business and integration interfaces reflect decades of division between business and IT groups that needs to be done away with as we move forward in an API-driven business landscape. There is no reason that as a user of an &ldquo;application&rdquo;, that I need to venture to another separate section of a platform and create another &ldquo;application&rdquo;, just so that I can access the same data, content, and algorithms I am already putting to use via the platform. It just doesn&rsquo;t pencil out anymore.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope-master/america-under-socialism-subway-underground_35904617894_o.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">This portal and management infrastructure that is serving API consumers who are building web or mobile applications. This usually doesn&rsquo;t include the other types of applications consumers will be developing like integrations, automation, orchestrations etc., but more importantly it doesn&rsquo;t serve other complimentary API providers, or API service providers. Meaning, Twilio and Stripe are optimized for their consumers to build applications on each of their respective APIs, but there is very little done to address when SMS and payments are made in a single application across both providers. There is a huge opportunity for API providers to share consumers, and optimize for bundled onboarding, integration, reporting, and other key areas. Additionally, there is very little considerations for how API service providers will be putting APIs to work across many different API providers. Which brings me to why I am writing this. As an API consumer using Postman across many different APIs, the burden is on me to setup applications and obtain keys for all of the APIs I am using, and there are very few API management affordances for me as Postman to help bridge these gaps. Can I go setup a single application and service all of my customers via the Twitter API? Yes, I guess I could argue that Postman is the application, but really developers are just using us as a vehicle to get them to their application or integration. Lots of conversations to be had here, and very few ways these discussions are being facilitated via existing API providers or service providers.</p>
<p class="p1">I am in a good place in the industry to move this conversation forward. Both by being at Postman, but also with my relationships to API providers, and specifically the API management service providers. This is a ball I think I will move forward in the next five years, helping push forward this critical construct in the API factory floor which seems to be slowing us down. Sometimes we just have to identify these legacy constraints that exist and encourage a handful of API providers and API service providers to take the lead&mdash;then we can help move things forward in a more meaningful way. If we are going to scale all of this API stuff to the levels we envision in our heads, and blow smoke about in our API economy storytelling, then we are going to have to trim a lot more friction off the API onboarding and integration dimensions of our operations. This will help us move from using ten or twenty APIs, to being able to use hundreds or thousands of APIs seamlessly across tens or hundreds of API providers with the same amount of effort. We just have to do the hard work to shift our views of what an application is, moving beyond these legacy web and mobile constructs, realizing that each potential API integration can have a wide range of applications in our digital and physical worlds.</p>

<hr />

<p class="p1"><a href="https://covid-19-apis.postman.com/">The COVID-19 API resource center we launched back in April at Postman</a> was a success. It generated a lot of traffic and API usage, but also brought in about 75 API submissions from the community. One of the things we learned as part of this work is that more APIs doesn&rsquo;t always mean better outcomes. More APIs means they have to be properly described and tagged, making them more discoverable, but you also need to make they are all &ldquo;good&rdquo; APIs. Which, once you begin to dive in, you realize that it becomes quite a can of worms, but luckily we have <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">the APIs.yaml specification</a> to help us map things out in a way that allows to slowly evolve things from human to machine readable. When it came to the COVID-19 data APIs were were making available one key element of &ldquo;good&rdquo; was knowing a little more about provenance behind each of the APIs, helping us see the overlap between all of the APIs, as well as the unique outliers who were providing new and novel resources.</p>
<p class="p2">First, to make sure everyone is up to speed, <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> / <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yaml</a> is a simple machine readable index for defining collections of APIs, and mapping out API operations. In this scenario I am <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes/covid-19/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">using APIs.json as the core of an API toolbox</a> that runs 100% on GitHub using Jekyll and Github Pages. In addition to indexing the documentation and Postman collections for each API, I am adding a provenance property to help define where the data behind each API originate, producing YAML that looks like this.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/3c9307fbe3f035e1113696e0d819e2fa.js"></script>

<p class="p1">Right now the x-sources APIs.yaml property just provides an array of name and urls for each of the data sources behind each API. Mostly just providing a list of URL sources that can be displayed, but it is a property that could be evolved to provide more machine readable capabilities like grouped by domain, rating, public or private sector, and other things you might be considered with when discovering data APIs. Eventually I will add a way for me to easily filter by all of the APIs that pull from Johns Hopkins, but for right now I am just looking to list the sources on the website for each resource center.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_10_06_at_2.03.22_pm.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">Initially I thought this would be a provenance type of property, but really it is just about the source of the data in this moment. I am trying to keep each property focused on solving a specific problem, and answering a meaningful set of questions, and I can always evolve the schema for a property or create new ones for addressing other issues. Right now I am just giving each API a bonus point if they have sources listed&mdash;even just one. I am finding that little meta details like this help out in search and discovery, but also are a great way to identify the API owners and curators who actually care about their APIs--which always demonstrates the potential for a better quality API in the end.</p>
<p class="p1">Using the APIs.yaml source property to rank COVID-19 and U.S. Election APIs is just the beginning of this renewed work around APIs.json / APIs.yaml. I am working on a number of other human and machine readable properties for a variety of APIs. Helping me map out different layers of the API universe from COVID-19 to banking, and back again. If you have any questions about <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yaml</a>head over to the website to learn more, and if <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes">you have any questions head over to the GitHub repo for each of the repositories</a> I have setup to power this API resource centers. Feel free to fork and play with any of the projects, or visit the home repo for my API toolbox prototypes to suggest new types of resource centers, or industry API catalogs</p>

<p class="p1">I have been working with my friends over at <a href="https://apimetrics.io/">APIMetrics</a> on the <a href="https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/">COVID-19</a> and <a href="https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/us-2020-elections/">U.S. Election</a>&nbsp;resource centers we launched recently. These API resource centers are all powered by an <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yaml</a> index, providing a machine readable core that is used to power each API resource center single page application. <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes/covid-19/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">Providing an index of a variety of COVID-19 and election related resources that powers the website</a>, but also can be used in other applications and systems to pull the OpenAPI, Postman Collections, and other artifacts that are being made available. One of the artifacts I am layering into the listing for each API is a <a href="https://www.api.expert/about/casc/">CASC score</a>, showing the uptime and availability across all of the resources being made available, helping me float the best APIs to the top of each API resource center.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">First, to make sure everyone is up to speed, <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> / <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yaml</a> is a simple machine readable index for defining collections of APIs, and mapping out API operations. In this scenario I am using APIs.json as the core of an <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes">API toolbox</a> that runs 100% on GitHub using Jekyll and Github Pages.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7f5021ee05ae77181bcd5557b26d8f4f.js"></script>

<p class="p1">CASC Score is a way to understand the reliability and maturity of an API from my friends over at APIMetrics. I just took their data and created a machine readable APIs.yaml property that I could then use to display the CASC score for each of my COVID-19 and U.S. Election APIs. Using the property to sort and display the CASC score as part of each listing.</p>
<p><a href="https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_10_06_at_1.30.32_pm.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I needed a way to float the cream of each API resource center to the top, and the CASC score is one thing I consider when it comes to ranking each of the community contributed APIs. I am looking at other metrics, which I will also publish as APIs.yaml properties in the near future, but understanding the overall availability and reliability of the API from many different geographic regions over time is a pretty key indicator of whether an API is something I want to be recommending to developers.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">One of the regular patrons of <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/home">my weekly Friday open office hours around API specifications</a> has been with API expert Marjukka Niinioja (<a href="https://twitter.com/mniinioja?lang=en">@mniinioja</a>), and a couple of weeks back we carved off 30 minutes to discuss the important of OpenAPI, other specifications, and the need for more education and awareness around specifications. I spend 30 minutes getting Marjukka&rsquo;s view of the landscape, and more insight into why she thinks API specifications are so important, take a listen for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uw4YMANjnNQ" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">What I like about chatting with Marjukka is that she gets APIs, especially OpenAPI, but more importantly she is passionate and motivate to contribute back to the community. I speak to many people about OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman Collections, and JSON Schema, but finding folks like Marjukka who are driven to help document, tell stories, and help move things forward. Thanks for your time Marjukka, and if any of you readers want to learn more about what she is working on you can join us for <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/home">the regular API Specification Toolbox office hours each Friday</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a talk I gave Saturday this last morning to almost 100 students in India, helping demonstrate the potential of APIs when it comes to their career. It is easy for me to stay entrenched in a world where everyone knows what an API is, but these types of conversations help me break out of the API echo chamber and reach out to developers, would-be developers, and those are curious enough to pull back the curtains on how the web works a little bit. With this talk I am looking to convert a few more folks to my API religion. Not because APIs are always good, but because being aware of the API layer that exists beneath our digital, and increasingly physical world is important. You will be more successful in both your personal and professional lives if you are API aware, and with this talk I am looking to help lay the foundation for anyone, developer or non-developer to understand the importance of API in our digital world.</p>
<h3>What is an API?&nbsp;</h3>
<p class="p1">An API, or application programming interface is the current evolution of the web when it comes to making data, content, media, and algorithms available to different types of applications. Websites are written in HTML, and designed to be displayed to humans in our browsers. All you have to do is right click on any web page you visit and select view source to see the HTML behind any web page you are visiting. APIs provide access to the same data, content, and images used in websites, but instead of returning HTML, it returns XML or JSON which developers can render exactly as they wish in the application they are delivering. APIs are not some new software from one of the technology giants, it is just the next evolution in the web, making sure we can use deliver the same data, content, and algorithms across the applications we run on our laptops, our mobile phones, in our automobiles, and any other place currently being connected to the web. Expanding the reach of the web beyond just the desktop computers in our homes and businesses, to almost every other physical object that exists across our physical world.</p>
<h3>How are APIs Used?</h3>
<p class="p1">APIs are used for many different purposes. They are used to power most websites you visit online today, with a single web page potentially making 10 different API calls to get the data, content, media, and advertising needed. However, in 2008 with the introduction of the iPhone, and the Android mobile operating systems, APIs became the primary way for delivering these resources to mobile applications. Developers didn&rsquo;t stop there, and began using APIs to power buttons, widgets, and phsyical devices, pushing the web beyond the confines of our desktops, laptops, and mobile phones, wiring up common objects like thermostats, refrigerators, signs, and our cars to the Internet&mdash;pushing the Internet into every potential corner of our physical worlds by reinventing existing products to be &ldquo;smart&rdquo;. Expanding the reach of government, businesses, and institutions using low cost web infrastructure to deliver digital assets around the world, by redefining existing software to use APIs, and leveraging more agile API software development lifecycles to rapidly redefine the<span>&nbsp;</span>future of how applications are adopted and put to use in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What was before APIs?</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/teaching_aarpanet.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">APIs come in many shapes and sizes, and have been around since the early days of compute in some form or another. The first formal set of APIs appeared to arise with the introduction of the Internet in 1969 with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>, by defining common network interfaces, and resources for transmitting data across these networks. By the 1970s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange">electronic data exchanged (EDI)</a>&nbsp;emerged to allow businesses to effectively communicate via digital channels, transmitting invoices and purchase orders within the transportation and shipping industries, but was something that would quickly spread to other commercial, healthcare, government, and NGO areas of the economy. As these types of programmatic interfaces were evolving other more generalized forms of APIs emerged with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">file transfer protocol (FTP)</a> for moving files around, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP)</a> for passing messages back and forth. To this day business still regularly move data around using FTP and Email, using these protocols in system to system communication, and as a way to make digital resources available in applications. However, once the World Wide Web (WWW) emerged in the early 1990s, new types of APIs began to emerge, resulting in a mix of approaches to providing programmatic interfaces for use in applications, which leverage HTTP 1.1, as well as TCP to move data, content, and media around, while also providing access to emerging algorithms. Approaches to delivering APIs which are still being improved upon today, and leveraging HTTP/2 and now HTTP/3 to keep up with the demand of modern applications.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>What are some types of APIs?</h3>
<p class="p1">By 2000, several competing approaches to doing APIs emerged, resulting in very different views on how you should be delivering applications. In 2000, while a more philosophical type of APIs called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">representational state transfer or REST</a> was evolving, a more structured business heavy approach to doing APIs called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">simple object access protocol or SOAP</a> was picking up momentum. SOAP quickly became the standard enterprise organizations used to connect systems, and deliver resources to applications, while REST grew slowly as the favorite of startups and independent developers. By 2008 REST was picking up speed, which accelerated with the introduction of the mobile phone and resulting application ecosystems. Skyrocketing REST to be the favorite for startups and a new breed of application developers when it came to delivering web, mobile, and device applications. While all this was happening another format was growing within Google called <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>, which emerged as a contender for how APIs are delivered when it comes to a B2B application ecosystem. Within this diverse API ecosystem you will find other promising approaches to delivering APIs like <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> which is very data centric approach to APIs, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">Websockets</a> which leverages the older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">transmission control protocol (TCP)</a> to deliver real-time, synchronous APIs that are a favorite of API-driven financial markets and blockchain providers.Making for a pretty rich playing field of different APIs to put to work, with the most common approach being REST due to its simplicity and low cost approach to using existing web infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Why Should APIs Matter to You?</h3>
<p class="p1">APIs are behind everything you do. They are at home, at work, in your car, and around you in the public commons. You do not need to be a developer to understand this reality. APIs are in almost every new appliance you will put in your house. They are behind the applications you use in your personal life across your desktop, laptops, and mobile phones. APIs are how companies are moving your bits and bytes around the internet while also making them available to their partners. The more you understand about this world, the more control you will have in your personal life, while also setting you up for more awareness and control in your professional life as well. APIs are behind every business application you depend on, and they are the way you better orchestrate and automate the common business processes you need to execute each day. Knowing that APIs exist behind the surface of each web, mobile, or device application you are already using gives you an edge in your personal and professional activities. APIs should matter to you because you depend on them so much, and they can be your key to seizing more control over your time, career, finances, and other key aspects of how your world works. Just knowing an API exists can help you take even a little control back in this chaotic digital world that has emerged in the last twenty years, if you don&rsquo;t know they exist, this entire world is off limits to you. It is up to you to decide if you want to step up learn more about this world and begin pulling back the curtain on how it works&mdash;Postman is here to help you pull back this curtain.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/teaching_jsom.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Business APIs You Should Know</h3>
<p class="p1">Depending on what you plan to do for a living you will use a mix of applications to get your work done each day. However, there are some common applications that are in use within most workplaces, and you depend on each day. If your organization is a Microsoft shop then you are probably meeting using Microsoft Teams, and emailing, scheduling, and sharing a variety of documents using Microsoft Office. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api">The Microsoft Graph API</a> provides you with your API doorway to this world, giving you the ability o integrate, automate, and orchestrate across the Microsoft platform. If your organization is a Google shop then you are probably meeting using Google Meet,<span>&nbsp; </span>and email, scheduling, and sharing documents using Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api">Gmail</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/calendar">Calendar</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/docs/api">Google Docs</a>, all of which posses APIs for you to put to use when it comes to optimizing how you work across the Google Domain. Beyond these two dominant platforms is is likely you are using <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/developers/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api">Zoom</a>, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">WordPress</a>, and other common platforms in a professional capacity&mdash;they all have APIs you can integrate, automate, and orchestrate with without writing code. If you want to understand more about this world, go ahead and make a short list of applications you use each day, then append each application name with "API" and then enter into Google, Bing, Duck Duck Go, or however you search on the web. Spend a little time looking through their API developer area, and looking at other articles, blog posts, videos, and other resources to understand what is possible with the API behind each application you use. You will be surprised at what you will learn about the tools you are already using each day.</p>
<h3>Postman is an API Browser for the Web</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> is your doorway to understanding this API universe. The platform allows developers and non-developers to learn about how APIs work using simple API collections like <a href="https://explore.postman.com/templates/7912/public-rest-apis">the Public REST APIs one I maintain as a template in the Postman API Network</a>. Pushing you to be more hands-on with a variety of APIs, peaking behind the current to see how each API request and response works, witihout the friction of having to login. Then if that gets your curiosity going you can <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">play around with other APIs in the Postman API Network</a>, running <a href="https://explore.postman.com/api/7013/twitter-api-v2">the Twitter V2 API collection</a>, or <a href="https://explore.postman.com/imgur">the imgur API collection</a>, exploring some APIs that require authentication, and you to setup your own account and application to get the keys before you make your API calls. Then if you are feeling really adventurous <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo?hl=en">you can download Postman Interceptor for Chrome and learn to reverse engineer some of the applications you use</a>, piping each API call made in your browser to a Postman collection, <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/">so thjat you can study, play with, and learn more about what is happening behind the scenes of each of your applications</a>. We haven&rsquo;t even touched on what you can do if you are looking to develop an API. I am just looking to get you interested in APIs, not because I anticipate you building APIs, but because I want you to have more awareness of how the applications you depend on actually work (or don&rsquo;t work). I want you to be more successful in your professional career, and have more control over your personal data. I want the digital landscape around you to be not just more visible, but also something feel comfortable with reverse engineering, integrating, automating, and orchestrating with.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/teaching_rest.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">APIs should matter to you because you are using them every day. You are already making hundreds or thousands of API calls a day, they just occur slightly out of your line of sight. You shouldn&rsquo;t just care about APIs if you are going to be building them (maybe you are). You should care about APIs because you are actively consuming them, and they are actively consuming you, gobbling up your messages, images, videos, and other digital bits throughout the day. I am interested in just in helping you pull back the curtain on this digital production a little bit and show you how Postman can help you poke around back stage, and begin taking a more lead role in how things work. APIs are nothing new, and they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere soon. If you want to better understand how platforms like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Zoom, and others are doing what they do, while also learning how to better migrate data between each of these platforms, then APIs are for you. Think of Postman as your Swiss Army Knife for your journey into this API back country, providing you with what you need to make sense of each API, and the request and responses you make to each platform using their APIs. Allowing you to understand how platforms oeprate, then better integrate, automate, and orchestrate with the data, content, media, and algorithms that reside across the domains you operate within each day. All you need to get started is to <a href="https://www.postman.com/">download Postman</a>, possess some curiosity, and be fearless when it comes to playing around with the APIs behind the digital landscape that already exists around you.</p>

<p>title: ‘I Am An Evangelist’</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/images/collections/copper-circuit/christianity.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I have to write these posts every so often to help folks understand who I am and what it is I do as the API Evangelist. You see, there are regular streams of people who attempt to define me based upon their view of the world, their belief system, and reduce me to a know series of transactions that compute in their version of reality. In the tech arena there are several variations of what I do for living, going by a handful of labels; evangelist, advocate, relations, ambassador, champion, or some other word. None of these disciplines possess a formal definition, and are perpetually defined by the people who fill these roles. I am not in the business of defining what people do when they wear these titles, or generalize any of them as good, bad, nor neutral.<span>&nbsp;</span>They are just like tech in my experience, and are only as a good or bad as the human beings they serve, and I&rsquo;m not really in a place where I give many fucks about policing any of this. However, when people say evangelists are doing bad things I tend to take offense, and sometimes feel compelled to put some words down within my domain (hrumph!). Technology and API evangelists existed before I came around in 2010, but after doing this a decade, and playing this part for enough time, I&rsquo;ve earned the right to push back, and call bullshit on the shade being thrown in my direction.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">First, I am an evangelist. I will even let my ego step up and say that I am The API Evangelist. I&rsquo;ve put down my mark. Paid my dues. I&rsquo;ve stayed the course for over ten years now, worked for the White House, with governments around the world, and most of the biggest names in tech in one capacity or another. Pure ego baby! I&rsquo;m good with it. Ego is required to be in the role at this level. But, I&rsquo;m under no delusion that any of this is real. It is a fucking performance. If you take yourself seriously enough as a evangelist, advocate, relations, ambassador, champion, or some other variation to actually believe any of this is real&mdash;you have a hard crash coming somewhere down the line. We are all in the business of blowing smoke up people&rsquo;s asses and selling, in a perpetual quest for a story, video, image, Tweet, or other digital transaction that will go viral. We are all in the business of selling our beliefs. We are all in the business of reducing everything to a transaction through the dogmatic use of a computational belief system. This is why there is so much &ldquo;those people over there are bad&rdquo;, and &ldquo;what I do is good&rdquo; in the business&mdash;everything is fucking boolean. Everything is a transaction (or not). We are all just striving for that one story that will transcend the uncaring, unloving digital landscape we are in service of, and make us feel like we are alive for just a few moments, and help us feel like others care about us. However, in the end, the only thing that matters in all of this is people. Not the tech. Not the titles. The people.</p>
<p class="p1">Second, what is an evangelist? According to OED, it is "a person who seeks to convert others to the Christian faith, especially by public preaching&rdquo;. I am going to turn Christian faith into a variable and go with, &ldquo;a person who seeks to convert others to the [faith], especially by public preaching.&rdquo; This is what I am in the business of. I&rsquo;m not advocating for developers, technology, or capitalism. I am in the business of converting others to my faith, through public preaching, or as I prefer to call it, a public performance. It is all a performance. A dance. A series of stories. What is my faith you might ask? API Evangelism is not about converting y'all to believe in APIs in general, a specific API implementation, or approach to delivering APIs. My faith is simply that amidst all of this API-driven chaos, it is the human being that matters. Not just the physical version of ourselves, bu the digital version that is in its infancy right now, being defined with each individual API request and response. API Evangelism is all about bringing awareness and understanding to the average person about how APIs are defining them, and how they see the world around them. While a significant portion of this evangelism is focused on the &ldquo;muggles&rdquo;, the lion share is definitely targeting the wizard class of developers who see themselves as the chosen ones in this evolution of our physical self into this digital realm. I am not interested in teaching developers about APIs, I am interested in reminding developers who are building APIs that they are human beings, and what they are building can all to easily be used to exploit, manipulate, and harm other human beings.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/images/collections/copper-circuit/crypto.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I did not grow up religious. I never set foot in a church until I was an adult. So I do not bring all the baggage with the word evangelist, making it very easy for me to turn Christain faith into a variable in the definition of evangelist. I see technology in the same light as I see Christianity. It has many of the same colonizing (geo, cultural,etc.) effects, which tends to be in the service of the white supremacy. Internet technology is a religion, and our belief that it will change the world for the better depends on our faith. Even though my faith centers on a dismantling faith, where we perpetually dismantle the machine from within, it doesn&rsquo;t exempt me from the negative impact that technology is having on the world, and the exploitative micro outcomes occurring each day. I am definitely going to the equivalent of hell in my faith for all my work to reduce everyone to a transaction (I would argue I am already there, but we&rsquo;ll cover that in another post). So you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me when I use my evangelism pulpit to tear apart your business, technology, and VC overlords. My faith is more meaningful than your faith. I am sorry, it is. People matter more than any of those things. I know, now you&rsquo;ll insert some quote from your capitalist scripture telling me that people can&rsquo;t exist without business, technology, or rich people, but you are wrong. None of the technology matters. I don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t care how much you have convinced yourself that you are doing tech for the social good, you are just getting high on your own supply. Nothing matters more than the human beings. This is why I am the API Evangelist. I stay aware of how the machine works, so I can share stories with others.</p>
<p class="p1">Building oneself up, and tearing others down is how we work in service of the machine. I&rsquo;ve seen evangelist, advocate, relations, ambassador, and champions all do exploitative and manipulative things in the course of their daily activities. I have also seen all of them do some amazing and captivating storytelling, and dedicate themselves to sincerely helping other human beings. I know this story will not stop folks from dividing and conquering with each wave of technology that lands on our shores, but it will hopefully help convert a few more to my belief that all of this technology is bullshit, and being in the service of educating average folk about the damaging effects of Internet technology is actually where it is at. How far you stand next to or within the machine as you evangelize, advocate, relation, or champion is up to you. There are times I stood too close and was meaner than I needed to be in my work. There were also times where I stood too far away and really didn&rsquo;t understand how the machine was exploiting, manipulating, and reducing our physical world into digital transactions, so that we could then be bought and sold. Honestly, it has all been an ongoing learning process for me. One that I&rsquo;ll continue to fuck up and stumble upon in the future. At some point I know that I will go away completely, consumed by the machine because I stood too close one time too many, but until then I will keep working to make folks more aware of their <a href="http://thedigitalself.org">digital self</a>, and remember what is truly important in all of this. Us humans.</p>

<p class="p1">My partners in crime <a href="http://www.mtna.us/">Metadata Technologies North America (MTNA)</a> and I are working on identifying the best election data and API resources available today, and one of the gems out there, when it comes to what is available is out of the politics and sports data platform <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a>. The data storytelling platform have made a name for themselves when it comes to predicting election outcomes, and possess some very interesting datasets around elections, which they public via a simple landing page, and on GitHub in a public repository.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1"><strong><a href="https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight Data Page</a></strong> - A simple page outlining all their data resources.</span></li>
<li><span class="s1"><strong><a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data">FiveThirtyEight Data Repo</a></strong> - All the datasets they have in a single GitHub repo.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">FiveThirtyEight has general poll data, but also data for more precise questions like &ldquo;How Popular is Donald Trump?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Are Democrats or Republicans Winning the Race for Congress?&rdquo;. They provide data as CSV files via their data page and on GitHub, making it easy to get at the data behind polling and storytelling. I am working with MTNA to take things a step further, and ingesting the data files and publishing them as simple APIs, then generating collections that index all the APIs, making it easier to access all the election related files in a single collection, while also opening up the possibilities for using Postman visualizer to make sense of the data being returned. Providing self-contained API client for all the data, complete with charts, graphs, and other eye candy that make it easier to understand what is happening.</p>
<p class="p1">I really like the&nbsp;happening approach to publishing the data via their dedicated page because it is dead simple, providing a title, more info, and a CSV download, as well as column saying how long it has been since it was updated&mdash;down to the minute.<span>&nbsp;Providing everything you need to understand what is going on with each dataset.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_09_11_at_11.16.58_am.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">This got me thinking about the real time opportunities involved with making the data available to consumers, which is a good reason to start making the data available via APIs. It makes it easier for us to poll (ha! polling poll data!), and then provide webhooks and other real time capabilities. It also allows us to establish a feedback look with consumers. While the data is made available publicly without authentication, we can still understand usage across different types of consumers. MTNA and Postman are working to help add this additional API layer on top of FiveThirtyEight, as well as a Postman collection layer to help us make the data more accessible, publish richer documentation, visualizations, and other elements that help make the data more usable.</p>
<p class="p1">MTNA has pulled all the relevant FiveThirtyEight data sets and published as an API, repeating the process on a schedule to keep fresh. They have also generated a rich Postman collection (which I will share soon), which aggregates all of the available datasets into a single place, while also augmenting with visualizations using Postman Visualizer. Next we are looking for other datasets that would compliment the polling data, further helping us make sense of what is going on. If you know of additional election related datasets that would add value, or would like to develop a dataset or API, I&rsquo;d love to hear more about it. Also, if you work at FiveThirtyEight, or know someone who does, I&rsquo;d love to learn more about their data pipeline, as well as the storytelling and visualization that happens on top of this data. I have a regular series of campaigns planned for this fall that I would love to make as robust and useful as I possibly can for developers.</p>

<p class="p1">I am including <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html">the U.S. Census API</a> in a couple of different projects in the queue, and to help me make the API more discoverable and usable by developers I needed an <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="https://www.postman.com/collection/">Postman collection for the API</a>. Helping make it easier for developers to on-board with the Census API, but also provide a base collection I can use to develop additional workflow collections that help provide specific types of data easier to use in variety of use cases. <a href="http://www.mtna.us">Our data API partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA)</a> is helping us deploy APIs on top of some valuable datasets as part of our COVID-19 resource center, and they offered to help us develop the OpenAPI and Postman collection for the U.S. Census API.</p>
<p class="p1">Carson Hunter (<a href="https://twitter.com/carrrson">@carrrson</a>) from MTNA got to work crafting an <a href="https://github.com/postman-government/census/blob/master/census-openapi.yaml">OpenAPI 3.0</a> for the Census API, providing a pretty robust source of truth for the API, which we can then use to generate Postman collections to document, mock, test, and automate around the Census API, but also just use the collection as a client for running different queues and saving the results of API responses to files without having to write code. Carson did the extra work of also <a href="https://github.com/postman-government/census/blob/master/Census%20Documentation%20(Generated).postman_collection.json">creating a Postman collection</a> and publishing as documentation, helping make the API a little easier to navigate, while also making sure there is a &ldquo;Run in Postman" button available so that developers can quickly begin putting to work within their own Postman workspaces. Carson helped reduce the friction when it comes to onboarding with the Census API, while also helping me make it more discoverable as part of the various API projects I am working on.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a lot more work we can do on these reference OpenAPI and Postman collection, but we wanted to just pause and put out there for others to comment on what they would like to see. <a href="https://github.com/postman-government/census">We have published the OpenAPI and Postman collection for the Census API to a GitHub repository, where anyone can fork, download, and put to use</a>. We would love to hear any feedback or requests via the GitHub issues, helping us ensure future work more useful to the wider community. I am going to see what I can do to get the Census Bureau to add the Postman collection to <a href="https://github.com/postman-government/census">the Postman network</a>, adding to the discoverability and onboarding for the API, but then also keep brainstorming with Carson and the MTNA team about what other Census API resources we should be adding, or maybe how we can layer in visualizations on top of common queries, helping make it easier for developers or even non-developers to make sense of the massive amount of data the Census API provides access to. We are just going to spread out our work on the U.S. Census API, helping break things into smaller more bit size chunks, while also opening our work up for community feedback.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mtna.us"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/metdata_technology_north_america.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you depend on the Census API, or have an application or integration you&rsquo;d like to develop on top of the API, I&rsquo;d love to hear more about it. I have a couple of projects in the works which are building on top of the OpenAPI and Postman collection that MTNA has developed. I am looking for additional use cases to drive future collection development. The Census API plays a pivotal role in a variety of important discussions, and there is pretty significant opportunity to make Census data more accessible and usable as part of these discussions, while also making the conversations more inclusive, allowing folks to work with Census data without writing code. I&rsquo;ve seen how the Census API has widened the playing field for who works with Census data firsthand since 2011. Before then it was just the bigger data players who were downloading the massive data files and making sense of the surveys. The API has made the data more accessible in smaller chunks to a wider audience, beyond only those who have the resources and skills to work with large data sets. I am looking to continue this evolution by developing a variety of Postman collections that help make working with the Census data easier, and establish a variety of workspaces and repositories for developers to get up and running with the Census API quicker. Let me know where you project fits into this picture, and how we can put this OpenAPI and Postman collection to work as part of whatever you are cooking up.</p>

<p class="p3">One of my current tasks at Postman is to help explore what the future of API deployment looks like. When I went into this work I expected serverless to play a significant role, but I have to admit I didn&rsquo;t anticipate the ways in which serverless would be used to reduce the steps it takes to actually deploy APIs. One of the tools I have been playing with for a couple of months now is <a href="https://nimbella.com/">Nimbella</a>, which describes itself as <em>&ldquo;the simplest way to build and run serverless applications&rdquo;</em>. I spent significant amounts of time building collections for deploying APIs to AWS using Lambda earlier this year, so when I had an API deploying in just a couple of minutes with Nimbella, you can say I was pretty impressed with what they have done to serverless by making it easy, but also bringing in the critical ingredients you need to actually deliver meaningful apps.</p>
<p class="p3">Nimbella is free to get started. Once you have logged in you can fire up your first project within 60 seconds, after installing the Nimbella CLI for Mac, Windows, or Linux. Once you have the CLI installed you can just execute:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>nim auth login [your token]&nbsp;</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">This command, plus all three runtimes are available on the home page of you account once you have signed up--then you can choose to install a single one of their start projects with:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/qrcode</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/visits</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/ocr</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/chat</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Or you can go ahead and clone all of their demo projects, which I recommend, because it allows you to reverser engineer a whole suite of simple serverless micro applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>git clone <a href="https://github.com/nimbella/demo-projects">https://github.com/nimbella/demo-projects</a></strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Within five minutes you can be reverse engineering what is possible when you deploy APIs and/or applications with Nimbella. With each Nimbella project you begin with two folders locally on your machine, the power your implementation:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Functions</strong> - This is the functional API side of the serverless app coin.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Web</strong> - This is the human web side of each micro application being delivered.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_09_09_at_1.36.12_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p3">Once your project is deployed, all you do is develop exactly the API and web application you need, and Nimbella syncs your local dev environment with the cloud. Abstracting away all the backend complexities of actually delivering a serverless API and application. After banging my head on the serverless worlds of each of the top three cloud providers I can seriously appreciate the frictionless deployment of Nimbella. They make it easy. I am not even touching on the application side of things, just the API. Where the Nimbella approach really shines is bringing in the ability to manage state, IAM, logging, and everything you will need to scale each of your APIs and applications, into a simple solution that will run in each of the clouds, or in an on-premise environment at the higher tiers. If you are truly looking to explore the world of serverless, but don&rsquo;t have an allegiance to any of the cloud providers I recommend checking out what is possible with Nimbella, it will make your first serverless experience much more more pleasant. Nimbella has abstracted away the complexities I first encountered with each of the cloud providers solutions, which made my early serverless journey a little hellish.</p>
<p class="p3">This is just the start of my work with Nimbella. I am preparing for my webinar with them next week, and next I am diving into how you can extend Nimbella using plugins, and specifically how you can rapidly deploy APIs from Postman Collections and OpenAPI definitions using Nimbella. Taking server side codegen to the next level, allowing you to rapidly generate the scaffolding for your APIs in seconds, using the Postman API builder and Nimbella to define each of your APIs. Going beyond just defining and mocking your APIs in Postman, and quickly deploying an API across cloud environments. I think once I write stories about each of the Postman and OpenAPI plugins for Nimbella, I might talk more about them being a true multi-cloud option, living up to the promise of serverless, but a promise that tends to fade as you are doing serverless on each individual cloud platform. <a href="https://nimbella.com/">Nimbella</a> holds a lot of potential for me when it comes to how we deploy APIs using Postman, and I am looking forward to this story series, but also <a href="https://www.postman.com/webinars/nimbella/">my webinar with them next week to show what is possible when you use Postman and Nimbella together</a>.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_09_09_at_3.55.41_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I am continue my storytelling around the work I am doing with Nimbella to help define what the future of API deployment looks like from within Postman, and next up on my list to do some storytelling around&nbsp;<a href="https://nimbella.com/integrations/postman">the Nimbella Postman Plugin</a>, which allows you to deploy the server-side scaffolding for an API in seven programming languages from a Postman collection. <a href="https://nimbella.com/">Nimbella is a dead simple way to deploy serverless APIs and applications</a>, which also possesses a plugin infrastructure that lets you extend the platform, and one of the plugins the Nimbella team has developed allows you to design your APIs using a Postman collection, then generate your serverless API project in Go, Node.js, Typescript, Python, Java, Swift, or PHP.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have signed up and logged into Nimbella, and installed the CLI for the platform, you can add the Postman plugin at the command line using:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>nim plugins add postman</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://github.com/nimbella/nimbella-cli-plugins/tree/main/postman">You can find the Postman plugin for Nimbella on Github</a> if you are looking to take things to the next level, but installing it is pretty dead simple with the one CLI statement. <a href="https://github.com/nimbella/nimbella-cli-plugins/tree/main/postman#usage-options">You can find all the usage options available for the Nimbella Postman CLI plugin on the GitHub README</a>, but here is a basic command that will generate an API project from any of your Postman collections.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>nim project create -s postman -i Products --language js</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This creates a new local Nimbella API project for me using a Postman collection in one of my Postman workspaces simple named &ldquo;Products&rdquo; in JavaScript. As soon as I want this API to be available in the cloud, I simply run this command:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>nim project deploy .</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Now I have my API. Of course I will still have to wire up the API to any actual database, functionality, or 3rd party AP or system I will be working with, but it gives me the skeleton of my serverless API in seconds&mdash;all originally defined in Postman as a collection.<span>&nbsp;</span>My API is in Node.js, but I can quickly do it in any of the other six languages, rapidly producing the most common and repetitive aspects of developing an API, while also abstracting all the complexities of delivering a serverless API that will scale as promised. What I love is the seamless interaction with Postman that Nimbella has introduced. Meaning, I can define, mock, and document my API using Postman, then once the collection is ready I can take it beyond just mock, and actually generate the server side code that will ultimately deliver the API. Nimbella brings the IAM, state management, logging, scaling, and load balancing to the table&mdash;doing the heavy lift when it comes to delivering an actual serverless API.</p>
<p class="p1">The Nimbella Postman plugin seamlessly works with Postman using the Postman API to automate the deployment of your APIs, augmenting an API-first approach to delivering APIs using Postman and Nimbella to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Automatically generate Nimbella Project structure with stubs, unit tests, and client code.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Generate language-specific project configuration, package/dependency management, and .gitignore files.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Generate Readme using collection description.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Update dummy API endpoints or non-existent URLs in the collection document with Nimbella namespace URLs that you get post-deployment.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Augment collection document with new Postman Tests.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Sync the updated collection to Postman Cloud.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Auto-convert version 1.0 collection into version 2.0.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Fetch responses in the collection from deployed URLs post-deployment.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Sync collection document to update in the Postman App.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Nimbella is one of what I&rsquo;d consider to be our first API lifecycle partners at Postman. Meaning, while Postman does service a number of different stops along the API lifecycle such as mocking, documentation, testing ,monitoring, etc, you can&rsquo;t actually deploy an API using Postman. So we are looking for partners to step up and help us deliver these stops along the API lifecycle for us. What Nimbella has delivered with their Postman plugin isn't just about enabling developers to deploy the scaffolding of their APIs using a Postman collection, but they have seamlessly integrated their platform with the Postman platform, taking full advantage of collections as well as the Postman API, to make deployment a seamless experience without actually changing the Postman desktop or web applications. These are the types of partners we are looking for when it comes to delivering across all stops along the API lifecycle.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/09/09/smoothing-the-rough-edges-off-serverless-with-nimbella/">My storytelling around Nimbella began with just talking about what they deliver</a>, and now their innovative Postman plugin. Next I am going to look at their OpenAPI plugin which does the same thing as the Postman plugin, but from an OpenAPI definition. In the Postman universe either of these approaches to deploying an API are acceptable. If you want the truth for your API to be a collection, it can be a collection. If you want the truth to be an OpenAPI definition, it can be an OpenAPI definition. This Swiss Army Knife approach to the API lifecycle is what Postman excels at. It isn&rsquo;t about there being one way to deploy an API--it is about accommodating many different approaches to delivering your API infrastructure. I think that Nimbella&rsquo;s approach to API development fits with our vision of the API lifecycle, and provides many different ways for you to bring your APIs to life. Partnering with Postman to help us deliver across the stops along a modern API lifecycle, while also delivering on the promise of a true <a href="https://nimbella.com/">multi-cloud approach to delivering serverless APIs.</a></p>

<p>title: ‘Not Being Able to Post to My Facebook Feed Using the API’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_09_02_at_9.43.00_pm.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v8.0/user/feed"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_09_02_at_9.43.00_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p3">I am hung up (once again) on the fact that I can&rsquo;t <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v8.0/user/feed">post to my personal Facebook feed via the Graph API</a>. Facebook removed the ability for you to add or update to your Facebook feed via the API in 2018. You can still post to pages via the API, but are out of luck via your personal profile. It drives me nuts because I queue, schedule, and automate a significant amount of my online presence. Honestly Facebook doesn&rsquo;t do much for my personal or professional online presence, but the fact that I can&rsquo;t do it is driving me nuts. I have an idea I want to implement around telling stories on Facebook, and without the ability to post via the API, the idea is a non-starter. I really bothers me when I can POST or PUT to any platform I depend on, and the fact that it is Facebook drives me even more nuts, making it something that I just can&rsquo;t seem to put down.</p>
<h3>Posting to My Facebook Wall Using Postman</h3>
<p class="p3">While you can&rsquo;t officially add to your feed via the official Facebook API, you can using Postman. You can install the Postman Interceptor Chrome extension, proxy traffic, and isolate the API call you need to post to your feed, including all the configuration and cookies you will need to make it work. I will write a separate post that walks through how to do this, but I just want to think through all of this before I move forward teaching other people how to do this. Like most everything with APIs, this isn&rsquo;t just technical, and there are numerous business and political considerations to flesh out before I just plow forward teaching everyone how to circumvent Facebooks limitations. I am not sure I want to me sharing this knowledge, let alone polishing the rough edges so that it is something that a wider audience can implement. You see, APIs are neither good, nor bad, nor neutral, and there is a reason Facebook shut these APIs down, and there are plenty of people who are looking to exploit our worlds via Facebook these days. This stuff isn&rsquo;t ever straightforward.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Using Postman to Automate Storytelling on Facebook</h3>
<p class="p3">I want to tell stories via my Facebook profile. I want to be able to craft 12 hour storytelling productions composed of text, images, and links which get scheduled and posted to my Facebook profile. I don&rsquo;t get any business value from Facebook, but there is a certain performance value gained when I use my Facebook soap box to broadcast to the &ldquo;friends&rdquo; I have there. However, I don&rsquo;t want to be posting each scene of my production via the Facebook interface, using their &ldquo;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/">sharing products</a>&rdquo;. I want to queue up 10, 20, or 30 individual posts under the umbrella of a single production, then schedule the posts to trickle out over a 12 hour period. I am looking to perform fictional and non-fictional stories via my personal Facebook profile, performing for my network, taking advantage of the only value Facebook brings me&mdash;influencing my friends, family, and acquaintances. I just want more control over my Facebook narrative, and because Facebook isn&rsquo;t interested in properly defending users against abuse, I can&rsquo;t do this through the front door (UI).</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/leaflets-of-the-russian-revolution-big-antennae-tower.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p3">This type of storytelling isn&rsquo;t a new idea for me. The original idea comes from 2 or 3 years back, and involves expanding my Facebook storytelling to include other diverse voices. I don&rsquo;t just want to produce my own stories to perform on Facebook, I want to subscribe to other people&rsquo;s stories, and perform them via my own Facebook profile. I want to solicit stories from other diverse voices from around the world, encourage them to craft thoughtful narratives using text, images, and links, then bundle them up so that I can queue them up, schedule, and perform their stories via my own Facebook profile. I want to take my storytelling format and open it up to other interesting characters, and turn my friends, family, and acquaintances into the audience for my &ldquo;Facebook production&rdquo;. Using my platform to help expose them to other ideas that I think are interesting, bringing thought provoking stories to their Facebook stream, going beyond what I am capable of saying and doing on my own, but more importantly giving voice to other people. The challenge here, is while I have creative and positive motivations behind wanting to do this, the way that I am potentially &ldquo;renting&rdquo; out my profile to other people, is something that many will see as problematic, and something Facebook surely won&rsquo;t like very much (which is sad ;-), and if I enable using Postman, it is something that bad actors can potentially take advantage of as well.</p>

<p class="p3">I have no real insight into why Facebook shut down their APIs for posting to the Graph API. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/">Their original announcement really doesn&rsquo;t give many of the reasons behind</a>, just burying <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/breaking-changes#login-4-24">the breaking change amidst a flurry of API changes in the wake of the Cambridge Analytic scandal</a>. Bots, automation, and abuse is common place via any API platform, and it is something that Twitter, Slack, and others have to deal with as well. This problem isn&rsquo;t unique to Facebook, so there are precedents for how to deal with&mdash;Facebook just doesn&rsquo;t care about other approaches. The sensible approach would be not get rid of the ability to post to an API, but to begin developing a set of policies for what is acceptable automation and what isn&rsquo;t, keeping track of the good actors as well as the bad actors. Along the way, amidst all of the turmoil of the last election Facebook made the decision to not invest in managing automation and abuse, and to just stop allowing for adding and updating to personal feeds via the API. It was easier. Sadly, shutting down the API paths for adding and updating items from your personal Facebook feed does not stop automation and abuse. As I can demonstrate via Postman, there are numerous ways you can automate through the browser, and reverse engineer how the Facebook UI submits to the API. They aren&rsquo;t stopping the automated posting of messages, they are just pushing it further into the shadows where they don&rsquo;t have to see it, or acknowledge it. This is the politics of APIs. This doesn&rsquo;t stop bad actors, it just makes it harder for good actors to deliver meaningful orchestrations outside the Facebook domain, while offloading responsibility for bad behavior.</p>
<p class="p3">There are numerous approaches to automating activity on Facebook, but one of the most common is for Facebook users to just give their username and password over to someone else, handing over their accounts to puppet masters who automate and spread disinformation, initiate likes, follows, and exchange in all the other social currencies that feed Facebook&rsquo;s business model. If I accept stories from other people and publish them to my Facebook profile, what makes me different from someone who turns over their account to the control of some other actor? I guess that I am choosing the stories that get published, and I am still going to be the curator of what gets published to my profile&mdash;it is just the stories that do not originate from me. But what percentage of stories do anyways? Facebook wants me to orchestrate each of these engagements using their &ldquo;sharing products&rdquo;, but I still want the ability to step one step back and schedule or automate the stories I want to appear on my timeline. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to operate in the shadows to get this done. If Facebook doesn&rsquo;t want to build out this capability I should be able to do it myself. OK. Lets just pause here for a moment. Really, what right do I have to demand this of Facebook? None. I guess I believe in some original bullshit about the web being free and open, and that all platforms should have APIs. If we believe that the platforms possess the power, then I guess we are all helpless in these battles. That is what this is all really about for me. It is about who has the power, and they&rsquo;ve further eroded the power I have over a significant slice of my digital self&mdash;the part that exists in the <a href="http://Facebook.com"><span class="s3">Facebook.com</span></a> domain. Which collectively represents are pretty influential part of our society.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/leaflets-of-the-russian-revolution-downtown-street-crosswalk.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Holding Platforms Like Facebook to a Higher Standard</h3>
<p class="p3">While I believe that Facebook&rsquo;s domain (<a href="http://facebooke.com"><span class="s3">facebook.com</span></a>) is theirs, and I am just operating on their platform. I also think that with mobile devices, and us engaging on these platforms from within our homes, while handing over many of our relationships and engagements with friends, family, and the public, that any domain can be elevated to new levels. I think Facebook and Twitter are approaching a level where they can be seen as a public service, and require more regulation and oversight. Media outlets are regulated. Telcos are regulated. Online domains aren&rsquo;t being regulated because they are so new. This is how we go from me believing that platforms SHOULD have APIs to platforms MUST to have APIs. If I depend on Facebook for election information, assistance in a disaster, and as a critical communication channel when it comes to my personal and professional lives, then there should be higher expectations for the access and control I have over my data on the platform. We have seen <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/01/22/key-points-from-the-payment-services-directive-2-psd2/">API regulation emerge dictating that banks in Europe have to possess public APIs</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/05/05/hhs-and-cms-finalizes-rules-to-provide-patients-more-control-of-their-health-data-using-apis/">recently with healthcare providers in the U.S. that work with Health and Human Services (HHS), and Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS)</a>. Further regulatory frameworks like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in California are setting the stage for wider productions around tech platforms, with APIs playing a central role in how this is accomplished. The regulation of tech platforms is coming, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p class="p2">While I believe that regulation is coming I do not believe that it will come easily, and be anywhere near fully baked and speaking for end-users like me when it does become a reality. This is why I am still toying with operating in the shadows using a Postman collection, and even further polishing my process, making it accessible to a wider audience. Not because I think it is the right thing to do, but because it further puts pressure on Facebook, and tells the story about how access and control over our own information and digital presence is being restricted and pushed further into the shadows. Why should I be able to give access to 3rd party providers of my choice to read my Facebook data, but not be able to add and update it. Just because Facebook isn&rsquo;t interested in managing abuse, exploitation, and disinformation. It has been been over two years since Facebook shut down the add and update capabilities via the Graph feed API, and they&rsquo;ve repeatedly demonstrated that they are only curbing abuse on the platform when something makes the news, and looks badly on the platform. I am not keen on having to reverse engineer platforms so that I can have access to my own data, but I am very keen on shining a spotlight on this line in the API universe, and keep things on the public API side of this coin, rather than buried behind web and mobile applications, only accessible to those who are savvy enough to pull the curtain back a bit. Well, luckily Postman excels at pulling the curtain back on what is going on via Facebook, Instagram, and any platform that uses APIs (which is all of them). This frontline is the divide between those who are open and observable with their APIs and those who aren&rsquo;t. A line I have been walking back and forth along since 2010.</p>

<h3>A Postman Collection and Interceptor Powered Facebook Production</h3>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo?hl=en">I can reverse engineer how Facebook adds posts to a users feed using Postman Interceptor</a>. I can save this as a Postman collection that I can run manually. I can also schedule this to run on a regular interval using a monitor. I can develop other APIs and user interfaces to help craft stories for publishing to Facebook. I can also add scripts to each collection to pull these scripted stories and automate the publishing of stories to my Facebook profile. The removal of the Facebook API paths haven&rsquo;t stopped me from automating what gets posted to my Facebook wall. It just pushed me further into the shadows. I don&rsquo;t want to be here, but I also want to be able to tell stories via my Facebook profile. I want to be able to tell stories about what matters to me right now in a Black Lives Matter Uprising. I want to be able to counteract the poison of disinformation that is ubiquitous on the Facebook platform right now. Facebook trying to restrict my voice just makes me more determined. The problem with this view though, is if I make it so that I can tell my story, then open that up for others to tell their story, then I am opening up this ability to a wider world of unknown actors that I can not guarantee will act in the same ethical and creative way that I will. So, should this stop me from doing it? Should we silence ourselves, and let Facebook silence us, just because we are operating off the radar in the shadows? From where I stand right now, the answer is no. I am going to go ahead and see if I can refine my approach to automating the posting of text, links, and images to Facebook using the shadow APIs behind the application, using a Postman collection.</p>
<p class="p3">I am obsessed with being able to tell stories on Facebook as well as tell the story of Facebook. I would rather to be able to do this via a proper API, but I will tell the story either way. It seems crazy to be so obsessed with just being able to schedule and automate my story versus me writing or pasting in and hitting submit, but it matters. This is really about Facebook not wanting to properly manage automation on their platform. It is really about Facebook keeping all the power for themselves, keeping it open for partners and bad actors, while restricting the power and control we have over our own data. This is about making sure the platforms we depend on in the public domain are as observable as possible so that the community can help keep the platform honest. I know that most people don&rsquo;t see this line that I live and breathe each day, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it doesn&rsquo;t matter, and that it shouldn&rsquo;t be pushed back into the shadows, leaving us more exposed, and with less control. Facebook is an important platform. Like Twitter, I am not willing to completely walk away from it. I fee like it is my responsibility to help shine a light on what is going on, and keep telling stories about this digital line that exists in our world. A line that regularly defines who we are each day, while also opening up our personal world to more surveillance and exploitation when not properly managed. In the end, the most important part of all of this for me is that I am being denied the ability to tell my stories. I just want to be able to tell my own stories via my Facebook profile, and also open it up to others people&rsquo;s stories if I so choose. Allowing me to elevate other voices that I wish to be heard, turning my Facebook profile into a production of my choosing. Counteracting the much darker storytelling that is dominating this platform today, helping bring more balance to the digital world that has been consuming our physical one over the last 20 years.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<hr />

<p>I am working on several demonstrations of what is possible when you use OpenAPI on the Postman platform, and as part of this storytelling I want to use the OpenAPI of leading API platforms to demonstrate what is possible. I am looking to showcase the potential of using an OpenAPI as a base of the API integration and development lifecycle, and today I wanted to showcase what you can quickly do when you put the OpenAPI for the Twitter API into a Postman workspace.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/twitter_openapi.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p>This OpenAPI can act as the truth for a variety of lifecycle activities, but to begin with I usually generate two collections. One for providing reference documentation for the entire API, and another to provide me with a mock representation of the entire surface area of the API, helping me articulate what the API does to team members, while also kicking the etires on it before I have to obtain a token or key.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/twitter_mock.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p>This approach isn't unique to the Twitter API, and can be used by API providers to guide the development of APIs, or it can be done by API consumers to help localize documentation, mock servers, and other resources you will need to work with an API. If you want to see it in action you can walk through a short video, showing how you can do this in just a few minutes using Postman.</p>

<p>title: ‘A Diverse API Workspace Example Using OpenAPI and GraphQL From GitHub’</p>

<p class="p3">Like other successful API patterns REST and GraphQL have been in competition for mindshare since GraphQL emerged on the landscape. GraphQL folks love to say it is a replacement for REST, and the RESTafarians love to point out GraphQL&rsquo;s weaknesses. When in reality they are both very useful patterns that API providers and consumers should be aware of, and possess in their API toolboxes. In an effort to continue showcasing t<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/08/31/a-diverse-api-toolbox-is-the-future/">he importance of having a diverse API toolbox</a>, I wanted to take a walk through my GitHub API workspace, which I use personally, but wanted to take a spin through it to help polish some of the rougher edges of my approach, before I invite some other team members to use my workspace.</p>
<h3>An OpenAPI and GraphQL Core</h3>
<p class="p3">While I have many orphan API collections laying around in workspaces, my more robust workspaces tend to leverage OpenAPI as the truth of each API, but with the GitHub API I have the opportunity to provide both an OpenAPI and GraphQL API side by side in a single workspace. Providing me with the base for all of the collections I am generating, evolving, and making work for me when integrating, automating, and orchestrating with the GitHub API.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>GitHub V3 OpenAPI</strong> - GitHub maintains an OpenAPI definition for their web API, allowing anyone to use as the base for generating docs, mocks, tests, and integrate, automate, and orchestrate across the API lifecycle.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>GotJib v4 GraphQL</strong> - I pulled the schema definition language (SDL) for the GitHub GraphQL, and published it as an API, which I can then use to generate collections&mdash;there is only a single endpoint, but still provides me with a base.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">These two API contracts provide me with a machine readable description of what is possible when it comes to working with the GitHub API. However, both of these require you to be fluent in OpenAPI and / or GraphQL to be able to get what you want out of the GitHub API. It is my job to help Postman customers and partners understand what is possible when it comes to producing on-boarding, reference, workflow, and other types of collections&mdash;this is where things begin to get really good, and actually reduce friction for developers.</p>
<h3>GitHub API Reference Collections</h3>
<p class="p3">The place most Postman users start when it comes to generating Postman collections from OpenAPI or GraphQL is some sort of reference collection that details everything that is going on with an API. I have that for GitHub, providing any developer within my API workspace to see the full menu of what is possible with both of the GitHub APIs.</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="20%"><strong>Web API V3</strong></td>
<td><strong><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/SzS8rjHv?version=latest">Docs</a></strong></td>
<td>Generating a collection for all of the 623 API methods available in the OpenAPI, providing a complete menu of what is possible with the GitHub API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>GraphQL API V4</strong></td>
<td><strong><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/SzS8rjHv?version=latest">Docs</a></strong></td>
<td>I will be honest, this is that robust yet, as I need to understand more about how you make GraphQL SDL more tangible using docs, making it something you can see.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="p3">Upon entering my API workspaces I like having a full menu of the GitHub resources available to me. I use these reference documentation to learn about the surface area of the GitHub APIs, then use the to remix on-boarding, workflow, and other types of collections that help me integrate, automate, and orchestrate using the API. These GitHub API reference collections become the seeds for the rest of my GitHub API awareness, informing what is possible when it comes to leverae=ging GitHub as part of my underlying API infrastructure.</p>
<h3>GitHub API On-Boarding Collections</h3>
<p class="p3">Once I open up my GitHub workspace to other developers I can&rsquo;t expect all of them to be equipped when it comes to making sense of the vast landscape of the GitHub Web API or the GitHub GraphQL API. They may or may not haver used the API, and will likely possess different levels of experience when it comes to using GitHub. To help deal with this reality, I am always making sure there are one or more on-boarding collections that help introduce people to each of the APIs.</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="20%"><strong><strong>Web API V3</strong></strong></td>
<td><strong><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/35240/TVCe39ME">Docs</a></strong></td>
<td>When I don&rsquo;t want to overwhelm a developer (or non-developer) with all 623 API methods available with the GitHub web API I point them to a hello world collection for the API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><strong>GraphQL API V4</strong></strong></td>
<td><strong><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/35240/TVCe39MD">Docs</a></strong></td>
<td>When I don&rsquo;t think someone will be able to get up to speed on everything GraphQL is, I will point them to a simple on-boarding collection to get them seeing how it works.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="p3">These collections help me onboard new developers to the GitHub API without overwhelming them. I want them to be able to understand how to go get their own personal access tokens from their GitHub account, configure their environment, and begin kicking the tires on either of the APIs without much of a cognitive load. I want developers to be successful, and helping minimize the amount of drowning they might have to do when it comes to learning about the API is pretty important.</p>
<h3>GitHub API Workflow Collections</h3>
<p class="p3">With the foundation of my GitHub API workspace laid, I can get to work defining collections that actually help me accomplish specific tasks on any given day. These are collections that help me make single or a sequence of API calls to accomplish a specific operational level workflow. Here are just a few examples of GitHub API workflow collections that I will use independently, or as the seeds of other workflows for specific organizations, repositories, and other dimensions of the GitHub universe.</p>

<p class="p3">This is just a sampling of the types of workflow collections I can derive from my GitHub Web API or GitHub GraphQL API. I can provide different approaches for different developers to integrate, automate, and orchestrate using the GitHub API. Depending on their understanding and experience with REST or GraphQL APIs they can put a variety of existing GitHub API workflow collections to use, fork, duplicate, and create entirely new types of collections, allowing them to remix and work with the entire surface area of GitHub APIs.</p>
<h3>GitHub API Lifecycle Collections</h3>
<p class="p3">I could stop there, but really the reason I want all of these reference, onboarding and workflow collections is so I can use the GitHub API to help improve my own API operations. GitHub is an essential piece of infrastructure for delivering my own APIs, and using Postman I want to be able to help scale how developers make sense of not just GitHub, but API operations as a whole&mdash;which GitHub is the factory floor of.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Documentation</strong> - I can publish and share documentation from any of these collections, providing portable reference documentation for the GitHub API, as well as documentation for specific API operational level workflows.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Mock Servers</strong> - I can publish mocked representations of any part of the GitHub API as well as any of the workflow collections I am delivering, potentially providing little portable sandbox representations of workflows for testing and onboarding.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Testing</strong> - I can use them to develop testing collections that don&rsquo;t test the availability and reliability of the GitHub APIs, but of the expected outcomes from each of the workflow collections I am building&mdash;I might even test the progress developers make onboarding with APIs.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Support</strong> - I am using GitHub issues as the feedback loop across many of my API projects, making the GitHub issues API a perfect place to help me automate and manage the feedback loop across all of my API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">There are many other stops along the API lifecycle that I could be using the GitHub API to help me automate my API operations. Postman isn&rsquo;t just about consuming the GitHub API, it can also be about helping me automate and orchestrate the API lifecycle behind the APIs I am delivering. Adding another entire dimension to how I use APIs to deliver APIs, leveling up the game when it comes to scaling what you can do with APIs.</p>
<h3>Turning It All Into a Factory Floor</h3>
<p class="p3">The purpose of a dedicated workspace for GitHub is to provide me with a single place that I can define and put to work all of these different types of collections built on top of the GitHub API. This allows me, and anyone I invite to the workspace to leverage it all as part of an API factory floor, providing all of the tooling, but also the conveyor belts to actually move the API discussion forward across teams, using the following resources.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Runners</strong> - All workflow and lifecycle collections can be manually run by any developer who has access to the workspace, executing all requests contained in the collection, with test results outputted as part of each run.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Monitors</strong> - All workflow and lifecycle collections can be scheduled to run using monitors, executing all the requests within a collection, applying different environments and data files to further focus the outcomes of each execution.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Pipelines</strong> - All workflow and lifecycle collections can also be baked into the pipeline using the open source runner Newman, further baking GitHub API workflows into the existing pipelines that are deploying and integrating with APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_platform.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p3">Workspaces allow me to organize all of my OpenAPI and GraphQL definitions, demonstrating what is possible, but also the derivative collections that help me actually set these possibilities in motion. This is something that I can open up to other team members, allowing me to define what is possible across both GitHub APIs, while also providing a suite of workflows that anyone with access to the workspace can put into motion using their own keys, tokens, and other relevant context defined as Postman environments.</p>
<h3>It's Not OpenAPI vs GraphQL, it is OpenAPI and GraphQL</h3>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/10/focus-on-having-a-robust-and-diverse-api-toolbox/">I began talking about a diverse API toolbox a couple years back</a>, and it is something I&rsquo;ve been working to keep top of mind by providing real world examples of what I am talking about. GitHub provides me the perfect opportunity to show how these two API patterns and work in concert. It also provides me the ability to showcase what Postman can do when it comes to defining reference collections, but more importantly it helps me make the GitHub API more useful to other developers with onboarding, workflow, and lifecycle collections. Helping abstract away much of the complexity and robustness of the GitHub API, and assisting them in finding the most meaningful workflows they need to be more successful in their jobs. I feel like this is the hard work API providers need to be doing right now. I am happy to help by fleshing this out for some of the leading API providers, but ultimately each API provider and their community is going to have to hammer out what the meaningful workflows are in their world, pushing APIs beyond just providing reference documentation and collections, and defining meaningful capabilities that can be executed manually or automated as part of regular operations, in an DevOps / APIOps way.</p>
<p class="p3">I am going to keep working on diverse API toolbox examples like this one. I am going to work involving some SOAP APIs, and look at doing some EDI APIs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Postman isn&rsquo;t a TCP client (yet), otherwise I&rsquo;d be doing this with Websockets with Slacks two APIs, and Kafka, NATS, and other event and message driven APIs. Next I am going to apply this same approach to the Atlassian APIs, and see if I can come up a pretty DevOPs / APIOps set of workspaces that can help us leverage GitHub, JIRA, Confluence, and other infrastructure we use across our APIs in new ways. I am also working through Twitter, Twilio, Stripe, and some other leading APIs to further flesh out what my workspaces look like for these platforms. I am looking to really push my set of API workspace blueprints forward, helping me push forward not just how OpenAPI and GraphQL work together, but also what the relationship is between these two standards and Postman collections. Providing a suite of blueprints that any API provider can follow when it comes to crafting their own workspaces, helping define what the factory floor of their API operations look like. Using leading API providers like GitHub, Atlassian, and others to showcase how modern API operations can work when applying a diverse API toolbox across teams.</p>

<p>One of the teams I work closely with at Postman is the group behind mocking APIs with Postman. The ability to statically mock APIs has received a lot of investment when it comes to recent releases, and in a couple of my Postman partner conversations I have been asked for more information about how to mock API using Postman. So, in an effort to reach the widest possible audience as I can, I wanted to write up an overview on the current state of mocking APIs using Postman, to help get everyone up to speed&mdash;including myself. ;-)</p>
<h3>Overview of Mocks Using Postman</h3>
<p>To get started with understanding the value of mocking APIs I recommend visiting <a href="https://www.postman.com/features/mock-api/">the dedicated marketing page Postman has up for mocking APIs</a>. This provides you with the meat of what you&rsquo;ll need to make the argument for mocks across your team, as well as your leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>See Exactly How Your API will Run&mdash;Even Before It's in Production </strong>- API design is the key to building quality APIs that last. Postman's mock API servers simplify design and planning, support split-stack development, and help you ensure that your API will run the way it's supposed to in production.</li>
<li><strong>Shorten Time to Production</strong> - Work more efficiently with Postman's API mock servers. Postman mocks support split-stack development so front-end and back-end developers can work in parallel and view responses without spinning up the back end.</li>
<li><strong>Design Your API with Flexible Schema Support</strong> - Postman mock servers complement Postman's extended schema support. Write, edit, or import your API schema to define your API's data structure and generate a collection from your API schema. You can review API responses using mock servers so you can reliably build your API from the ground up&mdash;all in one central place.</li>
<li><strong>Simulate the Expected Behavior of Your API -</strong> Postman Mock Servers simulate API responses that applications and services can utilize even before the API is built. Postman matches requests and generate responses to show you how your API will run in production.</li>
<li><strong>Catch and Fix Bugs Early </strong>- Mock servers increase visibility into errors and weak spots in your API, so you can debug effectively and efficiently. You can easily use mock servers to test for response errors continuously or as often as you need throughout the API lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Create Public or Private Mock Servers in Postman -</strong> Postman provides two different types of mock servers. Public mock servers are great for open source or individual projects, but if you're working on internal or private APIs, you can easily keep your APIs secure by viewing API responses with private mock servers.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize Your Data </strong>- Postman Visualizer can help turn your API data into charts and graphs. Combined with Postman mocks, developers can utilize Visualizer to help API consumers more easily understand API responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should help you build a case for why you should be mocking. Providing the 100K view of what is possible with Postman mocks, but also understand the business value for your team learning to mock. If you were looking for something a little more substantial don&rsquo;t worry, the next section will start getting you into the weeds of what it takes to setup mock servers, and make sure you have rich collections available to power your mock APIs.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Mock Servers</h3>
<p>This section is all about giving you the base you will need to understand how mocks work, and what you will need to setup, work with, and make sense of how Postman mock servers best fit in with your operations. Helping you on-board with the concept of mocking, but then quickly move to something that is functional within your own Postman workspace.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/#creating-mock-servers">Creating mock servers</a></strong> - You can create mock servers from an existing collection, or Postman will create a new collection for your mock server.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/#configuring-mock-details">Configuring mock details</a></strong> - When you create a mock server you will give it a name, choose a version tag (if your collection has a specific version you want to mock), and select an optional environment to use with the requests.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/#making-requests-to-mocks">Making requests to mocks</a></strong> - With your mock URL, you can start making requests right away. Make sure the request you want to mock has at least one example added to it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/#using-http-access-control-for-a-mock">Using HTTP access control</a></strong> - In addition to using the Postman app to make requests to mock endpoints, you can also make those requests in a browser.</li>
<li><span class="s1"><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/#viewing-mock-calls">Viewing mock calls</a></strong> - You can view and search the details of calls to your mock servers using the mock call log.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/#troubleshooting-mock-calls">Troubleshooting mock calls</a></strong> - You can use the mock call log to troubleshoot your requests to mock servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Postman mock servers are just what is widely considered to be &ldquo;static mocks&rdquo;, there is a lot of functionality in there that will help you make these static representations of your APIs much more functional, moving them much closer to what is considered to be &ldquo;dynamic mocks&rdquo;&mdash;which walks a fine line between dynamic representations of your APIs and actually deploying them.</p>
<h3>Mocking with Examples</h3>
<p>Mock servers on the Postman platform are all powered by Postman collections, leveraging examples for each individual API request as the potential response for each mocked API. Giving you full control over what gets returned for all of your mocked APIs, allowing you to customize and personalize the static responses that are returned for each API request.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mocking-with-examples/#setting-up-some-basics">Setting up some basics</a></strong> - Before you get into the details of mocking, let&rsquo;s start with setting up some basics required for mocks to work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mocking-with-examples/#adding-more-examples">Adding more examples</a></strong> - To further illustrate how responses from the mock service are entirely dependent on your saved examples, let's try adding another example to this collection.</li>
<li><span class="s1"><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mocking-with-examples/#using-random-data-dynamic-variables">Using random data dynamic variables</a></strong> - You can use random data dynamic variables in your Mock Server's Example Response Body.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mocking-with-examples/#using-query-params">Using query params</a></strong> - Postman's Mock server functionality is enhanced to return different responses based on matching request query params.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mocking-with-examples/#mocking-graphql-queries">Mocking GraphQL queries</a></strong> - Postman enables you to mock your GraphQL queries easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>The robustness and completeness of your examples will define the functionality of your APIs. The more rich your examples are within your Postman collection, the more meaningful your mock APIs will be. For new APIs this will require a significant amount of planning and work to create these examples, but if it is an existing API you can easily make calls to the APIs, save, then edit each response, making quick work of creating what you need to mock your APIs.</p>
<h3>Mocking by API</h3>
<p>An important dimension of mocking APIs on the Postman platform is the ability to create, manage, and destroy your mock servers using the Postman API.<span>&nbsp; </span>Using the Postman API to automate and orchestrate how you mock your APIs is a great way to reduce the workload when it comes to ensuring there is mock coverage across all of the API you are managing using Postman.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_platform_marketecture.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1"><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mock-with-api/#set-up-a-collection-for-mocking">Set up a collection for mocking</a></strong> - Collectionis are the core of mock servers on Postman, and this will help you understand what is going into each one.</span></li>
<li><span class="s1"><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mock-with-api/#retrieve-information-needed-for-mock-creation">Retrieve information needed for mock creation</a></strong> - You need a collection and environment to make your mock server work, so this will help make sure you have those, and their unique identifiers.</span></li>
<li><span class="s1"><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mock-with-api/#set-up-a-collection-for-mocking">Create a mock using the Postman API</a></strong> - With all of the details for your collection and environment you can actually automate the creation of the mock API using the Postman API.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mock-with-api/#run-the-mock-service">Run the mock service</a></strong> - This provides you with the details you need to actually begin making calls to the mock server you just setup, providing a common set of patterns for the URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Postman API helps reduce the workload when it comes to crafting the collection you will need, with all of the examples you will need. It also helps you manage the lifecycle and availability of mock servers for different business workflows, going well beyond just having a single reference mock for all of your APIs, and making sure your mocked APIs reference specific business processes that can be executed via your API.</p>
<h3>A Few More Resources for Your Journey</h3>
<p>That should give you the 100K view of why you should be mocking your APIs, the details you need to make that happen, as well as a look at how you can automate and orchestrate mock APIs using the Postman API. In addition to the marketing and documentation above I recommend taking look at these two videos from our team when it comes to working with mocks via the Postman platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXjoya11RAg">POST/CON 2018 workshop in review: Mock servers</a></strong>&nbsp;- While a little dated, Joyce gives a great walk through of what Postman mock servers can do.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZOwHyCl9sY">Building a mock API: Postman live stream on Twitch</a></strong>&nbsp;- Joyce and Arlemi go into some great details about mocking with Postman on a recent live stream.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also playing around with a couple of prototypes for mocking APIs using Postman. Going beyond the traditional use cases and pushing Postman mocks into some new areas like publishing simple data APIs using mocks, or providing a specific API business use case via an API sandbox. Like the rest of Postman, there are many different ways you can put mocks to work, so I will be further fleshing out some of the use cases, going beyond just AI design first, testing, and the other common arguments for mock servers. This is the part of my job that I enjoy the most&mdash;pushing both the platform and user&rsquo;s imagination when it comes to what is possible with Postman and the API lifecycle. If there are mock use cases you'd ilke to see as part of Postman mocks, or have specific situations you'd like to explore, feel free to reach out--I am happy to incorporate them into my regular storytelling and evangelism.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/birth-of-a-nation-working-on-railroad-2.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" />&lt;p class="p1"&gt;One of the reason you always want to surround yourself with people who call bullshit on meaningless trends is that when you begin to fall under the spell of each wave of API blah blah blah, they will slap you upside the head and remind you what this is all about. This happened to me the other day when I mistakenly mentioned that the future of APIs is event-driven, and Fran Méndez (<a href="https://twitter.com/fmvilas?lang=en">@fmvilas</a>) from <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI</a> slapped me upside the head and reminded that the future is about possessing a diverse API toolbox, allowing you to apply just the right approach to APIs for the job. Making sure we are equipped to deliver useful and meaningful APIs, not just the latest API blah blah blah because we heard it was cool somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">HTTP APIs, or as they are often referred to as REST APIs, are always the base layer for any API operation. This is where everyone should begin, but there are a number of other healthy patterns in use that teams should be aware of, and able to confidently implement. I began working working on this narrative back in March of 2017 with a <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/10/focus-on-having-a-robust-and-diverse-api-toolbox/">Focus on Having a Robust and Diverse API Toolbox</a>, which is something I kept expanding on in January of 2018 with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/01/02/my-evolving-definition-of-a-robust-and-diverse-api-toolbox/">My Evolving Definition of a Robust and Diverse API Toolbox</a>, culminating in <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/02/03/api-is-not-just-rest/">a talk that I gave at API Days Paris about APIs Not Just Being REST</a>. I am thankful for Fran slapping me and reminding me that I shouldn’t fall under the spell of any single API design pattern, and that a diversity in learnings and implementations is critical to being successful in the API long game.</p>
<p class="p1">REST, SOAP, Hypermedia, GraphQL, WebSub, Kafka, and many other successful API patterns dot the landscape. REST is dominant because it is simple and reflects the web, but as many practitioners point out, it will begin to fail you in a variety of use cases. In the ongoing expansion of the API universe there has always been, and will always be, believers of a specific API pattern who like to say it is the one pattern to rule them all. Always avoid this people. If someone says that GraphQL will work in all situations, they likely don’t have very wide experience in the API sector. If someone says that SOAP is dead, they likely haven’t worked much within the enterprise or government agencies. If someone says your APIs have to be all be level-4 REST then they are likely are part of a cult of religious believers called RESTafarians. There is no single API pattern to rule them all, there are only informed and uninformed API practitioners, who are putting APIs to work across the factory floor of their organizations.</p>
<p class="p1">While I have been doing this work for over a decade now I still fall prey to the most attractive narrative of the day. This is how storytelling works. This is why you can’t just surround yourself with marketers or ego-driven evangelists like me, and you need to have people who get their hands dirty with different approaches to delivering APIs, regularly engage in conversations with folks on the ground within enterprise organizations, and aren’t afraid to correct you when you are using the wrong words or phrases to talk about the present or the future. Our words matter. With this in mind, the future isn’t event-driven, eventful, or other exciting pattern du jour, and as Fran said, the future is about having a diverse API toolbox. If you, or someone else is pushing your operations to be more event-driven in this moement, make sure you are thinking it through. Make sure you are asking the right questions, and have sufficiently stepped back and are able to see the big picture before you commit fully to setting things in motion. Even-driven can help you solve a lot of problems, but like any other pattern, if you haven't properly crafted a coherent strategy, you might just be creating more problems for yourself.</p>

<p class="p1">The discovery of APIs has been the single most significant issue I&rsquo;ve tracked on and contributed to over my career as the API Evangelist. It is also one of the stops along the API lifecycle I have been very frustrated with due to a lack of things moving forward over the last decade. While there has been many failed attempts at folks trying to bring new API solutions to the table, the conversation really hasn&rsquo;t gone anywhere. That is, until the last couple of years, where we are seeing a new crop of interesting API service providers who are looking to address API discovery in new and interesting ways, bundling the discovery of APIs with other functions that help speak to the business bottom line, going well beyond just searching for APIs across the enterprise, or on the open web.</p>
<p class="p1">I am tuned into a handful of new API focused startups who are coming at API discovery from a variety of angles, but one of them I have been meeting with weekly to discuss the importance of API discovery, but also API governance, is with <a href="https://apidiscovery.teejlab.com/our-solution/">the folks from TeejLab</a>, who provide a view of the API discovery landscape through the enterprise risk management lens. TeejLab&rsquo;s API discovery solution isn&rsquo;t some API catalog or search engine, they help you discovery APIs across your existing operations, then evaluate and better manage how they are put work moving forward. Helping enterprise organizations find the existing internal, partner, and public APIs they already depend on is the #1 challenge enterprise organizations face right, and it is a problem that is only going to exponentially get worse in coming years. This is what makes TeejLab&rsquo;s so relevant, in that they don&rsquo;t just help you discover your APIs so you can use them, they help you assess the security, privacy, licensing, and other risks that come with unmanaged, ungoverned API chaos that exists across most enterprise organizations today.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://apidiscovery.teejlab.com/our-solution/">When it comes to API discovery, TeejLab will scour your repositories, log files, and other common network locations looking for signs of APIs in usage</a>. This type of automated API discovery is a growing trend among startups. But where TeejLab goes further than others I am seeing is the start drilling down on the details of how that APIs being used, helping understand the good and bad of this API, and all of the risk associated with putting it to use as part of operations. Once it discovers APIs it willl scan for common OWASP and PCI vulnerabilities, and generate critical compliance reports to satisfy regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPPA, and other laws in place to product end-users. I have never met an enterprise organization that knew where all of their APIs were, making TeejLab&rsquo;s approach to API discovery pretty critical, but I think it is the added value of helping you analyze, manage, and then evolve your usage of these APIs in a way that helps you mitigate risk is where it takes API discovery to the next level, and something that will begin to shift the conversation. While finding APIs is important, I think it is the additional helping you make sense of the chaos that will shift things into a higher gear in the next decade.</p>
<p class="p1">The ability to discover APIs at the enterprise level is critical, but what really interested me with what TeejLab is doing is applying their platform to the public sphere, and making sense of different industries. I am doing a big push into Healthcare and Fintech for Postman right now, and I am meeting weekly with Baljeet Malhotra (<a href="https://twitter.com/BaljeetMalhotra">@BaljeetMalhotra</a>) to discuss these two industries, but also think about how we can improve the discovery that happens within additional business sectors. TeejLab has been turning their platform outwards to discover APIs that are available publicly, but then use their algorithms to help me examine, rate, and make sense of the quality of the API that exist within each industry. I am working with a variety of API service provider partners <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes">to develop a mix of industry API toolboxes</a>, and I&rsquo;ll be working with TeejLab to help push this work into many different verticals, while also define a mix of machine readable artifacts that can help us make sense of the quality of APIs being indexed as part of these toolboxes. If I&rsquo;ve learned one thing over the last decade it is that more APIs aren&rsquo;t always better, and I am eager to develop more ways to help us work our way through the lesser quality APIs, and quickly find the APIs that do what we want, but also ensure we aren&rsquo;t inviting more risk into our operations. Which I am learning is the most important aspect of API discovery, and the parts that are going to incentivize enterprise organizations to step and put services like TeejLab to work.</p>
<p class="p2">I am a big proponent of enterprise organizations developing a formal strategy for delivering and operating APIs, as well as consuming 3rd party APIs, but I also recognize that most teams are moving forward so fast that we need the help of API service providers to help us make sense of the chaos in real-time. Helping us discover the APIs that are already in use, and were developed or integrated with as part of some tactical decision, then do the heavy lifting for us to connect rogue APIs into a more holistic strategy that helps us pay better attention to the privacy, security, licensing, and other issues that plague our operations. The enterprise monolith will keep rolling forward even as microservice and other efforts work to decouple and transform the beast. While much of this will happen behind the firewalls of enterprise organizations it will always leak out via Git repositories, mobile applications, and public or partner APIs, and we are all going to need as much help as we can in making sense of what is going on. I&rsquo;ll keep sharing stories about what TeejLab is up to as I continue to meet with them and map out various industries being impacted by APIs, and sizing them up alongside other API service providers I am seeing define into the API discovery space. The world of APIs is too big for me to wrap my head around anymore, and I am depending on a cadre of API service providers to help me map out and make sense of what is going on. Hopefully some of these stories can also help you understand some of the best ways to tame the API chaos that has unfolded in your world, and if these stories don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d love to learn more about what you are facing, and see how I can help steer more API service providers or open source tooling makers to help make your world a little easier.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_covid_19_resource_center.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I was needing a simple way to move forward a variety of API conversations I am having, ranging from COVID-19 APIs to API service providers who are using OpenAPI. I need a quick way to be able to flesh out a list of APIs, tooling, and specification that can be leveraged by developers when it comes to tackling a specific problem within an industry, issue, or conversation. This is an evolution in <a href="https://covid-19-apis.postman.com/">our strategy for shining a spotlight on the COVID-19</a>, helping me better figure out how we can keep adding value to the COVID-19 discussion, but also quickly do the same in other areas. For the COVID-19 effort we threw up a landing page and GitHub repository back in March, and since then we&rsquo;ve seen some pretty interesting submissions and conversation come out of the community.</p>
<h3><strong>Improving Upon the COVID-19 API Resource Center</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="p1">The COVID-19 API Resource Center is a listing of Postman API collection we&rsquo;ve developed, curated, and accepted from the community.&nbsp; We seed the resource center with 15 collections, and received 36 collections from the community, with 25 submission awaiting for a Postman collection to be developed so the API can be added to the list. For a total of 51 collections available on the COVID-19 resource center, providing a range of resources from data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to drugs and testing information. We successfully used GitHub to accept community submissions via issues, and evolve a pretty robust list of resources, but some of the APIs and resulting collections were of higher quality than others, and I wanted to understand why. To help me understand I went through all of them identifying the areas the could use more investment when it comes to helping individual collections, as well as the overall toolbox of collections, better serve the mission to help us in the COVID-19 fight.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative</strong> - Collections that do not have a descriptive title, or robust and helpful enough description increase friction for developers, and curators like me when it comes to understanding the value each API delivers.</li>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> - APIs that have their own domain tend to have more investment, providing a more solid foundation to work from. APIs that simply rely on a subdomain from where the API is hosted tend to be less mature.</li>
<li><strong>Ratings</strong> - It is critical to have a rating system established for each API published as part of a toolbox, allowing the best collections to be featured, and the less mature API collections to be moved down in priority in listing.</li>
<li><strong>Provenance</strong> - Understanding where the data behind each API comes from is a critical piece of the puzzle when it comes to defining, filtering, and knowing which APIs you should be working with, ensuring there is always a trail.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong> - One of the characteristics that really stood out of this work is the role that visualizations play in making sense of what is happening, and Postman visualizer proves to be a critical feature in all of this.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - Having each API tagged to identify the types resources it possesses is critical for understanding what resources are available across different collections, and being able to map out what is also missing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">When it comes to APIs, more isn&rsquo;t always better. I am excited that we have over 50 APIs published as part of the Postman COVID-19 Resource Center, but in the end how many different APIs do we need that tells us cases, deaths, and recovered, when we are in such desperate need for more data on testing location, and other vital areas of the world we live in now.&nbsp;Having the ability to rate and prioritize collections to make API discovery more efficient is going to be essential to all of this, and actually working to solve real world problems, otherwise we are just doing APIs for the sake of doing APIs.</p>
<h3>An API Toolbox Blueprint</h3>
<p class="p1">Once I had published <a href="https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/">v2 of the Postman COVID-19 resource center</a> I wanted to turn the approach to this GitHub hosted single page application (SPA) into a blueprint. I had a handful of projects I wanted to get out the door in some way, providing me with a diverse set of API toolboxes I could use to help me test out my blueprint, but also help me push it to see if it will work for a variety of industries, topics, and use cases. I am looking for a simple, yet versatile blueprint I can quickly replicate and use to curate different sets of API resources forward, so I began with these projects.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/">COVID-19 Resource Center (V2)</a> </strong>- The next generation Postman COVID-19 resource center, which is the model for this API toolbox blueprint.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/us-2020-elections/">U.S. 2020 Elections</a> -</strong> I am looking to test out this API blueprint using the 2020 U.S. election, and see how we can apply to helping make sense of the madness.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/postman/">Postman Developers</a> </strong>- Pulling together all of the Postman API, open source tools, and other resources into a single landing page for our developers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/newman/">Newman</a></strong> - Aggregating the wealth of open source tooling and other resources being built around the Postman Newman ecosystem.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes/api-knowledge">API Knowledge</a> </strong>- Providing a single list of the best resources for API knowledge available out there in the space, providing a single resource for folks to tune in.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_us_election_resource_center.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p2">In addition to these resource centers, <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes">I am working on healthcare, Fintech, and an authentication / authorization resource centers</a> using the same API toolbox blueprint. The goal is to use the API toolbox blueprint to help flesh out different sets of APIs, open source tooling, specifications, and other resources across a variety of topics and industries. Helping flesh out these specific areas of the API economy, while also refining and rating the collections that are submitted to describe each API, as well the open source tooling being showcased. This is all still a work in progress, but so far here is what I have when it comes to my API toolbox blueprint.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Single Page Website </strong>- A single page to view all of the resources being presented in one simple, yet robust landing page for consumers to put to use.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>YAML Data Source -</strong> The content available on the single landing page is delivered using a single YAML file, providing one place to make changes.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Simple HTML Template </strong>- I used the excellent COVID-19 page built by my team, but retrofitted it for Jekyll so it would natively run 100% on GitHub.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Featured Collections </strong>- All of the APIs which possess collections and have a rating above 6, featuring the best APIs across each area of research.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Additional Collections -</strong> Showcasing all fo the available API collection no matter the quality, highlighting everything that is possible within each area.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Visualizations Feature </strong>- Be able to highlight and feature the collections which have requests possessing visualizer outputs, to help make sense of data.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Resource Tag Cloud -</strong> Aggregate all of the tags applied to each individual API resource, rolling up and displaying all of the resources available via a toolbox.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Partner Feature -</strong> Allow for the featuring of partners who are helping contribute work, APIs, and data to each of the projects, helping showcase the community.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Call to Action -</strong> Asking the community for suggestions of APIs, datasets, tooling, and other resources that would help each area being targeted with a toolbox.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>GitHub Repository - </strong>Each project is hosted in a single GitHub repository within the Postman API toolbox organization, providing a shared organization across stakeholders.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>GitHub Issues -</strong> Leveraging the GitHub issues for each project to help gather suggestions from the community, and provide a feedback loop around each of the projects.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Stories</strong> - I have included a simple blog for each toolbox, allowing for the narrative around each API, open source tool, and resource to shared, helping tell the story behind all of the work.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Open Source Tooling</strong> - I added the ability to list open source tooling as well as APIs on each page, providing additional tooling support for specific areas of work.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Open Specifications </strong>- I added the ability to list out the API specifications that are supported as part of an effort, helping showcase the standards that exist behind the scenes.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Resources</strong> - I added the ability to just list different types of resources, grouping links, books, social, and other resources into a single set of resources that can be published to the page.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Rating</strong> - There is the ability to rank APIs, open source tools, and other resources using a basic rating score, as well as took first step towards using multiple ratings with a CASC score from API Metrics.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Provenance</strong> - I am adding name and links as provenance to individual APIs, helping showcase those that are using common sources of data to power their APIs, helping provide more value when it comes to searching.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I do not use all of these elements in all of the toolboxes. Depending on the scope of the project I will layer in different building blocks. However, all of these projects are about identifying APIs, open source tools, specifications, and resources that will all contribute to a specific objective that is meaningful in a specific industry or layer of our society. Then being able to refine, polish, rank, and evolve each of the individual resources being made available, as well as the overall toolbox of resources. Helping make sure it isn&rsquo;t just a listing of APIs and open source tools, and it is a listing of high quality APIs, collections, and maintained open source solutions that add value to the conversation.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a lot of work ahead to keep fleshing out this API toolbox blueprint, but I am pretty happy with this first iteration. I&rsquo;ve been building blueprints like this for the last five years, and this is the most refined one I&rsquo;ve created so far. It still has some complexities I&rsquo;d like to smooth out, but that will come with the implementation of more toolboxes. I am pretty confident that the blueprint I&rsquo;ve created can be quickly applied to a variety of business verticals and topics, but where I am really keen on pushing forward is not just expanding to other areas, but getting more precise in how I rate and influence the API conversation within each of these areas. I&rsquo;m looking to turn each of these pages into a wider conversation about what is possible with APIs, and leveraging Postman + GitHub to establish a sort of API factory floor for moving forward APIs across many different industries.</p>

<p class="p1">I am getting more hands-on with my API governance guidance while working at Postman. It is one of the reasons I joined the company, so I could move more into the execution of my API lifecycle strategies, which also includes applying API governance. To showcase some of what I have been developing <a href="https://www.postman.com/webinars/api-governance/">I am doing an API governance webinar this Wednesday</a>. To help me polish the narrative around my talk, as well as my wider API governance guidance, I wanted to work through my current narrative here on the blog. What I am enjoying most about my narrative right now is that they are rooted in doing what I am talking about, allow me to get more hands-on with API governance, where for much of the last five years my stories have just been narratives without much meat on the bone. I am enjoying this shift from a more academic perspective to actually being able to deliver what I am talking about when I say API governance.</p>
<h3>An Intro API Governance</h3>
<p class="p1">Most people will go straight to API design governance when they begin talking about governance, but I prefer starting with the base of API governance that is already in motion across many API operations. Born out of an API-first approach to delivering infrastructure many teams are already delivering on governance, they just call it other names like versioning and contract testing. This is definitely the road to API governance, but it is lacking an overarching API governance strategy to effectively deliver across many different APIs developed by many different teams. To help paint the tactical API governance that is already occurring let&rsquo;s zoom in on a single API being developed using an API-first approach, and consider how it is laying the foundation for a wider and more strategic approach to governance how APIs are delivered.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Workspace</strong> - Having a dedicated repository and / or workspace for an API provides the base for delivering APIs consistently.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - The OpenAPI specification provides a common vocabulary for defining, communicating, and governing APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Versioning</strong> - Having a strategy for managing change across individual APIs is essential to governing API operations.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Mocking</strong> - Being able to articulate the next iteration of each API in a functional ways helps drive governance of APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Documentation</strong> - You have to be able to effectively communicate to other human beings what an API does before you can govern.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Code Generation</strong> - Code generation helps deliver consistent behavior in the applications and integrations build on each API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Contract Testing</strong> - Testing your API definitions ensures that you are consistently delivering against each promised API contract.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is a snapshot of governance practices already in place across enterprise API teams today. It doesn&rsquo;t speak to the design of an API, but it does provide the basis for not just being able to govern the design of an API, but how it is developed, communicated, tested, and made available for use in client applications and integrations. You can&rsquo;t govern the design of an API without a machine readable contract like OpenAPI that is versioned over time. Then it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are governing your API, if you aren&rsquo;t providing documentation and consistent client tooling, and making sure to test the contracts of each API you deliver. All of this is the foundation for API governance, the design API is just the aspect of API consumption that introduces the most friction when it comes to API operations.</p>
<h3>What is API Design Governance?</h3>
<p class="p1">The design of the surface area of an API is what comes to mind for most people when you talk about API governance. Inconsistent API design patterns across a single organization&rsquo;s APIs is one of the most common types of friction introduced into the software development lifecycle. When APIs share common patterns it becomes easier for developers to understand how to put them to work. The entire reason the current pattern of REST APIs has become the dominant pattern in use is because it is simple, consistent, and relies on the HTTP standard. API design governance is very focused on producing the best quality API as possible by refining some of the most common ways in which APIs are leveraged, governing the surface area for the request and the response of each API method.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Paths</strong> - Ensuring the URL Path is intuitive, simple, and well thought out as part of an organization wide strategy for delivering digital resources.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Methods</strong> - Leveraging GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other common HTTP methods when working with digital resources being made available via an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Parameters</strong> - Having a strategy for how parameters are leveraged, crafted, and used across all APIs, helping ensure consistent path and query parameters.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Request Body </strong>- Being thoughtful in how and when the request body is used as part of API requests, using the body as the payload, complimenting parameters, headers and HTTP methods.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Response Body </strong>- Providing a standardized way of returning JSON, XML, or other data returned as part of each response, keeping responses consistent across all APIs, standardizing what developers can expect.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Status Codes </strong>- Always using appropriate HTTP status codes, effectively communicating with client integrations, providing information, success, redirect, and client or server problems encountered with each request.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are many other areas that can be included in API design governance, but these are the areas that are top of mind for most API providers and consumers. API design governance is all about standardizing how APIs are delivered, helping reduce friction and overhead when it comes to documenting, mocking, testing, securing, and integrating with APIs. Reducing the number of surprises a developer might face when putting an API to work, employing patterns developers are already familiar with, and do not require additional cognitive load to begin putting to use. As outlined above, you can&rsquo;t measure what you can't find and make sense of, in a machine and human readable way. Meaning, if you don&rsquo;t have a versioned OpenAPI in a known workspace, you won&rsquo;t be able to realize API governance, let along the design slice of the API governance pie.</p>
<h3>Measuring API Governance</h3>
<p class="p1">OpenAPI, and an API-driven lifecycle is critical to being able to govern APIs at scale across an organization. You can&rsquo;t govern something you don&rsquo;t have defined. You can&rsquo;t govern something you can&rsquo;t programmatically ask a question of. OpenAPI has emerged as the central specification format used by API providers to define the surface are of their HTTP APIs, providing the foundation for how we define, measure, and report upon how we are doing when it comes to the design of each API being delivered on the enterprise factory floor. Similar to each instance of an API, an OpenAPI provides us with a machine readable format that we can test to ensure that we are following prescribed design practices for each of the APIs we are developing. Providing a machine readable contract for not just the resources we are making available via each API, but for the API design itself.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - The OpenAPI specification is the machine readable contract you will need to define, measure, and ultimately govern how APIs are designed.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Requests</strong> - Each API governance rule can be defined as a single API request, pulling the OpenAPI contract for an API, providing the basics for governance.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Test Scripts -</strong> Test scripts can be developed to evaluate the details of each API contract, evaluating whether or not it meets API governance standards.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Test Results </strong>- Results can be accumulated from across many individual API governance requests made of the OpenAPI contract, reporting across each API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Environments</strong> - Environments are used to provide secrets and other variables needed to measure API governance, and used as a store for the results.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Collections</strong> - Each suite of API governance requests are defined and stored as a collection, providing a single executable unit of API governance for use across API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">API governance using Postman provides you with a machine readable way to ask and answer your API governance questions. As with each other stop along the API lifecycle you can use OpenAPI as the contract for each API, while using a collection in combination with an environment to realize governance across API operations. The OpenAPI is the contract for defining and validating each individual API instance, but it is also what keeps each individual API in alignment with other APIs, providing a common vocabulary for speaking about governance of resources being made available via APIs. Providing a self-contained, machine readable representation of how an API should be designed and behave, which can be manually run by developers to see if the API they are working is compliant with wider API governance, or scheduled and automated to run as part of regular processes.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/citizenship-turing-front-view.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>API Governance Automation</h3>
<p class="p1">With API governance defined as a self-contained executable collection opens up the possibility for automation and orchestration of API governance across operations. Like the testing of individual API instance, API governance should be scheduled, automated, and build into our API delivery pipelines. This is why using the same services, tooling, and definitions used to test each API implement makes sense for defining, measuring, and reporting upon API governance. Postman collections plus environments provides the fuel for this API governance automation, but then runners, monitors, and Newman helps actually automate the governance of API infrastructure. Helping ensure that API governance can be scaled in a consistent manner across organizations, lead from a centralized organization, but then applied, refined, and reported upon from within each individual API workspace and team.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Collections</strong> - API governance collection provide a machine readable set of requests that can be made of each API contract, that can be executed as a single unit of governance.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Environments</strong> - A Postman environment is used to define governance, but then also aggregate and store results so that they can be reported upon by individual developers or as part of wider governance.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Runners</strong> - Postman runners allow individual developers to run a governance collection locally on their desktops or via the Postman web interface, helping understand if an API is compliant with wider governance rules.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Monitors</strong> - Postman monitors allow for the scheduling of API governance collections and running them in different cloud regions, helping regularly test to see if an API is compliant with wider governance practices.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Pipelines</strong> - Lastly, collections can be executed within CI/CD pipelines using the open source Newman runner, executing API governance at the pipeline level, ensuring no APIs move into production that haven&rsquo;t met API governance.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Infrastructure APIs -</strong> The APIs for the infrastructure used to deploy and manage APIs can be further used to automate and report on API governance, providing additional artifacts that can be stored, measured, and reported upon.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">While API governance automation isn&rsquo;t necessary early on in the API governance journey, it is essential further down the road. API governance can be seen as a hinderance by developers if not fully fleshed out and providing sufficient details about why an API hasn&rsquo;t met governance rules. So be cautious in automating it early on until API developers are fully educated regarding how to implement it, and processes for applying and reported operate smoothly. However, once a robust set of rules have been defined, and teams are successfully applying manually within their Postman clients, API governance collections should be regularly scheduled using monitors, and put into every CI/CD pipeline used to deliver the code behind APIs, or driving API gateway deployment and management. API governance testing should just be another layer of testing that is realized as part of the automated software delivery lifecycles already in place across the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reporting on API Governance</h3>
<p class="p1">After collections are run, the results will need to be reported upon, helping everyone involved understand the state of API design for each API, across teams, and an organization. Along with the collection and environment capabilities, Postman provides the ability to store the results of API governance, and report on them using Postman visualizer. Providing a self contained way of defining, executing, and reporting on API governance in a consistent way across many different APIs.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Environments</strong> - Postman environments are used to define and store API governance, providing a key/value store that can be used along side development, staging, and production environments, but providing an added dimension that covers governance needs.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Visualizer</strong> - The Postman visualizer can be used to deliver reports across all of the API governance requests being made, providing a visual way to understand how well governance is being applied, and realized across operations by each team.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Postman provides the base of what you need to report on API governance. Leaning on the Postman visualizer to render results stored in environments for viewing by individual developers, and team members involved in API governance activities. API governance can be baked into the self contained and executable API governance collections, pulling the data needed for reporting, and leverage CSS and JavaScript to render governance results in a visual way that helps make sense of what is happening across API operations.</p>
<h3>Expanding on API Governance</h3>
<p class="p1">A dedicated workspace, OpenAPI, and some design governance should just be the beginning for most teams. If each stop along the API lifecycle is API-driven then there are always artifacts available which can be used to define, measure, and report upon each area of API operations. Enterprise organizations should focus on ensuring there are robust OpenAPIs available for all APIs, that are easily discoverable, and find their footing when it comes to defining, educating, applying, and reporting on healthy API design practices. Once teams have found their way when it comes to API design governance across APIs, then they can begin looking at the other aspects of API operations that should be governed, moving the focus of API governance to the following areas.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Workspaces</strong> - Whether your API workspaces are a GitHub repository, and Postman team workspace, or some other platform, it should have an API. Allowing for the configuration and orchestration of APIs within their workspaces.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Mocking</strong> - Measuring whether teams are mocking their APIs as part of an API-first design process, on-boarding new developers, or as part of API testing, and working to govern how APIs and data are virtualized.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Documentation</strong> - Robust, complete, and always up to date API documentation should always be present for APIs, and API governance should be measuring and monitoring the quality of documentation published for each API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Testing</strong> - 100% of the surface area of an API should be tested, ensuring that int is always in alignment with its OpenAPI contract. API governance should be measuring and monitoring the state of API testing across all APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Monitoring</strong> - The orchestration of the API lifecycle, and the deployment and configuration of monitors executing a variety of tasks across API operations should be defined, measured, and reported on as part of a wider strategy.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Pipelines</strong> - API governance should live within the pipeline, and be measured and reported on, helping make sure there is 100% governance being applied by default across all APIs, baking governance into the deployment of all API infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Adopting OpenAPI across API operations is the beginning of the API governance journey, and versioning and then testing your APIs represents the forward motion of API governance across your teams. API design governance becomes possible at a stage of the journey where OpenAPI contracts are present, up to date, and regularly tested. Most API providers are currently doing many of the moving parts of API governance, they just aren&rsquo;t doing it as part of a wider API governance strategy, and in a machine readable way that can be tested, automated, scaled, and orchestrated as part of a distributed API governance effort.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the first time I had an actual way to deliver governance at not just the design layer of each API, but also across every other stop along the API lifecycle. Using Postman, I am able to actually define how I am going govern the design of each of my APIs, using the tooling I am already using to test each of my API instances. The best part is the rules are up to me. I can use the JSON schema present in each OpenAPI or I can write custom JavaScript to interrogate the OpenAPI for each API, asking exactly the questions I want. Asking as many questions as I want about the design of each API, but also the other aspects of delivering and operating each API. Laying a pretty solid foundation for how I govern each API, allowing me to scale that across many different APIs across many different workspaces. Helping me define and apply governance across teams, allowing team members to manually apply governance to an API, but also automate it as part of their regular workflows, and using the tooling they are already putting to work each day.</p>

<hr />

<p class="p1">I am giving a presentation to my friend Ken Bauer Favel's (<a href="https://twitter.com/ken_bauer">@ ken_bauer</a>) class of computer science sutdents at Tecnol&oacute;gico de Monterrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/TecDeMonterrey">@TecDeMonterrey</a>) tomorrow, and I wanted to prepare an overview of what I am going to be talking about, and share some links for the students to follow. I am doing more workshops with students recently as part of Postman student outreach, and Ken&rsquo;s class is exactly the target audience we are interested in reaching. These are young minds who are just getting started in their careers and they should be aware of APIs, how to put them to work, but more importantly making sure they are fully tested and reliable for consumers, and the applications that are built on them.</p>
<p class="p1">Ken&rsquo;s class is all about software quality and testing, so I figured I would take a look at how APIs can be defined, versioned, managed, and tested. I&rsquo;ll be showing them the process using <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, which is a ubiquitous tool for developers within the enterprise but the concepts I'll demonstrate are universal an something the students can apply using different tooling, using any HTTP API. Here are the building blocks of what I&rsquo;ll be walking them through, with some links to help them get primed if they have the time.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><a href="http://101.apievangelist.com/"><span class="s1"><strong>API 101</strong></span></a><strong> - </strong>A quick refresh about what APIs are, and acknowledging they are behind every technological shift of the last 20 years.</li>
<li class="li1"><a href="https://history.apievangelist.com/"><span class="s1"><strong>History of APIs</strong></span></a> - A quick look at how we got here, and the role that APIs play in modern software development.</li>
<li class="li1"><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/"><span class="s1"><strong>Introduction to Postman</strong></span></a> - Learning about how Postman can be used to make calls to web APIs without writing code.</li>
<li class="li1"><a href="https://www.openapis.org/"><span class="s1"><strong>OpenAPI</strong></span></a><span class="s1"> (formerly known as Swagger)</span> - Looking at how OpenAPI can be used as the contract for each API, providing a machine readable definition for each API.</li>
<li class="li1"><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/"><span class="s1"><strong>API Authorization</strong></span></a> - Taking a moment to understand how APIs employ authentication, and how Postman can help you apply common forms of authentication.</li>
<li class="li1"><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/"><span class="s1"><strong>Postman Collections</strong></span></a> - Understanding how to save API requests as collections, so that they can be used for many different purposes in the future, while developing, testing, and consuming APIs.</li>
<li class="li1"><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/"><span class="s1"><strong>Scripting in Postman</strong></span></a> - Taking collections to the next level by adding pre-request or test scripts that can be used to test the contract of each API being developed.</li>

</ul>
<p class="p1">I will leave the rest of the conversation open ended, letting students ask questions, then dive deeper into each of these areas, or go in other directions that might help them build better software using APIs. If they want to follow along,<a href="https://www.postman.com"> the students should have Postman downloaded</a>, so that they can play with the platform as I am working my way through examples. If they are feeling adventurous ahead of time, they can use this collection:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><a href="https://explore.postman.com/templates/198/intro-to-writing-tests---with-examples"><span class="s1"><strong>Intro to Writing Tests</strong></span></a> - This is a ready to go Postman collection that will show many of the most common API testing patterns we see at Postman.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There won&rsquo;t be any &ldquo;tests&rdquo; for my workshop, but it is always more engaging when students have downloaded Postman and are already familiar with the platform and tooling. However, that isn&rsquo;t required, and students should be able to learn plenty just by following along during our discussion, but make sure and ask questions that will help make my workshop a little more relevant in their world, and applicable to their projects.</p>
<p class="p1">I thoroughly enjoy doing these types of workshops because I get such great questions from students. Their view of the world always helps me better understand APIs and also helps make me a better storyteller and teacher. If you are a professor or high school teacher I am happy to schedule time for similar workshops within your class. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be on API testing. I am happy to get as technical or non-technical as needed in my presentations and discussions. If feel pretty strongly that all students should be exposed to APIs, even if they aren&rsquo;t going to be software developers. APIs are literally behind everything we do online, and it is important to understand at least how they work, and what they can do.</p>
<p class="p2">Thanks for having me Ken, and I look forward to talking with your class tomorrow.</p>

<p>title: ‘Location-Aware Local Commerce Open Source API Standard From Beckn’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_08_11_at_9.51.17_pm.png</p>

<hr />

<p class="p3">I am working on profiling open specifications as part my work at Postman to help highlight how we can deploy APIs that use a common API and schema, reduce friction when on-boarding, while also increasing reusability across different industries. One of the open specifications on the table is from <a href="https://beckn.org/">Beckn</a>, who offers a suite of open source API specifications for things like food delivery, healthcare, and transportation--here is the description from the Beckn website describing the value they deliver.</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Beckn is an open protocol that enables location-aware, local commerce across industries to be discovered and engaged by any beckn-enabled application. Beckn, while being a minimal open source protocol specification, acts as a force multiplier for end-beneficiaries - customers, application developers, governments, and businesses by creating an interoperable open playground to unlock value and innovation</em></p>
<p class="p3">I love to see these kinds of projects. My concern is always heldping ensure they get enough adoption to help sustain them, and contribute by helping evangelize the possibilities, which is why I am writing this post as I am working with the Beckn team to get the word out about their standard. To help push forward the conversation forward around the <a href="https://developers.beckn.org/">Beckn APIs</a> I need Postman collections for the platform, or even better&hellip;OpenAPI definitions so that I can generate Postman collection&mdash;luckily Beckn is <a href="https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications">developing their API protocol out in the open on GitHub using OpenAPI</a>, making my job easy.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3">To help me move things forward I created a workspace in Postman dedicated to Beckn, then I took five of their OpenAPI definitions and published to the workspace, allowing me to use Postman to manage the collections and resulting docs, mocks, and eventually tests for the APIs.</p>
<p class="p3"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_builder.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">Right now I am just interested in helping the Beckn team better understand how they can manage their OpenAPI definitions using Postman, then <a href="https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications">sync the definition for each API bck to the GitHub repo they have setup</a>. Then they can generate collections from the OpenAPI contract for each API. Right now I am just looking to publish documentation for each API, so I am going to generate a collection to use as the base for docs.</p>
<p class="p3"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_generate.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">I repeat this process for each of the five API, producing five separate collections, which I can then publish documentation using Postman, resulting in a robust set of docs that can be used by Beckn, or by API providers and consumers. Going a little further than the current API documentation does, showcasing what is possible with the platform.</p>
<p class="p3"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_08_11_at_9.51.17_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p2">While there are a many more benefits of managing your APIs using the Postman platform, here are a few of the benefits that are exclusive just to API documentation:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Consistent Layout </strong>- Postman documentation provides a consistent single or double pane layout.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Examples</strong> - Each API method can now have one or more examples, which show in docs, but also mocks.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Code Snippets </strong>- Each API method now as client snippets a variety of programming languages.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Environments</strong> - Provide environments for each API, abstracting away variables for auth and other purposes.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Run in Postman Button</strong> - Each API now has a button for developers to instantly begin using in their Postman.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Network</strong> - Each collection can also be published into the Postman network making it available for discovery.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">I am publishing this post to help convince the Beckn team to import their OpenAPIs under their Postman team, generate their own collections, then publish each API to the <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Postman Network</a>. I leave it to Beckn to decide if they use Postman documentation as part of their developer portal, but it will help developers on-board with the API protocol quicker if it is available as a collection that can be shared and imported by any developer. Plus, if the collection are available in the Postman Network, the protocol is discoverable by 12 million developers via the Postman platform.</p>
<h3>Personal Beckn API Sandboxes with Postman Mocks</h3>
<p class="p3">Having Postman collection in the Postman network for the Beckn protocol will help it become more discoverable. Having Postman generated documentation will add more value with examples, code snippets, and environments. Having a run in Postman button available for each API all help reduce friction for developers when learning about the spec. However, if each collection possesses examples for each method, they can also be mocked using Postman, as easily as publishing documentation was, by clicking on the menu for each collection, and choosing to publish as mock servers.</p>
<p class="p3"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_mock.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">Postman will take the collection and generate a static mock server for each method, using each request body example, and response body example as part of the mocked experience. Leaving you with a URL you can then use to actually make calls to the API.</p>
<p class="p3"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_mock_url.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">I can take this URL and add it to an environment, abstracting away the baseURL so we can generate multiple mock servers, or eventually replace with development, staging, and production environments&mdash;helping make the Beckn collections more versatile using Postman environments.</p>
<p class="p3"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_environment.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">Beckn can also publish the environment along with documentation, removing any mock URL, and allowing API providers and consumers to replace with their own. This essentially turns each Beckn API collection into a portal sandbox, making learning about the protocol a hands on experience for developers. Allowing API providers and consumers to be able to play with responses and learn how everything works. A mocked representation of the Beckn APIs that can actually be used to begin mocking and developing applications as part of a hackathon, prototyping, or actually kicking off the development process.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_call.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<h3>More Work to Be Done</h3>
<p class="p3">This is just the beginning. There is a lot more we can do, but this will help augment the existing Beckn OpenAPI definitions with Postman collections that can be imported into Postman with one click, and then mocked and making requests to the mock server with a couple more clicks. The collections will be available in the Postman network for developers to discover and put to work. This post is meant to be the catalyst for some more work that would help make Beckn more discoverable and usable as part of the Postman platform.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Beckn Team</strong> - Publish a Beckn Postman team with logo and description.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Beckn Workspace </strong>- Encourage Beckn to establish a workspace for this effort.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Import OpenAPI -</strong> Publish the Beckn OpenAPIs to the Beckn Postman workspace.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Sync to GitHub -</strong> Sync all the OpenAPIs back to GitHub allowing changes to be made in both places.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Beckn Collections </strong>- Publish documentation collections from the OpenAPIs.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Publish to Network</strong> - Make sure each of the APIs are published to the Postman Network.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Polish Examples</strong> - Make sure all collections have a robust set of examples.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Walk-Through </strong>- Produce concise walk through for developers to use collections and generate mocks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">This will lay a pretty good foundation for some storytelling and demonstrating what the possibilities are when it comes to using the Beckn API. Then we can start brainstorming about what else is possible when you start building specific workflow collection that demonstrate the business value of the Beckn API. It will make it easier for developers to on-board and work with the API protocol, and understand what it does. Something we can replicate for any new APIs Beckn launches, and use the OpenAPIs on GitHub, and Postman collections available via the Postman Network to expand the conversation around what is possible with Beckn.</p>
<p class="p3">I am going to work with the Beckn team to move things forward a bit more in coming weeks. Postman is really into helping open API specifications like Beckn generate more attention about what they are doing, while also showcasing what is possible with Postman. Open API standards like Beckn are critical to all of this API stuff actually working at scale. We have to stop delivering a bunch of special snowflake APIs and move towards more standardized implementations using open protocols like Beckn. If you&rsquo;d like to kick the tires on the Beckn API while we are doing this work, you can play with the collections and documentation I&rsquo;ve published, for five of the Beckn APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/T1LLG98M?version=latest">Beckn Authentication API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/T1LLG98N?version=latest">Beckn Core API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/T1LLG98Q?version=latest">Beckn Final Mile Delivery API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/T1LLG98P?version=latest">Beckn Mobility API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/T1LLG98R?version=latest">Beckn Registry API</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">If you have any questions about the specification feel free to ping me, or go ahead and connect with the Beckn team. I am sure they&rsquo;d love to talk to you about how you might use the protocol. Also, if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about this approach to using OpenaAPI via Postman, syncing them to GitHub, and publishing collections to the network that can be easily mocked, feel free to ping me. It is one of the reasons I am publishing this to the blog, so that others can learn from the process and implement it for their own APIs. I am looking to get all of the open API specifications and protocols out there to use this approach to making their APIs more discoverable, accessible, and usable. While leveraging the Postman network to get the word out about the good work they are doing, and help expand the adoption of standardized API specifications across many different types of applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10394726/T1DwbZC8?version=latest"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_08_03_at_5.16.56_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been moving forward a number of new types of Postman API collections as part of <a href="http://union.fashion/">my Union Fashion reference implementation at Postman</a>, and one of the new types I'm using as part of different conversations are my API governance collections. I have two collections I am moving forward as a proof of concept (POC), helping map out how collections can be used to not just provide and consume APIs, but also help make sure they are more consistent in how they operate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10394726/T1DwbZC8?version=latest">Governance (Design)</a></strong> - This is just the governance of the design of the API, and since this is what most folks think of when they talk about API governance, it is the place most people should start this conversation.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10394726/SzYUagbA?version=latest">Governance (Lifecycle)</a></strong> - This is for the governance of the entire API lifecycle from start to finish, really helping me push the boundaries of what a collection is for, but also how we provide guardrails for our APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API design governance collection is interesting for me, but pushing myself to think about what API governance looks like for the entire lifecycle has helped me see things differently, and has allowed me to realize that you can't govern what you don't have defined, and aren't measuring.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Some Initial Thoughts</h3>
<p>This is all still a work in progress, so I am still working to make more self-service, and something anyone can put to use as part of their operations. Here is my brain dump of thinking going into this work, which will hopefully articulate a little more about where I am at with the work and how you can help provide feedback and thoughts on where I should go next.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why Collections? -</strong> I am skeptical that any software should bake in "governance" features into their product as governance means different things to different folks, and while we can come up with a standard set of rules that will fit most enterprise organizations, I feel that the path to success will ultimately defined by providers as the remix with existing governance rules, and augment with their own.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI as Source of Truth</strong> - These governance collections are focused on pulling the OpenAPI from the API builder in a particular workspace using the Postman API. We aren't going to test the API, but the contract for the API to see if it meets common API design requirements defined by this collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Test Results -</strong> These scripts use the exact same testing infrastructure as our customers use to test their APIs, but instead of pulling the response for an API, we are using the OpenAPI definition stored in API Builder. The OpenAPI is considered the central contract for each API, and can be used to accomplish a variety of design governance tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Governance Environment </strong>- This concepts rests on a new type of environment, and going beyond just developing, staging, or production environments and acknolwedging that we will need authentication tokens as part of API governance, and we'll also need somewhere to store the governance test results, allowing environments to be used as part of making sense how APIs are moving forward, or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are still some serious rough edges on this approach, but I feel pretty confident that they can be smoothed out over with some work on the Postman API. Cognitively I find it is a tough shift for most to see collections used in this way, but with some work on the documentation for this collection I think we can quickly get developers over the hump, and the fact that it uses some of the same Postman features they are using for regular testing APIs will ultimately help make this relatable. Additionally, I also feel like the potential of definining governance as some standardized collections that anyone can download and reverse engineer, then be able to augment, extend, and remix as they desire will help it make governance more successful for different teams.</p>
<h3>Governance Collection Configuration</h3>
<p>Most of the requests in the collection are just calling the Postman API, pulling the OpenAPI for APIs being targeted with this governance. Because of the robustness of the API for our APIs, it takes four API calls to get the latest OpenAPI, requiring the id for the API, version, and individual schema. It is something that is pretty easy to fix with a new API endpoint pulling the latest version and schema for an API by name, but until then there are two separate options for getting the ids you need to actually pull the OpenAPI and evaluate as part of design governance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1 -</strong> This is a manual series of API calls you make to pull the individual API to be governed, then the version, and schema. Each individual request has it's own instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2 - </strong>This is a single API call with a test script to make all of the API calls necessary, abstracting away the complextiy. You just have to provide the name of your workspace, API, and the version of the schem that you want to work with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally you'd just have to set the name of the API being targeted for governance in the environment, and each of the individual governance requests would be able to resolve the OpenAPI schema it needs. While this concept can be tough for folks just getting started with the concept of a governance API, it is minor in my mind, and something that will easily be dealt with in the near future with a new Postman API endpoint.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Base Set of Governance Rules</h3>
<p>I have a master list of a couple hundred rules I'd like to see as part of governance, but I wanted to start with just a handful of governance questions that API providers will want to ask of their API designs, and are easy to answer using an OpenAPI definition. Here is the outline of questions I want to ask of Union Fashion APIs when it comes to design, each reflected as a single request.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10394726/T1DwbZC8?version=latest#935a86a8-5902-4e07-aabc-250920b08bca"><strong>Info<br /><br /></strong></a>

<p>Most of these are simply looking for the presence of something in the OpenAPI definition. I am purposefully not using JSON Schema validation as I am trying to push these script beyond what JSON Schema is good for. The test scripts for each inidividual is pretty hacky and would benefit from the development of modules to abstract away the complexity, but it gets the job done as is. I'd like to clean up before I expand to too many individual governance collection requests, and consider the role a rules engine like <a href="https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral">Spectral</a> would play. I'm a big fan of Spectral, but I am purposely considering a hackier approach with scripts to help stick with what developers know--JavaScript. I have just begun moving these governance request beyond just basic OpenAPI lookups, something you can with the "Are path using words?", which uses a dictionary to validate the design of API paths, something that can't be done with JSON Schema or a rules engine--each type of questions I ask helps me learn a little bit more.</p>
<h3>The Benefits of API Governance Collections</h3>
<p>After thinking long and hard about API governance, and thinking about how organizations and their teams of developers get things done within the enterprise, I settled in on using collection in this way. I am still defining the benefits of this approach, which is why I am writing this post, but here is what I have so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modular Requests</strong> - Each question you want to ask is defined as a single request. Right now most of these API requests are just pulling the OpenAPI using the Postman API, but in the future it can query any API infrastructure looking for answers to the question.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Based -</strong> While there is a lot of development to be done on cleaning up the scripts, the fact that questions are asked in JavaScript will go a long way when it comes to on-boarding developers with this concept, over teaching them a new language or vocabulary.</li>
<li><strong>Networked</strong> - Individual requests and collections of requests can be published to the private or public network, allowing other developers to discovery, download, reverse engineer, and ultimately remix using API governance rules. Making for a pretty rich world of defining and sharing patterns that help organizations deliver more consistent APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Common Rules </strong>- Default sets of common questions that need asked as part of the API design process can be bundled and made available for API providers who are just beginning their journey, and there is plenty of room for more advanced sets of rules, as well as custom rules to be developed.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong> - Postman collections can be run as manually using Runners within the web or desktop versions of Postman, and the scheduled to run from multiple regions using monitors, or directly from the pipeline using the open source Newman runner, allowing governance to be defined as collections and then execute wherever they are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source -</strong> Postman Collections and Newman are both open source, so API providers can define, apply, and evolve their rules without the friction of any specific vendor. Allowing API governance rules to be developed in or outside of Postman, and executed as part of any pipeline, tooling, or service provider that supports collections.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/square/C32Eg8bUEAEa_gj_square.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>While I believe the scripting portion of this approach is going to quickly become pretty unwieldy, and will need much more standardization, a possible YAML or JSON rules engine, and other housekeeping support--it shows one possible future for governance. One where API developers can test the design and implementation of their APIs using the same tooling and scripting language. I don't think we can develop a one-size fits all approach to API governance, and I think there will be a solid core of common patterns we can define and apply, but I think there will be a pretty significant long tail to what is actually needed by enterprise organizations in the trenches, and they will need full control over being able to deliver API governance on their own terms.</p>
<p>I have a lot of work ahead of me to polish these collections, as well how I talk about these collections. In addition to the API design collection, I am looking to define API governance for other stops along the API lifecycle. If you are feeling brave, feel free to take a look at the full API life collection to get a taste of what I am talking about. Ultimately I believe that all APIs should be governed from start to finish, but as I've learned from pushing API governance beyond just API design, we are going to have to move the concept of observability beyond just monitoring and testing of APIs, and we are going to have to tune into the existing outputs from the infrastructure behind our APIs as well. API governance is going to depend on artifacts, and not just OpenAPI. We will have to be able to monitor the entire factory floor we are using to operate our APIs, then leverage and extract meaningful artifacts, and work to benchmark and measure more stops along the API lifecycle. Otherwise we'll never quite be able to get a handle on what is going on within the chaos of day to day operations.</p>

<p>title: ‘Managing Your OpenAPI and Postman Collection Publicly’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_api_network_explore.png</p>

<hr />

<p>I am having this conversation with multiple API providers right now, so I wanted to write it up, share it as part of these conversations, while also making it available for my wider audience here on API Evangelist. This is a blueprint for managing the OpenAPI and Postman collection in a very public way, ensuring the machine readable definition for an API is discoverable and easy to access, while also establishing a feedback loop for the community to participate in helping define the roadmap for each API. Leveraging both Postman and GitHub to move an API forward in a much more collaborative and observable way.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Postman Workspace</h3>
<p>ssThis blueprint begins with establishing a team workspace in Postman for managing the OpenAPI, and any collections that are derived from the OpenAPI contract, as well as environments that will be used to abstract away tokens, secrets, and other key / value pairs needed for working with the API.&nbsp; The Postman workspace will become the source of truth for your APIs, which can then be used to power other stops along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/workspace_image.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>You can have a single API in a workspace, or have multiple APIs, it is up to you how you want to organize your workspaces. The goal is to just make sure there is one place you can go to find your APIs, and work with other internal stakeholders on our team to move an API forward. Leveraging the workspace, but also all the comments, history, change logs and other features, helping you get more organized about how APIs are being delivered.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Adding OpenAPI to Postman Builder</h3>
<p>With a workspace you can now add your APIs using the Postman API builder. Each API allows you to publish an OpenAPI, establishing the central truth for each of your APIs, which we can then use to generate collections for powering stops along the API lifecycle, manage change with version, the change log, and history. Just click on the API tab in Postman and add an API, selecting OpenAPI as the schema format.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/buidl_image.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>It is up to you to define the version for your API, and whether you are starting with the default OpenAPI, or copying and pasting an OpenAPI from another location. As you will see, we&rsquo;ll be syndicating this OpenAPI, but this workspace provides the central place where OpenAPI contracts live. Providing a single place to track all of the changes that are occurring around each API contract, while still making it available externally outside of Postman for public consumption, and integration into other systems and pipelines.</p>
<h3>Syncing the OpenAPI with GitHub</h3>
<p>A Postman workspace provides a private place for internal stakeholders to collaborate around the evolution of each API, but we&rsquo;ll also want to be able to make the OpenAPI available to the public externally via GitHub. Postman provides you with two-way sync, allowing you to sync your APIs to a Github repository, allowing changes made in Postman to be pushed to GitHub, and changes made to the OpenAPI in the GitHub repository, then pushed back to the workspace.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/github_image.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>This is the public face of the API. You can accept changes to the OpenAPI definitions published as pull requests via GitHub, but the OpenAPI within the Postman workspace is where the central truth for each API will live. GitHub can be used to gather feedback from the public, while also providing a machine readable artifact for each API that can be used in other systems, pipelines, and services.</p>
<h3>Using GitHub Issues as a Feedback Loop</h3>
<p>In addition to leveraging Github to accept pull requests from the community, it opens up the opportunity to use GitHub issues as the feedback loop around the OpenAPI definitions. Letting users report bugs, comments, and provide other feedback around each API, and how it can be used in their applications and system integrations.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/github_issues_image.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>GitHub issues combined with labels and milestones provides a good way to gather feedback around an OpenAPI spec, organize and discuss changes and enhancements, and build a roadmap that meets everyone&rsquo;s needs. Using GitHub to open up access to the OpenAPI so that it can be used in other systems, but also be opened up for feedback and evolution out in the open with the community.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Generating a Collection for Documentation</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve syndicated the OpenAPI to GitHub, we&rsquo;ll want to derive a Postman collection from the OpenAPI contract we have in our workspace, providing a&nbsp; generated definition that can be used to publish documentation and make the API available to consumers. To generate a collection you just need to hit the generate button in the API builder, and choose the reason you are publishing it.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/generate_image.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>Postman will provide the ability to validate collections against the OpenAPI contract as changes occur, allowing you to keep the documentation in sync with the central truth. Allowing changes to be made to each API within the Postman workspace, or via the Github repository, while also keeping it in sync with the documentation that we are going to then publish to the Postman API Network.</p>
<h3>Publishing the Collection to the Public API Network</h3>
<p>The final step of this blueprint is to make the API available via to consumers using the public Postman API network. Using the Postman collection we generated from the OpenAPI contract we can publish documentation, which provides the mechanism for publishing the documentation to the Postman public API network so that it can be discovered and used by developers within Postman.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/publish_documentation.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>With the API published to the API network, developers can discover the APIs via the network in the desktop application or on the web, but they can also quickly put to work with the Run in Postman Button, and using the generated scripts that come with the documentation. You can even publish the Run in Postman button and a link to the documentation on the README for the GitHub repository.</p>
<h3>Managing Your OpenAPI and Postman Collection Publicly</h3>
<p>All of this sets the stage for being able to manage your OpenAPI and Postman collection publicly, providing a machine readable contract that developers can use in client tools like Postman, generate SDKs, while also making things discoverable and open for feedback from the community. Leveraging Postman to manage change around each API contract, while also ensuring there is a feedback loop in place for the community to participate in the evolution of each API. Making the API roadmap a much more collaborative and public affair, giving the community a much greater stake in what the future holds for each API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_api_network_explore.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>This blueprint won&rsquo;t be something all API providers will want to put to work. However, for API providers who are looking to ensure an API is discoverable by default, and make the roadmap a much more community affair will benefit from this approach. The goal is to effectively manage the OpenAPI contract for each API, while making it something that can be quickly put to use without friction, while involving the community throughout the process. I am looking to establish this blueprint as the base for many of the conversations I am having with API providers about how to effectively manage their API operations. Providing them with the foundation they need to develop and deliver APIs in an observable and collaborative way--stay tuned.</p>

<p>title: ‘Managing the API Lifecycle Using OpenAPI and Postman’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_workspace_collection_dashboard.png</p>

<hr />

<p>I am having this conversation with over five separate API providers right now, so I wanted to write it up, share it as part of these conversations, while also making it available for my wider audience here on API Evangelist. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/08/02/managing-your-openapi-and-postman-collection-publicly/">I just finished another piece on managing your OpenAPI and Postman collection publicly, laying the foundation for this post</a>. I want these to be separate modules which people can follow and use independently, providing me with a single URL for different concepts I am discussing. While this isn&rsquo;t a a pattern everyone will want to follow, it is one possible pattern I&rsquo;ve been identifying for use by companies looking to get a handle on how APIs are being delivered across the enterprise using Postman.</p>
<h3>Building on an OpenAPI Foundation</h3>
<p>The foundation of this blueprint is all about having an OpenAPI definition within a workspace acting as the central contract for each API. Providing the cornerstone each API will need to be moved along its lifecycle, and iterated upon by all stakeholders who have access to the workspace. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/08/02/managing-your-openapi-and-postman-collection-publicly/">You can view the separate post I have on management of OpenAPI using both Postman and GitHub</a>, but here are the moving parts of what I propose for one possible blueprint for how you want to manage your individual APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/product/workspaces/">Workspace</a></strong> - Always having a dedicated workspace for each individual API or a bundle of APIs, providing a single place internal stakeholders can find whatever they need about each API to understand how it works, and influence the road map when it comes to the future iterations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/products">Repository</a></strong> - Ensuring there is a GitHub repository in place to act as the partner (private) or public face of each API workspace, providing a single place that external stakeholders can can to find information on APIs, and provide feedback on each API being made available.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI/">OpenAPI</a></strong> - There is a versioned OpenAPI contract in place for each API, publishing one or more APIs to a single workspace. Using Postman API builder to define the central contract for each API, then syndicating, generating, sharing, and syncing the contract for use in other systems.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://blog.postman.com/backup-and-sync-your-postman-collections-on-github/">GitHub Sync</a></strong> - A two-way sync is set up to allow each OpenAPI contract to be synced to a GitHub repository, allowing changes to be made in both Postman and GitHub, but synced both directions, allowing for a bridge to exist between internal and external stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>This provides the foundation of the factory floor I am proposing with this blueprint. It gives you a single place to find each API, both for internal stakeholders, and with partners or public consumers of an API. It leverages Postman for much of the team work to move an API forward, and Github to manage the external facing elements of the API lifecycle. While depending on a machine readable contract as the source of truth within Postman, but also within any other system or pipeline using GitHub.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_workspace_collection_dashboard.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<h3>Powering the API Lifecycle from the OpenAPI Contract</h3>
<p>Collections have always been the essential unit of compute within Postman. However, once we&rsquo;ve started leveraging OpenAPI as the contract for each API in API builder, collections have been continuing to evolve in how they are applied, helping apply an API contract across the API lifecycle. Once I have a workspace, repository, and Open API setup for an API, I&rsquo;ve begun requiring there be a handful of common collections that help me deliver each API, using a collection-driven, API-first lifecycle defined by these elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-documentation-tool/">Documentation</a></strong> - I am generating a collection from the OpenAPI contract specifically for managing and publishing documentation, providing a place to add examples and other details that help developers understand what is possible when it comes to putting an API to work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/">Mock Server</a></strong> - I am generating a collection from the OpenAPI contract specifically for managing and publishing a mock server for each API, providing me with an API I can use during design, development, and testing, providing me with a ready to go representation of each API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://medium.com/better-practices/consumer-driven-contract-testing-using-postman-f3580dba5370">Contract Tests</a></strong> - I am generating a collection from the OpenAPI contract specifically for defining and executing contract tests for each API, requiring there be 100% coverage for all of the paths that are available for an API, ensuring they are delivering as expected in an ongoing way.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-monitor/">Performance Tests</a></strong> - I am generating a collection from the OpenAPI contract specifically for defining and executing performance tests for each API, requiring there be at least one path tested, ideally multiple, for performance from one or more cloud regions to ensure optimal performance.</li>
<li><strong>Security Tests</strong> - I am generating a collection from the OpenAPI contract specifically for defining and executing security tests for each API, making sure 100% of the available paths are being tested for some of the most common security vulnerabilities that exist for our API infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/">Environments</a></strong> - There should be at least one, but ideally multiple environments available for applying against documentation, mock servers, as well as contract, performance, and security tests, allowing for multiple profiles and design, development, staging, and production environments to be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>This further builds out the factory floor upon my OpenAPI foundation, providing what I will need to move each API forward in a consistent way. Ensuring that each API is well defined, documented, and fully tested to make sure it is meeting the needs of consumers. There will be additional stops along the API lifecycle such as deployment and management, but this blueprint can be applied to a brand new API that is being designed, all the way to an API that is in production. If every API I am developing uses this pattern, the potential for my factory floor to be further optimized, scaled, and distributed is much greater. I have a consistent foundation and machinery on my factory floor, which I can then replicate as separate workspaces for each API, each project, group, line of business, and organization. Providing me with what I need to scale API operations across many different teams, over many different geographic regions, serving many different applications.</p>
<h3>Managing Change Across the API Factory Floor</h3>
<p>The OpenAPI provides the contract needed to anchor each API throughout its lifecycle, providing a single source of truth for not just a single API, but multiple versions of the same API as it moves through time. Change is inevitable on the API factory floor, and this blueprint is designed to consider change, and make sure it is being managed at each step of the API journey. This blueprint focuses on a handful of ways that Postman can be used to deal with change, helping teams manage the forward motion of their API operations, using a couple of elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/versioning-an-api/">Versioning</a></strong> - Each OpenAPI, and collection generated is versioned to help be proactive when it comes to change, embracing semantic versioning to help iterate on the design of each API in a way that can easily be communicated across the team, and externally with consumers as each API evolves.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/validating-elements-against-schema/">Validation</a></strong> - There is inline validation for each OpenAPI contract to make sure it is following the OpenAPI schema, as well as validation to keep each collection you generate in alignment with the central contract, ensuring that documentation, mocks, and tests are always in alignment with the OpenAPI contract.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://blog.postman.com/backup-and-sync-your-postman-collections-on-github/">Syncing</a></strong> - Each version of an OpenAPI contract can be synced with GitHub, allowing change to occur within Postman, or externally as part of another system or application, allowing the OpenAPI contract to be syndicated and applied anywhere it is needed, leveraging Git as the conveyor belt for the API factory floor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/changelog-and-restoring-collections/">Change Log</a></strong> - There is a change log built into each API documenting what has changed, allowing for a historical record of each API to be established, providing what is needed to understand, but also communicate what has changed with stakeholders and external consumers in real time, or as part of a review.</li>
</ul>
<p>Change is an inevitable part of providing and consuming APIs. Whether or not API change is a positive or negative depends on your approach to managing it. The tooling and services you use will define change management for your teams, and set the tone for how your consumers view change--good and bad. This blueprint is designed to address the change that will occur across the API lifecycle, and the evolution of not just one, but of multiple APIs used across many different applications.</p>
<h3>Establishing the Critical Feedback Loop You Need</h3>
<p>This section of the blueprint is dedicated to making sure there is a feedback loop in place for all APIs, and all stakeholders are communicating properly around each stage of an APIs evolution. This blueprint makes sure that there is both an internal team feedback loop as well as a more external partner and public feedback loop that gives the community a voice. These are the feedback loop mechanisms that are in place as part of this API factory floor:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Comments</strong> - Each OpenAPI has its own comment thread allowing internal stakeholders to be commenting on the evolution of each API.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Documentation Comments</strong> - Each collection that is published for documentation has its own comment thread for internal stakeholders to use.</li>
<li><strong>Mock Server Comments</strong> - Each collection that is published for mock servers has its own comment thread for internal stakeholders to use.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Test Comments</strong> - Each collection that is published for contract tests has its own comment thread for internal stakeholders to use.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Test Comments </strong>- Each collection that is published for performance tests has its own comment thread for internal stakeholders to use.</li>
<li><strong>Security Test Comments</strong> - Each collection that is published for security tests has its own comment thread for internal stakeholders to use.</li>
<li><strong>Partner / Public Issues</strong> - The GitHub issues for the partner or public repo can be leveraged as an external stakeholder feedback loop for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Workspace History</strong> - Each workspace provides a history of all API calls made through each of the collections made available to team members.</li>
<li><strong>Workspace Activity</strong> - All changes to API, collections, environments, and other elements are logged as part of workspace activity across teams.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong> - There is reporting in place for all APIs, allowing me to see a history of their activity, broken down by API, helping define how each API is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>A feedback loop is essential to moving an API forward. Without a way for both internal and external stakeholders to educate themselves about what is happening, and provide feedback on bugs, enhancements, and other elements, an API will not move forward and meet the needs of its consumers. Feedback from consumers is critical for making sure the API is going to meet the demands of applications and system integrations, and provides the raw material needed to build each version of an API.</p>
<h3>A Factory Floor Designed for Collaboration by Default</h3>
<p>Providing and consuming APIs is rarely an isolated effort. APIs developed in isolation often do not meet the needs of consumers, and APIs that aren&rsquo;t easy to find, access, and put to use, rarely go anywhere. Successful APIs have active internal and external components, encouraging internal team members to actively collaborate, communicate, and interact, while also remaining engaged with external community stakeholders, ensuring they have a voice, and well-defined feedback loop in place to use. Here are some of the ways in which collaboration is built in as part of this API lifecycle blueprint.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workspaces</strong> - APIs can be found by team members using team workspaces, ensuring everything that is needed to work with an API is available within a dedicated workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Repositories</strong> - For the external facing engagement GitHub repositories can be used to provide artifacts, information, and use GitHub issues as a feedback loop.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Workspace Sharing</strong> - Workspaces can be shared with other team members, providing them a single URL to find what they need to work with any API available within the organization.</li>
<li><strong>API Sharing</strong> - Each API can be shared with other workspaces, allowing management to be centralized, while sharing out access to other teams via workspaces, and using RBAC to control who can make changes.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Sharing</strong> - Each collection can be shared out to other workspaces, using RBAC to control who can edit or just use, but they can also be shared via URL, providing a quick way to make it available to other users.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Sync</strong> - Postman users who are using the desktop application can work on APIs, collections, and environments within workspaces locally on their desktop and sync changes to the Postman platform for team access.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Sync </strong>- Each OpenAPI can be synced to GitHub, enabling collaboration across other external systems, while keeping the changes in sync between the Postman workspace and the Github repository where the OpenAPI is synced.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Collections can be used to publish documentation, providing up to date details about an API, as well as examples and code snippets that can be shared with other consumers, helping them understand what is possible.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Run in Postman Button </strong>- You can generate a run in Postman button from each collection that is generated from an OpenAPI contract, then publish the button on documentation, or any HTML or markdown page, allowing users to run in their Postman with one click.</li>
<li><strong>Private Network</strong> - APIs can be published to the internal network, allowing teams to build an internal organizational catalog of all the digital resources and capabilities that exist across teams.</li>
<li><strong>Public Network </strong>- Collections can be published to the public network, allowing the public to search for and import collections into their own personal or team workspaces, using collections to quickly on-board with public APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workspaces, APIs, collections, and environments are designed to be shared and worked on in a collaborative way. Encouraging internal team collaboration, as well as external partner or public engagement throughout the life of an API. Postman is a tool that has emerged as a developer favorite for working with APIs in isolation on the desktop, but over the last couple of years has evolved to incentivize teams to work together to move APIs forward within shared workspaces. When you combine this with the partner or public facing benefits of Github, you have the makings for a very robust and efficient way to design, develop, deliver, and sustain API infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Realizing API Automation and Observability</h3>
<p>This blueprint isn&rsquo;t meant to be just a static snapshot of what the API lifecycle might look like. It is meant to be an executable blueprint that can be used to automate and make the API lifecycle more observable by publishing the results of each collection run. By defining individual types of tests like contract, performance, and security as individual collections, it allows for each individual area of the API lifecycle to be manually run, executed on a schedule in the cloud, or as part of other pipelines that are run as part of regular CI/CD process. Providing three distinct ways in which the lifecycle can be automated, depending on what the goals are for each individual API.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/">Runners</a></strong> - All of the collections outlined as part of this blueprint can be manually run by any team member using a desktop or web runner, executing each collection, and the requests, scripts, and other details it contains using a variety of profiles defined as environments.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/api-monitor/">Monitors</a></strong> - All collections can be run on a schedule from multiple geographic cloud regions, applying any profile defined as an environment, executing the requests, scripts, and other details a collection contains, reporting on the results of each cloud run.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/use-cases/api-testing-automation/">Pipelines</a></strong> - All collections can be run from any pipeline using Newman, the open source collection runner, executing each collection and environment, helping automate and make each stop along the API lifecycle more observable using the outputs from each run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Runners, monitors, and pipelines provide us with the ability to automate the factory floor that moves each API forward. Working from a central OpenAPI contract, then generating, versioning, and validating each stop along the API lifecycle, we are able to choose to manually deliver a specific aspect of API operations, or schedule and execute upon different actions and events that occur as part of regular business operations. Giving us a significant amount of control when it comes to consistently moving each API forward, while making sure we are consciously managing change, and ensuring we are always meeting our API contractual obligation, as well as SLA when it comes to performance and security.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_runners.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<h3>The Required Security Controls</h3>
<p>This blueprint contains the base for a suite of security tests that can be automated, but there are a number of other security mechanisms built into Postman and this blueprint that help bring API security into focus, while providing some ways to help tighten the API security perimeter.&nbsp; These are the mechanisms in place for defining security for individual APIs, but also for applying in concert across many different APIs, helping keep things stable and secure for all internal teams, and external consumers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Tests</strong> - Each API will have at least one collection dedicated to security, ideally there are many different types of security collections that can be run in different ways, but each API should at least have one that is regularly monitored and reported upon.</li>
<li><strong>Public or Private</strong> - Teams can make a conscious choice to be public with an API, or keep it as part of a private network. Providing clear distinction and guidelines for how teams should be managing the presence for each of the APIs being delivered.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Each collection, folder, and request can possess the authentication details it needs to properly make each API request that is defined as part of an API, helping consistently apply authentication across API operations using well-defined collections.</li>
<li><strong>Environments</strong> - Collections should always have their keys, tokens, and other secrets abstracted away as part of environments, then applying the variables within each collection where they are needed. Helping keep sensitive data abstracted away from collections, with environments.</li>
<li><strong>Workspace Role Based Access Control (RBAC) </strong>- Each workspace has RBAC controls, allowing administrators to be able to control who can view or manage API workspaces.</li>
<li><strong>API&nbsp; Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> - Each API has RBAC controls, allowing administrators to be able to control who can view, manage, or use APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Role Based Access Control (RBAC) </strong>- Each collection has RBAC controls, allowing administrators to be able to control who can view, manage, or use collections.</li>
<li><strong>Environment Role Based Access Control (RBAC) </strong>- Each environment has RBAC controls, allowing administrators to be able to control who can view, manage, or use the environment.</li>
<li><strong>Activity</strong> - Everything done within a workspace is logged as part of activity, ensuring that there is observability into who is applying resources, allowing for security to be loosed or tightened at the workspace level, or more fine grained with APIs, collections, and environments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The security portion of this API blueprint isn&rsquo;t about providing a single silver bullet feature that can be applied to secure API infrastructure. This is about ensuring that all APIs are secured using the latest practices, and being able to define the security of each individual API request, as well as the workspace, APIs, as well as collections and environments used to work with and evolve each API. While also ensuring there is visibility into everything that is happening by default with all API activity across operations being logged and made more accessible within the workspace where teams are doing their work.</p>
<h3>Managing the API Lifecycle Using OpenAPI and Postman</h3>
<p>This blueprint is meant to provide one possible slice of the API operations pie. Showing how you can use OpenAPI as the central contract for each API, while defining, managing, and automating each stop along the API lifecycle using collections. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve been able to actually demonstrate how you can move an API forward across the API lifecycle using common artifacts and tooling. Up until now most of what I have been preaching is academic hand waving, but I actually have this working as part of <a href="http://union.fashion/">my Union Fashion reference implementation</a>. I still have a lot of work to do when it comes to coherently demonstrating each section of this blueprint, but at least I have all the tools I need for my factory floor, I just have to get more consistent and coherent in how I demonstrate it, and help people apply to their own APIs.</p>
<p>There are a handful of critical stops along the API lifecycle missing from this blueprint. Primarily API deployment and management. I am working on fleshing out what management would look like depending on the cloud platform and API management solution you are using. Deployment is a much tougher nut to crack. I have successfully made a handful of API deployment collections that take the OpenAPI contract from each workspace and deploy the API to AWS. However, deployment is the toughest stop along the API lifecycle to define, so it will take me a significant amount of work before it comes further into focus. I would consider this to be my base template for managing my APIs using Postman. It really provides the fundamentals for my API-first approach to delivering APIs, and the deployment and management sections can be added later, allowing these stops to be more customized for the cloud you operate in, and which framework, service or gateway you put to work.</p>
<p>I still have a lot of work in better fleshing out the areas of this blueprint. I don&rsquo;t feel like the relationship between OpenAPI and Postman collections is as clear as it should be. I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m adequately explaining how collections power the essential stops along the API lifecycle like documentation, mocks, and testing. I am just getting started on defining the feedback loop, collaboration, automation, and security aspects of this blueprint. However, this all gives me a pretty robust snapshot of what I am working with different enterprise organizations on. I will need to make it all a lot more modular before I present it to anyone, and be able to provide some sort of self-service walkthrough of what is going on before I think people will be able to follow. My goal is to keep investing in Union Fashion workspaces, and make it a working sample of what I am talking about, while heavily preparing and lobbying for new features in Postman that help make it easier for me to set up a working, clone-able example of this blueprint. Continuing to build my e-commerce reference implementation, but then quickly doing healthcare, and other industries to help show how this API blueprint can be applied to many different resources within the enterprise.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/fastapi_logo_teal.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I am doing deep dives into each stop along the API lifecycle, beginning with deployment and management, to better understand how we can bring other features into Postman, without actually developing the features ourselves. There are two primary ways we are accomplishing this, by identifying open source solutions, and by partnering with services and tooling providers. Next up on my list is to flesh out is how we leverage the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI framework</a> as part of the Postman platform, helping developers deploy their API using the &ldquo;<em>&nbsp;high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production&rdquo; </em>FastAPI framework<em>.</em></p>
<p class="p3">If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with FastAPI,<a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi"> it is one of the top open source API frameworks on Github</a>. It is built in Python 3.6+, and based on standard Python type hints. Taken directly from the web page for FastAPI, the key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast:</strong> Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).</li>
<li><strong>Fast to code:</strong> Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Fewer bugs:</strong> Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *</li>
<li><strong>Intuitive:</strong> Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Easy: </strong>Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.</li>
<li><strong>Short:</strong> Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Robust: </strong>Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Standards-based: </strong>Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">I know that most Postman customers will care about all of those bullet points, but the one that really grabs my attention is the last one, and the fact that it is centered on the OpenAPI specification. As part of <a href="https://github.com/oai-demandgen/home">my OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) DemanGen</a> efforts at Postman, and my work to flesh out different stops along the API lifecycle, I am interested in amplifying what FastAPI delivers, and work to further bake it into the Postman ecosystem. Allowing developers to rapidly deploy APIs using FastAPI across multiple cloud platforms, while also tightening the relationship between API providers who use FastAPI and Postman, by making it easier for them to document, and test their APIs using Postman. Let me break down what I am thinking to help drive the conversation around a partnership between Postman and FastAPI.</p>
<h3>Deploy a FastAPI Powered API from within Postman</h3>
<p class="p3">I have been developing prototypes for a new type of Postman collection called &ldquo;deployment collections&rdquo;. These are collections that will deploy any API you have defined in Postman using OpenAPI, using the infrastructure APIs beneath your APIs&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for applications, they are also for deploying and managing your APIs. I built an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/04/21/api-deployment-collections--aws-api-gateway-and-dynamodb/"><span class="s1">AWS API Gateway backed by DynamoDB</span></a> and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2020/04/21/api-deployment-collections--aws-api-gateway-lambda-and-rds/"><span class="s1">AWS API Gateway backed by Lambda and RDS</span></a> earlier this year. These are focused on AWS, but I&rsquo;m looking to build similar end-to-end API deployment solutions that can operate as a Postman collection&mdash;this means it has to be done via an HTTP interface. These are some of the thoughts I am having when it comes to deploying APIs using FastAPI from within Postman:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Multi-Cloud </strong>- I&rsquo;d like to start with one platform, but eventually I&rsquo;d like there to be the ability to deploy a FastAPI backed API to AWS, Azure, Google, and Heroku.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Containerized</strong> - Clearly a containerized approach to deploying Fastly is optimal, but I&rsquo;d like to make sure and explore all possibilities when it comes deployment.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - Each deployment should be able to occur from a single, complete, validated OpenAPI definition that exists within Postman and synced to GitHub.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Collection</strong> - The entire API from start to first API call should be able to executed from a single Postman collection, resulting in a completely functional API on run.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Environment</strong> - All keys, tokens, and other key / values will be abstracted away from the collection, and allow for storing of everything it will need to be deployed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">There are a number of ways to deploy APIs according <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/"><span class="s1">the FastAPI deployment page</span></a>. These are primarily CLI-based solutions, and I am looking to define API-based deployment options. I know this isn&rsquo;t the normal way developer are accustom to, but there is no reason for it to be on par with CLI options, and bundled up as a collection that can be manually run, or delivered as part of any pipeline. All Postman partnerships begin as a Postman collection, and the road to tighter integration requires a collection. The future of the Postman integration program will all be driven by well-defined and hardened Postman collections. Initially I am just operating Postman deployment collections within the workspace of each OpenAPI being managed via the platform, but eventually Postman customers will be able to expose and execute these collections natively as part of the Postman interface.</p>
<h3>Use Postman to Manage the API Lifecycle For Fastly APIs</h3>
<p class="p3">Supporting deployments within Postman, but also supporting FastAPI deployments that do not occur from within Postman, I would like to further flesh out how Postman can be used across the lifecycle for APIs that are powered using FastAPI. OpenAPI is the heart of FastAPI, and it can operate as the heart of Postman, making it the perfect bridge for managing many different stops along the API lifecycle using Postman. I am looking to explore how we can leverage Postman for managing the following areas:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Documentation</strong> - FastAPI has SwaggerUI built in, but I&rsquo;d love to also see the ability for users to easily deploy documentation using Postman.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Testing</strong> - It would be beneficial for users to be able to automate and streamline the testing of APIs deployed using Fast API with Postman.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Client</strong> - All APIs deployed with FastAPI should automatically have a Postman collection generated from the OpenAPI, providing a ready to go client.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Discovery</strong> - All APIs deployed with FastAPI should have the option to be published to the Postman private or public API network, allowing it to be found.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">These are just a handful of the core stops along the API lifecycle I&rsquo;d love to see Postman support FastAPI users. Even if API providers aren&rsquo;t deploying APIs from within Postman using FastAPI, they should have the option to easily manage one or more stops along the API lifecycle with Postman. API providers should be able to learn about FastAPI in Postman, as well as learn about Postman while working with FastAPI. Both Postman and FastAPI already possess significant mindshare with developers, establishing our own overlapping API communities&mdash;I&rsquo;d just like to take a closer look at how we can increase the overlap between our communities, and make it easier for both our consumers to leverage all of the API solutions brought to the table by Postman and FastAPI.</p>
<p class="p3">I am going to use FastAPI as a poster child for API deployment as part of my Postman API lifecycle and OpenAPI DemandGen work. There are many ways in which enterprise organizations are deploying APIs, and it makes sense for Postman to be leveraging the best of breed open source solutions for API deployment, rather than reinventing the wheel. I am looking to make deployment of APIs with FastAPI as one-click as possible, making it dead simple for Postman users to define their APIs using OpenAPI, then click once to deploy, and then easily manage other stops along the API lifecycle like documentation, testing, and discovery. I will keep pushing this conversation forward as part of my work at Postman, and see where we can move things along with it comes to FastAPI and Postman working together.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This is <a href="https://community.postman.com/t/visualizing-covid-19-data-with-amcharts/13765">a repost from the Postman community on a very slick COVID-19 data project with accompanying Postmn collection</a> to actually work with the data and get back responses, and then view responses as a visualization using the Postman visualizer. Here is what was posted by Carson Hunter (<a href="https://twitter.com/carrrson">@carrrson</a>) from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mtna.us/">Metadata Technology North America (MTNA)</a>.</p>
<hr />

<p><em>We&rsquo;ve been hard at work building our&nbsp;<a href="https://covid19.richdataservices.com/?utm_source=postman&amp;utm_medium=postmanlabs&amp;utm_campaign=community_forums">Rich Data Services COVID-19 project&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="4 clicks">4</span></a>&nbsp;and are excited to finally be releasing it to the public and to have our API included in the Postman COVID-19 API Resource Center. The API includes a free-to-use and always-expanding catalog of curated COVID-19 data and metadata that&rsquo;s all set up to use with the Postman collection. (Docs are&nbsp;<a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2220438/SzYevv9u?version=latest">here&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="2 clicks">2</span></a>, or run it with the button below.)</em></p>

<p><em>The API has a lot of great features for querying and packaging data, but maybe the coolest thing of interest to the Postman community is the ease of integration with charting libraries, so you can create visualizations quickly and easily.</em></p>
<p><em>In this collection, we&rsquo;ve focused on using amCharts, but RDS also supports Plotly and Google Charts if that&rsquo;s your thing. By specifying one of these libraries in the request, the API returns the data in a format that&rsquo;s directly consumable by the library, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about manipulating the response.</em></p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ve included some visualization examples from the collection below, but the amCharts library is vast and there is a lot of COVID data out there, and we would love to see any creations the Postman community comes up with using the API.

<p>We had a lot of COVID-19 collection submitted as part of the work we've been doing on <a href="https://covid-19-apis.postman.com/">the Postman COVID-19 Resource Center</a>, and this is one of the most useful we've received, but it is definitely the best because it provides visualizations, using the Postman Visualizer. Which I think is the next killer feature of Postman, something I am seeing sales, analyst, and other non-developer folks putting to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got off a web conference with Carson and her team at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mtna.us/">Metadata Technology North America (MTNA)</a>, and we'll be doing more work around the data they are publishing as part of their important work. I was please to learn that they are very passionate about data, APIs, standards, and helping researchers and government agencies be more successful in their work. We&nbsp; will b emeeting again to discuss some more COVID-19 collection work, but also brainstorm what is possible with other types of datasets that just needs some polishing and storytelling to make more useful to a wider audience.--so expect more stories and collections like this one in future posts.</p>

<p class="p1">I am working to better understand <a href="https://www.moesif.com">the Moesif Analytics API</a> so that I can define a new type of Postman collection I am calling an API management collection. You wouldn&rsquo;t use this collection to make calls to an API you operate, you would use it to automate and orchestrate the API management layer you use to operate your APIs. I am working with several API management providers, but Moesif came up in my queue of work, and I feel they represent a more progressive view of the API management landscape, so I got to work pushing this conversation forward. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/07/29/developing-a-reference-openapi-and-collection-for-the-moesif-analytics-api-so-that-i-can-build-an-api-management-collection/">I recently worked to create an OpenAPI and Postman collection for the Moesif API</a>, so that I can better understand what they offer, and now I want to learn how some of Moesif&rsquo;s customers are using their APIs, and <a href="https://www.shipengine.com/">ShipEngine</a> was kind of enough to work with Moesif and me to help define an API management blueprint based upon how they manage their API infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p1">ShipEngine uses both Postman and Moesif, so they provide a pretty compelling blueprint for modeling my API management collection after.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am looking to better understand which of the 12 Moesif resources they put to work using the Moesif API, so I can plan the next big of work on this partnership effort.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> - Understanding the context in which actions are tracked.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Understanding more about the context of an application.</li>
<li><strong>Cohorts</strong> - Standardize how analytics are being organized by cohort.</li>
<li><strong>Companies</strong> - How companies are being managed using the API.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards</strong> - What sort of dashboard orchestration and automation occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong> - Looking at what events are being surfaced and are meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong> - How is overall health of the APIs being monitored and responded to.</li>
<li><strong>OAuth</strong> - What sort of authentication and authorization is being automated.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - Understand how searching of companies, users, and events is done.</li>
<li><strong>URL Encoder</strong> - I&rsquo;d like to understand more about how it is used and compare to Postman&rsquo;s.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - Define more about how users are being defined and worked with via the API.</li>
<li><strong>Workspaces</strong> - Understand the way in which workspaces are utilized at the management layer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I am looking to understand which of the Moesif API resources ShipEngine uses to manage their valuable shipping APIs. I am also interested in how they use Postman to work with the Moesif API. I don&rsquo;t expect them to be using all of these APIs, or have some well oiled set of Postman collections in place for managing their operations. I am just looking to better understand what matters to them when it comes to managing their APIs, why and how they use the Moesif API to accomplish it. Now that I have a better understanding of what the Moesif API does after creating the OpenAPI and working with the Postman collection, I want to develop a suite of Postman API management templates (collections) that we can publish to the network. Introducing Postman consumers to the concept of API management collections with real world examples they can test drive on their own.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Next, I&rsquo;ll work with Moesif and ShipEngine to outline what one, or many API management collections might look like for the Moesif API. Then I am going to complete a diff with other API management providers I am working with (AWS API Gateway, Mulesoft, WSO2, Tyk, Azure API Management, Kong, Citirx), and see if I can define a handful of standardized API management collections that are consistent across multiple providers. Postman is looking for ways we can better empower our customers with some common API management features, and since we aren&rsquo;t an API management service provider we are going to partner for these capabilities, and all partnerships at Postman begin with a collection. My primary goal is to get these valuable API management collections to be in the Postman network, but I&rsquo;d like to also see them baked into the platform as full on integrations. So when ShipEngine goes to work with any of the Moesif API management collections, they get additional insights as part of each request, or even empowering ShipEngine customers to get more insights when they use ShipEngine APIs, augmenting responses with data pulled from Moesif via their APIs. There are lots of opportunities here for work, we just need to figure out which of the resources above are the most meaningful when it comes to managing APIs, and get to work on a proof of concept for the API management collection.</p>

<p class="p1">I am making my way through all of the partner conversation I am having, publishing stories for each of the conversations to help me move each one forward. Today I am focusing on API management providers because I am looking to define a baseline set of resources across all providers to consider for deeper integration, and of course storytelling. I&rsquo;ve been talking with the Mulesoft folks since last year, working to find some ways we can partner and provide value for both of our customers. As with every other partnership, and especially API lifecycle partners, everything begins as a collection. If I can&rsquo;t get at the APIs behind a service, create an OpenAPI and Postman collection for the API, then it isn&rsquo;t an API lifecycle capability I can think about for deeper integration, and further storytelling. But Mulesoft isn&rsquo;t messing around, and <a href="https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/">they have Swagger and RAML available for all of their API lifecycle services and tooling</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">I downloaded the generated Swagger 2.0 definitions Mulesoft provides for their API manager and API platform. There are some other interesting APIs available there that I would like to see live as Postman collections. Honestly, I&rsquo;d like to see all of the APIs they have published via <a href="https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/">the Mulesoft // Dev catalog</a> in the Postman API network, as well as Postman collection added to the dropdown list Mulesoft provides for each API, allowing it&rsquo;s definition to be downloaded as RAML, Swagger, or Postman Collection. As with the other API management service providers I am profiling as part of this work, I created a Postman workspace for managing Mulesoft APIs.</p>
<p class="p1"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_07_29_at_9.20.45_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">With the Swagger 2.0 and Postman collections for the Mulesoft API Manager and API Platform I can begin to break down the individual capabilities that the API management solution provides. Then I can pick from the most common of these API management building blocks and get to work developing some collections that help API providers automate and orchestrate the management of their APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alerts</strong> - Sending alerts about APIs.</li>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Managing the APIs being delivered.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Understanding how they see apps.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Policies</strong> - They do it all with policies.</li>
<li><strong>Environments</strong> - Need to understand their environments.</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - Understanding how groups are applied.</li>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong> - Looking at how they organize things.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Templates</strong> - How are policies being standardized.</li>
<li><strong>Portals</strong> - Evaluating how they organize their portals.</li>
<li><strong>Themes</strong> - Managing the themes applied to the portals.</li>
<li><strong>Versions</strong> - Handling change across all of the API.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I was able o get an idea of the types of resources available across the Mulesoft Manager and Platform APIs. The collections will take some additional work to polish and organize, so that they could potentially be published to <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">the Postman API Network</a>, but provide me with a good start to understand what is possible. Right now I am just looking to define what is possible when it comes to automating and orchestrating Mulesoft API management using APIs. It will take more work to actually identify the most common management workflows involved with Mulesoft when it comes to managing APIs.</p>
<p class="p1">The goal of this work is to increase the number of API management service providers available in the API network, and laying the groundwork for a suite of collections that can be used to expose more data to Postman customers who use Mulesoft Management or Platform. The goal is to be able to expose insights from the API management layer directly in Postman. But before we can do this we need to have the functionality defined as individual collections. Helping establish modules of API management capabilities that API providers and consumers can tap into while working within Postman. Providing more details with each individual API response, helping developers better troubleshoot and debug what is going on beneath the surface.</p>

<hr />

<p class="p3">I am working my way through profiling <a href="https://www.moesif.com/">API analytics provider Moesif</a>. I have a pile of partner related work accumulating and there is no better way to work through what is going on than just writing here on API Evangelist&mdash;it is what this blog is all about. I am interested in Moesif because they are a next generation API management provider that represents the ever expanding universe of what we need to manage our APIs at scale. With the consolidation and commodification of API management since 2015, we&rsquo;ve seen more specialized API service providers emerge like Moesif who are focused on just one aspect of management&mdash;like analytics.</p>
<p class="p4">My review of any API service provider always begins with looking at their own developer area, and identifying whether or not they have an API (all API service providers should have APIs)&mdash;Moesif has one. Next, I need a machine readable API definition&mdash;either an OpenAPI or Postman, ideally both, as they have varied but overlapping purposes. Moesif is using Postman, which I will talk about more in a bit, but alas there wasn&rsquo;t an easy OpenAPI or Postman collection for me to put to work (shame shame). Luckily they use Slate for their docs, which always means there is some easy to scrape and parse markdown or HTML right behind things. I quickly <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/moesif/blob/master/openapi.json">generated an OpenAPI for the Moesif API analytics API</a>.</p>
<p class="p4"><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/moesif/blob/master/openapi.json"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_07_28_at_6.07.31_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p class="p4">It isn&rsquo;t a complete OpenAPI, but it does give me the paths, summaries, and parameters in a machine readable format. I can use this to generate a Postman collection, then begin using it to certify each of the endpoints, saving examples, and making for a more robust definition for docs, mocks, testing, and other lifecycle stops. To continue working with my Moesif OpenAPI definition I will need to create a dedicated workspace in Postman for my work with this partner, and publish the OpenAPI in my Postman API Builder.</p>
<p class="p4"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_07_28_at_6.08.30_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">With the entry level OpenAPI in Postman, I am not able to generate a Postman collection, which I then do a little more polishing and organization of requests, helping make the Moesif API a little more actionable as part of other work. <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/moesif/blob/master/collection.json">Right now this is what I call a reference collection</a>, providing me with a complete list of the value that Moesif brings to the table.</p>
<p class="p4"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_07_28_at_6.09.54_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">Now that I have the building blocks of what Moesif does, as tags within the OpenAPI, and as folders within the Postman collection. This provides me with the understanding I will need to create additional Postman collections that help API providers accomplish specific business objectives. I have my sights set on pushing forward three Postman collections for the Moesif API:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><strong><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/moesif/blob/master/collection.json">Reference</a></strong> - The collection I have is the beginning of a reference collection, but I still need to certify each endpoint to make sure it works, and they each have an example.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>On-boarding</strong> - I&rsquo;d like to see an on-boarding collection for the Moesif API, providing the most common requests someone will need to begin making sense of traffic to their AP</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Management</strong> - Lastly, I want a management collection that redefines the Moesif API in the context of API management, providing a collection that Postman customers can use to manage operations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">I have a couple of selfish motivations here. <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">I want Moesif&rsquo;s Postman collection in the API Network.</a> I also want the management collection to go with a wider suite of API management collections I&rsquo;m developing across service providers. I want a robust suite of Postman collections in the Postman API network for our customers to use when managing their APIs. These API management reference collections help me better define the landscape, but where the value will really become evident is when you start building workflow collections that help API providers automate the management of APIs across the API lifecycle.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Replaying API Calls in Postman</h3>
<p class="p4">Once I get the Moesif reference collection into the Postman network, we will consider them to be a &ldquo;network&rdquo; partner, but even without this, we consider Moesif to be a &ldquo;runtime&rdquo; partner. Meaning, they&rsquo;ve baked the schema for a Postman collection into their platform. Here is how Moesif describes it as part of the documentation for their API analytics, when it comes to <a href="https://www.moesif.com/docs/api-analytics/run-in-postman/">replaying API calls in Postman</a>.</p>
<p class="p4" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Moesif supports selecting and exporting API Calls as a Postman Collection for easy replay. This enables any problematic API calls or even sequences of API calls found in your production environments to be sent to Postman in order to reproduce the issue in a test / local environment.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="p4">This type of "runtime" integration allows you to speak Postman for all the APIs you are managing, using Postman to debug and troubleshoot what is happening. It is a great way to reverse engineer your existing APIs, generate a Postman collection, and then make calls to each API, as well as mock, document, test, and automate different workflows involving your APIs. This is one reason I want to have the Moesif API mapped out as a collection, because then we can begin to map out how Postman can expose Moesif enabled capabilities as seamless integrations. On the Postman platform, all integration partnerships begin with a collection, and then after we validate, harden, and make these collections more valuable, we expand their availability across the Postman network, platform, and desktop.</p>
<h3>Developing and Strengthening Partnerships</h3>
<p class="p4">This post is meant to help me better define how Postman and Moesif can potentially partner. It is also meant to help other potential partners understand how we are working to develop partnerships with Postman, and how you can help streamline the process by having OpenAPIs and Postman collections already defined for your APIs, and further bake Postman collections into your functionality by leveraging the Postman collection schema as part of importing or exporting into your platform. This post helps me move forward this conversation a bit, share my thoughts with Moesif, and define what some of the next steps are. Now we need to further refine and certify the Moesif API collection, and get into the Postman network. Then I want to focus on creating a management collection based upon how Moesif customers are using the platform. Our friends over at <span><a href="https://www.shipengine.com/">ShipEngine</a></span> said they&rsquo;d be interested in helping define one based upon how they use the Moesif API and Postman together, providing a real world blueprint for this Moesif API management collection I&rsquo;d like to see created.</p>
<p class="p4">I have a list of partners who want to work with Postman to develop reference, on-boarding, lifecycle, and other types of collections. Writing each of them out here on the blog is the only way I am going to get through this work, quantifying each of these relationships, and proposing some next steps to move the conversation forward &mdash; this is the only way we&rsquo;ll get to the most exciting part of the journey, where we get to tell stories on the blog, in the newsletter, via Webinars, Twitch streams, and other channels we broadcast on. First we need lay the foundation with reference collections for each partner, get them added to the network, then we can begin getting more creative using Postman to not just work with the APIs we are providing and consuming, but use it also to actually automate, orchestrate, and evolve our APIs across the API lifecycle. If you have any needs for API lifecycle collections for stops like deployment, management, security, monitoring, testing, or other areas of operations, let me know. Also if you are an API service provider with an API-driven service like Moesif you&rsquo;d like to see in this suite of API lifecycle collections&mdash;this post should provide you with more information on how to shift your potential partnership with Postman into a higher gear.</p>

<p>title: ‘Breaking Down the Capabilities of the WSO2 API Manager’</p>

<hr />

<p class="p1">I am profiling a number of API management APIs right now and reaching out to each of their teams to discuss moving forward a set of official API management collections that I can have published to the API network, and use to flesh out more API lifecycle capabilities within the Postman platform. Postman isn&rsquo;t an API management service provider, so it make sense for us to expose existing API management and gateway solutions as integrations, rather than attempt to build anything on our own, partnering with the best of breed API management solutions already in use. This will be our approach to other stops along the API lifecycle, weighing the possibilities with each stop, based upon what already exists in the space, and what the opportunities are for us to build, partner, or a mix of both.</p>
<p class="p3">Next up on my list of API service providers is to profile and assess as part of this work is <a href="https://wso2.com/">WSO2</a>. I&rsquo;ve worked with WSO2 since way back in 2012, so I am somewhat familiar with their product and services. As with all of the other API management providers I am profiling I am looking for an existing OpenAPI or Postman collection to help me understand what is possible with each API. It was pretty easy to find the Swagger file for each of the WSO2 <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM200/apidocs/publisher/">publisher</a>, <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/APICloud/apidocs/store">store</a>, and <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/APICloud/apidocs/admin/">administrative</a> APIs, but I couldn&rsquo;t easily find them for their tokens or analytics API, or their Microgateway&mdash;I will ping them to see if they have Swagger for these. I was able to upload three Swagger 2.0 definitions into a Postman workspace&mdash;I normally would upgrade to OpenAPI 3.0, but since these were provider managed specs I will keep them as is, in case I need to update.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_07_29_at_4.00.10_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p2">There are a wealth of resources available across these three WSO2 API, and having them available as Swagger definitions, and generated Postman collections helps me make sense of what is possible. This provides me with a set of three reference collections that I can use to begin planning a variety of WSO2 specific workflow collections. In addition to the reference collections for WSO2 API Manager, and WSO2 specific API management workflow collections, I am looking to define a handful of common patterns that I see across other API management service providers I am profiling. I want a full suite of Postman API management collections across as many providers as I can, as well as being able to clearly point to common API management practices that exist across multiple API management providers.</p>
<p class="p3">Here are the resources I am seeing available across these Postman collections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Managing APIs deployed using the WSO2 publisher.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Exploring what the context of an application is.</li>
<li><strong>Blacklists</strong> - Being able to decide who has access to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Policies</strong> - Going deeper with polices being applied to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Subscriptions</strong> - Managing the subscriptions available for Apis.</li>
<li><strong>Tiers</strong> - Defining what the tiers of access are for all APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Throttling</strong> - Defining what the rate limits are for APIs published.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">The process of <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/wso2">producing a Swagger / OpenAPI and Postman collections</a> puts me in touch with what is possible with each API. Once I am done profiling all of the API management service providers I will conduct a diff between each of them to create a kind of Venn diagram for these resources. Now that I have an API workspace set up with a reference Swagger and Postman collection, I can work to push forward the conversation with WSO2 in a handful of ways.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Official Collection</strong> - Convince WSO2 to take ownership of the Swagger and Postman collection within their own Postman workspace, and add the three WSO2 reference collections to the Postman API network.</li>
<li><strong>Management Collection</strong> - Alongside this work to get the official reference collection in the network, I want to also work to define a handful of API management collections that help define common API management tasks.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Once I have a reference collection, as well as a handful of API management collections I&rsquo;d like to do more storytelling around what is possible with WSO2 within Postman. I&rsquo;ll be focusing on understanding what WSO2 brings to the table, but also do the diff on what they offer compared to other API management service providers. I want to better understand the common patterns that exist across API management service providers, as well as the unique capabilities that exist within individual service providers. Having these artifacts is essential to me doing the work, and I appreciate that WSO2 has Swagger, even if I&rsquo;d prefer to see OpenAPI 3.0 (I know they support it), because it saves me time. Once I get WSO2 added to the Postman network they will be seen as a &ldquo;network&rdquo; partner, then I will look for ways to more deeply integrate these API management collections into Postman, while also looking at how we can bake Postman collections into WSO2 API manager, allowing WSO2 customers to publish Postman Collections for their APIs, and choose to add them to a public or private network using Postman.</p>
<p class="p3">With each API management provider I profile I am gaining more coherence in the view I have for API management. Once I have a short list of the most essential capabilities API providers are using when it comes to managing their API using WSO2 API manager I will work with them to develop and own API management collections that we can add to the network as templates. I really want WSO2 to have a presence in the API network, but I really want to be able to expose their capabilities within Postman. Giving WSO2 users more super powers when they work with their APIs in Postman, but also open up those super powers to the developers who are using WSO2 customer APIs. Providing more insight into the API management layer for the APIs we are consuming, further helping Postman users debug and troubleshoot what is going on underneath the hood. Leverage the API infrastructure beneath the APIs we deliver to help make working with those APIs more intelligent, reducing friction for both API providers and consumers when it comes to putting APIs to work on the enterprise factory floor.</p>

<p class="p1">It can be difficult to understand exactly what OpenAPI is and what it isn&rsquo;t sometimes. I get a lot of questions from folks who don&rsquo;t entirely grasp what the OpenAPI specification is, and how it applies to the API lifecycle. It is alright to not fully get all the technical details of the specification, and I want to acknowledge this deficiency in the space, and help address the challenges by holding a 30 minute open office hours where I will introduce what OpenAPI is each week--helping on-board new people to the world of OpenAPI. These discussions will start out pretty free form, with me developing some curriculum to help introduce folks to the spec, but is something I would refine each week based upon the questions I get from the public.</p>
<p class="p1">I am looking to begin with just walking through some of the most common elements of OpenAPI 3.1, helping lay the foundation for what OpenAPI is all about:s</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>History</strong> - Quick recap of how we got here, including the difference between Swagger and OpenAPI.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong> - A look at what OpenAPI is for and why it has become a standard for defining APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Objects</strong> - Walking through the core objects that are present as part of the OpenAPI spec.</li>
<li><strong>YAML / JSON</strong> - Talking about how you can use YAML or JSOn to define your OpenAPIs.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> - Looking at some of the services that have adopted the OpenAPI spec as standard.</li>
<li><strong>Tooling</strong> - Looking at some of the open source tooling that have embraced the OpenApI spec.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I think that is all I will have time for when it comes to the 30 minutes. Initially I&rsquo;d like to just run through the basics of OpenAPI, and I can do 30 minutes sessions dedicated to other sections in future office hours. Right now I am looking to just talk about the basics, formalize some basic content, and answer the questions of folks looking to learn about OpenAPI. If you are new to OpenAPI, or just have questions about it&rsquo;s moving parts, feel free to join in. I love talking to folks who don&rsquo;t quite feel comfortable with all of the details of the spec&mdash;it helps me polish my approach.</p>
<p class="p1">This is just one of a handful of office hours I am looking to hold to facilitate discussions about OpenAPI. I am trying to help increase the awareness and demand for OpenAPI, and help push the community forward. If you have any questions about these office hours, feel free to show up, or find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/">LinkedIn</a>, or just email me at <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com"><span class="s1">info@apievangelist.com</span></a>.</p>

There really is no reason for so many folks are still talking about Swagger 2.0, when there are more benefits associated with the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, and more modern services and tooling that utilizes the current version of the API specification. I want to open up a conversation about this, discuss the challenges that people face, and help folks understand what the difference is between Swagger and OpenAPI, and why they should be moving forward, and not staying in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">This recurring session will start out exploring the divide and misconception that exists, and then evolve to be more formal about what enterprise organizations are needing to migrate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>History</strong> - Quick recap of how we got here, including the difference between Swagger and OpenAPI.</li>
<li><strong>Differences</strong> - What are the key differences between Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0.<span> </span></li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> - Look at how API services providers are using each of the specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Tooling</strong> - Understand the diff between tooling in both areas, understanding where deficiencies are.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - How can we tell more stories about OpenAPI that help people understand the difference.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The goal here is to develop some basic curriculum that helps teams make the switch from Swagger to OpenAPI. Part of this will be to understand how to help get the word out about the difference and why it matters that we move forward. There is a number of misconceptions that exist the prevent folks from moving forward, and I am looking to help clear things up, get people focusing on the future of the specification, and shift the conversation to services and tooling around OpenAPI 3.0.</p>

<p>title: ‘The Quickest Way to Partner with Postman Is Through the Network’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_network_partner_4.png</p>

<hr />

<p class="p1">One of the areas I am working on defining at Postman is how we partner with API providers, and API service providers. We are doing a lot of partnering right now, but we do not have a formal program for how we engage with our partners. Over the last couple of months I have been working to identify who all of our partners are, and define the common ways we partner with these various companies, non-profit organizations, institutions, and government agencies. I have a lot of people reaching out about partnering, and there are a lot of interesting APIs, services, and tooling providers I am looking to partner with, so we will need to get a little more formal about things if we are going to take things to the next level. One of the most obvious ways I can encourage folks to partner with Postman is to publish a collection for their API to the <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Postman public API network</a>. Once Postman formalizes its partner strategy, this will become the lowest tier of partnership for the platform and community, providing a self-service way to engage with us (pssst! you don't have to wait).</p>
<p class="p1">If you aren&rsquo;t familiar, <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">the Postman network is a public directory of APIs</a>. To join all you have to do is click n the dropdown menu for each of your API collections, and choose to publish as docs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 2px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_network_partner_1.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;As part of the process you are given the option to publish as part of the Postman API network&mdash;making your collection available on the web, and within the Postman desktop client. There are a bunch of settings as part of publishing documentation using Postman, and the collection discovery portion of the settings will allow you to control how things are published (or not).</p>
<p><img style="padding: 2px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_network_partner_2.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>Once you hit publish the documentation and run in Postman button for your collection will show up under your user or team page, which is something you can repeat over and over for different API, building up an entire suite of different collections--you don't just have to have one.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 2px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_network_partner_3.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">You can choose to publish it to the API network, which will require a review of the collection by Postman staff, or you can choose to add as a template, which requires less scrutiny. If a collection is the official reference documentation for your API then I recommend adding it to the network. If it is a more single use, workflow, tutorial, or other more utility type of collection, then I recommend adding it as a template. I also recommend spending a little time thinking about your user profile a bit, or if you are publishing as part of a team, I recommend spending some time in your team settings to make sure your page looks good from the outside.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/postman_network_partner_4.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p1">You can have multiple collections published to the network or as templates, and these will all be accessible from your user or team page. So it makes sense to put a little thought into whether these collections represent your work as an individual, or as part of your team. If it reflects your team, then you planted the seeds for a (network) partnership with Postman. Once you have your APIs available in the network, and they meet some basic quality criteria, there is an opportunity for further discussion around a variety of partner activities. While the levels of partnership and types of activities are still being defined, I am always happy to talk about the best possible way to leverage the Postman network, and other storytelling opportunities that exist--feel free to ping me.</p>
<p class="p1">On the Postman platform the collection is the most meaningful unit of value. Representing your entire API operations, all the way down to individual API capabilities your organization possesses. A collection added <a href="https://explore.postman.com">to the Postman API network</a> becomes the focal point of blog posts, webinars, Twitch live streams, case studies, workshops, educational curriculum, and other activities that occur regularly within our ecosystem. I am keen on getting as many API reference collections as I can into the Postman API network, so if just added one, feel free to Tweet a link to the page to me. I am also looking for more innovative collections such as on-boarding, deployment, management, and other types of what I&rsquo;d consider to be API lifecycle collections. I&rsquo;ve seen some pretty interesting incarnations from customers, and I&rsquo;m very interested in expanding my awareness of what is going on. Drop me a line.</p>

<p class="p1">I am working my way through all of the partner work I have on my workbench, and there is no better way to work through it than to write it out as blog posts here on API Evangelist. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/07/21/the-quickest-way-to-partner-with-postman-is-through-the-network/">I just talked about how the easiest way to partner with Postman is by adding your collections to the API network</a>. This is no guarantee of partnership, because Postman doesn&rsquo;t have a formal partner program yet, but it is a quick way to get on the Postman community radar, and if your API and collection is interesting enough, we are likely to want to showcase more in other storytelling. Adding your collection to the Postman network is self-service and easy to do, you don&rsquo;t need to talk with Postman to do it, but there is also another way in which you can partner with Postman that is also self-service, and will also get our attention. You can bake collections into your platform, which we like to call &ldquo;runtime integrations&rdquo;, because API service providers are integrating the Postman runtime into their services, and adopting the Postman collection schema as a common way to define API requests and workflows on their platform.</p>
<p class="p1">An example of a Postman runtime integration can be found with API monitoring provider <a href="https://apimetrics.io/">APIMetrics</a>, <a href="https://apimetrics.readme.io/docs/monitor-postman-collections">who allows their customers to import a Postman collection and fire up industrial grade API monitoring at scale</a>. Postman does monitoring, but it makes sense to embrace other service providers who offer competing or more comprehensive services, and a Postman collection is the perfect unit of currency to define this relationship. APIMetrics benefits from the over 11 million users of Postman, and Postman benefits because our customers can scale the services they use with Postman, and with all of our partners. Beyond APIMetrics, here are a handful of other service providers who have baked the Postman collection into their platforms.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p2">Most of these services are competitors of Postman. They are primarily baking the Postman collection into their platforms to benefit from the ubiquitous nature of Postman collections across the enterprise. We see this as an opportunity to grow the reach of the Postman platform, and it just strengthens the value of Postman collections as a currency of the API economy. It benefits Postman customers to have Postman collection work in other services that they use, and with each platform our runtime operates in, our overall engine grows more powerful.</p>
<p class="p1">If you use Postman collections, or any of the other open source components that Postman provides, I&rsquo;d love to learn more about how you are using it. I spend a lot of time looking through the thousands of API providers who use collections, but finding API service providers who use Postman collections can be more difficult to discovery. I know there are more of these runtime integration out there, I just need to find them. I am looking to stimulate more runtime integrations across the lifecycle. This list is a little API testing heavy, and I&rsquo;m looking to identify, showcase, and help evolve a robust set of runtime integration partners who service every stop along a modern API lifecycle.</p>

<p class="p1">I recently harvested all of the open source tooling that is being built on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/06/08/the-open-source-community-tooling-built-on-openapi/">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/06/08/the-open-source-community-tooling-built-on-swagger/">Swagger</a> specifications from GitHub. I am looking to better understand what people are doing with the specification, and parsing the words people use to describe their open source project is a good way for me to quickly pull together a list of what matters. If people are building a tool to solve a problem, and publish that on GitHub, it is a good sign that it is an itch needing scratching--here is the tag cloud from this list of what people are doing with both Swagger and OpenAPI.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_07_20_at_4.26.05_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">Semantically they all don&rsquo;t jive, but it does paint an interesting picture of what is happening in the OpenAPI community. I am going to be working on this list to establish a more solid reference for the OpenAPI community. I am looking to profile all of these tools as part of the OAI demand generation work I am doing, but I am also interested in continuing to map the API lifecycle and keep mapping how open source OpenAPI tooling fits into the picture. We have built up a lot of momentum over the years, but this landscape is still pretty fractured and disorganized, making it difficult to navigate&mdash;I am looking to change that.</p>

<p class="p1">I conducted the first OAI Demand Generation Public Office Hours last Friday. On behalf of the OAI I am looking to generate more awareness and demand around the specification, helping bring together members and non-members in the community to tell more stories about what is happening around the specification. I pitched the idea as part of the OAI marketing meeting, and didn&rsquo;t want to waste any time in scheduling a meeting and getting the conversation going. We had a pretty small turnout for the first one, resulting me just talking about what I am already working on for over a half hour. However, we now have over 20 people added to the invite for the recurring meeting every Friday at 8:00 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few ways you can catch up on what is going on, and get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/oai-demandgen/home">Head Over to GitHub</a></strong> - We are managing this effort out in the open on GitHub, using the README as a home page, and issues to help track ideas and projects that are moving forward.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP7PScrtrVQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">View Last Weeks Video</a></strong> - I am recording each session and publishing to YouTube for those who can&rsquo;t make it. This one isn&rsquo;t the highest quality, but I will get better at doing these in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Join the Conversation</strong> - Go ahead and email <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com"><span class="s1">info@apievangelist.com</span></a> if you&rsquo;d like to be added to the Google Calendar invite for the OAI DemandGen Public Office Hours, and get the meeting in your calendar.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">We are looking to gather ideas from across the community about how we can build awareness of the OpenAPI specification, and increase more demand for the services and tooling that is built on top of it. I am aggregating ideas via the issue for the projects GitHub repository, and moving forward projects as I have time. If there is an idea you have, or an existing idea you have time to help move forward please jump in. This work isn&rsquo;t for the shy or fence-sitter types, it is about sharing ideas about what you&rsquo;d like to see, while also rolling up your sleeves and helping out.</p>
<p class="p1">I will use the<a href="https://github.com/oai-demandgen/home"> README for the home repo of this project</a> as the central page to find out everything that is happening around this project. I set up its own organization to allow for wider non-member participation. I intend to fork projects here from across the community, and leverage GitHub heavily for moving projects forward&mdash;keeping everything out in the open. If you want to help manage I recommend starting by joining the weekly conversation, and then we can explore the best way for you to help. I am going to keep stoking the fire under this conversation each week, building momentum until we pick up the speed we need to get the API sector to the next level.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p1">I like researching and thinking more about each of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/01/22/help-defining-13-of-the-asyncapi-protocol-bindings/">the 13 AsyncAPI protocol bindings</a>. It paints a picture of the past, present, and future of APIs for me. Leveraging <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI</a> to define your event and message driven APIs is the future of API development, but one of the things I really, really, really, love about AsyncAPI as a specification is that the definition for the HTTP binding is just OpenAPI. Similar to how OpenAPI and AsyncAPI have baked in JSON Schema, AsyncAPI has baked in OpenAPI. In my opinion, this is how API specifications should work. There shouldn&rsquo;t be one specification to rule them all, we let API specs compete on usefulness and the tooling that is built on top, and build on top of the specifications that already exist, preventing us from reinventing the wheel.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">This kind of extensibility and reuse is what APIs are all about. This isn&rsquo;t a question of OpenAPI vs. AsyncAPI, it is a question of AsyncAPI and OpenAPI. I know there is a lot of investment going into thinking about OpenAPI overlays for the next version, but as we have these thoughts I want to make sure this type of reuse gets considered. I am thinking very deeply about OpenAPI again, but I also find myself thinking very deeply about a number of API, data, and other operational level API specifications, and how they all work in concert. I am also thinking about where we need potentially new specifications, industry level specifications, and trying to find the bandwidth to continue talking about the future of APIs.json providing an index for all of API operations. OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman collections have come a long way over the years, and I feel pretty poised to radically move forward how the API factory floor operates within the enterprise.</p>
<p class="p1">I learned a lot about the technology, business, and politics of APIs by participating in the evolution of API specs from 2010 through 2015, and was able to level up this knowledge working with API providers, and service providers from 2015 through 2020. Moving forward, I am wanting to inject more energy into the conversation, and help guide more money into proprietary and open source services and tooling that leverage API specifications. 2010 through 2020 showed me how slow these cycles really are for enterprise organizations, institutions, and government agencies, despite all the dust that gets kicked up by investment capital and storytelling by the tech sector. API specifications help me keep my eye on the prize on my own and I feel pretty strongly that they help enterprise organizations get their act together when it comes to doing APIs across teams and projects. API specification literacy will become a critical aspect of API operations in the next decade, and entire organizations will be defined by how well they define, collaborate, and communicate using API definitions. I can pretty quickly size up the nimbleness and agility of a large organization based upon whether they say "Swagger" or "OpenAPI", and whether they know about AsyncAPI, and utilize JSON Schema and Postman collections across operations. These specifications are essential to doing business online today, and tell a lot about what is going behind the scenes at any enterprise organization.</p>
<p class="p1">As we continue our march forward with the development and evolution of API specs, as well as the services and tooling that leverage them, let&rsquo;s make sure we are thinking about interoperability and reuse. Let&rsquo;s make sure we know how the specifications work together, and make sure all services and tooling we develop wisely put existing API specifications to work. Let&rsquo;s understand and put to use in ways which the specifications reuse each other and prevent ourselves from reinventing the wheel in our work&mdash;even if a specification doesn&rsquo;t do everything you need. I think that OpenAPI provides us with a wealth of reuse opportunities within the HTTP 1.1 realm, but AsyncAPI has come along as a sister specification to show us how this can be done beyond HTTP 1.1. Building on OpenAPI and JSON Schema to help guide us into the future, allowing for reuse of existing patterns, but also pushing us to continue to acknowledge that HTTP APIs will only get us so far, and we will need a diverse set of bindings to keep our API factory floors operating.</p>

<p>I have been asked by more than 10 people in the last couple of weeks for more information for helping them make sense of the whole event-driven API landscape. I have all kinds of links available, and various organizations, tools, and other building blocks identified, but if I haven't told any stories on a subject, I won't have more refined information to share.

<p>These are some of the key building blocks of the event-driven conversation. Having the keywords avaialble in my research notebook helps me Google and discover other new information. It gives me the vocabulary to assist me when I am manually researching things, but also provide what I need to automate and scale my harvesting of interesting stories, tools, services, people, and other ways in which the event-driven conversation is being push in new directions.</p>
<p>If you have any go to sources of information for event-driven APIs please ping me on Twitter or via email and let me know. I will add it to my research, and use as part of storytelling in the future. I am far from becoming a source of relevant information on event-driven APIs, but I have been tuning in for long enough that I should be able to quickly curate what I have, and hopefully produce sosme better posts that help others navigate the landscape that is rapidly emerging.</p>

<p class="p3">I am making my rounds with folks in the API community talking about the next generation of <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">the OpenAPI specification</a>, getting people to move beyond Swagger 2.0, tooling and service providers to adopt more of the spec, and generate more demand for the specification and the work going on around it. Demand generation is such a business term to describe what I envision, but it is a word that people in the sector get, and neatly sums up what we need to do, so to hell with it. The OpenAPI spec has continued to evolve and grow, but things have clearly plateaued when it comes to the narrative coming out of the OAI, and from people doing interesting things with the specification in the API space. There is lots of activity, but there isn&rsquo;t a clear overarching narrative about what is OpenAPI, why OpenAPI, and the tooling and service enablement that is occurring around it. I am looking to change this, gather ideas, turn up the volume, and get more people working with OpenAPI 3.1, and investing in the future of the spec.</p>
<p class="p3">To help drive the demand generation discussion around OpenAPI I am going to be holding a recurring weekly demand generation discussion right after the regular OAI marketing meeting&mdash;here are the details if you want to join in the conversation.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong><a href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=MWVwY2VyMnI3cmxoNmFvaXIzOGUycWR1aWhfMjAyMDA3MTcga2luLmxhbmVAcG9zdG1hbi5jb20&amp;tmsrc=kin.lane%40postman.com&amp;scp=ALL">OpenAPI Demand Generation weekly at 11:00 AM Pacific Time</a>&nbsp;</strong>on <a href="https://meet.google.com/rts-wzng-hpm">Google Meet</a>&nbsp;- Let me know if you want a calendar invite to join in each week.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">While the meeting is associated with the OAI you do not have to be a member to participate. We are looking to gather ideas from the community about what we should be doing to generate more demand for the OpenAPI specification. I have been gathering ideas from one on one discussions with folks, so if you have any ideas and won&rsquo;t be able to join in, feel free to email me or schedule some time to talk. We are gathering all ideas from the OAI membership and the wider OpenAPI community then working to see which ones we can move forward. If you have any opinions on what is going on with the state of the OpenAPI spec, or the services and tooling that emerges around it, now is your time to get those opinions heard.</p>
<p class="p3">I have a number of ideas swirling around in my head, so I wanted to scribble a few of them down in preparation. To help drive awareness, adoption, and growth, I am thinking we should focus in some of the following areas:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Propaganda Posters</strong> - I would like to see a series of old time propaganda posters focused on the OpenAPI community, helping people see the big picture, and understand the importance of working together around the spec. Let&rsquo;s make these posters collectors items.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Education</strong> - This is already in motion within the OAI, but I&rsquo;d like to discuss how the community contributes to a wider OpenAPI edu effort, and how does the OAI incentive participation and include the community as part of the effort to get many voices involved in EDU.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Certifications</strong> - As part of the OpenAPI education efforts I&rsquo;d like to discus the possibilities of certifications, and how we can validate what people know about the spec, and begin certifying developers with the spec, but also for services and tooling that uses all or part of the spec.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Open Tooling</strong> - How do we support existing OpenAPI tooling catalogs from Phil, Mike, and natively as part of OpenAPI? How do we continue to showcase, invest in, and amplify the tooling that exists across the space to increase demand for the spec.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Certified Services </strong>- Can we do a roundup of the existing tools that support OpenAPI, define how much of the spec they support and documentation showcase them? How do we do this with 2.0 providers and encourage them to invest into 3.0?</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Storytelling Network</strong> - How do we establish a network of sites for publishing OpenAPI related stories, and how do we get more practitioners to tell stories about what they are doing and help them get more attention when they do.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">I am going to start there. I know other people have already added their thoughts to an internal spreadsheet for demand generation within the OAI. I will take a look at these ideas, and then augment with my own. If you have any ideas for what you&rsquo;d like to see when it comes to beating the drum louder about OpenAPI and the services and tooling that support it, let me know.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know that the community is doing interesting things, and that there are many ideas floating around regarding what the OAI could / should do to stimulate the community&mdash;we just need to figure out how to get it onto a list of projects we are collectively moving forward as a community, and work to get the OAI blessing.</p>
<p class="p3">OpenAPI is the clear leader when it comes to defining what is possible with our HTTP 1.1 web APIs. The tooling and service support for 2.0 demonstrates the potential, and the evolution in support for 3.0 continues to highlight the importance of services and tooling embracing the spec. We just have to figure out how to get the community moving forward in concert when it comes to moving our APIs forward across the API lifecycle. I am not looking for huge amounts of time from you, just for those of you who are already doing interesting things to step up and share your thoughts. I am pretty convinced that once we get others knowing about what you are up to, or the ideas you have about growing the community, that others will step up to help beat the drum and tell stories too. Anyways, ping me directly with ideas, or tune in each Friday to the discussion, and make your voice heard. I look forward to seeing you all there.</p>

<p>title: ‘I Started API Evangelist 10 Years Ago’</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-logos/api-evangelist-butterfly-vertical.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p3">I started planning API Evangelist in July of 2010 after I saw what was happening with APIs being used in the cloud, and powering mobile applications. By September I had a plan in place, and I figured out a name, bought a domain, and had established my approach to researching what was going on with web APIs. Ten years later I am still doing the work, and even though I&rsquo;ve managed to burn out a couple of times, have had life get I&rsquo;m the way, and more recently joined Postman as their Chief Evangelist, I am still beating the drum after all these years. I have learned a lot over the last decade. I don&rsquo;t see APIs as good, nor bad, nor neutral anymore&mdash;they are as good or bad as whoever is wielding them, which with the lax security and ethics of most companies, it isn't always the API provider inflicting the most damage to the ecosystem. APIs leave me very concerned most days. I am not very keen on building and owning production APIs in the current online world, but I am happy to stay in tune with how the machine works, help evangelize for some ethics and sanity in how we use them, and hopefully be somewhat of a voice of reason in the space, even if I am still doing a significant amount of selling of the concept, and perpetuating of the myths.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>The Only Thing That Has Changed Is That There Are More APIs</h3>
<p class="p3">There really hasn&rsquo;t been any seismic shifts in the API landscape during my 10 years of studying what is going on. 80% of what occurs across the API lifecycle was going on in 2010. There are just more people doing it. Sure, there are a few new tricks and tools, but for the most part the APIs in 2020 are just like they were in 2010, it is just more mainstream companies doing them now, as well as each wave of startups. I&rsquo;d like to say that people are doing APIs better than they were in 2010, but that really isn&rsquo;t the case. There are a handful of companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies who get it, and who are pushing the API conversation forward in interesting ways, but mostly people are just doing them without a real strategy or vision for the future (or remembering of the past). Ultimately I don&rsquo;t think this reflects good or bad on APIs as a technology, it is more about the state of business than it is about the state of technology.</p>
<h3>I Find People Are Not Always Interested in Doing APIs Well</h3>
<p class="p3">Most people I talk to just want to be shown how to do APIs. Like it is something you are just shown once, and then you do exactly the same way for each API moving forward. People aren&rsquo;t overly concerned with doing them well, which to me means we need to do a better job providing templates, tooling, and other plug and play solutions, otherwise we are going to keep seeing the insane mix of API chaos that has been unfolding over the last decade. I am all for helping increase the amount of API educational content that is available, and pushing up API literacy levels amongst developer and business stakeholders, but a core group of API service providers is going to have to come together and keep investing in standards like OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and AsyncAPI, as well as open source tooling and services that leverage these specifications, if we expect to make any forward motion. Let&rsquo;s educate the API providers and consumers the best we can, but the industry is going to have to come together on the specs and tooling if we are going to keep ratcheting things up, and stabilizing the API economy to meet the needs of the wider economy.</p>
<h3>People Do Will Never Care About APIs As Much As I Do</h3>
<p class="p3">I have come to terms with the fact that people do not care about APIs as much as I do. I am ok with people thinking I am pro-API, and an API technology solutionist. Once you sit down with me and understand why I evangelize APIs most people change their tune. I am not cheerleading using APIs in every situation, I am evangelizing that we keep the pipes (APIs) of all this web, mobile, and device activity as observable by the grownups as we possibly can, while also protecting the privacy and security of end-users. I am not saying let&rsquo;s do APIs! I am saying, if we are going to do APIs, let&rsquo;s do them sensibly. Let&rsquo;s make sure they are in service of our end-users and customers, and not just the platform, developers, or the crazy ways that foreign and bad actors are manipulating our online worlds today. I do not stay in the API business because I want you to buy my API, or my API service. I stay in the API business because I understand how the pipes just below our personal and professional worlds work, and I want to help make things less exploitative. In this light, it is hard for me to full grasp why most people will never care about APIs as much as I do, but I keep trudging forward.</p>
<h3>Regulation for the Tech Industry is Coming and APIs Are Essential</h3>
<p class="p3">Like any new industry the world of technology has been largely unregulated, creating a couple of waves of unrestrained growth online over the last 25 years, but like other newborn sectors regulation is coming for the tech industry, and APIs will continue to play a role in how technology ends up being regulated internally and externally. It is coming, and the companies who embrace it will do better than the ones who do not. APIs are the pipes behind the web, mobile, and device applications that regulators will be looking to keep an eye on, and are a natural fit for helping keep platforms observable for a wide variety of stakeholders. APIs are how tech platforms open up data, content, media, and algorithms for their own apps, as well as those of partners, 3rd party developers, and in the &ldquo;service of end-users&rdquo;. When done right APIs can help strike a balance between a platform, partners, 3rd party developers, and the end-users of applications that are made available via a platform. It is natural for regulators to just inject a layer here, at the existing gateway or management layer of what is already going on. It is also how 3rd party auditors and researchers will obtain the access they need to make sense of what is going on across massive platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube. All we need is some policy that helps map out this evolution in how we regulate business in a digital world, and some will amongst politicians to actually make it happen.</p>
<h3>I Will Just Keep Saying the Same Thing Over and Over</h3>
<p class="p3">I have definitely got more polished in how I speak over the last ten years, but looking back through the blog I am still pretty much saying many of the same things I was writing about in 2010 and 2011. I have become more aware of the business and politics behind the API sector, and I have gotten more opinionated in what I say, but I am pretty much saying the same thing over and over while doing all of this API blah blah blah. Honestly I don&rsquo;t think there is one original thing I have contributed to the discussion. All I am doing is learning from others and evangelizing the best of what I am seeing, and push back on what I do not think is healthy. Ironically there really doesn&rsquo;t have to be much innovation involved, it really is about doing more of what we already know works. The challenge is helping individual see this instead of the latest shiny object and trend, and invest in what matters the most, which is usually pretty mundane and boring. I guess my mission is to keep finding new and interesting ways to say some of the old things over again, and help people learn the same old healthy patterns while thinking they are doing something new. This is really one of the hard parts of it for me is to keep getting up each day to only say the same old things I&rsquo;ve been spouting for the last ten years. Sometimes I just can&rsquo;t do it. Well, I can usually pull something together, but I can&rsquo;t always do it with the passion I&rsquo;ve had in the past.</p>
<h3>I Am Finding Renewed Energy For Helping Push the Conversation Forward</h3>
<p class="p3">I am not as naive as I was in early days of API Evangelist. I&rsquo;ve given up my delusions of making change and &ldquo;doing good&rdquo;. I learned along the way that that was more about me, than it was about APIs. I have a much more pragmatic view of things these, and while I still get all worked up about things sometimes, I am finding it doesn&rsquo;t push me over the edge like it used to. One other thing that has changed, is I have a regular paycheck now. Not having to hustle for the rent, and travel around the world without a credit card does wonders for helping one find balance. All of this combined has helped me find renewed energy for another decade long push of everything API. This combined with a renewed will to invest Ventura capital into the world of APIs, gives me fuel. I work at one of the leading API service and tooling providers, and APIs have become something all companies are doing, not just a few leading tech companies. I am pretty optimistic that we can stir things up again to levels we saw in 2012 through 2015. I think we can go even further when it comes to discussions around how to do APIs well, and how to do them in more observable ways that benefits everyone. I also think I will continue see just as much exploitation at the API level as we&rsquo;ve seen in the last decade, but I think I am in a better position to call these things out. I am excited for the API conversations in the next decade because I think the stakes are going to get even higher in a COVID-19 world, and we will be forced to get more honest about security, privacy, and how all the money flows behind the biggest of the online platforms. No matter what unfolds, I&rsquo;m looking to stick around another decade and help stir the pot, and provide some wisdom to help keep the conversation grounded.</p>
<h3>I Am Happy That I Chose To Do API Evangelist in 2010</h3>
<p class="p3">Sometimes I have fleeting moments where I think API Evangelist was a waste of time, and I should have been doing something else that wasn&rsquo;t on the Internet. The other 95% of the time I am pretty happy that I chose to do what I did. I know I have made my mark on the conversation. I have helped evolve my own understanding of what is going beneath all of the applications we depend on each day, while also working to amplify the voices of others. The API Evangelist persona has allowed me to go beyond what I am capable of as an individual. It has provided me with a muse for thinking about how technology impacts our lives. It has given me a voice to be significantly more outspoken and opinionated about what is going on. During the last ten years it was important to me that my name was associated with what I was saying, but I&rsquo;m well on my toward keeping this theater in the API Evangelist realm, and making Kin Lane more about me personally. The problem is I have to develop some hobbies and things that are not APIs, which in a COVID-19 world can be pretty challenging. While I may not have it completely dialed in, in 2020 I think I am doing better at balancing who I am as an individual, and the writing and storytelling I do as the API Evangelist, which means I need to turn off the work in the evenings and on the weekends when possible. Otherwise Kin is a pretty dull, boring, and less happy individual.</p>

<p>It has been a wild ride. I must admit. I am going through each year of my blog looking for what I&rsquo;d consider to be my best work. Then I am going to compile into a single collection. My great hits 2010 through 2020. It is a lot of work to look through all of these posts. I have written around 4K blog posts on API Evangelist over the years, and most of it is just like reading from my notebook&mdash;things aren&rsquo;t always full baked, and my mind is moving pretty fast. However, occasionally I am able to find some clarity and focus that still blows me away after all these years. Leaving me pretty proud of what I have written over the years. I think most of it some people are embarrassed about what I am willing to publish on my blog, but I am more familiar with the process and realize that some of the posts are just me practicing and learning to speak, where others are the result of my hard work. API Evangelist is just my research notebook for the years between 2010 and 2020. It wasn&rsquo;t meant to be a blog like ProgrammableWeb, TechCrunch, or other popular tech blogs. It is meant to just be a reflection of what I am seeing and learning from across the space. It is meant to be place where I capture my thoughts on what is going on so that I can look it up later. It was often times the exhaust from work I am doing for a particular company, organization, institution, or government agency. It was me talking publicly about questions I have received from people via email and direct message. API Evangelist is very much my stream of consciousness about the digital currents flowing around me on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="p3">I work hard to keep my personal life separate from API Evangelist, but it just hasn&rsquo;t always been possible over the years. My life experiences are the well spring for my writing here, and the API community has been my well spring for the last decade. The community stepped up and supported me when I left for the summer of 2016, and that continues to be supportive of my work in 2020. I know there are people who don&rsquo;t fully respect me because of my grammatical errors on the blog (unforgivable), my politics and opinions, and that I wear my mental health on my sleeve. That is OK. Most of them do not know me personally, or had the chance to work with me. I have no regrets about the stories I have told here on the blog, and have only taken down one post over the years. I feel pretty accomplished after a decade. While I still have so much to learn, I feel like I know my shit. I can jump into discussions at almost any level and tread water, and contribute to the conversation, from the startup up to the enterprise and government levels. People in the industry tend to know who I am, even if they don&rsquo;t always understand or like me. That is OK. I don&rsquo;t always understand or like them. Ultimately I am hoping I can continue to make my mark more as the Chief Evangelist of Postman, while also still maintaining the stake I have claimed as the API Evangelist. I am looking to parlay both roles into something involving API policy at the global, federal, state, and municipal levels. I am looking to build on my work in Washington DC, and in Europe, and continue to help influence tech policy using APIs. Regardless of where the next decade takes me, I am ready for another marathon run evangelizing why APIs matter, and how they are influencing our personal and professional lives in some prounfoud ways each and every day.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_06_29_at_2.12.34_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.apidays.co/interface">I am speaking tomorrow at 1PM Pacific time about using Postman collections and environments to define and power the API lifecycle at apidays INTERFACE</a>. I am stoked that I get to have a dream job where I get paid to push forward ideas at this level, and wanted to share some of the ways I am using OpenAPI in conjunction with Postman collections and environments to define then execute across the API lifecycle for a variety of APIs. My talk is going to walk through the relationship between an OpenAPI and collections, but also begin pushing forward the notion of what collections are for, while also demonstrating that environments can be used for much more than just a place to put your API tokens and keys.</p>
<p class="p1">Most developers know that you can use a Postman collection to store the details of an API you want to make requests to, helping you keep track of the all the details of each request and response. Developers have tons of these collections laying around, sometimes organized by personal and team workspaces. Developers are also using Postman environments to abstract away keys, tokens, and other key / values pairs that can be used across one or many collections. What most developers do not know is that you can use collections and environments to also deploy and manage your API across multiple stops along the API lifecycle, while also using them to measure and govern what is going with each API as it moves forward across a standardized API life cycle. My talk at APIdays INTERFACE is focused on this evolution in how Postman collections and environments can be applied to not just defining APIs, but also defining the API lifecycle.</p>
<h3>API Lifecycle Foundation</h3>
<p class="p1">To help ground each API I am developing I establish a strong foundation for moving each API forward, providing me with a layer I can use for delivering every other stop along the API lifecycle, consistently delivering APIs at scale.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Dedicated Workspaces </strong>- I establish a dedicated workspace for each domain, providing a single place to discover, collaborate, monitor, and run all artifacts that will be used to move each API forward across the API lifecycle.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>OpenAPIs&nbsp; Contracts </strong>- Well crafted OpenAPI definitions are the core of each API I am moving forward throughout the AjPI lifecycle, providing a single contract for of the APIs being developed, staged, and delivered into production.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Synced to GitHub </strong>- Every API contract is synced to GitHub. If I make any changes to the OpenAPI in Postman it shows in GitHub, and if anyone makes changes to it in GitHub, the changes show in my Postman, keeping us on same page.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is the base for each of my APIs, which will be used to stabilize the development and delivery of each API. Providing a solid foundation for how we define and operate each API, but also consistency collaborate across the API lifecycle across many different teams, from different parts of the organization.</p>
<h3>Core Collections</h3>
<p class="p1">Each domain workspace is setup to move a single, or a set of APIs forward, possessing a single set of API collections that I can use move the conversation around each API forward. Providing a set of collections that are derived from the OpenAPI truth, but used to power different stops along the API life cycle, demonstrating how collections can be used to do more than just store all of your API calls.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Documentation</strong> - There is a single collection used to publish documentation for the API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Mock Servers</strong> - There is a single collection that provides the definition for mock servers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Testing</strong> 
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Contract Tests</strong> - There is a single collection dedicated to testing the contract of an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Performance Tests</strong> - There is a single collection for testing the performance of an API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Security Testing</strong> -<span>&nbsp; </span>There is a single collection for security testing of each of the API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These collections exist for every one of the APIs I am moving forward. Living within the dedicated workspace that I have setup for each domain. These collections may have some standardized patterns, but are generated from the OpenAPI contract defined for each API, then evolved and validated as separate drivers for each stop along the API lifecycle.</p>
<h3>Operational Collections</h3>
<p class="p1">Everything I have shown you so far isn&rsquo;t that ground breaking. These are some pretty standard patterns that Postman sees across it&rsquo;s more advanced users. However, my job as the Chief Evangelist at Postman is all about pushing this conversation forward, and I will be showcasing how I am defining next generation collections that will deliver on other stops along the API life cycle.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Deployment</strong> - Utilizing collections to execute and report on the deployment of APIs and their pipelines.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Management</strong> - Having collections that provide you insight and control into the management layer.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Governance</strong> - Using collections to define governance in a modular way that can be used across Apis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These collections do not live within each domain workspace, and are managed centrally as part of an operational workspace. They are not generated or tailored to each individual API. They are defined as part of a wider organizational API operations strategy, and then get shared to each workspace when they are being applied. Providing a standardized way to govern how APIs are delivered across an organization.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_06_29_at_2.12.51_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<h3>Environments</h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="p1">Lastly I want to demonstrate how Postman environments can be used to abstract away tokens, keys, and other key/value pairs, but also be something that can help mange the evolution of an API from development to production, but also the ongoing management and governance of each API using a common strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Development</strong> - Having an environment for the development stage.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Production</strong> - Having an environment for the production stage.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Deployment</strong> - Tracking deployment and pipeline details in environment.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Management</strong> - Publish the management layer of contract to environment.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Governance</strong> - Define, measure, and report upon governance across the lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Environments are the critical artifact needed to not just define the API lifecycle, but are used to execute and deliver across it. When it comes to the API lifecycle you can&rsquo;t manage and report upon what you can&rsquo;t define, and Postman environments are increasingly how you define both the provider and consumer dimensions of the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Defining and Powering the API Lifecycle</strong></h3>
<p class="p1">This is my most recent attempt to help quantify what the API lifecycle is. Helping make the API lifecycle more tangible and meaningful to stakeholders is what I&rsquo;ve been doing as the API Evangelist, but also what I am now doing as the Chief Evangelist at Postman. For me, collections and environments represent the gears we will be using to execute upon the API lifecycle at scale across our organizations. In the last six months I have finally been able to see the relationship between OpenAPI and Postman collections, as well as the critical role that Postman environments play across the API lifecycle. Finally getting me to a place I have been working towards for the last ten years, allowing me to quantify, measure, adjust, communication, report, and collaborate on the API lifecycle.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are keen on learning more, <a href="https://www.apidays.co/interface">join me 1PM tomorrow for my using Postman collections and environments to define and power the API lifecycle at apidays INTERFACE</a>. Hopefully it will provide you with a glimpse into not just how I am defining collections and environments, but also how Postman customers are pushing forward the notion of what collections and environments are used for. Realizing that Postman isn&rsquo;t just an HTTP client for testing APIs, but a platform that you can use to define and deliver your APIs, as well as put them to work once they are ready for prime time. I look forward to seeing everyone online tomorrow for apidays INTERFACE, and if you have specific things you&rsquo;d like me to focus on, feel free to tweet at me before the event and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. See y&rsquo;all tomorrow!</p>

<hr />

<p class="p1">My head is swirling from a flurry of exciting meetings around what different Postman features are being worked on currently. I can&rsquo;t speak directly on the features until they are released, but I am keen on pushing forward my understanding of the stops along the API lifecycle being served so that I can be articulate in meetings, while also helping light the fire under my readers imagination about what is possible with APIs. Today my head is moving very rapidly across the types of APIs I am producing or seeing produced, as well as the variety of approaches employed to bring these APIs to life&mdash;spanning from simple mocking of an API to full blow deployment of APIs at scale across multiple platforms, frameworks, and languages. I am thinking the overlap between examples I used in my APIs, how I mock with these examples, then evolve them into more static, synthetic, and dynamic mock implementations, or even possibly how these APIs then become real world production deployments.</p>
<p class="p1">Currently you can mock your APIs with a variety of services, including Postman. I have also played around with a variety of ways to deploy APIs from an OpenAPI using Postman. I am looking for ways to help better quantify, visualize, and understand the different types of data we are making available via APIs, how those APIs are defined, hardened, and scaled, as well as documented and immediately accessible via a client like Postman.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I do not have the first clue in how to map this out as a single visualization or coherent narrative, but that won&rsquo;t stop me from trying. Here are the dimensions I am working within, trying to define some sort of Venn diagram regarding how they work in concert. I can&rsquo;t quite see it all yet, but this post is designed to help me bring it more into focus. I am trying to put these in order of need, but it is very difficult when they aren&rsquo;t a constant for all APIs, but here is my working list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong> - I have a YAML or JSON example of the data I working with, which I would like to turn into any API, and make available for use in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>Schema</strong> - I can take the examples that I have and turn them into JSON schema for modeling my API, and to be used as part of the validation of the APIs I am developing.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - With my examples and schema I can get to work defining the paths, parameters and other details of the requests that can be made to APIs I will be providing.</li>
<li><strong>Mocks</strong> - Next, I need to be able to mock the APIs I have defined using OpenAPI, providing a quick way to generate a simple representation of the API I am looking to build.</li>
<li><strong>Static</strong> - Many of my APIs will only need a static representation of each endpoint, taking simple examples I provide and returning them to demonstrate what will occur in production.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> - Occasionally I need to go further and provide dynamic representations fo ray mocked endpoints, generating different responses, and going further to mimic production.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic</strong> - Sometimes I need to go further by actually generating and providing synthetic data as part of my mocked API responses helping make it as real world as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - In some situations I may be actually using mocked APIs to publish real world data for testing and other purposes, even considering many of these APIs ready for production.</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong> - Many will be deployed as simple data APIs, but many will evolve to contain standardized or custom code delivering upon specific functions that are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Frameworks</strong> - In preparation for deployment I may need a framework to be deployed and code generated to deploy each API using a specific API framework as scaffolding.</li>
<li><strong>Gateway</strong> - In preparation for deployment I may need to deploy to a gateway, using the APIs definition as the set of instructions for the gateway to following when deploying.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong> - Any combination of the previous steps will be used to actually deploy each API into developing, staging, and production environments, showing the many ways APIs are brought to life.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - As part of this process I always want up to date documentation produced from the OpenAPI definition, examples, and other artifacts that are produced.</li>
<li><strong>Collection</strong> - From the OpenAPI truth there should be a generated, ready to go collection that can be published along with documentation and used by developers to call an API.</li>
<li><strong>Client</strong> - Of course this narrative is going to end at me being able to actually make calls to, debug, and work with the responses I am getting back from each of the APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">While I have worked with each of these layers for years, I am still working to refine how I talk about them. I am also working to try and visualize how they work together. While not all APIs will employ all of these layers, some of them are essential, and developers should be aware of the different approaches to designing APIs, but also knowing that sometimes a static API deployment of simple data is perfectly adequate for some implementations. It is common for many APIs to never evolve beyond simple Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. I feel like CRUD gets a bad reputation because there isn&rsquo;t much design love that goes into them, but I think in reality CRUD gets the job done for many folks. I am just working to help folks better understand the different layers, be equipped to have a conversation about them, and know when to apply them in their everyday work.</p>
<p class="p1">One things that really fascinates me here is the line between a dynamic mock API and an actual API deployment. There really isn&rsquo;t much difference between a static mock and a simple read only data API, the only difference is with a static mock API you&rsquo;d call the data being returned &ldquo;examples&rdquo;, where with the data API that would be the actual data. Then as I push my mock APIs to be more dynamic, where is the line to cross when I am really just better off deploying my API? How much work am I putting into mock infrastructure, over just putting that work into deploying an actual API. Honestly, I feel like it comes down to your process and workflow, and what your expectations are of a production API. I would say the biggest kink the API narrative e comes in when you start needing logic behind your APIs, and have to begin adding functions and custom code. Everything else is pretty straightforward and structured, lending itself to easy generation and validation, but everyone always hits the point where you need more than schema and CRUD will get you.</p>
<p class="p1">I am going to keep noodling on this one. I am stuck on this line between mock and deployment right now. I am also stuck between reality on the ground at enterprise organizations and the right way of doing things. I am determined to better define the API deployment process and bring it out of the shadows with some clearly defined steps, while also working to identify the common API deploy patterns that exist within the enterprise. While I am eager to flesh out what the best practices are when it comes to deploying many different types of APIs, I am also painfully aware that not everyone will get to adopt best practices on the ground with their organizations, as they are just expected to get a job done. I am looking for quick examples of how API development teams can be changing their behavior in incremental ways to be more successful in what they are trying to do. I am also very interested in shining a light into the world of API deployment at the enterprise level because historically it is a process that many organizations keep to themselves, and isn&rsquo;t something very many API service providers have historically helped out with. There is a lot to learn at this layer, and seismic shifts coming in the next ten years when it comes to how we deploy API infrastructure.</p>

<p class="p1">I spent the last week looking through open source tooling built around leading API specifications. If you are tuned into the RSS or Twitter feed from this blog you probably saw the exhaust from my research. People who don&rsquo;t understand what API Evangelist is about often see these as listicle posts, and are confused by my erratic scheduling and release of these posts. If you understand that API Evangelist isn&rsquo;t a tech blog in the normal sense, and that it is my professional API workbench, then you understand I am often times working towards some sort of research goal with each post. Well, this post is the next step in that research, taking me 12 separate research sprints to look through the API specification layer of our industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">I am very interested in the top open source tools developed on top of these API specifications. However, I am also very interested in understanding how each of these tools contribute value to different stops along the API life cycle. These are the essential building blocks I identify to help me understand what people on the ground within organizations are needing when it comes to delivering APIs. Resulting in a pretty interesting list of capabilities, which are ordered based upon the frequency they are mentioned across all to the tooling for each of these dimensions. The results of this research is all pulled from GitHub, so I recognize it is an incomplete snapshot, but I still see it as the most representative source we have from across the API industry of how people are investing across the API life cycle.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p1">Some of these words are more meaningful and precise than others, but their order tells a pretty compelling story. It tells me what the priorities are for organizations across the API life cycle, but it also shows me where the challenges and opportunities are when it comes to realizing a diverse API toolbox across an organization. Demonstrating how more mature organizations who have been on their API journey for a lot longer are investing in multiple protocols and patterns across their operations. Fully understanding the HTTP 1.1 is the dominant protocol, and request / response is the leading pattern, but that many more mature organizations are operating across multiple protocols, and are investing in more event-driven and real-time approaches to putting APIs to work. This open source blueprint represents the diverse API toolbox I began talking about a couple years back, coming into focus for me just a little bit more.</p>
<p class="p1">I have over 100K open source repositories referenced as part of this research. I&rsquo;m working on a more intelligent and efficient tagging mechanism to apply across this corpus of data. As part of these last few sprints I hand curated some of what I see as the top tooling providers in each of these communities. Next I will consider the innovation that is occurring in the long tail of it all, but I am eager to identify what some of the most obvious opportunities are across this landscape. Concepts like management and testing for event-driven APIs, or multi-protocol orchestration using common API definitions that use OpenAPI and AsycAPI. Lots of work ahead. I just wanted to take a breather and dump this view of the landscape to help articulate what I am seeing unfold across teh API landscape.</p>

<p>Continuing my journey through all of the leading API specifications I pulled the top open source projects that I could find via via the GitHub API. Pulling the cream off the top of what is being built, allowing me to loosely organize them by stop along the API life cycle. Resulting in an interesting mix of open source tools in a variety of languages, and platforms.</p>

<p>I am pretty new to Thrift. I'm a data guy, but never got much production experience in the big data wave of things. With that said, I think there is a wealth of interesting patterns to assess when it comes to the Thrift community. The overlap with Avro, Protocol Buffers, and relevance when iti comes to message-driven, and event-driven makes it something worth staying in tune with.</p>

<p>RAML is a pretty concise set of tools. For this research I was just looking at the top tier of RAML tooling, but resulted in a pretty solid stack of solutions. I am working to better understand who is building on RAML, but also what problems they are looking to solve. Since Postman supports RAML, as well as OpenAPI and Swagger, it makes sense to be understanding what is going on within this neck of the woods.</p>

<p>It is tought to organize these and make sense of what each tool is doing. Protocol buffers get used in similar ways to OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and other formats, but how tooling gets build can be a little different. I'll keep going through these and tagging them, helping me make sense of what is happening. I am just looking to get a better handle on what is going on, and how Protocol Buffers are being put to work across the API space.</p>

<p>I am picking up my research into the open source tooling that is built around the common API specifications, and after looking at Postman collections, OpenAPI, Swagger, GraphQL, and gRPC, I wanted to look at JSON Schema. OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and others use JSON Schema, and the ways in which JSON is used applies acros sthe API lifecycle. Here is the cream off the top of the open source tooling that I found being built on top of JSON Schema--providing another interesting dimension of what is happening.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how forms is one of the top areas of investment, then of course validation. I am very interested in the long tail of query languages, registries, documentation and others. I still have a few more of these top API specification listings to do, and then I'll move on to better understand the long tail of what is being built, as well as where the opportunity and challenges lie in moving forward the API conversation at scale using open source tooling.</p>

<p>Like JSON Schema, Avro is a very data centric specification. I need to better understand how it is used by leading providers like Confluent for powering Kafka, but I also want to better understand its relationship to JSON Schema, and how it is used for AsyncAPI and OpenAPI. This dive provided me with a fresh look at how the API space is evolving, and also how data and our databases are still king when it comes to everything API.</p>

The event-driven and message-driven API specification is sitll fairly new so the community isn’t nearly the size of OpenAPI or Swagger, but there is plenty of insights to mine from what is being built. Here is the list I have compiled so far when it comes to AsyncAPI, something I’ve grouped, but will keep adding to and evolving as I continue this work.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The number of GitHub action tools I find interesting. I see many of the patterns emerging in the AsyncAPI community that I have seen in the Swagger and OpenAPI communities. I also see some things that are different because the types of APIs being defined are different. This is one of the open source communities I will definitely be keen on mapping out over time to help me better understand where things are going.</p>

Once, one of the more promising API specifications leading the API design first charge, post acquisition there isn't a whole lot of forward motion. However, API Blueprint still provides a pretty compelling view of the landscape, and is worth tuning into to understand what is happening.

<p>The tooliing available around API Blueprint provides a minmalist view at what is needed when it comes to the APII lifecycle. It is the basics of what you need to be API-first. If the specification hadn't been acquired as part of the Oracle acquisition of Apiary, the tooling would have continued to evolve. While not a leading contender in the space, I still look back at API Blueprint with.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/braceros-domingo-ulloa-working-on-railroad-1.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" />&lt;p&gt;I am getting time to map out the diverse API toolbox landscape I see unfolding lately. I am aggregating the most used open source projects across the leading API specifications in use. While gRPC is more of a style or pattern than it is a specification–it is a fast growing standard. I’ll be doing a separate analytics of Protocol Buffers, but I wanted to look at the cream on top of what is being build within the gRPC community. Revealizing almost a hundred open source tools loosely organized by what they deliver as part of the API lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>gRPC provides a pretty compelling look at what is next. I'd say some of the stops along the API lifecycle are pretty forward leaning. I'd also say there are some clear opportunities present here when it comes to database, testing, and other areas. I am interested in the tooling being developed to support gRPC APIs, but more I am very interested in these different stops along the API lifecycle that are being serviced using open source tooling. This only reflects what is published to GitHub, but I think it does provide a pretty compelling look at what the future of APIs looks like.</p>

<p>I have done several dives into the world of GraphQL. As part of some API specification work I am not getting another chance to look at what the open source community around GraphQL looks like. Along with other API specifications in our modern API toolbox, I am looking at how GraphQL is being leverage, and what the motivations are behind the open source tooling that has emerged.

<p>Similar to my snapshots of OpenAPI, Swagger, Postman, and gRPC, I think that GraphQL paints an interesting picture. Of course, this is just a look at what open source is available on GitHub, but it still provides an interesting look at what is important to GraphQL providers and consumers. I am going to keep making my way through each dimension of the API specification landscape, identifying the top tooling that exists. Once I get through it all I will do more side by side comparison of what is going on, looking for the challenges and opportunities when it comes to open source tooling as part of a diverse API toolbox.</p>

<p>I am finally finding time to pick up some old work quantifying the open source that has risen up around API specifications. I just pulled all the GitHub repos when you search for "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/06/08/the-open-source-community-tooling-built-on-postman/">Postman</a>" and "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/06/08/the-open-source-community-tooling-built-on-openapi/">OpenAPI</a>", and now I wanted to do "Swagger". I'm looking to evaluate the cream off the top of what is going on in each of these buckets, but also eventually evaluate the long tail of what is going on. I've been trying to understand the evolution of Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0 from a tooling perspective for some time now--this is me getting a handle on what is happening. Here is the top repositories when you search for "Swagger" on GitHub, roughly broken down by the stops along the API lifecycle they are serving.</p>

<p>It is tough to organize these because so many of them overlap. Deployment is definitely top heavy because there are tools in there that deploy APIs, but then publish documentation from a generated Swagger 2.0 document. Where others actually generate your API from a Swagger 2.0. There are many paradoxes in here like that, but I am going to keep organizing and refining my view of the landscape. Each of these tools are relevant, but I am very interested in getting a better lay of the landing when it comes to all of the specifications. Since Postman speaks collection, Swagger, and OpenAPI, all of these slices of the API matter to my perspective of what is going on.</p>

<p>I am finally finding time to pick up some old work quantifying the open source that has risen up around API specifications. I am pulling all of the open source tooling available on GitHub when you search for "Postman". A portion of this is open source by Postman, others are collections built by API providers helping developers on-board more quickly, but there is another set of tooling that builds on top of the concept of Postman collection as a specification. Providing an interesting look at what developers are wanting when it comes to integrating the Postman platform into their oeprations. I have a longer list of everything, but here is the cream off the top.</p>

<p>I am interested in learning more about each of these open source tools, and learn about what their road map looks like. I am also interested in thinking about each of these areas, and how I can further incentivize innovation in each of these areas. Next I am going to look for other open source tooling within these areas that might not be operating on GitHub. I am also going to do a diff against similar efforts to quantify the open source tooling within OpenAPI, RAML, Swagger, GraphQL, and other layers of the API economy. I am going to publish each of these as snapshots here on the blog, but then brainstorm how I can also publish it as an open source project that others can add to and fork for their own purposes. Right now, I am just working to get a handle on what is going on, while also spending some time defining the landscape a little better for other people I am talking with.</p>

<p>I am finally finding time to pick up some old work quantifying the open source that has risen up around API specifications. I am pulling all of the open source tooling available on GitHub when you search for "OpenAPI".<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/06/08/the-open-source-community-tooling-built-on-postman/"> I just published the same assessment of searching for "Postman"</a>, but since Postman's API builder is centered around OpenAPI, it makes sense to do the same for OpenAPI. I'm looking to develop a understanding with many of the tooling provider listed here, but I am also looking to understand what developers are needing when it comes to OpenAPI. I have gone through the cream off the top of the search for "OpenAPI" on GitHub and here is what I have come up with so far.</p>

<p>OpenAPI definitely has more expanded stops along the API lifecycle being serviced here than Postman does. This is partially due to the momentum OpenAPI has from it's own evolution from Swagger, but it also has to do with the fact that you can import OpenAPI into Postman. For me, OpenAPI is how you define what the API can do, and Postman collections are how you do it. Next, I am going to take a look at Swagger, and I think my view of the landscape will be significantly increased in ways I didn't anticipate, and I will see other ways in which we still need to see investment in OpenAPI, as well as Postman collections.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">I had begun playing around with the concept of API brokers back in 2014</a>, and it is something that is recurring and evolving in a handful of the conversations I am having in the Postman ecosystem lately. API brokering is the concept that instead of developers directly engaging with all of the public APIs they will ned for an application, that a professional API broker could discover, sign-up, setup applications, and aggregate documentation, client libraries, and other essential items for developers. So all an application developer has to do is fire up a workspace, and they have all the docs, code, keys, and other elements ready to go for them to just start building. Saving an organization time and money by outsourcing much of the tedious work involved with discovering APIs, on-boarding with them, and preparing to build an API, letting organizations focus on what they do best.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Most of my talk in the past has been conceptual around being an API broker, but now with Postman I can actually do it for realz. I can take the many different workspaces of API collections I have and use them to populate client specific workspaces. Meaning I can setup a workspace specifically for companies I know that want quick access to a variety of APIs--without the friction of on-boarding themselves. Here are the building blocks I&rsquo;ve established for my own definition of the API broker / client relationship.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>User</strong> - I am on the business plan, so I add a new slot for each of my clients, paying for their team license as part of the overall value that I am delivering to them. They use this user account whenever they are engaging with the API I am maintaining for them. I can apply appropriate roles, and terminate access whenever the relationship ends.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Workspace</strong> - I setup a single workspace for my client, allowing them to access only the API, collections, environments, tests, and other artifacts I have established for them. I can create and manage one or many workspaces to help provide ready to go API integration solutions to assist them in the applications they are developing.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Collections</strong> - Many of the collections I will be making available to clients will already be assembled and living in another workspace, so all I have to do is share them into each client workspace when they are requested. When I create new ones I will also follow this pattern, building them in a central workspace, and then sharing them to any workspace where they are needed.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Environments</strong> - This is where things get personal with each client, and we taking the secrets, tokens, and keys we&rsquo;ve gathered for them as part of the API broker relationship and we setup them up as a logical set of Postman environments. Abstracting away secrets from each collection, and allowing me as the API broker to reduce the friction of on-boarding for my customers. Making it single click for them to get up and running with each API made available via the workspace.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Feedback Loop</strong> - Each API and collection I put in a workspace has a comment feature, allowing me to create inline feedback loops around each individual API, and even specific API requests. I am still working on the best approach to doing this across many clients, but I&rsquo;m just looking to map out the basics as part of this first draft of an API broker model using the Postman platform.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Role Based Authentication and Control -</strong> Postman also has RBAC enabled at the user, workspace, collection, and now environment layers of this conversation. Allowing me to make some of the essential parts and pieces of this readonly so that things don&rsquo;t get broken along the way. Providing me with an important layer of control over the customers of my API broker business.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">That is a pretty complete formula for an API broker business. All you need is a website, email address, and you are off and running. The beauty of it, the more collections you have created, the higher your margins become with each &ldquo;client&rdquo;. With Postman you can publish aggregate documentation and code libraries along with each of the APIs being made available via a workspace--which all helps lower the total time and cost of integration, and helps a customer be more efficient and consistent in how they integrate with APIs. Ultimately, I see a wealth of new services that could emerge from these workspaces, but I think the custom delivery of a variety of API collections, complete with personalized environments is a great place to start for anyone looking to get going.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">I cam envision agencies that have multiple user accounts and workspaces for clients because they are providing ready to go API resources for a variety of applications. I need to put more thought into the business model around something like this and where you charge, and what you give away for free. I also imagine you&rsquo;d see brokers pop up in the larger, more heavily regulated industries like healthcare and banking, where you already have standardized API specifications in place, but you also have a huge market of companies looking to integrate APIs into applications. I will keep pondering the possibilities of operating an API broker agency, and publish some more stories on the topic. I just wanted to lay down the base of what I had in mind when it came to operating an API brokerage on Postman out there, preparing me for some other conversations I am having on the subject.</p>

<p class="p1">Business is anything but usual these days. I have a lot of time on my hands when it comes to writing and working online, but the reality in the chair is anything but easy. When I sit down to tackle even the most basic of tasks I can usually make it through about 50% of the work before I feel drained, and left with a blank screen for a brain. In addition to COVID-19 and the #BlackLivesMatter uprising, <a href="http://dronerecovery.org/journal/a-drone-recovery-post-to-remember-the-kid/">we also lost the kid this month</a>. Making for a swirling emotional mess of a reality that really isn&rsquo;t conducive to doing much beyond just reading a book or watching a movie. Looking through my notebook there are numerous half, or even complete stories about APIs I could be publishing, but my blank screen of a brain can&rsquo;t even properly edit them, let along grock and finish many of the API stories I was pushing forward.</p>
<p class="p1">It is difficult for me on the best day to conjure up some storytelling about APIs here on the blog. With that said, it also can be useful to lose myself thinking about some technical topics if I can find ways to convince myself that they are meaningful in these times. Technology is no replacement for direct human action, but the forces we are up against are actively wielding API-driven technology against us, and pushing back on this has always been what API Evangelist is all about. It isn&rsquo;t about just saying the Twitter API can be used for social justice, it is also about demonstrating to folks that the Twitter API is also being used to surveil and manipulate us. Pulling back the curtain on how all of this works is the cornerstone of what API Evangelist does, and I&rsquo;m determined to find ways of doing this in service of the #BlackLivesMatter uprising.</p>
<p class="p1">This is one of those &ldquo;getting back on the horse&rdquo; posts. Where I just practice using my words again, and stringing them together into somewhat coherent sentences. Often times if I just force myself, and manufacturer some sort of urgency, I can get back on the horse. To where the words just flow. This persona is too well rehearsed to be shut off all together. There are too many stories still needing told. There are many ways in which I can use APIs to push back on what is happening today. I wish APIs weren&rsquo;t the direct line of communication, surveillance, organization, and doing everything else in 2020, but they are. As much as I&rsquo;d like to step away from technology, I can&rsquo;t. I know too much about the pipes being laid to operate the public and private sector beauracracies we are seeking to cut the systemic rot out of. I know too much about the Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other APIs that are being used to organize and manipulate us. I can&rsquo;t step back even if I&rsquo;m on shaky footing.</p>
<p class="p1">Writing is essential to me making sense of things. Without it I am increasingly lost in the noise of technology. I have taken about 20 five minute breaks while writing this post. My attention span is shit to begin with, but with mush brain and such little emotional bandwidth I have to accept this amount of distraction and just staring out the window to move forward even just a couple of sentences. The kid passing has put me on severely shaky footing. COVID-19 has increased my anxiety significantly. But the #BlackLIvesMatter uprising has given me hope. I&rsquo;m hopeful that we can really begin making some meaningful system change in these times. It is work that won&rsquo;t end even once the pandemic is over. I&rsquo;m going to try and spend the weekend thinking deeply about how data and APIs can be used to push back on the machine right now. I know. I know. This sounds like techno solutions. It is. I acknowledge that. However, they are currently using data and APIs against us, so we have to at least understand these mechanisms and work to clog up the works, if not actually forcing some of the technology to serve our purposes. We can&rsquo;t dismantle the masters house with his tools, but we sure can make his smart home a living nightmare by understanding how it works.</p>

<p class="p1">Business is anything but usual these days. I have a lot of time on my hands when it comes to writing and working online, but the reality in the chair is anything but easy. When I sit down to tackle even the most basic of tasks I can usually make it through about 50% of the work before I feel drained, and left with a blank screen for a brain. In addition to COVID-19 and the #BlackLivesMatter uprising, <a href="http://dronerecovery.org/journal/a-drone-recovery-post-to-remember-the-kid/">we also lost the kid this month</a>. Making for a swirling emotional mess of a reality that really isn&rsquo;t conducive to doing much beyond just reading a book or watching a movie. Looking through my notebook there are numerous half, or even complete stories about APIs I could be publishing, but my blank screen of a brain can&rsquo;t even properly edit them, let along grock and finish many of the API stories I was pushing forward.</p>
<p class="p1">It is difficult for me on the best day to conjure up some storytelling about APIs here on the blog. With that said, it also can be useful to lose myself thinking about some technical topics if I can find ways to convince myself that they are meaningful in these times. Technology is no replacement for direct human action, but the forces we are up against are actively wielding API-driven technology against us, and pushing back on this has always been what API Evangelist is all about. It isn&rsquo;t about just saying the Twitter API can be used for social justice, it is also about demonstrating to folks that the Twitter API is also being used to surveil and manipulate us. Pulling back the curtain on how all of this works is the cornerstone of what API Evangelist does, and I&rsquo;m determined to find ways of doing this in service of the #BlackLivesMatter uprising.</p>
<p class="p1">This is one of those &ldquo;getting back on the horse&rdquo; posts. Where I just practice using my words again, and stringing them together into somewhat coherent sentences. Often times if I just force myself, and manufacturer some sort of urgency, I can get back on the horse. To where the words just flow. This persona is too well rehearsed to be shut off all together. There are too many stories still needing told. There are many ways in which I can use APIs to push back on what is happening today. I wish APIs weren&rsquo;t the direct line of communication, surveillance, organization, and doing everything else in 2020, but they are. As much as I&rsquo;d like to step away from technology, I can&rsquo;t. I know too much about the pipes being laid to operate the public and private sector beauracracies we are seeking to cut the systemic rot out of. I know too much about the Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other APIs that are being used to organize and manipulate us. I can&rsquo;t step back even if I&rsquo;m on shaky footing.</p>
<p class="p1">Writing is essential to me making sense of things. Without it I am increasingly lost in the noise of technology. I have taken about 20 five minute breaks while writing this post. My attention span is shit to begin with, but with mush brain and such little emotional bandwidth I have to accept this amount of distraction and just staring out the window to move forward even just a couple of sentences. The kid passing has put me on severely shaky footing. COVID-19 has increased my anxiety significantly. But the #BlackLIvesMatter uprising has given me hope. I&rsquo;m hopeful that we can really begin making some meaningful system change in these times. It is work that won&rsquo;t end even once the pandemic is over. I&rsquo;m going to try and spend the weekend thinking deeply about how data and APIs can be used to push back on the machine right now. I know. I know. This sounds like techno solutions. It is. I acknowledge that. However, they are currently using data and APIs against us, so we have to at least understand these mechanisms and work to clog up the works, if not actually forcing some of the technology to serve our purposes. We can&rsquo;t dismantle the masters house with his tools, but we sure can make his smart home a living nightmare by understanding how it works.</p>

<p class="p1">I am tasked with defining what sharing and collaboration means when it comes to API operations at work. I have never had a tool like Postman to help me define how we work as a team across an organization. Normally, I just do a lot of hand waving and say, &ldquo;you do it like this&rdquo;, and call it good. With Postman, I now have an opportunity to anchor what I am talking about using the current state of the Postman platform, as well as help shape the future by influencing the Postman road map.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">To help me prepare for more coherent storytelling on the Postman blog, and as part of other conversations, I want to work my way through what the core features of Postman are when it comes to sharing and collaboration. There are many levels to how you can share and collaborate within Postman, which will have different impacts on the ground within enterprise organizations. To help me map Postman functionality to the real world of API operations, I wanted to break down the different level of sharing and collaboration that exists within Postman.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Team Level</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The essential ingredient of API sharing and collaboration is a team. You just can&rsquo;t effectively share and collaborate at the provider level without a team. You can share and collaborate in spontaneous ways amongst API provider stakeholders, as well as API consumer stakeholders, but with a well defined team of stakeholders you can take sharing and collaboration to new levels. Here are a couple of the core Postman features that facilitate sharing and collaboration across API operations.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Create a Team </strong>- The act of creating a team in Postman, and upgrading your account to support the size and scope of your team is the first thing you can do to help lay a foundation that facilitates sharing and collaboration within a team, but also between teams.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Invite to a Team </strong>- The process of inviting someone to a team is one of the most meaningful sharing and collaboration steps you can take. Designating a shared space for all provider stakeholders to collaborate when it comes to defining and delivering high quality APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In Postman, teams are how organizations go from many individuals working with APIs in isolation to working together to define what APIs are all about. Well defined teams are the foundation of collaboration and sharing across the enterprise. There can be one or many teams within the enterprise organization. Developers are already using Postman across the organization, it is more just about establishing a common set of teams, and encouraging stakeholders to be more organized, thoughtful, and collaborative about how APIs are being delivered.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Workspace Level</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Workspaces in Postman help organizations draw lines throughout the legacy monolith that exists across large organizations and begin to break things down into smaller, more manageable chunks. There are a handful of sharing and collaboration features involved with workspaces, but really they are the cornerstone for sharing and collaboration across every other aspect of moving APIs forward.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Create a Team Workspace</strong> - Creating teams is setting the table for sharing and collaboration across an organization There can be as few, or as many workspaces as your organizations envision, but they should all act as hubs for how APIs are being developed and delivered across an organization, providing a single snapshot and slice of what is happening within operations.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Invite to a Workspace</strong> - Inviting a team member to a workspace should be a regular occurrence across an organization, bringing stakeholders into the conversation, and allowing teams to work together within a specific context that is defined by teams themselves.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Share a team workspace via URL </strong>- You can use the URL of a workspace to quickly identify a deliberate set of artifacts and conversations that exist for specific parts of API operations, providing a canonical URL/URI for various parts of an organization.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Team workspaces are where all API stakeholders will work to define, design, mock, document, and test APIs. You should think of team workspaces as being synonymous with GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket repositories, but specifically for API artifacts and collaboration. A workspace is how you define the bounded context of your API operations, setting the table for the collaboration that will occur in these workspaces, and the sharing that occurs between workspaces, and with the outside world.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>API Level</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Next up is the API dimension of all of this, and how sharing and collaboration occurs around specific API definitions. Providing the central truth that is being defined, designed, and then used to validate, test, and deliver across the API lifecycle. Making sure there is a well defined contract present for each API being delivered, and ensuring that it is accessible for use across operations in a human and machine readable format--providing a handful of sharing, collaboration, and sync opportunities.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Share an API via Team Workspace -</strong> You can have all of your APIs in a single workspace, and then share them out with the workspace where they are being developed, mocked, documented, tested, or other stops along the API lifecycle.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Sync OpenAPI, Swagger, RAML to GitHub</strong> - This is a really important dimension for sharing and collaborating with other services, tooling, and systems by making sure the central truth for each API is being synced to the repository of choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-paris-bookstand.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">For an API contract to be effective it has to be accessible, shareable, and iterated upon across all stakeholders. API definitions should be accessible to developers in their local workspaces, while also still being synced and made available in common workspaces and repositories. Reducing the friction that historically occurs around emailing around API snippets, artifacts, and definitions, or API assets not being accessible because they are stored locally by individual developers, or on networks that aren&rsquo;t accessible by all stakeholders.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Collection Level</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Postman collections are the essential building block of the API economy. Postman collections have emerged over the last five years as the currency for how you put APIs to work, and more importantly how you communicate and collaborate around the consumption of an API. Providing a machine readable way to define the request and response details of what each API can do, while also saving them into a single collection that can be made available to other stakeholders in a way that they can execute and achieve the same outcomes no matter where you are in the world--providing a handful of ways to share and collaborate when it comes to APIs.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Share a collection via URL -</strong> Every collection has a unique URL that anyone can use to quickly share with other individuals. Providing a simple URL / URI that references specific API-driven capabilities that can be executed as is by anyone using their own Postman client.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Share a collection via documentation - </strong>When you publish documentation a collection is also shared, making the documentation executable, and some each developer can take back to their own space and put to work on their own.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Share a collection via team workspace -</strong> Collections can be shared across different workspaces, allowing for the distribution of collection for use as part of the API lifecycle stops employed to deliver those APIs, or by consumers looking to put them to work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Collections are built for sharing and collaboration. This is why Postman has become an indispensable tool for developers. Right now many developers are using Postman collections in isolation, but once they realize that their co-workers have built many of the same collections, and they can do less work by sharing and collaborating with their team members, collections become much more about sharing and working together. Reducing the everyday workload when it comes to integrating, testing, and working with APIs across an organization.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Environment Level</strong></p>
<p class="p1">After a collection the ability to define environments that can be applied across one or many different APIs represents one of the biggest opportunities for sharing and collaborating across an organization. Environments are a fairly new concept (within the last couple of years), providing a single way to share environments across teams who are developing and consuming APIs.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Share an Environment via Team Workspace </strong>- You can make environments available across multiple workspaces, laying the foundation for how secrets, keys, and other key / value pairs are used across API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Abstracting away keys and secrets, and the variables used to create different contexts, from the collections where they are applied is essential for maximizing team interoperability and collaboration when it comes to putting APIs to work. The velocity at which your teams are able to collaborate will depend on how sophisticated your approach is to defining and putting environments to work.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Feedback Loop Level</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is one last dimension of features I wanted to throw into the mix involving the feedback loop that needs to occur around API definitions and collections. There are a handful of features available when it comes to inline commenting for both APIs and for collections.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Commenting on API </strong>- You can comment directly on each API definition, allowing for the collaboration around its evolution. Connecting many different stakeholders together when it comes to moving each definition forward.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Commenting on Collection</strong> - Like APIs, you can comment inline on individual collections. Keeping the thread around each individual collection being used to move each API forward, feeding the collaboration throughout its evolution.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Viewing History -</strong> Each workspace in Postman has a history, showing every API request made across the collections within a workspace. Providing an automated, self-service way to tune into what is happening across teams, allowing for more asynchronous collaboration.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Viewing Activity -</strong> Each workspace in Postman also has an activity log showing all the configuration, administration, and other activity that is happening when it comes to managing APIs, collections, environments, and the other building blocks of the API lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/america-immigration_dumping-ground-working-waterfront-2.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">The feedback loop is an essential part of the API sharing and collaboration process. If teams are talking, and those discussions are accessible, things move forward at a much more rapid pace. If you have to go looking around for what it's going on with an API, hunting for details, it is unlikely that they will be tuned into what's going on, and effectively collaborating with team members. If everything is available in a known location, with all developers plugged in via the tooling they already depend on, the velocity of collaboration will increase exponentially.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Bridging These Feature with the Real World</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Next I want to go beyond just looking at the Postman features. It will take me several posts to bridge what Postman offers and what is actually occurring on the ground within organizations. I want to begin mapping out how these features translate on the ground, and there are several stakeholder considerations I want to begin thinking about. Helping me think more about how these Postman features facilitate sharing and collaboration across API operations, but also how they collide with the real world. These features exist because of what the community has asked for, but they also need to be mapped to real world motivations that individuals will have on the ground within their organizations.</p>
<p class="p1">I am going to be continuing this narrative across multiple posts. I want to spend time thinking about how developers see or do not see these features, and will care, or not care about sharing and collaboration across their organizations. It is easy to say that developers should just share and collaborate, but the motivations behind doing this on the ground will vary from team to team and organization to organization. Why I share an API with one workspace and team will be different for each API, with some common patterns emerging after you are doing this work for a sustained amount of time. I&rsquo;m looking to get at the heart of why we share and collaborate which I fear is more about the business and politics of APIs, than it is about the technology of APIs, and specific features existing or not.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say one of the most controversial aspects of the world of APIs involves the places where people are used to and prefer to deal with API complexity at. After you look at thousands of APIs you begin to better understand where people introduce complexity into the design of an API, and as more people become familiar with any single approach they are much more likely to stick with it over time, bake it into their APIs, and passionately believe it is the normal pattern that everyone else is and should be using. You can see what I am talking about at the heart of the microservices debate, where the API complexity is dealt with at the API level, or in the number of APIs you have&mdash;something many increasingly are finding to be unacceptable. Another way you can see the API complexity debate unfolding across the API space is within the graphQL, where the complexity is at the schema level, and believers truly think that this is where API complexity should live. I try to not be too prescriptive on where API complexity should lie because the reasons why you want to increase or decrease the scope and complexity of an API will vary widely depending on what you are delivering with the API, the organization where it is being produced, and who will be consuming it.</p>
<h3>First, What is API Complexity?</h3>
<p>I feel like it is important to set the stage with what is complex. To provide a complicated view of what complexity can be, the definition for the complexity is,<em> &ldquo;the state or quality of being intricate or complicated&rdquo;</em>, with the definition of complicated being, <em>&ldquo;consisting of many interconnecting parts or elements; intricate.&rdquo;</em>, and the definition of intricate being,<em> &ldquo;very complicated or detailed&rdquo;</em>. ;-)&nbsp; Here are some of the questions that nag me as I think about API complexity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is complexity in each individual API instance necessary?</li>
<li>Is complexity in each individual API scenario bad?</li>
<li>Will this complexity be worked out in future versions?</li>
<li>Is this complexity by design, and used as leverage by platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t see complexity as always being bad. It can be, but quite often it is just the state of being within many enterprise organizations, and the longer you are there the more you understand the complexity and normalize it in your mind. Complexity often accumulates organically over time, but there are also many problems out there being solved using APIs where complexity is inevitable, you just have to have a plan for dealing with it. I just want to mostly set the stage that I am not saying complexity is always bad, but I feel complexity without a reason or purpose is usually bad by default.</p>
<h3>Are Your API Teams Complex?</h3>
<p>Describe your approach to defining the teams that are working on APIs within your organization. Most companies I have asked to do this for me aren't able to articulate any existing plan for how teams are assembled to deliver APIs. There are plenty of agile, and other organizational religions and dogma in place about how teams come together and operate, but there are few who think about this in the context of the API life cycle, even when teams are only developing and delivering APIs. Always leaving me with questions about API complexity at the team level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do all teams have access to basic API training?</li>
<li>Do all teams communicate around the delivery of APIs?</li>
<li>Do all teams deliver on every stop along the API life cycle?</li>
<li>Are there any teams who are specialized in any specific area?</li>
<li>Are there shared feedback loops in place across teams and APIs?</li>
<li>Are teams dedicated to building new APIs, or assigned to sustain existing APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This results in much complexity that can&rsquo;t be seen playing out throughout the development of new APIs, and sustainment of legacy APIs, produced as a kind of API entropy when there is no feedback loops, and deliberate team collaboration when it comes to doing APIs at scale across an enterprise. When operating hundreds of APIs the number and size of teams only act as magnifiers for API complexity if the teams aren&rsquo;t known, engaging via well established feedback loops, and collaborating in real-time around each API artifact and stopping along the API life cycle. Honestly, most enterprise teams I&rsquo;ve worked with do not see the API complexity debt they&rsquo;ve accrued at the team level, and it will be something they struggle with sorting out over the next decade.</p>
<h3>How Complex is Your API Workspace?</h3>
<p>After teams, I&rsquo;d say a lack of dedicated API workspaces for teams to design, develop, deliver, and manage APIs is one of the ways that API complexity is seriously amplified across operations. Sure, working locally is what every developer will want and need, but there comes a time where teams will have to work together to deliver each API. This tends to be using Git, and leveraging one or many Git repositories as the shared workspace for building APIs, and making them available to consumers. The differing opinions on API complexity at this level can be seen in the mono repo discussions you see occurring across the microservices landscape. Opening up a whole bunch of questions about like or disliking complexity at the workspace level?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you use one single repository for all of your APIs?</li>
<li>Do you create team level repos for all of a team's APIs?</li>
<li>Do you create a line of business level repos for all APIs?</li>
<li>Do you create a single repo for each individual API?</li>
<li>Do you have one to one for Postman workspaces and git repos?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on who you ask these questions you will get different answers. There is no right answer here. It depends on where you like your complexity, and being honest about where you want overhead and friction to exist. There is also additional complexity introduced when you don&rsquo;t have a plan for how developers should be setting up and building APIs, as well as no consideration for how teams collaborate across the API life cycle across workspaces. Like most of the API life cycle, if you do not have a plan in place for how you are carving out workspaces for the delivery and sustainment of APIs, the API complexity entropy increases, resulting in many unforeseen challenges downstream. The complexity of things at the workspace level is something that will be helped by the types of tools you use, helping reduce friction in context switching when you have a lot of teams and workspaces all trying to work in concert. A lack of tooling will make things cumbersome, and feel like there is friction whenever things get complex.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is the Scope of Your APIs?</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/aws-s3-stories-G0520270-blue-circuit.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule about how big or small an API is. Honestly this is one of the most damaging aspects of the microservices movement is that everyone assumes that you have to go to the smallest possible unit of value. The words we use matter. The scope of each 3rd party, and internal API will vary widely across each organization, making for a dizzying mix of what is an API. For the last five years the microservices movement has been all about embracing complexity in the number of APIs teams develop and operate. However, recently you are beginning to see significant pushback on this notion from folks who are not interested in having to manage many different APIs, citing friction with discoverability and context switching, leaving us with many questions about API complexity at this level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does an API reflect a line of business?</li>
<li>Does an API reflect all of a company&rsquo;s digital resources?</li>
<li>Does an API reflect a single digital resource?</li>
<li>Are all sub-resources broken out as individual APIs?</li>
<li>Are APIs only about partner integrations?</li>
<li>Are APIs organized based upon the applications they support?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on where you are comfortable with your API complexity you will answer these questions differently. Again, depending on whether not you have a plan, and the type of services and tooling you adopt, you will see having many different APIs as a burden or you find context switching to be an easy way to navigate many different APIs. There is no right answer to these questions. Only that these questions should be asked as you are working to define your own organizational API strategy. There are trade-offs to doing microservices, as well as operating as an API monolith. The scope of your APIs will define how fast you are able to move when developing new applications, and shape your developer on-boarding practices. API complexity at the individual API level will work in parallel with how you apply API complexity to the other levels I am highlighting here, making an API complexity discussion and strategy at your organization a pretty critical component to how you get things done.</p>
<h3>Take Many or a Single Path</h3>
<p>The API design movement over the last 5-7 years has introduced much complexity when it comes to using API paths. Having an individual resource for every digital asset across an organization, as well as a knob or dial for every enterprise capability can make for a dizzying number of API paths that consumers can take. However, this is one thing that a URL path is designed to address, as long as there is a thoughtful information architecture in place, otherwise it can become just a maze that your consumers will get lost within. There are many questions that arise as one begins crafting paths for their API consumers to follow, which can increase or decrease API complexity for consumers who are trying to put APIs to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you follow RESTful principles when it comes to defining API paths?</li>
<li>Is every object made available for integration available as an API path?</li>
<li>Do you have dedicated namespaces at the base of your path?</li>
<li>Do you use your HTTP methods consistently along with each API path?</li>
<li>Do you have an information architecture plan for use with your API?</li>
<li>Is there any relationship between your web and API implementations?</li>
</ul>
<p>The path layer has been the site of many bloody API battles over the years between linked data folks, RESTafarians, hypermedia, and folks who are just trying to do their jobs across enterprise organizations. People get very religious about his layer of API complexity. How many paths, and how you name your paths are central to REST, microservices, GraphQL, and other primary API belief systems. The types of applications you are building on top of your APIs, and who the developers of those applications are will all influence the type of complexity you embrace or resist at the API path layer. There is no way of avoiding heated debates at this layer. Your only defense when it comes to these API battles, and in dealing with API complexity at this layer is to make sure you have many conversations across teams about how they are doing it, what the tradeoffs are, and establish an organizational wide strategy for dealing with API complexity at all levels.</p>
<h3>Choosing to Query Your API Complexity</h3>
<p>Depending on how developers on-board with API development they will have different approaches to API complexity, and often times if a developer comes from the web world they will be alright with complexity at the query parameter layer. Web developers learned to hack backend systems by playing with query parameters, so this is where they have learned to embrace and accept API complexity. Other dimensions of the API stack tend to be dark and mysterious for web developers but query parameters are something they get, but injecting complexity at the query parameter level can introduce a lot of challenges for consumers, leaving a number of questions when it comes to how APIs are delivered.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many query parameters are too much?</li>
<li>Do query parameters have enumerated values?</li>
<li>Do query parameters have data types applied?</li>
<li>What limitations are there on query values passed?</li>
<li>Are there shared or common parameters across APIs?</li>
<li>Are query parameters using common words?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you embrace complexity at the query parameter layer, and develop an API this way, it will make sense to you, but depending on the words you used, and how well you document this complexity could become an obstacle for consumers. A spider web of unique, cryptic, but potentially powerful mix of query parameters will have many different possible outcomes depending on the type of API, and the community being targeted. Query parameters provide a powerful tool for turning the knobs and levers on an API, but when done in isolation it can quickly become a maze for API consumers to have to navigate when trying to understand how to put an API to work. Query parameters work best when using a shared vocabulary across not just a single APIs, but many private or public APIs, allowing all API consumers to collaborate and put APIs to work because of the shared meaning present in the query parameters we use, but is also a dictionary that will grow in complexity with each parameter we add.</p>
<h3>All Your Focus on The Request Body</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/aws-s3-stories-ellisisland-blue-circuit.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Like query parameters, developers who rely on the HTTP request body for their API complexity tend to come from the world of web development, where remote procedure calls (RPC) design patterns were adopted, as well as out of the mobile evolution of APIs that began in 2008. If a developer was introduced to APIs being about RPC, then they tend to use the body. Also, developers who evolved into the modern world of web APIs out of the enterprise SOA and SOAP era, tend to see the HTTP request body as the place you put the complexity of your API&mdash;it is all about the payload. Leaving me with many questions when it comes to adopting API complexity at this level, pushing me to be more thoughtful in how I craft my HTTP request body payload, and when I don&rsquo;t use it at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using your HTTP method in alignment with the body?</li>
<li>Do you have a plan for managing the schema used?</li>
<li>Do you define JSON schema for each of your APIs payload?</li>
<li>How many levels deep do you go with your objects in payload?</li>
<li>Do you offer multiple media types (ie. JSON or XML) for the body?</li>
<li>What is the relationship with your body and the API path?</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience people who lean on the request body for their complexity are making the transition to event-driven and message-driven approaches to delivering APIs. They don&rsquo;t see any value in complexity at other layers, and the message in the body is really the value. HTTP is just a transport, and these developers aren&rsquo;t really interested in the nuance of HTTP. The GraphQL folks also operate here believing that complexity shouldn&rsquo;t exist at the API or path level, and it should be all about the schema at the body, and response layers&mdash;ignoring the benefits of HTTP and focusing on giving API consumers all the controls they need over the request and the response of each API integration. Demonstrating that API complexity is not just up to the API producer, but is also something that gets dictated by the API consumer. Further expanding how we think about API complexity, and who holds the power when it comes to dictating where API complexity exists, but whether it should exist at all.</p>
<h3>All API Complexity Trickles Down to the Response</h3>
<p>The final place developers love their complexity is at the response layer, and the robustness of the schema being returned. As mentioned above the GraphQL folks enjoy complexity at the query parameter and request body levels because it gives them the control they desire over complexity at the API response layer. Complexity exists at this layer though dogma that exists at other layers. How someone views API design practices and the number of API paths will exponentially increase the complexity at the API response layer. Harder core developers see complexity in the XML or JSON responses as acceptable, where it will become a blocker for less technical end-users. Leaving a number of questions when it comes to understanding API complexity at the response and schema layers, helping us think through the impact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have the resources to parse complex responses from an API?</li>
<li>Are you looking to put an API response to work in a spreadsheet?</li>
<li>Are you integrating an API response directly into another API request?</li>
<li>Are you building a web application?</li>
<li>Are you building a mobile application?</li>
<li>Are you building an IoT application?</li>
<li>Is there limited network or bandwidth available?</li>
<li>Do you prefer all sub-resources included with each response?</li>
<li>Do you get to define your response as part of each request you make?</li>
<li>How many API calls does a single user interface need to make?</li>
<li>Are multiple content types available for any single API response?</li>
</ul>
<p>API responses are a hotbed of API complexity. There are few API standards in use that dictate what gets returned for common API patterns. Most companies see the naming and ordering of the API complexity they&rsquo;ve embraced at this layer as their intellectual property. API complexity at the response layer that keeps out less skilled developers and non-developers is often embraced and celebrated, ensuring that APIs are not about access, but about being a gatekeeper, and keeping those who are not in the know out of things. API complexity by design is not unique to the response layer, and is something that exists through each layer I have walked through here, but I&rsquo;d say because the response is downstream, the API complexity entropy and debt accumulated upstream from here eventually flows downhill and dramatically expands API complexity at the response layer.</p>
<h3>So Where Do You Like Your API Complexity?</h3>
<p>Where you are used to, and believe API complexity will vary on how you have learned about APIs, and how you are applying them across applications. There are no right answers here, only right questions. For me, the process of asking the right questions has helped me evolve beyond my legacy beliefs around where API complexity should exist. Thinking through API complexity and whether it should exist or not exist across all of these levels has helped me learn to understand how large groups of develoeprs see APIs, as well as define, design, and deliver APIs that reach a much larger group of developers by employing common patterns and vocabulary. It has helped me unpack my own dogma. It has helped me better understand those who have gone off of me for investing too heavily or too little in API complexity across each of these layers. For me, people&rsquo;s insistence on API complexity at a single level often demonstrates how little they have thought about API complexity across all of the layers.</p>

<h3>API Complexity Often Gives Way To API Religion</h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve stated several times there are no right answers here. I find that believing too heavily in complexity of any single layer without thorough consideration of the impact of complexity at other layers, as well as at the API consumer dimension, tends to lead towards some very religious belief, behavior, and ultimately condemnation, shaming, and guilt. Like most other aspects of Internet technology across the enterprise the more exposure you have to complexity the more use to it you are, and just because you are accustomed to it doesn&rsquo;t mean it is the way thing should be. Also, it takes time to reduce very complicated things down into a more distilled and simplified version&mdash;this should be what API evolution is all about. Ideally, we are working to reduce complexity. This is why web APIs have made their biggest impact, making digital resources more accessible to developers, and non-developers. APIs are about access and not about barriers, and API complexity at any layer will ultimately act as a barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had people scream at me on Zoom meetings because I provided paths for every digital resource and capability rather than making a single API call that just returned everything as a massive JSON blog. Claiming in front of large audiences that clearly I do not know what I am doing because I would introduce such complexity to an API. With no regard to the reasons why I was introducing complexity at the path level instead of the response schema level. I get this regularly when it comes to discussions around API design, and how you build a platform and strategy for your API operations. People get mean about these things, and it is usually because they worked very hard to learn what they know, and are pretty afraid of what they do not know. People also tend to use APIs to protect existing power structures, and wield complexity as part of this fight. Which in my experience makes many of these API battles more about the politics of APIs than it ever is about the technology, or even business of doing APIs. As you are baking in specific patterns into your API strategy, make sure you pause to think about the politics of APIs at these levels, and ask some of these questions, ensuring that you are making informed decisions around where you invest or divest in API complexity.</p>

<p>title: ‘Where is the API Value?’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_value.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p>I had some thoughts bouncing around in my head the last couple days about where the value in this whole API game actually resides. When it comes to the types of APIs I am seeing be deployed, and where I see things head in the near future, I wanted to try and map out where the different moving parts of an API are, and assigning value to each component. At first I just wanted to think more deeply about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon the father of information theory</a> would see (or not see) the value in APIs. In <a href="http://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf">1948 Claude Shanno wrote in his&nbsp;Mathematical Theory of Communicatio</a>n:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2020, I feel like the message is still the center of value, but I would disagree about the meaning of those messages being irrelevant, but that is another post. However I would say that other dimensions have emerged in the 70+ years since Shannon wrote his theory. I would argue that Shannon's view of the message still hold true in 2020, but I just think he couldn't have imagined the many ways in which protocols, connections, formats, channels, and the network, performance, and volume of messages would influence the purpose, meaning, and ultimately value of each message, and messages in bulk. This is my first draft at trying to map out the moving parts. It is far from complete, or laid out as I see in my head, but its a start to try and understand where the value lies within doing APIs across the landscape in the 2020s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_value.jpg" alt="" width="98%" align="center" /></p>
<p>Here:</p>
<p><strong>G1 - Protocols </strong>- This is the protocol layer for each potential API transaction occurring.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) FTP </strong>- This is still a relevant way to move messages around.</li>
<li><strong>2) HTTP 1.1</strong> - This is a dominant protocol available across the landscape.</li>
<li><strong>3) SSE -</strong> A relevant way to send one-way streams of messages.</li>
<li><strong>4) HTTP/2 </strong>- The next iteration of the HTTP protocol already in use.</li>
<li><strong>5) HTTP/3 - </strong>The next iteration of the HTTP protocol being laid.</li>
<li><strong>6) TCP -</strong> The foundational protocol that is driving business messaging.</li>
<li><strong>7) UDP&nbsp; -</strong> A protocol you don't hear much about but is influencing the future.</li>
<li><strong>8) MQTT - </strong>Satisfying the devices that are being connected to the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>G2 - Connections -</strong> The variety of lego API connectors we have available out there today.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>8) Files -</strong> This really doesn't fit here, but it balances out the FTP part of the equation.</li>
<li><strong>9) Request - </strong>Simple requests being made by consumers to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>9) Response -</strong> The responses returend for each of the requests being made.</li>
<li><strong>10) Webhook -</strong> Pushing information out to consumers as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>11) Sustained -</strong> Dedicated connects providing one-way or two-way connections.</li>
<li><strong>12) Multiple </strong>- Opening up multiple threads as part of API communication.</li>
<li><strong>13) Lossless </strong>- Making sure information doesn't get lost along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>G3 - Design </strong>- The design pattern in use for deliverying each API made available to consumers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>14) EDI</strong> - The electronic data interfachange format is still powering much of the economy.</li>
<li><strong>15) SOAP</strong> - SOAP is still relevant when it comes to integrating with enterprise systems.</li>
<li><strong>16) REST</strong> - This philosophy is simple, easy to use, and ubiquitous giving it an edge over others.</li>
<li><strong>17) RPC</strong> - Still a viable format with a handful of patterns powering heavy hitting APIs.</li>
<li><strong>18) Hypermedia</strong> - Helping make content, media, and other vlauable resources accessible.</li>
<li><strong>19) GraphQL</strong> - Giving more control to consumers when it comes to access complex data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>20) Headers - </strong>Providing the routing, control, and additional meta data about messages.</p>
<p><strong>G4 - Formats - </strong>The data formats in use for request, responses, and streaming messages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>21) CSV</strong> - This format is still relevant to users of spreadsheets.</li>
<li><strong>22) XML</strong> - Provides the robust structure for machine readable data.</li>
<li><strong>23) JSON</strong> - Provides a more lighteweight format for developers.</li>
<li><strong>24) YAML</strong> - Simplifying machine readable formats for management.</li>
<li><strong>25) Protobuf</strong> -Helping make APIs more efficient over the wire.</li>
<li><strong>26) Avro</strong> - A common data serialization format for messages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>G5 - Engagement </strong>- How API resources are engaged with by human beings putting to work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>27) Request</strong> - A little redundant, but relevant to how APIs are often engaged.</li>
<li><strong>28) Response</strong> - Getting a response back for request that is being made.</li>
<li><strong>29) Push</strong> - Having data pushed to you when some criteria is met.</li>
<li><strong>30) Stream</strong> - Leveraging one-way or two-way streams of messages.</li>
<li><strong>31) Runner</strong> - Orchestrating many API requests and connections.</li>
<li><strong>32) Monitor</strong> - Executing APIs based upon a schedule from regions.</li>
<li><strong>33) Events</strong> - Responding to events that occur across API infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>34) Performance -</strong> What is the performance expectations of any API I am using as a consumer.</p>
<p><strong>35) Volume -</strong> What volume is obtainable via each API to match my desires as a consumer.</p>
<p><strong>36) Messages -</strong> Coming full circle to the most important ingredient in all of this -- the message.</p>
<p><strong>37) Humans -</strong> Wait, actually the most important ingredientn is humans, because without us...</p>
<p>My drawing is rough, and the overlapping moving parts of each potential API call are extremely difficult to nail down in a single diagram. I am just trying to get all the moving parts listed, grouped, and somewhat visualized for further processing. I will be hanging the diagram on my wall for a couple of weeks and simmering on how all of these moving parts work together. What has the past looked like, where do we find the value today, and what does the future look like. I'll get better at visually representing this landscape as I progress. I have to start somewhere and spin out on thinking about each gear in the larger machine.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the API Value?</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so where is the value for me. Is it the API pipes? What part of the protocols, connections, formats, or ways that I engage with APIs drives the value for me? This provides me with a way to trace the path of each type of API request and understand the value provenence that exists (or doesn't) throughout the stack. I can freeze frame on a single type of resource I am working and think about what atters to me most in the API supply chain. Most importantly for me, contrary to what Claude Shannon believed I can't help but feel like the semantics of the message do matter in this day and age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I think in a general mass digital communication sense we definitely had to ignore the contents of the each message as well as sender and receiver, but I think in today's digitial world these things actually matter a great deal, and we are routing, filtering, prioritising, and limiting based upon these considerations (one reason I put headers up there). I think a one size fits all approach works at scale in general, but there is a lot that can fall through the cracks at this scale, and we need to think more about where the value lies when it comes to API providers, consumers, as well as the end-user of the applications and integrations we are powering with APIs. This type of API-driven communication pushes us to think that single technological ideologies and philosophies are where it is at, when in reality there needs to be a diversity in technological approaches applied, as well as a deeper understanding of who the relevant actors are and what they value the most.</p>
<p>Lots to chew on...</p>

<p class="p1">I am fleshing out ideas from a couple of recent conversations around API life cycle religion and philosophy. We&rsquo;ve made our way through several lofty ideologies around how you should or shouldn&rsquo;t do APIs, and next up in the queue is API specification first, or API spec first development. I like the phrase. I like it a lot. However, I am afraid if we aren&rsquo;t being precise in what we mean by it we might be sacrificing a more meaningful usage of it for delivering a certain class of API that is meant for reuse. This is another one of my pedantic API definition stories, but since it is meant to help me use my words better in these conversations I am having, and secondarily for a wider reading here on the blog, you are going to have to bear with me as I work through my feels about API spec first development (should there be any dashes in there?)</p>
<p class="p1">To help guide me in my work, I am using <a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/home">my API reference implementation &ldquo;Union Fashion&rdquo; </a>as a foundation for this narrative. I&rsquo;ve been calling what I am doing with Union Fashion API-first, but honestly I&rsquo;m just looking to build out the best reference implementation that I can showing how to do APIs thoughtfully&mdash;I am not trying be prescriptive about there being one way do APIs, or one phrase to describe it. It just doesn&rsquo;t exist. However, I do like peeling back the layers on the onion until I cry. When it comes to Union Fashion I might be agreeable to calling what we are doing API spec first development, if we are using it in two possible ways. Let&rsquo;s use the Union Fashion products API to help break things down and see if we can&rsquo;t help flesh out what we mean by API spec first development.</p>
<h3>The Product API Began With Three Specifications</h3>
<p class="p1">When I first started development of the Union Fashion product API it began with a specification, an empty OpenAPI in my local IDE. It began with an API specificatio--we are off to a good start right? Maybe this is API spec first development! Facing my OpenAPI I now needed to define what my &ldquo;product&rdquo; schema would be before I get to work on the actual API. When it comes to common everyday objects I always begin the journey with <a href="http://Schema.org"><span class="s1">Schema.org</span></a>, another specification, which in this case I leverage the products object. To quantify the <a href="http://Schema.org"><span class="s1">Schema.org</span></a> product object as my product object I use JSON Schema, which fits nicely with OpenAPI, which has also adopted the open source schema specification to define the underlying objects used as part of the request and responses of APIs it is used to define. I have just started defining and designing my products API and I&rsquo;ve used three separate specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong><a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a></strong>&nbsp; - We will use version 3.0.3 of the OpenAPI specification as the central truth for the Union Fashion product API.</li>
<li><strong><span class="s1"><a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a></span> </strong>- We are using the <a href="https://schema.org/Product"><span class="s1">Schema.org</span> product object</a> as the underlying specification for our Union Fashion product.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> </strong>- We are using JSON Schema to define our product object, and referencing it within our OpenAPI definition.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Ok, I have an product object, and I begin to define each path for creating, reading, updating, and deleting objects in my OpenAPI definition, wiring up the request and response objects to reference my <a href="http://Schema.org"><span class="s1">Schema.org</span></a> compliant product object which is defined as JSON Schema. Ok, I have used three specifications to create the definition for my API, which allows me to the potentially mock, document, share, and collaborate around the evolution of my products API. Is that API spec first development because I am ALWAYS researching, considering, and building with common specifications, or is it APII spec first development because I am creating a spec for my API? If it is the former I can get behind it, if it is the latter than I think it loses meaning, and potentially takes away from the development of reusable API specifications which I will talk about shortly.</p>
<p class="p1">At Union Fashion I am not developing a specification. I might be developing an API using specifications, but really I could get pretty wild about the design of my API moving forward and negate much of the benefit of the specs that I am using. I am using OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and <a href="http://Schema.org"><span class="s1">Schema.org</span></a> to create a definition for the Union Fashion API, but I am not creating a specification. I am just using specifications to jumpstart my API, and maybe to shape my API, but I am not developing an API specification. Or am I? If I leverage other standards, and open source my specification and some or all of the tooling around it, maybe I could consider my Union Fashion API to actually be a specification, resulting in this being&hellip;wait for it&mdash;api specification development.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Union Fashion Product API as a Specification</h3>
<p class="p1">Not all APIs are &ldquo;open APIs&rdquo; designed for reuse. There are few APIs that provide you with the definition of the API, as well as server, client, documentation, and other building blocks to deploy that API in compliance with a specification. This type of API development is ideal because it allows API providers to deploy many different APIs which all follow the same API specification (ie. PSD2 or FHIR APIs). This is where we want to be for all major industries. We want a wealth of API specifications for many different industries all defined using OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and <a href="http://Schema.org"><span class="s1">Schema.org</span></a>. However, this adds an entirely new dimension to API spec first development as well as what I&rsquo;d consider to be API spec development. Imagine being API spec first at a bank and to kick things off developing your API you don&rsquo;t just choose OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and <a href="http://Schema.org"><span class="s1">Schema.org</span></a>, you also choose PSD2 for the specification of your API, ensuring your bank is in compliance with EU regulation and is reusable in a variety of tooling. I can really get behind this type of API spec first development, especially when there are a wealth of API specifications that have been developed and are available like PSD2 and FHIR.</p>
<h3>Confusion Around What is the API Specification</h3>
<p class="p1">Ok, phew. I worked my way across this spectrum not to just be pedantic about a simple phrase. I want to just make sure we are in alignment on what we mean when we say API spec first development or API spec development, because they feed each other. If you Google API spec first development, the majority of the posts say "specification" as a way of expressing what is produced first as part of the development of your API. You aren&rsquo;t. It is unlikely that you are producing a reusable specification. You might be. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. If you are, then use it. I just want to make sure we aren&rsquo;t just loosely throwing it own there because if you are using OpenAPI and JSON Schema (two specs) to develop your API, and what you build isn&rsquo;t reusable as a pattern, then you didn&rsquo;t produce an API specification, you produced and API definition using API specifications. I put this out there because I want to be honest about my intent behind each Union Fashion API, fully admitting that some of my APIs may some day rise to the level of a specification, but it is likely that most the APIs I&rsquo;ll be developing, no matter how many specifications I use, and how well defined my process is, will never be a specification for use in someone elses API.</p>
<p class="p1">So I think that API spec first development has its place. I also think we can do a better job of using this term. I think specifications are important. I just don&rsquo;t think everything we do rises to the occasion of being API spec first development, and especially not API spec development, so I just want to be careful. Let&rsquo;s definitely look at using API specification at the beginning of any API journey. Let&rsquo;s definitely discover, reuse, and contribute to API specifications like PSD2, FHIR, Open Referral, Open311, and other open source API specifications that are defined using OpenAPI and JSON Schema. Let&rsquo;s be more cautious if we are building momentum around marketing, branding, and storytelling that uses API spec first development if the intent behind the API isn&rsquo;t designed for reuse, because in this middle ground the outcome of development isn&rsquo;t going to be a spec.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ok, I think I have my head wrapped around the spectrum of what I mean by API spec first development. I feel a little more equipped to partake in lofty conversation about the term without flip flopping around. It helps to keep the words I use in my storytelling and conversations grounded, otherwise this stuff gets pretty unwieldy pretty quickly.</p>

<p class="p3">I am working up towards a loftier piece on the importance of RBAC to the API life cycle, and as part of my research I was going through all of the documentation postman has <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collaboration/roles-and-permissions/">for roles and permission at the team, workspace, api, and collection levels</a>. RBAC is one of those layers of the API discussion that touches on almost every other layer, making it an area you have to not just think about at the microscopic levels within workspaces, but also at the macro level thinking about organizational and team level impact. I&rsquo;m feeling like I am going to need to flesh out several dimensions of what is RBAC here on the blog, as well as the other critical factors of what influences RBAC across operations.</p>
<h3>The Basic Building Blocks of Postman RBAC</h3>
<p class="p3">To get a handle on things I wanted to think deeply about the core building blocks of Postman RBAC, and consider the roles, as well as the objects in which access is being controlled, but also the downstream effects of how RBAC gets applied or not. When you browse the Postman Learning Center under <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collaboration/roles-and-permissions/">roles and permissions</a>&nbsp;you get the following breakdown:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Team Role</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Admin: manage team members and team settings</li>
<li>Billing: manage team plan and payments</li>
<li>Developer: access team resources and workspaces</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Workspace Roles</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Admin: manage workspace details and members</li>
<li>Collaborator: work on team resources in a workspace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>API Roles</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Editor: edit APIs directly</li>
<li>Viewer: view, fork, and export APIs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Collection Roles</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Editor: edit collections directly</li>
<li>Viewer: view, fork, and export collections</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">That represents nine individual roles defined by the API resources in which they are applied. Postman does a good job of breaking out the control each role has in each of the respective areas, but the overall effectiveness of RBAC will be determined by how solid of a strategy you have for defining and managing each of these areas&mdash;meaning you are going to to have a strategy in place, and being willing to invest the energy in managing each area:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Teams</strong> - If team members of all of your AIP development staff isn&rsquo;t well defined, controlling access will be challenging.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Workspaces</strong> - Without a formal approach how workspaces are create and how they are used controlling will be difficult.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>APIs</strong> - In the absence of a strategy for how APIs are defined, synced, and leveraged you won&rsquo;t be able to nail down access.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Collections</strong> - There has to be a method to the madness of how collections are created and evolved or control will fall short.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">It is difficult to control access to a moving and ever evolving target. Sure, teams, workspaces, apis, and collections will always be evolving, but you have to contract some sort of scaffolding for governing how teams, workspaces, apis, and collections are created, versioned, and shared, establishing a strategy for managing change across all types of roles.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Downstream API Life Cycle Effects of RBAC</h3>
<p class="p3">Since Postman collections are used to define, power, and publish other stops along the API life cycle you have to have some observability and plan behind how collections are used across the API life cycle, as well as how workspaces are defined to support the development, sustainment, and general operations of all APIs. The downstream API life cycle effects are hard to quantify if you do not have a solid strategy for defining how APIs and collections are used for each stop along the API lifecycle, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Mocks</strong> - How are mock servers defined, created, used, maintained, and torn down as part of the API life cycle.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Docs</strong> - Which collections are used purely for supporting documentation and how are they evolved and put to use.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Tests</strong> - Which collections and APIs are used as part of performance, contract, integration, and other test suites.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Code</strong> - When it comes to code generation there should a clear vision of which artifacts are being used to deliver.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">If you don&rsquo;t have a clear understanding of how you are powering each stop along the API life cycle it can be difficult to control access to the teams, workspaces, roles, and collections behind each individual stop. Meaning you can&rsquo;t properly prevent changes being made to the documentation for an API if you don&rsquo;t have a clear picture of which collections power docs, and which workspaces that collections exists in. To do right, you need step back and look at the big picture.</p>
<h3>Considering the Bigger Picture</h3>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/stalin-time-border-crossing-through-fence.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p3">In addition to the roles and resources we are controlling access to and the downstream effects of RBAC being applied well or not, there are numerous other dimensions to think about. Too many for just a single post, requiring me to spend time digging, scratching, and working to make sense of what the big picture of API RBAC looks like across the entire API life cycle. Here are just a few of the areas I am thinking about in addition to what I have listed above, making for the seeds of future blog posts here on API Evangelist.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Activity</strong> - How is the activity of team members evaluated to better understand the need for tightening or loosening RBAC.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>History</strong> - How is the history of collections usage evaluated and understood to help paint a clear picture of how RBAC is applied.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Auditing</strong> - Regularly auditing RBAC looking for how it is being applied or not being applied across an organization.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Considering how monitoring can be enabled to better understand the effectiveness of RBAC across teams.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Automation</strong> - Looking to automate some of the implementation of RBAC to help realize the housekeeping needed for RBAC.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Observability</strong> - Producing output from RBAC activity so that there is as much observability as possible into how access is controlled.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Like most aspects of API operations there is so much that can go wrong with RBAC if you don&rsquo;t have other areas in order. I would say that there has to be other dimensions I am not considering. These six areas reflect the output from RBAC being applied across the API life cycle. I&rsquo;ll have to step back a bit and simmer on the roles and resources involved with RBAC, as well as how this trickles down to mocks, docs, testing, and code, while also looking to quantify it all along the way. I am guessing there are other dimensions like SSO and GitHub sync which will significantly impact the success or failure of RBAC in ways I can&rsquo;t see right now&mdash;I will keep scratching.</p>
<p class="p3">This is the first time that I have had a tool that would even begin to touch on the complexity of organizational change across API operations, so a lot of this is new territory for me. This isn&rsquo;t RBAC for a single API, which I&rsquo;ve done numerous times. This is RBAC for the API life cycle. Most places I&rsquo;ve worked do not have a formal definition of what the API life cycle means, so controlling access across the life cycle based upon well defined roles represents a pretty big opportunity to move the API conversation forward across large organizations. Anyways, I will keep simmering on this stuff, and dive into other dimensions, eventually arriving at some point with a stronger view of what RBAC looks like for the entire API life cycle so that I can write something a little smarter for the Postman blog.</p>

<p>title: ‘Learn by API’</p>

<p>image: https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/learn-by-api/2-visualizer-experience.png</p>

<hr />

<p class="p4">I was playing around with <a href="https://glitch.com/@sue.smith">my co-worker Sue Smith&rsquo;s Learn by API project today</a>, and found it to be a pretty powerful usage of Postman for not just teaching users about Postman, but also teach them about healthy practices when it comes to API design. The <a href="https://explore.postman.com/templates/7499/learn-by-api">Learn by API Postman collection</a> provides an interesting building block for development of other introductory API concepts, but also API design concepts in service of a formal API governance strategy across an organization. I recommend you just click on the Run in Postman button for the Learn by API to collection to better understand the potential, but I&rsquo;d also like to break down what she did to help illustrate how it could be used as an API education and training blueprint.</p>
<h3>Learning Collection</h3>
<p class="p4">The Learn by API collection is a single request wrapped in a portable Postman collection, allowing anyone (<a href="https://www.postman.com/">with Postman installed</a>) download into their desktop client and execute. Teaching anyone (developers or non-developers) about the fundamentals of Postman, API design, as well as how the web works in general. To begin learning, all you do is click send in Postman once you have imported the collection, and you&rsquo;ll will be introduced to the next step.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 8px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/learn-by-api/1-collection-request.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">The collection introduces each user to how Postman makes requests, how APIs are designed by showing the mechanics of how the web is working behind our web and mobile applications. It also really shows how Postman is all about helping you understand APIs by peeling back the layers of HTTP requests and responses in a hands on way.</p>
<h3>Visualizer Experience</h3>
<p class="p4">Once you have clicked send you see the response body as JSON, however if you click on the Visualize tab. Here you are given an HTML view of the tutorial you have initiated. The collection helps you understand what you just set into motion by sending the request, fusing the tutorial with the response of the request you initiated. Immediately immersing you in the fundamentals of how the web and APIs work.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 8px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/learn-by-api/2-visualizer-experience.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">I really like this one because if shows off the potential for Postman visualizer reaching a new audience. I like it because it demonstrates how Postman helps people understand the API landscape that has emerged behind the web, mobile, and device applications we are all building. The Learn by API collection Is awesome because it walks you through all of this.</p>
<h3>Query Parameters</h3>
<p class="p4">Next, you are introduced to a fundamental building block of the web and APIs with a hands-on approach to tweaking a query parameter to familiarize ones self with how you can begin manipulating the web around you. Demystifying an essential building block of the web that everyone sees every day, and putting it within reach of anyone who is curious enough to understand what is going on.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 8px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/learn-by-api/3-query-parameter.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">This tutorial could easily be customized to serve a specific type of parameter that is in alignment with an organizations wider API governance strategy. Talking about not just query parameters in general, but taking a specific query parameter that has been standardized for a common use case, upgrading this tutorial to be about API governance training as well as API design literacy.</p>
<h3>Path Parameters</h3>
<p class="p4">Now the tutorial moves you into path parameters revealing that many of the paths you are navigating are actually dynamic and (hopefully) there is a larger information strategy being applied. To continue with the tutorial you just have to enter in a category value for your path parameter and click send to move on.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 8px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/learn-by-api/4-path-parameter.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">This is an important step in helping folks understand that not everything has to be a query parameter and that you can be more thoughtful about how you design your API resources, as well as helping API consumers understand the many dimensions that exists with each API path that is published. Again, this step could easily be co-opted and made to serve a more formal API governance strategy.</p>
<h3>POST Request</h3>
<p class="p4">After parameters the Learn by API collection walk through helps us begin to understand the variety of HTTP methods that are available to use, helping us expand beyond just consumption<span>&nbsp;</span>on the web to actually creating and defining the web. To continue you have to switch from GET to POST, showing you how the web works, but also how Postman helps you navigate these layers of the web.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 8px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/learn-by-api/5-post-request.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">You can quickly see how this type of learning collections could be quickly expanded to introduce PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, helping further round off the vocabulary of the API curious. Opening up a whole new world for them when it comes to understanding how web and mobile applications are working, allowing you to poke around and understand it all works, and eventually Make it work for you.</p>
<h3>Body Data</h3>
<p class="p4">Once you learn about POST methods you are introduced to how you can send along a JSON body with each request. Revealing one of the common workhorses involved with moving your digital bits and bites off your computer and mobile phones into the cloud, allowing you to not just consume but also help construct the web.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 8px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/learn-by-api/6-body-data.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">GET is the read, and POST is the write for the web. In just six short steps, users of the <a href="https://explore.postman.com/templates/7499/learn-by-api">Learn by API collection</a> should have more of a grasp of how URLs work and how they can manipulate them. They are also taken beyond what they can usually see in a web browser, breakdown the building blocks of HTTP like methods and request boxes. It is quite a bit of API fundamentals in just six short steps, revealing a lot more potential when it comes to a full blown API life cycle curriculum.</p>
<h3>The API Behind</h3>
<p class="p4">I really like that at the last step you are left with your next step is learning that the API behind the tutorial is available on Glitch and it is something you can easily fork on your own. Allowing you to see how the API requests for the tutorial are handled, but also providing you with a quick blueprint that you can fork, evolve, and make to serve your purposes.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 8px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/learn-by-api/7-next.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p4">The Learn by API collection concludes with telling you how to find the collection using your Postman client and then leaves you with the most essential ingredient&mdash;a Run in Postman button for the collection. It is kind of API collection inception to have a Run in Postman button embedded within a collection that you are running in Postman. (Mind blown)</p>
<h3>API Literacy</h3>
<p class="p4">Ok, that is a quick glance at the future of API literacy folks. There is no better way to learn about how the web and APIs work than using Postman and Glitch. So why not develop all levels of API courses as Postman collections using a&nbsp; Glitch backend, making learning about APIs a hands on experience that anyone can immerse themselves in. Using APIs to teach about APIs. Using API artifacts to standardize how we teach about our APIs. Using APIs and API artifacts to help us understand, interact with, troubleshoot, and define how the applications around us work. Sue&rsquo;s collection opens up an entirely new classification of Postman collection for me&mdash;the learning collection.</p>
<p class="p4">I am going to adopt Sue&rsquo;s models as <a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/home">Union Fashion&rsquo;s approach to teaching team members about the company&rsquo;s API strategy</a>, life cycle, and approach to governance. Hopefully I can help contribute to Sue's model, keep using Postman and Glitch as the underlying fabric, which will allow any of the learning blueprints that I create to be easily forked, replicated, evolved, and used by the community. It is some slick API juju that needs to be shared widely, helping us all ramp up API literacy across developer communities around the world. API education and training for individuals within your organization is one of the most important areas you can be investing in, and sadly it is one of the most deficient areas when it comes to some of the API operations I have visibility into. I&rsquo;m hoping Postman + Glitch can change that. ;-)</p>

<p>title: ‘HHS and CMS Finalizes Rules to Provide Patients More Control of Their Health Data Using APIs’</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/interoperability-and-patient-access-fact-sheet"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/cms_finalrule_square_1_e1584028841105.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I have had a pretty massive API story in my notebook for a couple of weeks now that I just didn&rsquo;t have the emotional bandwidth to process, but eventually I&rsquo;m finding the energy to think about APIs at this scope. The TL;DR is that <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/03/09/hhs-finalizes-historic-rules-to-provide-patients-more-control-of-their-health-data.html">the US Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) finalized a historic rule to provide patients more control of their health care using APIs</a>--from the HHS announcement:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;ONC&rsquo;s final rule establishes secure, standards-based application programming interface (API) requirements to support a patient&rsquo;s access and control of their electronic health information. APIs are the foundation of smartphone applications (apps). As a result of this rule, patients will be able to securely and easily obtain and use their electronic health information from their provider&rsquo;s medical record for free, using the smartphone app of their choice.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to understand what this means for healthcare APIs. I&rsquo;ve gone down the Blue Button API rabbit hole several times before, and I have an intimate awareness of how much time is involved with just loading all the moving parts into your head. However, this is why I write on API Evangelist, to help me process big ideas like this through ongoing API storytelling, and whittle away at projects I may not have time for in waves. I finally made time to do a first dive into this monumental precedent in the US federal government directing healthcare providers to deploy APIs, loading it all up in my head so I can chew on for a bit.</p>
<h3>The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule</h3>
<p class="p1">The technical meat of this can be found within <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index">the CMS interoperability and patient access final rule</a>. Helping me better understand what is being asked of healthcare providers, and who the providers even are. At this point the rule sounds promising because of its scope, but really the devil is in the details--the CMS interoperability and patient access final rule document(s) provide:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>Information and tools to help implement the Patient Access API and Provider Directory API</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>Best Practices for payers and developers sharing and receiving patient data via FHIR-based APIs</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>Information to support payers as they produce patient education resources tailored to their patient population&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">After realizing the CMS rule had all the technical details I needed, it also answered my next question about who was required to deploy APIs that would allow application developers to access patient data. dThis final rule requires most CMS-regulated payers &ndash; specifically:</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1">Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations</li>
<li class="li1">Medicaid Fee-For-Service (FFS) programs</li>
<li class="li1">CHIP FFS programs</li>
<li class="li1">Medicaid managed care plans</li>
<li class="li1">CHIP managed care entities</li>
<li class="li1">Qualified Health Plan (QHP) issuers on the Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">To provide APIs, excluding these groups:</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1">issuers offering only Standalone dental plans (SADPs)</li>
<li class="li1">QHP issuers offering coverage in the Federally-facilitated Small Business Health Options Program (FF-SHOP)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I am doing more research into the scope of each of these groups, and hopefully pull some data for different states. I&rsquo;m looking to better understand who the actors are in this healthcare API conversation which will help me understand the maturity of these entities regarding how they put technology to work, and where they are in their overall API journey.</p>
<p class="p1">To help be a little more precise about what is being asked of these groups, CMS provides a little more clarification about what is expected of these healthcare organizations that are spread across the United States.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;To implement and maintain a secure, standards-based Patient Access Application Programming Interface (API) (using Health Level 7&reg; (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources&reg; (FHIR) Release 4.0.1) that allows patients to easily access their claims and encounter information, including cost (specifically provider remittances and enrollee cost-sharing), as well as a defined sub-set of their clinical information through third-party applications of their choice.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="p1">FHIR has been around for a while, used for the <a href="https://bluebutton.cms.gov/">Blue Button</a> and other APIs, but this is a federal rule saying that if healthcare providers who receive federal funds have to provide APIs for trusted 3rd party developers to build applications on. It is a pretty significant precedent of API regulation similar to PSD2 for banking the UK and EU, establishing expectations that businesses need to provide APIs. It is a big deal. Additionally the rule builds upon existing API standards, dictating that all APIs reuse these existing patterns:</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">FHIR</a></strong>&nbsp;- Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a standard describing data formats and elements and an application programming interface for exchanging electronic health records.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a></strong>&nbsp;- OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a></strong>&nbsp;- OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi)">USCDI</a></strong> - The United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) is a standardized set of health data classes and constituent data elements for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is a pretty solid foundation for such a rule. It also provides a model that could be considered for other industries. The rule focuses on providing API access to the following healthcare resources:</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><strong>Claims &amp; Encounter Data </strong>- Payers are required to make a patient&rsquo;s claims and encounter data available via the Patient Access API.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Clinical Data -</strong> Payers are also required to make a patient&rsquo;s clinical data, defined as those data the payer maintains that are included in the USCDI version 1, available via the Patient Access API.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Plan Coverage and Formularies </strong>- Part D Medicare Advantage plans must also make formulary information available via the Patient Access API. And, Medicaid and CHIP FFS and managed care must make preferred drug lists available.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Provider Directory - </strong>Under this rule, MA organizations, Medicaid FFS programs, CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities are required to make provider directory information available via the Provider Directory API. This API must be accessible via a public-facing digital endpoint on the payer&rsquo;s website.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">CMS provides all the technical information need including reference implementations. They have the model for doing this with Blue Button, and all the healthcare provides need to do is replicate the Blue Button model for their own operations. To help me refresh what the Blue Button team has accomplished I wanted to take a moment to look at Blue Button again in the context of this rule.</p>
<h3>The Blue Button Profile</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://bluebutton.cms.gov/">Blue Button 2.0</a> is a <em>&ldquo;developer-friendly, standards-based API that enables Medicare beneficiaries to connect their claims data to the applications, services and research programs they trust.&rdquo;</em> CMS has invested a lot of resources in rolling out this API that &nbsp;contains four years of Medicare Part A, B and D data for 53 million Medicare beneficiaries. To help me how much of this work is reusable as part of the wider HHS &amp; CMS rule(s) I wanted to break down the relevant building blocks present with the Blue Button API, that might be applied to other providers.</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><strong>Portal</strong> - There is an easy to discovery portal for access the Blue Button 2.0 API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Subdomain</strong> - Having a dedicated subdomain for an API demonstrates investment.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Overview</strong> - There is a simple overview of what is happening with the API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Getting Started </strong>- A simple list of what it takes to get going is available for consumers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>HL7 FHIR Specification </strong>- The FHIR specification is the cornerstone of the Blue Button API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>OAuth 2.0 Standard</strong> - OAuth 2.0 is used to manage authorization and access.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Authorization</strong> - An overview of authorization is available for consumers to put to use.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Documentation</strong> - They provide complete documentation for the APIs that are available.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Data Model </strong>- The underlying data model for the Blue Button API is published.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Sample Data </strong>- Blue Button provides sample data for developers to put to use.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Sandbox</strong> - There is a sandbox so that everyone can play with the Blue Button API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Developer Signup</strong> - Developers can sign up for access to the sandbox API environment.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Developer Login</strong> - There is a login for developers to come back and use to engage.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Developer Guidelines </strong>- There are clear guidelines for how developers can use the API.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Implementation Guide </strong>- Instructions are available for guiding developers to production.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Forum</strong> - There is a forum for supporting the Blue Button API developer community.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Blog</strong> - The platform uses a blog to communicate with API consumers on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I have a lot more reading and documentation to go through to fully understand what is expected of healthcare providers when it comes to this new rule. I am working with my friend Mark Boyd (<a href="https://twitter.com/mgboydcom">@mgboydcom</a>) over at <a href="https://platformable.com/">Platformable</a> to think through a model for thinking through not just the Blue Button 2.0 model but also how it can be replicated across hundreds or thousands of health care providers while also striking a balance between API providers, consumers, and the end-user healthcare patient who all of this is supposed to serve. Each of these building blocks from the Blue Button 2.0 API will help contribute to the vision Platformable is proposing for healthcare.</p>
<h3>Data at the Point of Care</h3>
<p class="p1">As I was doing this research I happened to connect with my old friend Shelby Switzer (<a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">@switzerly)</a> who happens to be working at HHS behind the scenes on some of these efforts and she helped be better understand the landscape. She brought a few interesting areas to my attention but one of the most relevant things she shared with me was <a href="https://dpc.cms.gov">Data at the Point of Care</a>, which according to the site helps provide a 360 degree view of your patients history:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;As patients move throughout the healthcare system, providers often struggle to gain and maintain a complete picture of their medical history. Data at the Point of Care fills in the gaps with claims data to inform providers with secure, structured patient history, past procedures, medication adherence, and more.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="p1">Data at the Point of Care also employs the FHIR specification, but provides bulk data access to patient data, which also builds upon the Blue Button data model. It introduces an interesting question about the best way to actually provide end-users with access to their data. Giving us two separate models for defining how healthcare data can been mad available to end-users, and another dimension I want to consider as part of my Blue Button model profiling. I am not sure which model the rule will be mandating healthcare providers follow, but I&rsquo;ll be considering both as I make my way through what is going on.</p>
<h3>What is Next?</h3>
<p><a href="https://platformable.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/ob_5_wins_model.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">This little sprint plus blog post has given me a better understanding about what this rule is all about. Based upon my experience, what I know is likely just the tip of the iceberg. I do these pieces to help me distill down what I am reading into essential details I can load up in my brain and consider as part of the bigger picture. I am looking to simmer on this for a while, and think of it context of what I have learned from PSD2. Sadly, PSD2, and now FHIR are the only two precedents we have for API regulations at the industry level. To help me keep learning there are a handful of other areas I will be thinking about next as I work to expand my view of this landscape&mdash;here are just a few of what is on my list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference Implementation </strong>- I am a reverse engineer so I need a reference implementation to work with to grasp what is going on.</li>
<li><strong>Management Layer </strong>- I am working with my partner in crime Tyk to help flesh out what API management for a FHIR implementation looks like.</li>
<li><strong>Provider Profiling </strong>- I am looking to pull data on Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations and Medicaid Fee-For-Service (FFS), CHIP FFS and other programs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Landscape Map - </strong>Try to come up with some way of quantifying what the landscape might look like including other actors influencing what is happening.</li>
<li><strong>Postman Collections -</strong> Working to understand how I can create Postman collections to help drive the conversation around healthcare APIs.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I am sure other things will emerge as I keep digging. Ultimately I&rsquo;m looking to expand my understanding of what is going on and look for opportunities of how I can help reduce friction for providers when it comes to using Postman. I am also really keen on working with my friend Mark Boyd at <a href="https://platformable.com/">Platformable</a> to apply his vision for banking and government to the healthcare sector. Much of the equity and balance he calls for in these sectors apply to the world of healthcare APIs. Mark is asking some of the hard questions and tracking on some of the meaningful data behind how APIs working, but more importantly are not working--helping us be more honest about what is going on and make sure APIs are living up to expectations.</p>

<p class="p1">I would say today reflects the purpose of API Evangelist in my world. Helping me get through the work I have on the table, while expanding my awareness of what is going on in the world of APIs. Most people think my blog is for them, and it is, but first and foremost it is about me working through my ideas and projects. I haven&rsquo;t been feeling like writing much during the current situation we find ourselves in, but this morning I was needing some help getting to some items on my task list that have been sitting a little to long. Resulting in three posts here on the blog, and me remember why I do this, which always helps me find renewed energy in my work.</p>
<p class="p1">I have about 10 different items I was looking to accomplish today, but three of them made for pretty worthy stories that helped me better understand what is going on while also pushing me to articulate my ideas to other people. Here is the result of me clearing three items from my task list today:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/05/05/learn-by-api/">Learn by API</a></strong> - I was impressed by a new type of collection my co-worker at Postman came up with, making learning about APIs and Postman a hands-on experience. I am going to adopt her approach for my Union Fashion API reference project.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/05/05/the-basics-of-postman-role-based-access-control--rbac/">The Basics of Postman Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</a> </strong>- Refreshing my memory of what is possible with Postman RBAC, so that I can pull together a compelling story about how Postman RBAC benefits our enterprise customers.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/05/05/hhs-and-cms-finalizes-rules-to-provide-patients-more-control-of-their-health-data-using-apis/">HHS and CMS Finalizes Rules to Provide Patients More Control of Their Health Data Using APIs</a></strong> - Digging deeper into HHS and CMS finalizing a rule for payment providers to deploy Blue Button compliant APIs to give patients more access to their developers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This process reflects how I like to work. It represents how I have managed to move my API research forward over the last ten years. I like being able to pause and remember how and why I do this. I learned a lot today. I have a three big ideas implanted in my head so that I can simmer on them. Being able to think about things like this keeps my brain occupied, and helps me move forward the conversations I am having. This is why I do all of this. Because it keeps me learning and thinking about interesting aspects of how technology is being used in our world.</p>
<p class="p1">I would also say that these three projects reflect what interests me. 1) Helping others learn about APIs, 2) Be successful in my job (helping Postman customers), and 3) Helping potentially move forward the conversation around API policy at the highest levels. Anyways, I like having days like this. It energizes me a bit and keeps my brain out of trouble, while also helping me work my way through my task list. Clearing the way for other projects that I&rsquo;d like to spend time on, while also producing (hopefully) relevant content for API Evangelist readers sharing what I am learning along the way. Anyways, I just wanted to pause for a moment and acknowledge that I enjoy my work, and the little niche I&rsquo;ve carved out.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>title: ‘The Quickest Way To Make An Idea for an API Usable By Others’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/6_request.png</p>

<hr />

<p class="p1">I have used Postman in a handful of webinars and takes recently to demonstrate how you can quickly go from idea to a tangible usable API. My goal is to equip myself with a way to I can quickly demonstrate an API I have in my head to someone else in five minutes or less. This is a walkthrough of that process, hopefully showing you a quick way to be more effective in how you share and collaborate around APIs. Allowing anyone, even non-developers to make their abstract ideas a little more tangible and real for others.</p>
<h3>Oakland Restaurants JSON</h3>
<p class="p3">To demonstrate how you can quickly deploy an API using Postman I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of some of the restaurants in Oakland (where I live) that are still open for take-out and delivery. To demonstrate what is possible I have added four restaurants to a JSON file, providing me with what I&rsquo;d like to see for my API response.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/quickest-way-to-make-an-api-usable-by-others/1-json.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">This JSON will become the response for me new API, providing a list of restaurants for Oakland. However, with an eye for the future I will be looking to create separate JSON responses for Berkeley and other surrounding cities, breaking up my API into more usable chunks.</p>
<h3>New API Request in Postman</h3>
<p class="p3">To launch my new restaurants API I am opening up Postman, creating a new request for the API I am wanting to share with others. Adding a path resource named restaurants with a city parameter with a value of Oakland, allowing me to break things up by city in the near future.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/quickest-way-to-make-an-api-usable-by-others/2-request.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<h3>Save Request as a Collection</h3>
<p class="p3">Before I can actually put my new imaginary API to work I will need to save the request as part of a collection. Helping provide me with a way to organize my API, but also begin to make it more tangible and executable as a Postman collection. Taking the first step towards making my API idea a little more real.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/quickest-way-to-make-an-api-usable-by-others/3-save.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">This collection will make my new API much more defined, providing me with something that I can use to further bring my API to life, but more importantly it is something that I can share with others using a URL or workspace, providing them with an executable representation of what I am thinking.</p>
<h3>Create Example with My JSON</h3>
<p class="p3">Now I am going to take the JSON example I create for my Oakland restaurants and I&rsquo;m going to add it to Postman. For my new request I am going to add new example, and paste in my JSON, representing what I&rsquo;d like to see come back for each request to my new API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/quickest-way-to-make-an-api-usable-by-others/4-example.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">This will provide users of my new API with a response when the city is Oakland, but I can also add examples for Berkeley and other surrounding cities once I am ready. Providing several different responses fo ray different consumers allowing them to choose which restaurants they are looking for.</p>
<h3>Publish Mock Server for Collection</h3>
<p class="p3">With my new request, collection, and example, I can take the next step of actually publishing a mock server for my new API. To bring to life I click on the three dots (&hellip;) action menu for my collection, and choose to mock our new collection.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/quickest-way-to-make-an-api-usable-by-others/5-mock.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">We can give out new mock server a name, and chose to make public or private. I am just going to make public for the sake of the demo. Making my API as easy for consumers to put to use as I am working to get them on-board with my new API idea. Removing as much friction from the process as possible.</p>
<h3>Make Call to Your New Mock API</h3>
<p class="p3">Now using the URL I was given for my new mock server I can I can paste into the request I have defined. Completing the circle for what I am needing to actually make a call to my API. I should now be able to hit send on my request and I will get back the JSON response I&rsquo;ve published for my API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/quickest-way-to-make-an-api-usable-by-others/6-request.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">Now I have an API that I can share with others using the browser, or using Postman. Demonstrating what I mean when I am talking about my Restaurant API. However, I&rsquo;d like to go one more step, helping make my API more tangible and executable by others I am talking to about my API idea.</p>
<h3>Publish Documentation for API</h3>
<p class="p3">Having my Mock API makes my idea much more tangible, but there is one more step I&rsquo;d like to take helping put a face to my new API&mdash;publishing documentation. Using Postman I also click on the three dots (&hellip;) action button for my new collection, and choose to publish documentation for my new API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/postman-tutorials/quickest-way-to-make-an-api-usable-by-others/7-docs.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<p class="p3">As you work your way through the wizard for publishing your API documentation you can just hit publish and leave all the settings default, or you can get to work tweaking and customizing. For purposes of this demo I am just looking for that link to my documentation, so that I can share with others to help illustrate what I am talking about.</p>
<h3>A Shareable Executable Example of Your API</h3>
<p class="p3">You should now have a working API with documentation in about 5 minutes. The time on the video was a little over six minutes, but I was talking a bit more than I should have. Regardless, hopefully it shows you how you can go from idea to tangible, executable API in about five minutes. Why spend time talking about your API when you can make your API something that is tangible and real, and something people you are talking to can put to work. To help fruther flesh out this concept for you I have also published a video walk through of what I m talking about, helping provide a richer format than this story can deliver by itself.</p>

<p class="p1">I find that it helps to have defined boundaries for your APIs. If you have the resources and interest I recommend studying subjects like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">domain driven design</a>. Investment in properly defining the boundaries of your organization and lines of business is a very worthy endeavor&mdash;if you have the time. However, if you already have a lot on your plate, and are just looking for incremental changes that can help make your life easier when it comes to the API sprawl we&rsquo;ve introduced into our worlds, I recommend just spending a few moments thinking about how you can better use Postman workspaces to dive and conquer your API landscape.</p>
<p class="p2">I have begun using Postman workspaces in similar ways that I use GitHub repositories. The GitHub repository has long represented a unit of API value in my world, but with the introduction of <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/github/">GitHub two-way sync</a> into Postman I now have a one for one matchup between workspace and repository when it comes to moving each API forward. For my <a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/home">API-first e-commerce reference implementation Union Fashion </a>I am currently developing five separate APIs, which each have their own Postman workspace and GitHub repository pairing.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Products</strong>&nbsp;- (<a href="https://union-fashion.postman.co/workspaces/2990215b-b3e0-4431-b2ca-80cf01274a25/apis"><span class="s2">Workspace</span></a>) (<a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/products"><span class="s2">Repo</span></a>) (<a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/10394726/SzS2xojt?version=latest"><span class="s2">Docs</span></a>) - Defining all of the products that Union Fashion offers.</li>

</ul>
<p class="p1">Postman workspaces and GitHub repositories accomplish many overlapping concerns along the API life cycle, however I am finding that Postman workspaces are better suited for establishing a tighter team level definition of who should have access and voice in moving an API forward, but GitHub is better for a more organizational-wide, or a public level of engagement. With both workspaces containing many of the same artifacts, but they will be evolved and consumed in different ways within a Postman workspace, or GitHub repository. Making for a pretty powerful Venn diagram when it comes how I move APIs forward as part of this project.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a natural synergy between Postman workspaces and GitHub repositories for me. Postman workspaces very much reflect the organization and tighter knit collaboration I need for each individual API, and the GitHub repositories reflect that next outward wave of engagement via a private or public GitHub repository. I can sync my artifacts between Postman and GitHub, and use both platforms APIs to orchestrate and automate the evolution of each individual API. Using Postman workspaces and GitHub repositories in tandem is allowing me to be a little more organized about how I roll out my APIs, and helps me establish relevant bounded contexts to any of the API resources I&rsquo;m pushing forward.</p>

<p class="p3"><em>This is the narrative from one of the last webinars I did for Postman oin my API-first e-commerce reference implementation Union Fashion. I always try to write what I am going to be saying furing a webinar so that it is loaded up in my brain in a natural way---think Neo learning Kung Fu before sparring with Morpheus. Anyways, here is the narrative, with accompanying video embedded below, helping share the narrative behind how I am building Union Fashion, trying to learn, grow, and expand how I use APIs out in the open, so that others can learn along the way.</em></p>
<p class="p3">Jeff Jones the VP of Engineering at Union Fashion has been working to get more organized about how they deliver applications using APIs at the company. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1Xep0j5s0&amp;t=71s">In our last webinar episode we looked at how Union Fashion was building and testing APIs, moving their operations towards an API first way of delivering application infrastructure</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/home/blob/master/planning/build-and-test-planning.md">build and test planning session</a> was all about ensuring Jeff could lay the foundation for organizational change at Union Fashion by making sure his teams had the proper planning, and everyone was in agreement on an API-first way of delivering APIs behind the web and mobile applications they were needing to run their business&mdash;investing in the following areas to help define how they build and test APIs before actually building them:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Organizational</strong> - Making sure the team was well defined, including having dedicated workspaces for each API.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>APIs</strong> - We are making sure that common API definitions at the center of the conversation for each API being developed.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Collections</strong> - Being very structured in how collections are define and used to power different stops along the API life cycle.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Environments</strong> - We made sure secrets and some key value pairs were abstracted away from each of the API collections.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Mocks</strong> - Mock servers are published from all APIs, using a specific collection, making each API being developed more tangible.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Documentation</strong> - Documentation is also published for each API from the beginning making it more accessible and usable.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Tests</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>- Establish contract tests for each API, making sure that each API is properly tested to meet its design requirements.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Feedback Loops</strong> - Establishing feedback loops around each API, ensuring there is proper feedback and communication.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">This allows the team at Union Fashion to employ an API design first approach to developing APIs, defining, mocking, documenting, testing, and iterating upon<span>&nbsp;</span>each API before it is ever actually deployed. Allowing teams to be more efficient when it comes to how APIs are brought to life, while making sure APIs better meet the needs of stakeholders as early on as possible, including those who are building applications and other integrations using each potential API. The build and test approach Union Fashion has been developing is a great way to bring each API to life but eventually we will need to actually deploy each API, so that it can be put to work within applications and system integrations.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Deploying and Monitoring Union Fashion APIs</strong></p>
<p class="p3">Using our build and test API first methodology we have established five OpenAPI definitions reflecting the core commerce services we will be needing, including products, baskets, orders, users, and search. There will be other APIs that will emerge along the way, but in this first sprintd we were able to define a robust build and test strategy for developing APIs in a consistent way without writing code, while actually producing the first version of five APIs we will need. Now we need to actually deploy the APIs we designed using a standardized, consistent, and scalable way for standing each API up, and making available to consumers using common cloud infrastructure.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3">To help lay the groundwork for <a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/home/blob/master/planning/deploy-and-monitor-planning.md">our deploy and monitor strategy</a> we got to work on defining a set of processes which developers can put to use when deploying an API into any stage of delivery, from development to staging to production. Laying the foundation for Union Fashion&rsquo;s official deploy and monitors strategy, helping formalize how APIs are delivered across the organization. Making sure API infrastructure at Union Fashion all follows the healthiest and most widely agreed upon patterns for delivering consistent and reliable APIs.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Ensuring Each API is Versioned</strong></p>
<p class="p3">Union Fashion employs Semantic versioning (<a href="https://semver.org/"><span class="s1">https://semver.org/</span></a><span class="s2">)</span> for each API definition, ensuring that each API is evolved in a way that is fully documented, but also helps ensure backward compatibility, and easy reuse across the organization by making sure each version is available within the repository for each API being developed.</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>API Version</strong>&nbsp;- Making sure to iterate the version of each API and derivative collection, managing change across APIs.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Version Tag</strong> - Applying vision tagging to each of the collections associated with the API being moved forward.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Change Log</strong>&nbsp;- Evaluate change log activity for each service, making sure you are in tune with what has been happening across an API.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Major Version Sync </strong>&nbsp;- Ensure that latest version is synced to GitHub, keeping all changes made in Postman or on GitHub reflected in both locations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Managing change for each of the APIs we are delivering as part of Union Fashion is critical to ensuring the reliability of each of the APIs we are making available to consumers.<span>&nbsp;</span>Having a plan for managing change rather than responding to it after it has already occurred.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Actual Deployment of Each API</strong></p>
<p class="p3">With each of our APIs well defined using OpenAPI, with supporting documentation and testing to ensure the API operates as intended, we have reached the point in the evolution of our API resource where we need to actually bring the&nbsp; to life using common cloud infrastructure. Union Fashion currently has <a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/home/blob/master/planning/deploy-and-monitor-planning.md">two blueprints for delivering APIs using AWS</a>, providing a basic, and more robust &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; model for delivering API infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable way that is contract-driven and fully tested to ensure each API is living up to its intended contract.</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/10394726/Szf6XTqp?version=latest">Basic NoSQL (AWS)</a> </strong>- Providing a standardized and repeatable way to deploy basic NoSQL backed API resources.       
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - Leveraging the OpenAPI contract to define, prepare, and build each API being deployed.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Table</strong> - Pulling the table name from the schema available as part of the OpenAPI definition from the API.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Publish</strong> - Publishing the OpenAPI definition to the AWS API Gateway, using it as the truth for deployment.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Deploy</strong> - Actually deploying the API published to the AWS API Gateway into a specific stage of development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/10394726/Szf6X8Wd?version=latest">Serverless SQL (AWS)</a> </strong>- Providing a standardized and repeatable way to deploy basic serverless SQL backed API resources.       
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - Leveraging the OpenAPI contract to define, prepare, and build each API being deployed.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Table</strong> - Pulling the table name from the schema available as part of the OpenAPI definition from the API.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Layers</strong> - Pulling and deploying the AWS Lambda layers package needed to satisfy Node.js dependencies.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Scripts</strong> - Dynamically generating JavaScript for each API method that is defined as part of the OpenAPI.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Packages</strong> - Pulling, zipping, and publishing AWS Lambda deployment packages for each OpenAPI method.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Functions</strong> - Deploying the package for each OpenAPI method and publishing individual AWS Lambda functions.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Publish</strong> - Publishing the OpenAPI definition to the AWS API Gateway, using it as the truth for deployment.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Deploy</strong> - Actually deploying the API published to the AWS API Gateway into a specific stage of development.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">There are additional deployment patterns being developed, providing delivering more functional and algorithmic APIs, as well as to replicate these patterns across additional cloud platforms, including Azure and Google. Deployment collections can be executed incrementally or collectively running API deployment collections for each of the patterns listed, deploying APIs individually, or as part of a wider API life cycle process.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Management of Each API</strong></p>
<p class="p3">Each API requires a minimal level of management ensuring that each one is properly secured, and requires an API key to access. Each API should have its own usage plan with the AWS API Gateway, and be configured with a rate limit for the consumption of each API, limiting what consumers can access per second, minute, day, or other metrics.</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Usage Plan</strong> - Publishing a usage plan with access limitations defined, governing each API being deployed.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>API Key </strong>- Generating an API key and associated it with the plan, allowing each API to be securely accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Each API should have a default API usage plan with associated key, then each additional consumer should have their API keys associated with the APIs plan, keeping each individual API within its own definition of operation&mdash;defined by the API management layer. Ensuring that each API is properly protected from access by unknown actors, but also limits the amount any one consumer can access of each API resource, during a particular time frame.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Establishing Environments</strong></p>
<p class="p3">Each API needs an environment to define each stage of its evolution, including a mock representation for each stage. Providing a place to store key / value pairs that are needed to define individual API as they move through each stage of development. Ensuring that there is a snapshot of the environment need to operate each version and stage of an API.</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Stage</strong> 
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Name</strong> - Publishing of an environment for managing the deployment of the API, naming for the stage.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>BaseURL - </strong>Provide a key / value for the base_url , which will be used when deploying and testing of the deployed API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Mock</strong> 
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>Name</strong> - Publishing of an environment for managing the mock for thi API, naming for the stage.</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span><strong>BaseURL - </strong>Provide a key / value for the base_url , which will be used when working with the mock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">The presence of an environment for each stage of an APIs development reflect the maturity and evolution of each API within its workspace. Providing the definition of how far along it has moved from from design to development to production. Providing a machine readable map of each stage of evolution, for each version of an API.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Monitoring API Contract and Performance</strong></p>
<p class="p3">Each API should possess a monitor for each of its test collections. Making sure that contract and performance testing occurs on a regular basis. Taking the tests established as part of the build and test process cycle and running them against each API deployed as part of development, staging, and production environments. Ensuring that all APIs are regularly monitored to ensure they are living up to expectations and meeting the agreed upon service level agreement (SLA).</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><strong>Contract Testing</strong> 
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><strong>Name</strong> - Apply name to the monitor matching it with the API and type of testing being implemented.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Version </strong>- Make sure the monitor has the proper version tag applied associated it with current version.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Environment</strong> - Using the proper environment stage for the API contract being tested and monitored.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Schedule </strong>- Applying the required schedule for the monitoring of the API contract testing.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Region </strong>-<span>&nbsp; </span>Monitoring the contract of each API from the required geographic regions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Performance Testing</strong> 
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><strong>Name</strong> - Apply name to the monitor matching it with the API and type of testing being implemented.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Version </strong>- Make sure the monitor has the proper version tag applied associated it with current version.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Environment</strong> - Using the proper environment stage for the API performance being tested and monitored.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Schedule </strong>- Applying the required schedule for the monitoring of the API performance testing.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Region </strong>-<span>&nbsp; </span>Monitoring the performance of each API from the required geographic regions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Service Level Agreement</strong>&nbsp;- Establish benchmarks for contract and performance testing.       
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><strong>Results</strong> - Ensure that the results of contract and performance testing are being stored in the environment.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Publish</strong> - Publishing of contract and performance testing results to the GitHub repository for each API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Additional test suites, and integration testing will be developed, but basic contract and performance testing is mandatory for all Union Fashion APIs being deployed. Making sure each API lives up to its contract, meets the level of service needed, and does this across every geographic region that matters in an ongoing way, maintaining a consistent level of service across all APIs, no matter what teams are delivering them.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Mocking of Each API Being Deployed</strong></p>
<p class="p3">There should be a mock server for each stage of API evolution, ensuring that there is a mock representation for use during testing, as well as safe and easy playing with by consumers as they are learning what an API does, without having to be exposed to live data&mdash;providing a virtualized instance of each API for quick access and use.</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><strong>Deploy</strong>&nbsp;- Establish a mock representation of the current stage, providing a mocked server for this version.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Share</strong>&nbsp;- Share the URL of mock server with rest of team, making sure it is know that there is a separate mock.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Environment</strong> - Add the mock URL and keys to the environment, ensuring the mocked version can be accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Mock APIs reduce the overhead on development, staging, and production environments, while helping alleviate anxiety with consumers when it comes to working with live data, or event development and staging data that might be needed for testing. Ensuring there is always a sandbox present for API consumers and making it easier for consumers to play around with each API.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Ensuring There Is Always Up to Date Documentation</strong></p>
<p class="p3">There should always be up to date documentation published for each API, making sure the collection behind documentation has proper name, description, and examples of the value each API request delivers. With each stage of an APIs development, the following elements should be addressed as soon as any stage of an API is deployed.</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><strong>Publish</strong>&nbsp;- Publish documentation for each service being developed, making sure the document is up to date.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Environment</strong> - Make sure there is an environment available for each stage of an APIs development.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Share</strong>&nbsp;- Share the URL of documentation with team members, making sure everyone has the link they need.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/bf-skinner-cargo-ship_36587814601_o.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p3">The publishing of API documentation for each stage of an APIs development should be a deliberate step at the end of the deployment cycle. Making sure that documentation represents the current state of any fully deployed and monitored API, keeping the visual representation for each API is always up to date and providing the most value possible.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Establish Feedback Loops for Each API</strong></p>
<p class="p3">There should be an independent feedback loop in place for each API being deployed, allowing for stakeholders in the deliver of each API can comment on the API contract, as well as the derivative collections used behind documentation, mock servers, and tests. Ensuring API consumers have a channel to provide feedback, that can be considered as part of the evolution of each API.</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li3"><strong>API Comments</strong>&nbsp;- Tune into comments available for each API, helping keep discussions self-contained for each API being developed.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Collection Comments</strong>&nbsp;- Tune into comments available for each collection, helping keep discussions self-contained for each API derivative.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Issues</strong>&nbsp;- Tune into GitHub issues for each service, leveraging the repository issues as public and private communication cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">The feedback loop for each API should be used to stay in tune with what is happening as each API is being deployed, ensuring that all the concerns and feedback of stakeholders have been considered before an API is deployed. It should also be regularly visited upon a well established schedule, making sure all feedback has been considered, and if possible, the comments and issues should be automatically tracked for evaluation of feedback lop activity and engagement across teams.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>A Standardized and Repeatable Way to Deliver API Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p class="p3">We now have a standardized way of deploying APIs at Union Fashion. This process will evolve with each API that is delivered using the process, but it also provides us with a base approach for delivering the infrastructure we need to operate online as a business. Combined with our API-First approach to building and testing APIs, our approach to deploying and monitoring APIs will make sure the API contracts defined are delivered as intended using common cloud infrastructure. Helping stabilize the infrastructure Union Fashion uses behind its web and mobile applications, and system integrations.</p>
<p class="p3">This concludes the deploy and monitor portion of our API develop life cycles. This process will help us move APIs from idea to production more efficiently, and will set that stage for us to bring our API to market, no matter whether they are strictly for internal use, access by trusted partners, or for the general public. This process is meant to show what is possible when it comes to quantifying how we deploy and monitor our API infrastructure, but can and should be evolved to consider the needs of future APIs that will be delivered. Continuing to push how we move APIs forward by making sure each individual step of the process is as well through out and planned as we possibly can. Allowing us to be more flexible, efficient, and scalable in how we deliver our API-driven application infrastructure.</p>

<p class="p1">After over a decade of API evolution, API deployment is still much more of a dark art than it is something that ever sees the light of day. Sure you can setup a pipeline for an API, making a known pattern a repeatable process, but there isn&rsquo;t much consistency out there when it comes to repeatable patterns for use across many different APIs. Certain vendors are working on optimizing the API deployment cycle within the context of their platforms, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see more open blueprints for how APIs can be deployed, designed for applying across a mix of APIs which are defined using OpenAPI. To push this conversation forward I began exploring what the common patterns for API deployment on the leading cloud providers would look like, and if it was something I could accomplish using API infrastructure, which mean that I can do using Postman.</p>
<p class="p1">One API deployment blueprint I had on my list to develops was using AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS. Providing me with a quick way to consistent and repeatable way of deploying APIs that I could define as a Postman collection that can be shared and used by others. The results is a first draft of a Postman API deployment collection, which can be used to deploy an API to AWS using Postman, taking an existing OpenAPI and bringing it to life using common AWS solutions. Rather than outlining what I did as I normally would, I am going to play around with producing content in other mediums, and publish a video walk through of how my new AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS API deployment Postman collection works&mdash;let me know what you think.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwZvQQ7265E" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">My AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS API deployment collection is still under development and being refined each week, but feel free to kick the tires and ask questions. <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis?region=us-east-1">I&rsquo;ll be showcasing how the collections fits into the bigger picture of an enterprise API life cycle tomorrow April 22nd at 9:30 AM pacific time, during my Postman Deploy &amp; Monitor webinar&mdash;showing how to just not deploy an API, but also monitor to ensure it is fulfilling its API contract</a>. You find <a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/10394726/Szf6X8Wd?version=latest">the documentation for my AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS API deployment collection here</a>, where you can use the Run in Postman button to kick the tires. If you have any features you&rsquo;d like to see added, or encounter any problems you can report it using <a href="https://github.com/union-fashion/operations/issues">the GitHub issues for the project operational repository</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">I am pretty psyched about these API deployment collections. I feel like they balance out having an entire list of each step of API deployment, while also abstracting away as much of the friction as we can when it comes to deploying APIs. My <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/04/21/api-deployment-collections--aws-api-gateway-and-dynamodb/">AWS API Gateway DynamoDB</a> and AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS API deployment API deployment collections only get me about 50% of the way there. Next I&rsquo;m going to have to add the ability to inject other code into my Lambdas behind each HTTP method that I deploy using a collection, if I am going to be able to meet all my needs when it comes to API deployment. Regardless, it is the biggest step I&rsquo;ve made in over a decade when it comes to changing my API deployment behavior, and I am pretty excited about the serverless layer in this design&mdash;it reflects how I like to think about the functionality behind each API capability I have.</p>

<p>title: ‘Running and Organizing AWS Lambdas with Postman Collections’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_04_20_at_9.16.29_am.png</p>

<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2020_04_20_at_9.16.29_am.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" />&lt;p class="p1"&gt;I am auto-generating and manually producing a number of Postman collection lately. I am creating a Postman collection that autogenerates AWS Lambdas from an OpenAPI stored in the Postman API builder, as well as a handful of infrastructure AWS Lambdas that accomplish bigger picture items like creating a database in RDS, or zipping up AWS Lambda packages to deploy APIs. So, I have a lot more AWS Lambdas laying around that I am needing to organize and put to use. I find the first rule of AWS Lambda club is remembering you created the thing in the first place and remember to actually put the thing to use—when you have so many of them laying around, you need a way to make them more discoverable, browsable, and usable in your everyday lives, something Postman excels at.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to deploying APIs with AWS infrastructure using a Postman collection, there were two things I couldn’t do purely with AWS APIs, which pushed me to create AWS Lambda functions that would get the job done. Demonstrating that I was going to be creating a growing number of Lambda functions that I was going to need to organize, retrieve, and execute regularly as part of my manual work, but also automated process, beginning with these two functions:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/10394726/Szf6Z9Kn?version=latest#42702fb3-00c3-401e-b371-8da9892a5bf7">Create AWS RDS Aurora SQL Table</a></strong> - There is no way to create a table using the AWS RDS API, so I created an AWS Lambda function that would let me pass in the table name and fields using environment variables, mounting the database and creating the table I needed.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/10394726/Szf6Z9Kn?version=latest#0401abaa-2fe4-4915-99f5-9614c994c277">Generate AWS Lambda Deployment Package</a></strong> - I was dynamically generating a lot of the code powering Lambdas, as well as the layers of Node.js dependencies they were using, so I created a Lambda script that would take files from an AWS S3 bucket and folder and generate a zipped up AWS Lambda deployment package.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://documenter.postman.com/view/10394726/Szf6Z9Kn?version=latest#intro">I then created myself a Postman collection simply named “utility lambdas”</a>, until I begin to see other logical boundaries and buckets for the AWS Lambdas I am developing—then I’ll create some better named Postman collections. There is a single AWS Lambda API path for invoking a Lambda function which conveniently uses the name of the AWS Lambda as a path variable. So all you have to do is create an individual Postman request that authenticates with the AWS Lambda API, plug in the name of your function as a path variable, and environment variables via the body of the request. And BAM! You have a single Postman request for quickly running an individual AWS Lambda. Being able to create individual requests for each Lambda is great, but what I really like is being able to organize the via folders and collections, helping make them more browse-able and searchable via the interface I use daily—Postman.</p>
<p class="p1">I enjoying bending what a Postman collection is for in these ways. There is no reason I can’t have a collection full of 50 requests to the same API, as long as I am changing one path, query, header, or body parameter—then naming and describing each API request appropriately, and breaking down into meaningful, logical, and human readable folders. Sure, I can search for my functions via the AWS Lambda console, but that means I remember the Lambda exists in the first place. Having Postman collections of my Lambdas organized into workspaces and collections, making calls to the AWS Lambda API to invoke specific functions makes my Lambda functions more tangible and usable, within the environment I am already working each day—<a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">I struggle with using the right words in my API storytelling. Striking a blend between what people are saying across the sector, and what people should be saying. There are many words and phrases in the space that help describe what it is they do, while there are others that confuse more than they describe anything in particular. Mostly I struggle because all of this API stuff can be complicated and very abstract, but also because I can be a little dyslexic at times, seeing some words as interchangeable, depending on what day it is. To help me (once again) think through the world of API definitions, I wanted to riff off of <a href="https://www.asyncapiconf.com/">my talk from AsyncAPI virtual conference this week </a>and peel back the layers of the API specifications, definitions and schema onion.</p>
<p class="p1">The words API specifications, definition, or schema are often used interchangeably as part of API discussions, but there are some realities on the ground when working with these artifacts that can increase the friction across operations if we allow them to be used interchangeably. It is pedantic as hell to want to write a story about the nuance of these terms, but if it helps me be more precise in my work, I&rsquo;ll do it. To help illustrate the dimensions here, I wanted to highlight the artifacts around the Slack API that I am using for my talk next week.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/talks/api-specifications-walk-through/#OpenAPI">Slack Web API&nbsp; OpenAPI</a></strong> - The <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> for the Slack Web API defines the surface area of this single HTTP API instance.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/talks/api-specifications-walk-through/#AsyncAPI">Slack Events API AsyncAPI</a></strong> - The <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI</a> for the Slack Events API defines the surface of this real time HTTP API instance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These two artifacts describe the surface area of specific APIs, leveraging two open source API specification formats, but also adopting a third API specification format that these two specifications use to describe the underlying schema being used as part of the structure for request and response, message, and event-driven APIs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both OpenAPI and Async API utilize <a href="https://json-schema.org">JSON Schema</a> for describing the underlying data structures used in APIs, which can also exist on their own as individual JSON Schema files, helping validate, annotate, and define JSON (and YAML) structures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/talks/api-specifications-walk-through/#JSONSchemaSlackWebAPI">Slack Web API JSON Schema</a></strong> -<span>&nbsp; </span>This a single JSON Schema object used in the OpenAPI above, but it also stands on its own.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/talks/api-specifications-walk-through/#JSONSchemaSlackEventsAPI">Slack Events API JSON Schema</a>&nbsp; </strong>-<span>&nbsp; </span>This a single JSON Schema object used in the AsyncAPI above, but it also stands on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In addition to using JSON Schema for allowing API providers and consumers to describe the surface area of HTTP, TCP, MQTT,<span>&nbsp; </span>AMQP, and other protocols used to define APIs, both OpenAPI and AsyncAPI also use JSON schema to define and validate their own schema. There are JSON Schema definitions for each of the OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications, which are used to validate that specific API definitions are valid, and following the spec.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/talks/api-specifications-walk-through/#OpenAPIJSONSchema">JSON Schema for the OpenAPI Specification</a></strong> - There is the JSON schema to validate that any OpenAPI is a valid OpenAPI.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/talks/api-specifications-walk-through/#AsyncAPIJSONSchema">JSON Schema for the AsyncAPI Specification</a></strong> - There is the JSON schema to validate that any AsyncAPI is a valid AsyncAPI.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If those layers of the API specification, definitions, and schema onion didn&rsquo;t make your eyes water, then maybe this layer will leave them watering a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/talks/api-specifications-walk-through/#JSONSchemaJSONSchema">JSON Schema for the JSON Schema Specification</a></strong> - Then there is the JSON schema to validate that any JSON schema is a valid JSON schema.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If I was to be pedantic about how I use the words specifications, definitions, and schema, I would try to be careful about how I use schema, knowing that people will assume you mean the JSON Schema specification for each individual API, or for the specifications themselves. Using my Slack API example I would consider OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">specifications</span>, with each usage of a specific to define each of the Slack APIs to be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">definition</span>. Keeping the JSON Schema layers used for validation as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">schema</span> portion, keeping things precise regarding the structure and format for each layer of APIs vs their specifications. Making for an eye watering number of layers when it comes to peeling back what we could possibly mean when it comes to saying API specification, definition, or schema.</p>
<p class="p1">One more nuance to this is I tend to not say OpenAPI definition or AsyncAPI definition, and instead just say the OpenAPI, or the AsyncAPI&mdash;the definition is assumed as part of each definition. To help me walk through this concept <a href="http://apievangelist.com/talks/api-specifications-walk-through/">I&rsquo;ve thrown together an Intro.js walk-through for the concept,</a> showing each of the moving parts I am talking about. Using the Slack APIs from my talk as the point of reference for each layer of this onion. I am not a big fan of saying there is a right way or wrong way of using these words, but I do think it can help reduce confusion and friction along the way if we use them more precisely. The problem with these three words is that they can have such a broad range of usage across many different concepts, topics, business verticals, and other domains. While I don&rsquo;t think I will get everyone on board with my view of the layers of this onion, I do think it will help me speak more coherently when it comes to my own storytelling around API specifications, definitions, and schema.</p>

<p>title: ‘We Should Have Built an API First’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/aws-s3-stories-losangeles-from-observatory-blue-circuit.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope-master/aws-s3-stories-losangeles-from-observatory-blue-circuit.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" />&lt;p class="p3"&gt;It has been a while since I wrote a simple breakdown of why APIs matter, but also why API-First matters. I went down the API-First rabbit hole with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/03/09/apifirst-design--code/">API-First [Design || Code]</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/03/10/apifirst-business/">API-First [Business]</a>, but I haven’t just made the basic case of why we should have built an API in the first place. It really isn’t a concept you full grasp until you’ve made the very costly mistake of being API-Last several times over, so it makes sense to break things down into a single blog post to help folks [hopefully] learn from without going down the same paths I’ve been in my application development career. To help on-board folks with what I mean when I say API-First, let’s recap how we got here with a simple finctional product API story.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h3>One Product Catalog With Multiple Destinations</h3>
<p class="p3">Products are a ubiquitous resource in an online world. By 2000, if we were selling products in the real world, we also began needing to publish products to a website, which by 2005 would morph more into a mix of database-driven web applications. However by 2010, we also needed to have the same products available in our mobile applications., resulting in a handful of channels we need our products available on.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Websites</strong> - Public websites that a product catalog need to be published to for consumption.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Web Applications </strong>- Specific web applications that need access to our product clog.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Mobile Applications </strong>- Making sure the product catalog is available via iPhone and Android phones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">In 2020, these channels are morphing iton a suite of single page and static applications that work across web and mobile properties, but the need for a single set of content or data for making available across these channels hasn’t changed. By 2010, most companies were realizing that HTTP APIs were the most effective way to deliver content and data across applications, and by 2020 this has emerged as the reality for more mainstream business.</p>
<h3>Multiple Applications Using Multiple Connections</h3>
<p class="p3">To satisfy the many different requests for access to the product catalog over the years, a handful of database connections have been given out to different teams to deliver a variety of web and mobile applications, with some teams creating additional data stores either replicating product data or augmenting it with additional details not available in the central database. Honestly, it is pretty difficult to know who has access to the database, and how data and content is used across applications because there has been no coherent approach to serving up product catalog content and data.</p>
<h3>Satisfying Product Catalog Integration Needs</h3>
<p class="p3">In addition to developing a mix of web and mobile applications over the years, each utilizing their own approach to accessing product catalog content and data, we’ve had hundreds of partners who we’ve given access to our product catalog using a variety of approaches intent on solving a particular business problem within a specific time and context, employing, but not limited to the following approaches:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>FTP Data Dump -</strong> Providing XML, JSON, or CSV files within a specific FTP location for internal and external users to securely access product catalog content and data.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Spreadsheets -</strong> Regularly exporting or publishing of a spreadsheet and emailing or otherwise sharing with a target audience, providing them with product catalog content and data.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Database Access -</strong> For some trusted stakeholders we provide direct database access to a specific subset of data in our database, providing access to the product catalog content and data.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Custom API -</strong> For other internal or external stakeholders we publish custom APIs providing access to only the product catalog content and data they need access from our systems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">There are many other ways in which we automatically and manually share product data, but these capture that primary ways the catalog is made available across stakeholders. Resulting in a maze of implementations over 20 years, which we have very limited visibility into and control over changing and evolving. Dramatically increasing the scope of our organizational technical debt, which isn’t limited to just our product catalog, and is a pain shared across every other digital resources we need to operate our business.</p>
<h3>Let’s Build An API To Solve All Of Our Problems</h3>
<p class="p3">Now that we have identified the pain of making product catalog content and data available, and realizing that this isn’t just limited to products, and exists across orders, invoices, services, scheduling, and every other aspect of operating our business, we are getting to work on an API—leveraging an API-Last strategy. Our API effort is hoping to standardize how applications are delivered, only using APIs for accessing content and data in ANY application, investing in the following areas:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Legacy Applications</strong> - All legacy applications will be wrapped in a new API, allowing requiring all applications switch to use the new API for access to content and data.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>New Applications</strong> - All new applications looking to access content and data will have to be done using an API that is developed as part of a common strategy.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Developer Portal </strong>- All APIs will be published to a single developer portal, providing a single location where applications and integrations can find APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Even as we embark on our comprehensive API development strategy to "solve all of our problems", new applications are being delivered using the old model, continuing to expand the surface area of our digital business, expanding the resources needed to conduct business each day. Teams aren’t aware of the new API practices and processes, or the business objectives of each of the individual applications is prioritized over the greater good of the organization and a centralized mandate for standardizing how content and at a is made available.<span> Leaving us realizing thath this will be a lot more work than we anticipated, and will need more resources.</span></p>
<h3>Moving From API-Last to API-First</h3>
<p class="p3">Moving from API-Last to API-First doesn’t happen with a flick of a switch. Most individuals will not grasp the API-First mandate until they actually experience the pain, and will continue to see API-First as yet another trend or marketing tactic. Until you have to consolidate many data connections across many different applications, and dealt with the pain of evolving the applications that depend on them, you just won’t see API-First as something that matters. Then, until you see how this echoes across all digital resources, experiencing challenges in different business domains, you won’t fully see the scope and critical nature of API-First, and how it can help tame the chaos.</p>
<p class="p2">Until you’ve felt the pain you won’t be motivated to think of API-First before you develop any application, or attempt any integration of migration. Until you’ve seen the cost savings of using a single API for web, mobile, device, and network applications, and any system to system integration, you won’t grasp the efficiency of being API-First. Until you’ve been stuck in a service agreement for 3-5 years and unable to move your data into or out of an application that doesn’t meet your needs, you won’t fully realize the importance of being API-First before you buy ANY software solutions. Until you’ve felt the API-Last pain, you will just see API-First as marketing fluff, but once you gone to hell and back in these ways, and were able to find sanity and balance being API-First, you will begin to see things quite differently.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are surprisingly few meaningful API numbers to showcase across the API sector. There are few API or API service providers who have a view of the landscape that can produce meaningful numbers, and most prefer to keep their numbers close to their chests for a variety of reasons. Over the last decade we've all grown accustom to <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/apis-show-faster-growth-rate-2019-previous-years/research/2019/07/17">the Programmable Web hockey stock chart showing the number of public APIs added to the PW directory</a>, due to the ubiquitous graphic being used in conference talks and blog posts since before 2010. I've always been a big advocate of API service providers developing and sharing their data, something that hasn't diminished at Postman.</p>
<p>Postman has a pretty unique view of the API landscape, possessing many interesting data points. The company is working on a strategy for compiling, organizing, publishing, and sharing the data it has in a thoughtful way, something that you can see trickling out through a variety of slides from recent events like the Postman Galaxy Tour, and Postcon last year. Like this one showing the growth in API collections, topping at 34.9M collections published in 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/growth_in_api_collections.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>The important thing with this visual is it reflects both private and public APIs. This graphis is just one of many data points Postman possesses that I am working to encourage packing up, so that others can reference and use, much like the ProgrammableWeb public API chart over the last decade. Visuals like this are important all of us making sense of what is going on, and be able to truly see the scope of what is happening.</p>
<p>I'd love to see other API service providers share their numbers, but like Postman, I understand it is difficult to do in a meaningful way that respects the privacy of your users, and the interests of your investors. I will keep pushing for more observability into the API community through the Postman lens, and hopefully produce some interesting visuals along the way. If there are specific numbers you'd like to see made available to the community, feel free to ping me. I'd love to hear more about the numbers that matter in your corner of the APi economy/</p>

<p>I got an email from GitHub after firing up an older Postman collection I had. The collection was originally engineered to just pass in a GitHub token using a query parameter, which historically has been accepted, but is something that will be going away soon. It makes sense, and while query parameters are much easier for authentication, using headers is just a more logical and secure way to pass your tokens in with each API call. The token usage itself isn't what caught my attention, what gave me pause was the usage of real time email to notify users of features they are currently using which will be going away in the future.</p>
<p>Here is the amil I got my GitHub about my usage of the deprecating access token query parameter:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p><span>Hi @kinlane,</span><br /><br /><span>On March 24th, 2020 at 03:55 (UTC) your personal access token ([TOKEN NAME) using [USER AGENT] was used as part of a query parameter to access an endpoint through the GitHub API:</span><br /><br /><a href="https://api.github.com/search/repositories">https://api.github.com/search/repositories</a><br /><br /><span>Please use the Authorization HTTP header instead, as using the `access_token` query parameter is deprecated. If this token is being used by an app you don't have control over, be aware that it may stop working as a result of this deprecation.</span><br /><br /><span>Depending on your API usage, we'll be sending you this email reminder on a monthly basis for each token and User-Agent used in API calls made on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span>Just one URL that was accessed with a token and User-Agent combination will be listed in the email reminder, not all.</span><br /><br /><span>Visit&nbsp;</span><a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param">https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param</a><span>&nbsp;for more information about suggested workarounds and removal dates.</span><br /><br /><span>Thanks,</span><br /><span>The GitHub Team</span></p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>I like this type of communication from API providers. I think this is a nice addition to any API management solution. Where you could flag any element of an API and when analytics reveals a developer using this feature, a transactional email is send off to the user. Allowing API providers to be more organized about how they plan for deprecations, and craft messages that go out to API consumers in real time, educating them about changes in the API landscape. Anyways, it was just a simple API thought out of my inbox for a Monday morning that I wanted to put out to the universe.</p>
