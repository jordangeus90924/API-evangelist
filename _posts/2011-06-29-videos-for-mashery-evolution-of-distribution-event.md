[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/evolution-of-distribution/mashery-evolution-of-distribution-event-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][1]The other week I attended an event put on by[Mashery][2], called[The Evolution of Distribution][1]. Mashery has published videos from the event on their site.

The event focused on the growing need to distribute information to a multitude of Internet connected devices using APIs, andMashery invited four leaders in the API space to showcase their experience:

  * [Daniel Jacobson][3], Director of Engineering for[Netflix API][4]
  * [Kumar Kandaswamy][5], Director,[Open API Platform Business for Best Buy][6]
  * [Adam Kleinberg][7], CEO of[Traction][8] and Mashable.com Tech Writer
  * [Edwin Aoki][9], Chief Architect of PayPal/eBay
Mashery did a great job in publishing video for each of the four talks online, as well as remarks by [Quentin Hardy][10] who moderated theEvolution of Distribution Speaker Panel.

You can find all the videos on the Mashery, [Evolution of Distribution page][1] on their site.
