{% include JB/setup %}<p>When I review a new API, I take a look at the technology they provide, but I tend to focus on the business of their API.One area I look at, is what tools they use to deliver the building blocks that make up their API.Did they build it themselves?Did they use Mashery, Apigee or 3Scale?Are they using other open-source tools or a software as a service (SaaS) provider?</p>
