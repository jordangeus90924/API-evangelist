			<p><em>24 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>When I want to understand a business sector as part of my overall analysis, or part of a specific API strategy, I kick off what I call a &ldquo;landscape targeting&rdquo; campaign. This time around I am interested in better understanding the the landscape of the payment API space. Every landscape targeting campaign begins with some Googling of the top key phrase, which this time is "payment API". From this I manually build a list of key players in the payment API space. My goal is to not build a complete list, but a list of the players doing it well&mdash;screw the rest. I only have time to target the best approaches, and in the payment space I find roughly 35 players, which I will publish later. While I am conducting this same procedure on all 35 payment companies, I start with the one I know the best, and feel will produce the most meaningful results&mdash;Stripe. To help me quantify Stripe&rsquo;s ecosystem landscape I execute the following: Pull a Twitter profile for @Stripe, which gives me a snapshot of their Twitter account, via the Twitter API Pull lists of @Stripe Twitter followers and friends Twitter IDs using the Twitter API Pull a Twitter profile for the followers and friends of @Stripe, so I have each of their names, bios, location, and friend / follower count Pull a Github profile for Stripe, which gives me a snapshot of their Github account, with overall activity, via the Github API Pull a list of all Stripe repositories using the Github API Pull a list of each repositories watchers, subscribers and contributors using the Github API Pull each of those repo watchers, subscribers and contributors Github profiles using the Github API Profile each Twitter follower using Full Contact API to obtain their alternate Github or LinkedIn profile Profile each Github user that shared their email address using Full Contact API to obtain their alternate Twitter or LinkedIn profile For Stripe,...[<a href="/2014/02/24/landscape-targeting-payment-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m working with Phil Legetter (@leggetter) to put together a panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam on APIs and realtime, and as I&rsquo;m working to bring together the leaders from the space together, I can&rsquo;t help but think of past APIStrat panels. At APIStrat we are looking to pull together the leaders from different business sectors and have a conversation on where we are, and where things are going with trends like API aggregation, automation, design, BaaS and realtime.
At APIStrat, NYC 203 we brought together the leaders from the backend as a service (BaaS) space, including Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of&nbsp;Parse, Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of&nbsp;Kinvey, Marc Weil (@marcweil) of&nbsp;Cloudmine, Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of&nbsp;Kii, Ty Amell (@tyamell) of&nbsp;StackMob&nbsp;James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of&nbsp;Firebase, resulting in a pretty interesting discuss about what is BaaS, and the future of the fast growing trend in using APIs for mobile development.
Fast-forward to March of 2014, Parse has been acquired by Facebook, Stackmob acquired by Paypal and shut-down just last week, and the speed at which the tech sector moves is really evident. I started tracking on BaaS in 2011, and just 3 years later the space has evolved fast&mdash;making conversations like the APIStrat BaaS panel critical in helping shape the industry.
As APIs + realtime technologies gain in popularity amongst startups and leading tech companies, its time to get together and have a conversation with leading tech companies in the realtime space like Pusher, Pubnub, Firebase, and Fanout.io to name a few. Much like BaaS, the important conversations around key trends in API like realtime, will be occurring at APIStrat.
These conversations are why the 3Scale team and API Evangelist put on #APIStrat, and look forward to you being part of these important discussions. Make sure you are registered for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 26-28th.

			<p><em>24 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working with the Cashtie API to pull together API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy. First up, is goals. What are the goals of your API initiative? Increase Awareness of API Program - The number one priority for any API, increase awareness that you even exist! Growth in New Users - Everyone wants new registrations for the API--it s a great goal, but don&rsquo;t get too caught up in just acquiring new users. Growth in Existing User API Usage - How do we encourage existing users to consume more, be more successful in using API resources. Brand Awareness - Elevate the awareness of not just an API but the overall company brand(s), establishing life long customers. These are just a few initial goals every company should consider when crafting an API evangelism campaign, but don&rsquo;t stop there, what are some other goals? New Customers For Other Products - Do you have other products and services you&rsquo;d like your API end-users to be aware of? Value Add For Existing Customers - Maybe you have an existing customer base you want to encourage development of products, services and features that add value to their existing engagement. Revenue - Money, of course, we all need to make money. How do we leverage API resources into new sources of revenue for our company? Having short term, and long term goals is essential to any API evangelism strategy. What are our long term goals? What goals do we have this week? How do they change over time? Documenting our goals is critical, so we can deliver on them, but also understand how we need to shift our goals to be more successful over time. Do you have goals for your API program that aren't listed here? Share them with me...[<a href="/2014/02/24/api-evangelism-strategy-goals/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>I've been polishing my version of the history of web APIs since I started API Evangelist. Through my research it became clear that the world of web APIs had evolved through several key phases that have gotten us to where we are at, and were essential in making the API economy a viable opportunity. So far my history tracks on 5 key phases: Commerce - The first wave of web apis came from commerce pioneers like Salesforce, eBay and Amazon deploying APIs to make commerce more distributed. Social - Early pioneers like Flickr, Delicious, Facebook and Twitter have made the Internet social by default using web APIs. Business - As APIs evolved API management providers like Mashery, 3Scale and Apigee have standardized the business approach of leading APIs, delivering tools and services that other API providers can put to use. Cloud - Amazon forever changed the way we compute using APIs, proving that we could deploy essential global infrastructure like compute, storage and DNS using web APIs. Mobile - The final piece of the puzzle was the mobile computing device, ushered in by Apple with the iPhone, followed up by Google with Android, mobile phones will forever change how we interact, with APIs delivering the essential resources we need to make mobile possible. In my opinion, the 2014 API economy wouldn't be possible if APIs hadn&rsquo;t developed and evolved through these stages. Commerce, social, business, cloud, mobile are all essential to a thriving API economy. Sure there are other APIs in other genres that fill in the cracks, but these five areas are the pillars that not only showed that APIs are viable, but will also be the pillars that the API economy rests on from here forward. As I track on the API space, I&rsquo;m trying to understand where we are at, and where we are going, hoping to identify the next phases of API history. I'm keeping an eye on trends like aggregation,...[<a href="/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
At API Strategy &amp; Practice in San Francisco last October, we streamed the event online. We are considering doing this again for #APIStrat in Amsterdam this March 26-28th.
We had an inquiry from Australia, asking whether or not we planned to do this for Amsterdam, and they wanted to stream some of the event as part of their local API meetup--what a great idea!
So we wanted to put out the word and see if there are other API meetup groups that were interested in doing the same thing in their local area. If you are interested in streaming the event go ahead and ping me on Twitter @kinlane or email me at [email&#160;protected].
If we get enough groups signed up, we&rsquo;ll make sure the stream is available for Amsterdam.

			<p><em>14 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on BaaS since 2011, and identified it was an important layer of the API space, dedicated to serving up the resources that mobile developers were needing to be successful. BaaS is all about creating meaningful stacks of API driven resources, allowing developers to build on top of a single backend, and not have to assemble their own from disparate open source tools, cloud service and individual API providers. During 2012 I saw the momentum picking up around BaaS and made sure I included it in my monitoring of the API space, resulting in a BaaS white paper, which I will be updating for 2014 to include recent shifts towards the enterprise. In February 2013, 3Scale and API Evangelist also brought together Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of&nbsp;Parse, Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of&nbsp;Kinvey, Marc Weil (@marcweil) of&nbsp;Cloudmine, Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of&nbsp;Kii, Ty Amell (@tyamell) of&nbsp;StackMob&nbsp;James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of&nbsp;Firebase to talk about the fast growing BaaS space at API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC&mdash;resulting in a pretty heated exchange between Ilya and Tye, which is ironic since these were the two acquisitions we saw in 2013 (which I alluded to at the closing of the panel, but you will have to watch for yourself). Here we are in 2014, Parse has been acquired by Facebook, and Stackmob has been acquired by Paypal. While Parse is still functioning as a viable BaaS platform, we got the news this week that Stackmob was shutting down as of May, no longer supporting developers. I think Parse and Stackob are the poster children for amazing new resources that capture the attention of developers, and while not all of them go away when acquisitions occur, it is something developers have become all to familiar with, and need to build in their own operational plans. I don&rsquo;t think we can blame Stackmob for their decision, I&rsquo;m sure many of you entrepreneurs will be faced with the same decision when you reach your goal...[<a href="/2014/02/14/what-is-the-future-of-backend-as-a-service-baas/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2014/02/14/jumpstarting-the-api-conversation-using-prototypes/">Jumpstarting The API Conversation Using Prototypes</a></h3>
			<p><em>14 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>For those of us who live and breathe APIs, it is easy to image what is possible when discussing an idea for an API, or what an API could to to transform an existing process or application&mdash;however for everyone else will often need something more to help them understand what is possible. Often times it is these folks who are the decision makers behind whether an API will live or die, so it is critical to help them get up to speed. In my experience there is no better way to jumpstart the conversation about what is possible around an API, than to just build a prototype, flushing out all aspect around an API resource. This is just what I recently did around the free financial student aid form, from the Department of Education. In November someone contacted me in government and told me how there had been a conversation around a potential API for the FAFSA form, but because of the usual undercurrents in government, the discussion had gone cold. My contacts in the federal government can&rsquo;t actually ask me to work on projects for free (and they didn't), but they can express their ideas of what "could be", then it is up to me if I want to help make this come true. This is one of the primary reason I left my own position in government as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, to give me more flexibility in designing and deployment projects, and also help federal agencies kickstart API initiatives from the outside-in. During November and December I worked on a prototype for what the FAFSA API could be, using my own approach to API project development, where I don&rsquo;t just design and develop the API, I tell the story of the process in real-time, publishing it all as a Github repository and site that anyone can follow, fork and put to use. By 12/15 I had a handful of API endpoints including...[<a href="/2014/02/14/jumpstarting-the-api-conversation-using-prototypes/">Read More</a>]</p>

The lineup is coming together for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, and you can find the schedule for the two days of keynotes, fireside chats, panels and sessions publish on the #APIStrat website.
Keynotes from Rackspace, Twitter, Runscope, and Absolut Vodka. Fireside with Tyler Singletary from Klout, Gordon Hollingworth of Software at Raspberry Pi, and Adam Duvander of SendGrid--with sessions on hypermedia, scalability, discovery, design and much, much more.
After successful events in New York City, and San Francisco, the momentum to Amsterdam is pretty exciting. 3Scale and I are thoroughly enjoying putting together the schedule which came together really fast, leaving us having to make some hard decisions on which talks to include, and which ones we had to decline.
There are still a handful of sponsorship opportunities available if your company would like to help support and participate in the conversation that is API Strategy &amp; Practice. I'm looking for to seeing everyone there in March!

			<p><em>13 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm been so busy with work lately, I haven't been able to maintain my usual rhythm of blog posts on API Evangelist. The good news is I'm doing some interesting work that I'm able to pull stories from. This post is from a forum post I made on the US Government API forum i frequent, which has some very interesting conversations about APIs in the federal government. In a recent post from Brian over at DC3 (Defense Cyber Crime Center), an interesting question was asked:&nbsp;Do US Government Web APIs Require System Interconnectivity Agreements? I will let you visit the conversation and see more detail around his question, as well as some of the other responses, but here were some of my thoughts: Web / http APIs do not fit earlier definitions of &ldquo;system interconnectivity agreements&rdquo;, which represents the technical and fundamental shift between network connections, SOAP APIs and this new world of web APIs.&nbsp;Web APIs were successful in part because of the loosely coupled nature of HTTP, leveraging a client / server and request / response. There is interconnectivity, but not the tight coupling and governance of previous network protocols and APIs.&nbsp; &nbsp;APIs are the contract! Each API endpoint provides access to a resource, then with accompanying management building blocks, you dial in that contract.&nbsp;At the&nbsp;API provider level, you can enforce / encourage interoperability using common web api approaches: API Definitions&nbsp;- Machine readable API definitions like&nbsp;Swagger,&nbsp;API Blueprint&nbsp;and&nbsp;RAML&nbsp;can provide templates that enforce / encourage common blueprints that providers can follow when publishing APIs to centralized or decentralized API management platforms, establishing base contracts for interoperability, as well as underlying data models. Terms of Use&nbsp;- Common terms of use can be established for management, allowing provides to contract their own TOS that is tailored for specific resources, but derived from common patterns. You see this emerging in private sector with&nbsp;Swedish API License. Licensing&nbsp;- Much like TOS, common licensing blueprints can be provided, allowing data and resource licensing...[<a href="/2014/02/13/do-us-government-web-apis-require-system-interconnectivity-agreements/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
At the same time I am processing the move by CVS to stop selling tobacco products in their over 7,600 retailsstores, making a commitment to being more retail healthcare, rather than just a corner drugstore&mdash;I am also wrapping my head around potential strategy and opportunities for the Cashtie API which opens up the ability for mobile developers to accept cash payments at CVS retail locations.
I think CVS&rsquo;s commitment to their healthcare mission, by itself is a pretty significant move towards reinventing themselves, but adding to the news, the White House just announced that CVS was onboard to work with standardizing patient prescription information as part of the Blue Button initiative, which works to give citizens control over their healthcare data&mdash;further defining CVS as more than just a corner drugstore.
As the healthcare industry continues its adoption of APIs, smart-phone adoption increase, the quantified-self movement expands, and retail drugstores like CVS look to increase their relevance, I think we will see an entirely new retail healthcare landscape emerge. When you take this seismic healthcare shift and pair up with powerful API resources like the Cashtie API, which have the potential to allow the underbanked who have recently gained access to healthcare, pay their premiums with cash&mdash;we wiill see a serious shift in how healthcare is delivered, and consumed.
I am seeing APIs emerge in various aspects of the healthcare industry ranging from the next generation of electronic healthcare records (EHR) to accessing vital health insurance information, but I think the role APIs will play in  this emerging retail healthcare space will be pretty significant in changing how we consume, pay for and interact with our healthcare.  Any company that serves the healthcare industry that doesn&rsquo;t have an API, will not stay relevant in this new API driven healthcare economy.

			<p><em>12 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>I did a Google Hangout with the Cashtie API development team this morning, which I thought was an interesting enough format to share with all of you. The Cashtie API team is a distributed team, between the corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Ukraine and Brazil. I&rsquo;m working on ways to help Cashtie with their API strategy, and wanted to get to know the team&mdash;what better way than using Google Hangout. While the call started with an introduction to the team, my goal was to spend some time walking through the Cashtie API with them, showing what I see, as a newbie to the developer area. Since I am a developer, I know how easy it is to be too close to the code, and you can miss some obvious things that may confuse API developers you are targeting. I shared my desktop in the Google Hangout, then walked through what I saw on the homepage, what the on-boarding process was like, and worked my way through their developer area, discussing their approach to delivering a dashboard, account settings, support, blog, and other areas of their API strategy. Alongside this walk-through I had other browser tabs open with the developer areas of Twilio, SendGrid, Gitub, and Stripe, comparing the building blocks these API leaders employ, with the building blocks the Cashtie team used. This really helps the team understand how other APIs, who potentially have more resources, and have been at this game longer, have deployed their own developer programs. This type of Google Hangout is something I will do regularly with the Cashtie API team (maybe others), hoping to expand their horizon when it comes to API deployment, bringing them out of their developer silo. This is one of the biggest problems I encounter with API development teams as I make my evangelist rounds--developers are often entrenched with their views and practices, because they never really are forced out of their bubble. Most developers, once you...[<a href="/2014/02/12/google-hangouts-for-bringing-your-api-developer-team-out-of-their-silo/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>In the days before the Internet when you had access to a valuable business resource, you kept it to yourself as long as you possibly can, hoping to maximize the potential to your business, and limiting other businesses access to the same resource--if possible you secured some sort of exclusive deal. In the age of the Internet, APIs have democratized access to extremely valuable resources, making them available to developers and businesses of all shapes and sizes. Resources like mapping from Google Maps, compute power from Amazon, and deployment of of phone numbers around the globe using Twilio, do not take millions of dollars and the negotiations of big deals, they are all accessible to anyone via web APIs. Even with this wider access to resources, it doesn't mean yCou can&rsquo;t tell compelling stories about the resources your startup has, like the ability to map from anywhere in the world, unlimited scaling of server capactiy and telephone access points around the globe. If you are a savvy startup you will discover and aggregate the best of breed API resources, then build a business and application around these resources, then tell stories that impress. The best example of this I&rsquo;ve seen recently is from PayNearMe, who has leveraged their expansion using API driven resources, resulting in the securing of 20M in funding from GSV Capital: Cash-Based Payments Network PayNearMe Raises $20M Series E, Expands Via Family Dollar Partnership http://t.co/gYLIC5i3Uz via @techcrunch &mdash; PayNearMe (@PayNearMe) February 6, 2014 The expansion to Dollar Store by PayNearMe was done via the Cashtie API, which gives you access to the point of sale systems at top retailers like Target, CVS and Dollar Stores. I&rsquo;m not saying that PayNearMe secured their 20M in funding exclusively based upon their expansion using Cashtie, but it did allow them to weave it nicely into their overall story, making for a nice investment for GSV Capital.

			<p>In 2010 I made a deal with my girlfriend Audrey Watters (@audreywatters), I&rsquo;d run the server infrastructure behind her blog Hack Education, and she&rsquo;d help me polish my storytelling on API Evangelist. Audrey studied folklore and storytelling as part of her masters degree, and I saw that the API space was desperately in need of some meaningful storytelling to help the fast growing space find its future&mdash;a perfect partnership! The API space is full of conversations (and arguments) about the technological building blocks of the space, and saturated with pitches for the products and services across the industry, but the sector is often deficient in stories that help newbies understand APIs, and veterans grasp the big picture of where we are going. For us to understand the space as it grows, make sense of technologies like hypermedia, and evolve approaches for communicating around APIs using definitions like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, we need stories&mdash;not press releases, not product pitches, we need stories that we can share and retell. Every once in a while you see great stories from the occasional technologist or passionate evangelist stand out from the noise, but lately I&rsquo;m seeing more API leaders step up and deliberately craft meaningful stories that help us better understand the API universe. This week I&rsquo;ve seen two great stories emerge with Why REST is More Like Religion than Most Technologies, from Mike Schinkel (@mikeschinkel), and Dark Matter in the API Universe by Jason Harmon (@jharmn). These stories aren&rsquo;t selling you on a specific technology or product, they are helping us understand the big picture, and tell us stories that help us understand a very complex space, which spans almost every business sector. These stories are critical to helping us all make sense of the API industry, and whether we acknowledge it or not, help lead us in a better direction, and even allow us to even laugh at ourselves from time to time.

			<p><em>06 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
While it may seem obvious that you should ask your API developers what they want, many times this is a simple task that can get lost in the shuffle of API deployment and management. API Evangelist is all about sharing, simple stories that keep API providers informed of the best practices of API management&mdash;today's story comes from big data platform Splunk.
Splunk is actively soliciting ideas from developers on where they think Splunk should take the platform, asking questions like, should we invest in SDKs for mobile devices like IOS and Android, and should we be adding a new kind of charting to the web framework? To solicit the feedback, Splunk isn&rsquo;t getting fancy, they just deployed a feedback area using UserVoice&mdash;allowing developers to submit their own ideas, and vote up the ideas of other developers.
Splunk wrote up a blog post soliciting the feedback of the Splunk community, which is something that you should do on a regular basis, not just at launch of your feedback area. Any API provider should be actively engaging their community, which will not just provide valuable feedback for the roadmap, it will bring you out of your bubble, forcing you to be closer with your developer ecosystem&mdash;which I believe is one of the healthiest side effects of an API way of life.

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been reviewing the recently released Marvel Comic API, because I&rsquo;m a comic book geek, wait no, because I&rsquo;m the API Evangelist&mdash;no wait it is both. Properly reviewing an API takes time because you need to spend time in the developers area, and actually go through the motions of hacking on an API. So far I&rsquo;ve registered, spent about 15 minutes looking around the documentation, and wrote a post on their getting started page. My friend Andreas Krohn (@andreaskrohn) started by first reviewing the Marvel Comics API terms of use, which is the first thing any savvy developer should do, and he wrote up a great blogs post called, The Marvel API - a case study in how to not respect developers. Andreas uncovers some pretty show-stopping aspects of the Marvel terms of use, &nbsp;including the fact that you can&rsquo;t generate any revenue from your applications built on the Marvel API, publish press releases about your work, and they reserve the right to take any idea you have, and keep for themselves. ;-( Through a developer lens, these are pretty clear signals that an API provider is more concerned with their own interests, and don&rsquo;t care about developers success, and it is probably a good idea to steer clear of integrating with the platform. Through the lens of a major publisher who is first entering this scary new world of APIs, it starts to makes more sense. This is why the terms of service is the single most important building block of any API--it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good your technical implementation of an API is, or how good your other building blocks like documentation are--if your TOS does not encourage innovation, developers will walk away. Even with these extreme limitations placed on the TOS, I&rsquo;m still very optimistic for the Marvel API. I agree 100% with Andreas&rsquo;s analysis, but we also have to also celebrate that a major publisher like Marvel even being willing to...[<a href="/2014/02/06/apis-are-about-iterating-on-not-just-the-tech-but-also-the-business-and-politics-of-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
One of my biggest challenges at API Evangelist is keeping content accessible for people who have just come into the API space. The most successful aspect of my site is the blog, and while I try to keep all my writing targeted outside the developer community, it can be a lot of work to jump in and get up to speed on posts that are chronological.
It is really important to me, that people who are just learning about the space, or weekend API warriors can find the best resources across the space, not just on my blog&mdash;this is why I&rsquo;m super stoked about the new site from 3Scale called API Alchemy.
API Alchemy is looking to curate the best of resources from the API space, providing curated links and commentary and access to the most influential authors across the world of APIs, in an easy to discover format.
API Alchemy isn&rsquo;t just for newbies either. Now when you are looking for that kick-ass rant from Steve Yegge, or Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API by that blowhard Kin Lane, you can find it in one place.
Now I have a place to publish the best of the best I find across the API space, and somewhere to send people of all skill levels&mdash;API Alchemy.&nbsp;Nice work 3Scale team!

			<p><em>05 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>It is easy to think of Github as a central repository for your open source code&mdash;most developers understand that. I have written before about the many ways to use Github as part of your API management strategy, but in the last few months I'm really seeing Github playing more of a central role in the overall lifecycle of an API. API Presence Github Pages provides a very simple way for API providers to deploy public or private portals that can be a simple or elaborate doorway for developers to learn about and engage with APIs. A company can potentially have a single or multiple API portals, targeting a variety of potential consumers. You don't need a special website for your API anymore, just fire up a Github Page and get publishing the relevant building blocks your consumers will need. API Definition As I continue to study the world of API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, I'm increasingly finding API definitions published to Github, as well as employing it as a central storage for all my own API definitions. When 3Scale and API Evangelist designed API Commons, we allowed the publishing of API definitions to Github to be one of the ways you can include your API definition in the commons. By publishing your API definition on Github, either publicly or privately, you can provide a central definition of your API surface area, that can be versioned, forked, downloaded, and allow for contributions from other key players in your API ecosystem. API Services During my monitoring of the API space, I came across a new API monitoring service called AutoDevBot, which monitors all your API endpoints, and notifies you when something goes wrong. Pretty standard feature in a new wave of API integration tools and services I&rsquo;m seeing emerge, but what is interesting is they use Github as a central place to store the settings for the API monitoring service.

			<p><em>05 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
It is easy to get excited about the potential around &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. Many individuals and companies feel this latest trend is all about offering up big data solutions with business models that are built around algorithms, that founders consider their &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo;.
I don't have a problem with this, more power to you, however I personally feel big data solutions, especially those within government should be more transparent than many of the secret sauce, big data approaches we&rsquo;ve seen to date.
Alex Howard (@digiphile) has a great post at TechRepublic, called data-driven policy and commerce requires algorithmic transparency, which outlines this very well.  Alex uses the the phrase "algorithmic accountability&rdquo;, which I think sums all of this up very nicely.
When it comes to big data solutions, especially in the public sector, it is fine to collect large amounts of data, offer up analytics, visualizations and other big data tools, but algorithmic accountability is something that will be essential in moving forward and building trust across all indusries when it comes to big data.

			<p>
I wrote about the interesting approach by Plivo the other day around their Voice Chat API, in which one thing they did really caught my eye, and reflects what I think is the future of APIs&mdash;the deployment of the API to Heroku.
This type of very modular, cloud deployment of fine grain APIs is something that I&rsquo;ve blogged about recently in Modular APIs Driven From Github Blueprints Using OpenShift, Server Side API Templates On AWS Cloud Formation And OpenShift, and Caching APIs With CloudFormations Or OpenShift.
As part of the Voice Chat API, Plivo allows you to deploy an instance of the open source audio conference API to your own Heroku account. This is an interesting way to empower developers to deploy API resources, allowing them to allocate them within their preferred cloud environment, whether it is Heroku, Amazon, OpenShift from Redhat, or any other provider.
I haven&rsquo;t investigated if there are any dependencies between the Voice Chat API and Plivo, but even with dependencies, this approach still holds a lot of promise. This gets us closer to some of my earlier thoughts around virtual API stacks, that allow us to build, manage and put to use the most meaningful stack of APIs possible for our applications&mdash;think backend as a service (BaaS), but custom fit to exactly the resources we need.

			<p><em>01 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
A free, open-source, API driven conference solution called Voice Chat API popped up on my API monitoring radar today, as I was going through my feeds. The Voice Chat API is a very cool, dead-simple conferencing solution. As a tool it provides clear value, and I really like the approach from Plivo to rollout out an open, API driven resource like this&mdash;a model that could be applied to other valuable resources.
What really stands out is the Voice Chat API does one thing and does it well&mdash;audio conferences. It is easy to tell what it does. We aren't having to convince users of a problem, then sell them on a solution. The problem is clear, the solution is simple.
Open Source The Voice Chat API is open source and available on Github, built using "Plivo WebSDK and APIs&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t investigated the separation between what code is open source, and where the dependencies on Plivo is, but regardless the approach is interesting.
Add-Ons Providing users with more ways to deploy a conference, the Voice Chat API provides a set of add-ons including a Hubot Plugin, that works in Campfire or Hipchat, a Chrome extension, and a bookmarklet for deploying a conference from any other browser.
API The Voice Chat API centers around its API,&nbsp;which allows developers to create a unique audio conference, the call mobile &amp; landline phone numbers (PSTN) into the bridge. The API deploys to your Heroku account, allowing you do manage your ad-hoc audio conference deployments in the cloud.
I&rsquo;m still playing around with the Voice Chat API, understanding how the application and the API works, as well as considering how this new open source approach dovetails with Plivo's business model, but now I&rsquo;m intrigued which the approach, and how they crafted this API driven resource.

			<p><em>01 Feb 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m currently reviewing the Marvel Comics API, and their approach to making their rich content available via a simple web API.
They did a great job deploying the API. To start with they published very simple and honest getting started steps:

Sign Up - Get an API key
Be A Good API Citizen - Read, understand, and abide by the terms of use for the Marvel Comics API
Link Back - Observe the attribution and linking guidelines when displaying data from the API
Keep In Touch - Tell us about what you're building and talk to other developers on our community page
Build Cool Stuff!

I like their style. As a building block, getting started pages are pretty important, yet most API providers provide very dry, technical steps for on-boarding with an API&mdash;if at all.
The Marvel Comics API is a refreshing approach to explaining to developers how to get up and running with the API. Its nice to see from such a big brand.

			<p><em>31 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>As a proprietor of a small, successful niche blog, I can easily share some insight into why Google recently started punishing blogs that have guest posts. At API Evangelist I get about two offers a week from random companies and individuals asking to guest post on my blog. These people cite several reasons for wanting to do it, ranging from me helping them as an aspiring blogger, to them helping me with more content and traffic. If you know me, you know I don't have a problem producing content, and I do not blog because I give a shit about pageviews. In addition to these smaller, much frequent requests for guest posting. I also get the occasional bigger company looking to &ldquo;partner&rdquo; with me, when in reality they have no desire to partner and generate value for my readers, or move my research forward. These conversations start out entertaining my perspective of partnering and bringing me value, but once I choose to dance with these partners, they almost always start getting heavy handed about me publishing what they want, and providing links to their own sites and content. My friend Mike Schinkel has a great post on this very topic, echoing much of what I&rsquo;m saying. Mike is like me, he blogs for himself, not to generate pageviews. I started API Evangelist to help me better understand the API space, and while I do have a mission of also educating the masses about APIs, the primary directive is still about educating myself&mdash;without this none of it matters. The reason Google has begun cracking down is because it is in their best interest to ensure blogs are of the highest quality, unique content possible. What these &ldquo;guest post farmers&rdquo;, and the enterprise companies that employ this same practice don't realize, is their aren&rsquo;t generating any value, they are extracting and diminishing the value of these blogs, and this is what has catching Google&rsquo;s attention.

			<p>I am working through some deeper research into the world of API design, and specifically into the world of API definitions. This research involves talking to each of the leading providers, crafting a series of stories along the way, resulting in a white paper that provides an overview of the space and possibly where things are going. During my conversations with Tony Tam (@fehguy) of Wordnik, creator of Swagger, Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril) and Z (@zdne) of Apiary, creators of API Blueprint, and Uri Sarid (@usarid) of Mulesoft, creators of RAML, I asked a simple question: What is the vision behind your API definition format? Resulting in a little insight behind each approach: Swagger - The vision behind Swagger was not to make a company or to get people to use our service, it was strictly to solve a workflow problem. Initially the goal was centered around documentation and client tooling, but quickly realized it was much bigger, and became about managing the overall lifecycle of APIs. API Blueprint - API Blueprint is all about simplicity, and allowing people to have a structured conversation around an API, with the people who are actually going to be using it. Apiary is the conduit for this conversation, allowing developers to easily create a mock interface from the blueprint, share with consumers, and iterate as necessary. RAML - The motivation behind RAML was about seeking one source of truth, and a basic representation of an API. We used Swagger and API Blueprint, but neither fully met our vision. RAML was born, and is in alignment with Mulesoft's design first approach, and gave them the ability to design an API in a format that allowed them to sit down with stakeholders in a webinar and get instant feedback&mdash;bringing the API to forefront, not the implementation. These are my summarizations of what Tony, Jakub, Z and Uri said in response to my question, not direct quotes.

			<p>I was having one of my regular Google Hangouts with the OG API Evangelist John Musser (@johnmusser) the other day as I was flying back from east coast, and he made a comment about my classic API Evangelist drawing, and said I should write the ten commandments of APIs. At first I thought, not my style, but on second thought, what the hell. Here they are: Deliver Value - Generate value for consumers, without value APIs mean nothing. Provide Documentation - Provide clean, simple, up to date API documentation for users. Code Libraries - Deliver code sample, libraries, SDKs, or starter projects in a variety of languages. Provide Support - If you don&rsquo;t support your APIs, your efforts won&rsquo;t be sustainable. Don&rsquo;t Break Minimize Breaking Shit - You will never establish trust with consumers if you break your shit all the time. Business Model - Without a business model for your API, they will not be sustainable. Terms of Service - Establish TOS that protect your company's interests, but allow consumers to prosper and grow. Security - Establish solid security practices that keep your resources secure, while also protecting all users involved. Privacy - Passionately protect the privacy of your API consumers and end-users. Tell Stories - Craft and tell meaningful stories about the value your APIs deliver or nobody will will know or care about them. These are my 10 commandments for API providers, and represent what I think are the 10 most important elements of delivering APIs. If you follow these 10 commandments, in your API design, development, deployment, and management you will find happiness. ;-) These commandments won&rsquo;t guarantee your success in the market, but they will guarantee that you will learn and grow in your API initiative, whether its internal or external&mdash;which in my opinion is the most important aspect of adopting an API way of life.

			<p><em>30 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm continuing my exploration of the possibilities of offering up a wholesale version of an API resource. While wholesale is not an option for all types of APIs, there are a subset of APIs that are more utility in nature and would lend themselves nicely to being sold wholesale to other API providers. I want to better understand the nuts and bolts of what it will take to offer up APIs in this way, and for this exercise I&rsquo;m going to explore providing my recent screenshot API as a wholesale API that other API providers could resale alongside their own resources. An API provider could have their own news, content or other resources, and decide it would be more cost effective to resell my screen capture API, rather than design, deploy and provide their own. I have designed, developed and deployed my screenshot API, now what do I need to make it available wholesale? Definition - I'll need to have some sort of API definition in API Blueprint, Swagger or RAML to be able to communicate my interface and underlying data model to other providers in a machine readable way that lets them interface with it, as well as potentially develop other tooling around their resale of my resource. Proxy - I don't think this this one is a requirement, as some providers would prefer to develop their own proxy layer, but providing a proxy harness that other API providers could use to deploy my API, as a resource within their domain would be a nice to have. Providing it in a variety of languages including PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Java and Node.js would sensible. Management APIs - To support wholesale interactions I would need a set of my own APIs that providers can use to accomplish common API management features like usage volumes, rate limits, and user management if applicable. These services would have to be available as APIs so that providers could seamlessly...[<a href="/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I recently talked with the AT&amp;T API team about their recent Sabre partnership, which I thought was a pretty interesting approach to evolving your API strategy, by leveraging your partners.  As we discussed the overall AT&amp;T API strategy and their approach to partnering, we also discussed the evolution to their hackathon strategy and how they've added workshops to their event toolbox.
While AT&amp;T is very much committed to having hackathons, they didn't always deliver the understanding and feedback around their APIs that they were looking for and decided to develop a workshop format around their developer programs. A workshop is about sitting a group of developers down in a room, provide them with workbooks and other structured content, as well as more direct engagement with the AT&amp;T API team.
I recently spoke with Brian Koles (@BrianKoles) from ChallengePost on the subject, and he says it is what their developer challenge platform company is also witnessing occur in the space. A majority of companies that approach them to do hackathons, in reality don't get what they desire from the more open hackathon format. These companies are looking for a safer, more controlled environment, where they can educate developers about their APIs, and receive quality feedback and measurable results around their API programs.
While a workshop may not be as attractive as the exciting and more intensive hackathon format, it is something that can deliver more meaningful results to your company, as well as reach an audience that probably isn't that interested in spending their weekends, staying up all night, building apps they won't use&mdash;they just want to learn more about your API, and understand how it can solve real-world problems, in their everyday lives.

			<p>The Noun Project recently&nbsp;launched their API, and after getting off the phone just now with a publication, I looked to see if I had written it up&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t. I had a lot of thoughts in an Evernote, but I had not really shared my thoughts on why I think The Noun Project API is significant. If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, I use The Noun Project a lot across the API Evangelist Network. Not all of my images are directly from The Noun Project, but they reflect they same general approach. I use The Noun Project for two main reasons: On-boarding Users With Abstract Concepts - It can be hard to convey the often abstract concepts around APIs, and a single, concise image really goes a long way in bringing a user quickly up to speed with what I&rsquo;m talking about. Simple &amp; Minimalist - The Noun Project images just look good with the overall API Evangelist look and feel. I don&rsquo;t think this stops with just my website, I think a simple, minimalist image goes a long way in blending in with any site, without cluttering the overall look. When publishing content online, whether its blogging or publishing a list of local events, it can be difficult to capture and keep the attention of your audience. A simple, concise image can go a long way to help convey the meaning of a blog post, event listing, or other content, and on-board users with what you are dishing up, and this is where The Noun Project comes in. The Noun Project gives you an API to search, pull and manage simple image representations for a person, place, thing, animal or idea. I use a single Noun Project image to accompany each blog post, as well as other elements of my work such as API building blocks, and tools. The API allows me to integrate images in this way, seamlessly within my content management system. While I use...[<a href="/2014/01/27/why-is-the-noun-project-api-significant/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working with a very interesting new API offering from the retail focused InComm, dubbed the Cashtie API. Over the last two decades InComm has worked hard to build relationships with major retailers, resulting in a very hard to establish presence at the cash register of major retailers like Walmart, Target and CVS. InComm&rsquo;s new Cashtie API opens up access to retailers point of sale (POS) systems, allowing any approved developer to sell online goods to consumers at these high value retail locations&mdash;opening up the possibility for web and mobile applications to accept cash payments for virtual goods, services and utilities at top retailers. InComm is the company behind gift card activation solutions for all those major gift cards you see everywhere, and digital barcode solutions that we are getting familiar with when purchasing physical goods like a coffee at Starbucks, but the Cashtie is pushing commerce into an entirely new realm. These earlier solutions are about buying physical goods with virtual gift cards and online accounts, where the Cashtie API is about allowing buy digital goods at retail locations with cash. The immediate use of cash for purchasing virtual goods can be applied to the hottest virtual products like online movies, music and gaming. Think of the possibilities for impulse buys at the cash register of Walmart and Target, when you aren&rsquo;t limited to the physical items that surround the cash register, but expanded into an unlimited world of digital goods and services. Opening up cash payments for digital goods to all retail consumers is interesting, but the application that really gets me interested, is delivering applications to what is considered as the unbanked, and underbanked across the nation. According to the FDIC, 8.2 percent of US households are unbanked, representing 10 million in total, as well as 20.1 percent of US households are underbanked, which represents 24 million consumers&mdash;this is a pretty significant audience to reach with online goods and services.

Amazon has an interesting new service called Instant Access, which follows a trend I&rsquo;m seeing in commerce, that allows the sales of digital goods, not just in-app like Amazon&rsquo;s In-App Purchasing does, but let&rsquo;s you sell your digital wares on Amazon.com.
This new service allows you to list and sell your digital goods on Amazon.com, just like the physical goods you normally associate with Amazon. This opens up your digital products to the heavy traffic of Amazon.com, as well as the other perks like discoverability, reviews, and the payment systems that the Amazon platform enables.
Amazon Instant Access connects customer&rsquo;s profiles with your application profiles, and triggers digital products sales in your system, using your API. To do this, you provide Instant Access with API endpoints for triggering profile creation or linkage, and for initiating digital product sales that are coming from Amazon.com.
Now you can generate new sales, as well as allow your existing customers to use Amazon.com for searching, browsing and purchasing your digital products&mdash;changing the dynamics of virtual commerce. This opens up another reason for you to have APIs for your customers, as well as for your physical and virtual products. If you don&rsquo;t have APIs, you will be limited to attracting customers and sale of your products via your website and applications.
If you do have APIs for your customer profiles, and physical and virtual products and services, you can open up the sale of your products via 3rd party platforms, including commerce giants like Amazon.com.

			<p><em>25 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve done 3 stories over the last week about the Panoptix API from Johnson Controls (JCI). I try to regularly check in with the John Bernd (@jkbernd) and Simone Vigano (@viganosimone)&nbsp; of the Panoptix API team, and see what they are up to in the world of building efficiency APIs.
What make this possible is their willingness to share stories, trust in me that I&rsquo;m going to tell these stories in the best possible light, but also no fear of what people think of their approach. John and Simone share my humble view, that we are all just figuring this shit out as we go along. Of course it is based upon experience, and both sensible strategical and tactical execution, but in the grand scheme of things, there is no single master plan for success.
You'd be surprised at the number of people who call me, share stories about their internal API operations, then conclude the conversation by telling me that I can&rsquo;t tell publicly for fear of what the public will think, or fear of upsetting folks within their own company. Sometimes I tell the stories with names and identifying elements scrubbed, but often I just add to my wealth of knowledge of move on.
Teaching individuals and companies how to tell stories and open up, and be more transparent, is the number one benefit of APIs in my opinion. All the business benefits in new revenue streams, efficiency, agility, innovation and all the other reasons I often cite are secondary to helping companies learn to open up.
What is your company&rsquo;s stance on storytelling, and sharing both the good and bad of your API operations?

One of the areas I track on is what I call the API reciprocity space, which is all about interoperability between platforms, but I label it reciprocity as an attempt to capture that it isn&rsquo;t just about old school Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) of the old days&mdash;today it is about ETL in the cloud, plus adhering to the intent of not just platforms, but the users interest as well.
When thinking of API reciprocity, think If This Then That (IFTTT), Zapier and Temboo. I&rsquo;ve been watching Temboo evolve with their API driven, platform to platform solutions, but I&rsquo;m really interested in there latest moves to support web platforms to the Internet of Things using the Arduino platform, specifically using the Arduino Y&uacute;n micro controller board.
Temboo has been working hard recently to connect the Arduino Y&uacute;n to over 100 web-based resources and services like Facebook, Twitter and Dropbox.  The Arduino Y&uacute;n gives you connectivity to lights, motion, sound, temperature and other sensor based devices, and Temboo provides the connectivity between these sensors to the numerous API driven resources in the cloud.
Taking it to the next level, Temboo has released Sketch Builder, an application that allows anyone to design interactions between Arduino Y&uacute;n and Temboo enabled cloud services. This opens up this type of Internet of Things to web service interaction design, development and deployment to anyone, not just developers.
APIs are moving forward at a very rapid pace, and as we move from the mobile era of APIs into the Internet of Things phase of APIs, the pace is going to quicken. APIs aren't just about social, cloud and mobile anymore&mdash;innovators like Temboo at bridging all of the APIs driven platforms we depend on, to our physical world via sensors.

Saturday afternoons are great for closing out tabs I&rsquo;ve had open all week, and the theme this Saturday is APIs and the Internet of Things. This time it is about controlling your Internet of Things using voice the Thingspeak Talkback API and the Arduino Y&uacute;n, which seems to be the darling of API to Internet of Things projects.
The Thingspeak Talkback API allows for the adding, updating, deleting and executing of voice commands. It acts as a middleware for the Arduino Y&uacute;n, allowing IoT devices to to be able to check for commands that need executing&mdash;providing an API driven queue of voice commands for all of the Internet connected devices in your life.
As the cost of connecting everyday objects to the Internet gets easier and cheaper, it is fascinating to see the different approaches that providers take to connect these objects to the web. Thingspeak is choosing to go the voice route, where Temboo is betting on the fact that people want to connect IoT devices with their existing cloud platforms and services.

			<p>I received a press release from AT&amp;T last week, about a new partnership with Sabre to develop what is called location information services (LIS). Ben Kepes has a good summary of the partnership over at Forbes, so I won't add my own analysis of what the partnership means. After speaking with the AT&amp;T team today, and I&rsquo;d prefer to focus on the importance of partnerships when developing your own APIs--sharing AT&amp;T's wisdom with my audience When listening to Laura Merling and Chris Aron of AT&amp;T talk about the Sabre partnership, I couldn't help but think about the importance of working with trusted partners, in developing your valuable API resources. In the open API world, many companies open themselves up to iterating on API resources with a large group of public developers, a process that can make your API strategy feel very schizophrenic&mdash;in contrast making designing, developing and iterating on API design in closed environment with trusted partners much more, well sane. Location Information Services With Transportation and Travel Partners The location information services that AT&amp;T is partnering with Sabre on, began as a set of location services they first worked with AAA on to help them locate drivers in need of roadside assistance. Now AT&amp;T is working with Sabre to evolve these same location APIs and expand not just to new business sectors like travel or retail, but improve accuracy of a mobile user's location by not just using a cell signal, but also wifi and bluetooth. Mobile Identity Toolkit With Banking and Financial Partners In addition to location APIs, AT&amp;T recently developed a mobile identity toolkit and what better way to help define the most valuable toolkit possible, then to work with banking and financial partners to design and deploy a toolkit that reflect exactly what they need. The result is a set of API fueled services that makes apps more secure, and reduces fraud via mobile devices.

			<p>Some of the best stories I hear as the API Evangelist, are the internal success stories around API efforts. Everyone wants to be the next Twilio success story with their API, but in reality the API use cases that will make the biggest impact, will be the ones within your own organization. In my story queue I have two stories coming from very different API efforts, but they both have a similar theme regarding APIs starting conversation internally&mdash;something that couldn&rsquo;t have occurred, if they didn&rsquo;t already have APIs. Johnson Controls (JCI) / Panoptix While talking with the Panoptix team last week, they told me about making the rounds within JCI to talk APIs and strategy with other groups, and how they were surprised to learn that another group within JCI not only had heard of the Panoptix API, they had already integrated with it. Apparently the separate group caught wind of what Panoptix was up to and because the API was self service, they registered, began playing with, and found a use for the resources, and integrated into their own operations. A great story of not just internal API usage, but of self-service APIs, and how API can change things within an organization without you even knowing. City of Philadelphia I had the pleasure of drinking a beer with head data guy, Mark Headd (@mheadd), for City of Philadelphia last night. As we exchanged war stories he mentioned a city agency that he went to visit to discuss their data resources, and how the conversation had quickly shifted to discussing other available city API resources, that they could put to use in their own operations. While working in the federal government this is one area I see APIs having the biggest impact--inter-agency API usage. In Philly, Marks role is to go around and assess the open data resources of each group, and the potential for deploying APIs, but quickly he is finding that making agencies...[<a href="/2014/01/24/opening-up-internal-opportunities-because-you-have-an-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
According to Keir Clark over at Google Maps Mania, we are seeing The Slow Death of the Google Maps API. Who else could read the tea leaves, when it comes to an API, than a blogger who is dedicated to covering the innovation that comes out of a single API ecosystem.
Clark has noticed that "there seems little sign of the Google Maps API team returning from their two year vacation&rdquo;, and "at the same time the MapBox team has continued to innovate and has now become the maps API of choice for most developers&rdquo;.
While nobody knows the reasons Google Maps has stopped innovating (except Google), it is clear that you can&rsquo;t stop delivering value to developers, or they will migrate elsewhere to find the API resources they need for their applications&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are Google, or any other tech giant.
Mapping darling Mapbox, and open source JavaScript library Leaflet has seemed to captured the attention of developers by delivering simple, open solutions&mdash;while also continuing to iterate and deliver features that keep up with the needs of developers.
The Google Maps API is one of the API pioneers listed on my History of APIs, but much like Delicious, maybe the age of Google Maps is coming to a close. I&rsquo;m sure many mainstream websites and applications will use Google by default because of the advertising and SEO opportunities, but for developers who care about providing beautiful, seamlessly blended maps that add value to their websites and apps, I think Google Maps just isn&rsquo;t going to do it anymore.

			<p><em>22 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time diving into the evolving world of API design over the next couple of weeks. There is a rapidly emerging community of companies, tooling and approaches to designing and developing APIs, that is centered around API definition languages. Languages for defining web services have been around for a while, with Web Application Description Language (WADL), which was born out of the SOAP WSDL era, representing very technical approach to describing this new world of web APIs. While WADL is still in use, it hasn&rsquo;t seen the adoption many envisioned. It wasn&rsquo;t until recently that we&rsquo;ve seen new approaches emerge, and get traction, with JSON based API definitions like Swagger from Wordnik, and I/O Docs from Mashery. The primary motivation behind defining your API using Swagger or I/O Docs has historicaly been to deploy interactive documentation for developers, with discovery, client-side code generation, server-side code generation and other tooling as secondary motivator, if at all. In the last year we&rsquo;ve also seen even newer approaches to designing and defining APIs emerge, with the introduction of markdown based API definitions like API Blueprint from Apiary, and RAML from Mulesoft. This new markdown approach is&nbsp;providing languages for describing and defining APIs that holds the promise of even being accessible to non-developers. I have time scheduled to talk with each of the providers listed above in the coming weeks, but after a talk with the API Blueprint team from Apiary, I&rsquo;m reminded of how the motivations for API definitions is continuing its rapid expansion. When you are motivated to use API definitions for just generating API documentation, you miss so much opportunity for communicating, collaborating and iterating during the planning and design of your API. API Blueprint was born out of Apiary, so it is rooted in the desire to design and mockup APIs, all while collaborating with other key players and the actual consumers of the API. If you wait to generate an API definition...[<a href="/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

The team over at Panoptix turned me on to the the Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED) platform being developed over at the Department of Energy, which aims to be an API for collecting, storing and analyzing building energy performance data.
It appears that DOE is looking to develop open source software that state and local governments can use to manage energy efficiency across their buildings.
I like the approach to develop an open source, API driven platform that can set the tone for how data can be collected, managed, and shared. I think this is a great way to lead in an industry, and bring together not just government entities but other private sector players.
SEED is something I&rsquo;d love to see work, and an API design I&rsquo;d love to see in the API Commons. If you are part of the SEED project, I&rsquo;d love to talk more. I pinged the email on the site, but haven&rsquo;t heard anything.
Good stuff coming out of DOE lately.

			<p><em>21 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I'm heading to Philly this week, to participate in a panel on Openness: Should We Create a More Transparent World, at the Franklin Institute, as part of EduCon.
The panel will run from 6-8PM, and include:

Jaime Casap (@jcasap), Global Education Evangelist at Google
Sunny Lee (@soletelee), Project Lead, Mozilla Open Badges
Homa S. Tavangar (@growingupglobal), Author of Growing Up Global: Raising Children to be at Home in the World
David Wiley (@opencontent), Co-Founder of Lumen Learning

The conversation will be centered around education, as it is part of Educon, which is focused on discussing the future of schools. I like participating in panels like this, as it sheds new light on what open really is--not just the tech, but business and politics, in one of the most important aspects of our economy.
I'm excited to be on the panel and participate in the conversation at Educon, which represents the increasinglly overlapping of my world of APIs and open data, and education technology, which is the domain of my partner in crime @audreywatters.

I was playing with the Noun Project API today. If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, I use the Noun Project throughout the API Evangelist network. The simple, black and white icons work very well with my minimalistic look, and help me convey some very abstract API concepts.
As I was reviewing the Noun Project API, looking at what resources are available via their API endpoints, I noticed a /usage endpoint,  which lets you understand your API usage, as well as the rate limits for your API access level. This isn&rsquo;t revolutionary, its something I've seen on other APIs, but it is an important resource I think many API owners overlook.
Providing an API usage endpoint by default for all APIs makes sense. Developers can either build into their apps, or just setup some sort of daily job, that alerts them when they are approaching API rate limits. Much like push notifications on your bank account or other online resources, a usage API will go a long way in helping developers quantify and understand what resources they have available to them, as well as what they consume on regular basis.

			<p>I look at a lot of APIs--some are crap, some make sense, a few are interesting, and every great once in a while you see an API that you know will be one of the next big API platforms. I&rsquo;m reviewing one such API, Evercam.io. I know that Evercam.io will be be big, because it bridges an increasingly ubiquitous technology&mdash;the camera. Whether its its for home or commercial usage, Internet connected cameras represents low hanging fruit for applying proven API techniques. Evercam.io was born out of experience working at a cloud CCTV company, where the Evercam team realized the opportunity was about becoming a developer platform that enabled any developer to interact with potentially hundreds of types of cameras, while also applying modern API techniques to the world of security and webcams. Cameras + Oauth 2.0 + API + App Store = Evercam.io StorageWhen it comes to video, the obvious API usage involve storage of the video, still photos, audio, and logs generated by a video camera. The cloud opens the ability to scale storage to match whatever needs the camera owner may have. Video potentially can be disk heavy, something that is perfectly suited for the cloud, as long as someone is willing to pay for the storage. ConnectivityCameras are just one node, in this fast growing world of Internet connected devices that you may find at home or in the business. The ability to sync up cameras and still photos with point of sale (POS) activity, sensors or even other cloud applications is significant. Zapier and IFTTT like actions or seamless reporting and analytics across systems will open up with API deployent. Events Evercam.io introduces events as a layer between the camera and users, allowing developers to define custom or scheduled events based upon what happens in a video. Examples include sending of MMS when camera receives SMS from owner, take picture of storefront or dining area each hour or during peak hours....[<a href="/2014/01/21/a-world-where-every-camera-is-connected-to-the-internet-via-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
Right now when it comes to API discovery you have the OG ProgrammableWeb, and newcomers Mashape and APIHub (which also owns ProgrammableWeb). All three of these sites provide you with a large directory of APIs you can search and browse at, when looking for APIs.
I pull new APIs from all these sources, in hopes of staying in tune with what is out there. However, I have a different approach to my API database of APIs. I only keep track of the best APIs I see. I'm not concerned with every API available, I&rsquo;m interested in the best approaches to APIs.
I&rsquo;m hoping in 2014 that we'll see more niche API hubs emerge, that specialize in specific areas like government, finance, photos, video and other specific areas that developers would be specifically interested in--allowing domain experts to step in and help guide us.
When looking at the big picture it can be hard to see the gaps and opportunities. If you specialize in a particular area, you really get to know what resources people are offering, how they are serving these resources up, and potentially what is missing fro the consumer perspective.
This doesn't have to be exclusive from the existing efforts, Mashape and APIHub could provide more curation tools for domain experts to use in organizing, deploying and management of these hubs. &nbsp;
Just a thought...

			<p><em>20 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>When I last talked with the Panoptix API team over at Johnson Controls (JCI), they were working hard on new features, including the possibility of writing data to the building efficiency API(s). A year later, I wanted to see where the team was at with their API efforts and was intrigued to learn that their work to make their API writable hadn&rsquo;t gone exactly as they had planned. On the surface it sounds like an easy task. You can pull data from an API, now using POST, PUT and DELETE you should be able to write data back into the system. Easier said than done, says John Bernd (@jkbernd) and Simone Vigano (@viganosimone)&nbsp; of the Panoptix API team. First you have all the technical issues around data storage, indexing, accessibility and the usual problems you face with managing lots of data. Working with known data from their own systems and devices is one thing, but opening it up to wider audience takes some extra work. Second you have to think about the legal issues. Who&rsquo;s data is it? Do they have the right to publish it. What are the legal responsibility of JCI and Panoptix? Once you open up a system for publishing of data, you open yourself up to a whole new world of legal headaches. Once you allow write capabilities for Panoptix API users, whats next? What features are needed. How much will all this cost to develop, manage and evolve? Opening up a lot of business questions. I&rsquo;m a big proponent of APIs being not just read, but also write. I rail on city, state and federal governments, stating this is one of the biggest problems with government APIs--the lack of writeable APis. However I understand it is not as easy as it seems, and agree with the Panoptix team, that it is something you have to think through all the pros and cons. Then take your time, build a proper strategy,...[<a href="/2014/01/20/jci-amp-panoptix-apis-write-apis-are-much-harder-than-read-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>Just exactly what an API is, is always up for debate. APIs have been around since before the Internet. API Evangelist focuses in on what I call web APIs, that were built using the same technology as websites, and were made even popular for delivering valuable data and resources to mobile phones. While there are device APIs on phones, that give you access to resources like the camera or microphone, web APIs are the choice of developers when it comes to delivering popular cloud based resources like friends, photos and video to mobile apps. Web APIs, are using the Internet to deliver common resources that websites, web and mobile apps need to operate. With the dominance of mobile devices, and the emergence of the Internet of things, we are now seeing APIs that move beyond just this general approach, and focusing on delivering resources tailored to specific devices, or device groups. As I do with everything, I&rsquo;m just shedding more light on what is already happening out there. Daniel Jacobson of Netflix has been talking about Why REST Keeps Me Up At Night, and how Netflix is catering to hundreds of devices for some time now. So, getting to my point, I was reading two separate articles about new Google APIs: Google Details Google Drive Android API Google Working on Fitness API for Android In both of these new APIs, Google is developing APIs that cater specifically to Android devices. Google has radically different motivations for delivering device based APIs than Netflix, but I think their focus on the device is still a relevant aspect of this trend in API design. General purpose APIs are common, but is Daniel right about where we are going with APIs? Will we continue to see APIs tailored for specific devices? What will happen with the Internet of Things? Will there be APIs that are tailored for home automation devices or just our cars? There are a lot of...[<a href="/2014/01/19/are-device-based-apis-where-it-is-at/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was doing some research on a video camera API platform that I'm keeping an eye on, and Google, Nest and the $3.2 Billion API by Roberto Medrano of SOA Software popped up in my curation system. The Nest&nbsp;is currently the best known example of APIs being placed in between us, and everyday objects in our lives. The enhanced objects, and the applications that emerge are the obvious value, that end users see, however as Robert says: These decisions will be strategic business and financial ones, but they will all be enabled by the use of APIs. Without the API involved, the work required to connect products such as Google and Nest would be too complicated or costly. When I think about devices like the Nest, in our homes, the obsessive compulsive geek in me gets excited for the potential of such a platform. However after I apply a little critical thought, I get very concerned. Then I immerse myself back into what is possible when cameras have APIs, security camera, street cameras, webcams&mdash;all have APIs. Then I get very, very concerned. After this roller coast I come back to a balanced view, that smoke alarms, thermostats and cameras equipped with APIs are neither good, bad or neutral. That cat is out of the bag, and we have this technology. It isn&rsquo;t going away. We might as well enjoy the positive, but we also need to keep an extremely close eye on how things are being deployed and managed behind the scenes. There is a lot of room for logging as part of the regulatory process, democratizing access of resources, and generally injecting transparency into how things work with these Internet enabled, API driven &ldquo;things&rdquo;. However there is also a whole lot of room for exploitation, surveillance and hijacking of data via these Internet enabled, API driven &ldquo;things&rdquo;.

			<p><em>17 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>I just had a great conversion with John Bernd (@jkbernd) and Simone Vigano (@viganosimone) of Johnson Controls (JCI), who lead efforts at the building efficiency API, Panoptix. They shared several great stories with me, I&rsquo;ll trickle out over the next week, with the first one about internal evangelism. Internal evangelism, whether your API is public or private, is something I&rsquo;ve advocated for pretty heavily over the last few years. Lack of internal evangelism around an API can be the number on reason you get your API defunded within any size organization. Basically if the rest of the company, included your bosses , don&rsquo;t know about your API and the success you&rsquo;ve had, your done. So tell stories about your API. This particular story out of JCI is particularly interesting because it isn&rsquo;t just about evangelizing your API, its evangelizing your approach to delivering your API. Over the last couple years of the Panoptix API, John and Simone have done a great job evangelizing the Panoptix API internally (separate story coming soon), but somehow in the hustle they forgot to package up and sell their approach to delivering the Panoptix API, so other groups within JCI can learn about and put the API approach to use for their own needs. Panoptix realized they need to document their own approach to designing, developing, deploying and managing the Panoptix API, create a case study that they can then evangelize within JCI. The benefits of separating data and resources, establishing self-service APIs, establishing meaningful metrics combined with analytics, and the overall health brought by an API centric approach, was something that every group within JCI needs to understand. Panoptix uses 3Scale API infrastructure, and has been reading API Evangelist for a couple years, resulting in their own unique approach to API delivery, you can experience within the Panoptix developer community. Hearing John and Simone talk through their realization, made me see another layer to internal API evangelism.

I was taking another look at the Makerbot Thingiverse API the other day, and was very pleased with their developer area overhaul. One feature I noticed when playing with my account settings, was the ability to set the default licensing for my "things".
Interestingly this is a feature you don't see in many SaaS apps, let alone as part of API developer settings. I remember first seeing this in my Flickr account settings, and is something I wish I&rsquo;d see it in every platform I use (keep dream'n buddy).

When it comes to user generated content via APIs, this licensing is kind of a big deal. It decides as a user and developer, who ultimately owns the exhaust from your work or just from your daily online world.
I'll be including licensing considerations in the future discussions around the politics of APIs. A setting to determine how user generated content is licensed should not just be a setting in your application account settings, but baked into API developer account settings as well.

In 2014 I'm also researching what the building blocks are in other areas of the API world, including API design, deployment, discovery and integration.

			<p>I&rsquo;m spending the next couple weeks going through each of the leading API design approaches: API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger. Even though I still personally use Swagger in my own work, I&rsquo;m pushing myself to learn API Blueprint and RAML to better understand the landscape, as well as the pros and cons of each approach. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with this emerging trends in API design, they are approaches to defining your APIs either using JSON or a markdown language, which allows you to quantify and describe the API interfaces and underlying data models in a way that allows you to communicate with others, generate mock or production APIs, interactive documentation, code samples and potentially other tooling that will help you be successful in your API initiatives. While there are other approaches, I&rsquo;m focusing on what I consider to be the three leading approaches right now: API Blueprint - Using API Blueprint gives you awesome tools for your whole API lifecycle. Use it to discuss your API with others. Generate documentation automatically. Or a test suite RAML - RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices Swagger - Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. The overarching goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server I don&rsquo;t feel there is a right or wrong answer to which API design provider you choose. What I want to understand is the nuances of each, how they help us define our APIs, what tooling is available for each, and what does the overall community of developers look like for each.

			<p>
Have you taken a look at the Thingiverse developer area lately? It&rsquo;s been a while since I reviewed it. A couple years ago while working at Mimeo as an API evangelist I had the pleasure of doing some deep research into not just printing APIs, but 3D printing APIs&nbsp;as well. I wrote a lot on the subject, but overall I was unhappy with what was available in the areas of 3D printing APIs.
When you go to the Thingiverse API now, the landing page immediately tells you what is possible, gives you direct links to API documention, but also provides you what you need to get started, sign up and explore the Thingiverse API&mdash;a flow that is so very important!
When you look at the API docs, you immediately see that the API is a simple web API allowing you to manage users, things, their files and copies, while being able to tag, build collections as well as look for the newest, popular and featured things. The Thingiverse API interface is simple, well designed and actually allows you to access some seriously valuable 3D printing resources.
Thingiverse also delivers other critical resources, providing FAQs, application gallery, hackathon and challenge calendar, and a terms of service that provides a plain english translation for developers. All essential resources to supporting and growing your API ecosystem.
I&rsquo;m impressed with the Thingiverse API, not just because it delivers what I envision a 3D printing API should look like, but it is a well-designed, simple implementation of what any API program should look like as well.

API Terms of Use is the single most important building block of any ecosystem, yet it is the least discussed area of API management and integration. I&rsquo;m working hard to dedicated more time in 2014 to not just the area of API TOS, but what I consider to be the politics of APIs.
Today&rsquo;s focus is on making a plain english translation of your terms of service available. I came across a great example over at Makerbot Thingiverse today, where they add:
We realize Terms of Service can be confusing and, quite frankly, a snooze- fest; however, they are very important in explaining the basis of what we, the Company, expect of you, the User, while on this Site and how this interaction plays out. We promised &ldquo;understandability&rdquo; so, to the right of each term, we provided a summary in &ldquo;plain English&rdquo;.
Music to my ears. Every time I come across an example of plain english terms of use like this, I&rsquo;m going to write a short blog post on it. While I may not always agree with a company&rsquo;s terms of service, I can get behind approaches to make them simpler, more accessible and understandable by users.

			<p><em>13 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m playing catchup on some of my projects, and one of them is tracking on the evolution of Executive Order 13642 from last May, which was the White House directive to make open and machine readable the new default for government information. The piece that I'm tracking on specifically right now is around the OMB Memorandum M-13-13 Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, in which one of the items require agencies to publish a data.json file that provides a machine readable inventory of each agencies public data assets. In short, each federal agencies should round up a list of all their public data assets, make a machine readable JSON file from that list, and publish to the web. The deadline for publishing was November 30, 2013, and I got caught up in my FAFSA work and the holidays happened, resulting in just getting a chance to take a look at truly take a look at where our government is at with this. To really quantify where we are at, you have to execute on the core vision of the mandate&mdash;write a script to pull all the federal agencies data.json file. First you pull all the agency&rsquo;s root url using the Federal Agency Directory API from USA.gov. Then you append data.json to the end of each address, pull each data.json file and get to work! When executing on this work, you encounter the problem of inconsistent HTTP status codes from agency, which I talked about before. Once you navigate this I find: 22 Federal Agency Data.json Publish (I also see SEC published, what they did is another story) 5,558 Public Datasets Published (6,479 actual distributions) This is just my initial pull, and resulting count. I have only begun hand evaluating what is published, what is not. This is good though right? 22 federal agencies successfully publishing a data.json file for a combined 5,558 datasets available! I know how hard this was to make happen, and...[<a href="/2014/01/13/what-happened-with-federal-agencies-and-their-data-json-files/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I had a friend ask me for help with their talk submission for #APIStrat in Amsterdam. He was concerned that his talk was too product pitchy, and wanted help making it something that not just would be accepted by our event, but something community would want to hear.
It is good to hear the concern, its true we want the best talks at #APIStrat, we don&rsquo;t want to have a bunch of product pitches, we are seeking stories of API strategy and the practices from the trenches of API design, deployment and management.
Additionally, the audience doesn't want to hear it. I know many companies are focused on selling their products and services, but event audiences don't care. #APIStrat participants wants to hear about how you are solving the problems they face, using APIs.
Sure your product or service may solve their problems, but telling them this isn't good enough. You need intelligently articulate the problem and walk the the story of how the problem can be solved, in a compelling way. Sure your product or service may be woven in there, but it can't be the central actor in the story. You need to work extra hard to find a story that is meaningful to the #APIstrat audience, and provide details they can take home with them and apply in their own worlds.
We are still looking for more stories of API Strategy &amp; Practice from the trenches. Our call for papers is only open for another week, so make sure and polish your story and get it submitted. I look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam.

			<p><em>11 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Ericsson once had around 19 APIs available via their Ericsson Labs platform. After doing a round of looking through all the APIs I track on, I noticed they have ALL gone away. They are still doing a lot of research, but they seem to have lost their interest in APIs all together.
I have no problem with experimentation and playing around with different resources, and even the deprecation of APIs, with appropriate communication, when it makes sense. I know Ericsson exploration is via their labs, and isn't really meant for production, but it grinds on me when there are APIs be played with, then all of sudden one day they are gone, with no trace.
If you are experimenting with APIs, I recommend leaving some sort of landing page behind, with some trace of the exhaust from your research, experimentation--if possible open source your work. You put APIs out there and expect developers to come, play and give you feedback with no compensation&mdash;the least you can do is leave some of that research or assetts behind for the industry to put to use, or at least for us to understand that this has occurred at some point in time.
I don't know why your API initiatives didn&rsquo;t work or were closed down, but I think in general it leaves a bad taste in developers mouths--I know it sure does in mine. Experimentation and iteration is fine, but if you want the public to care about your research in the future, leave some of the exhaust from your research behind, so we can derive meaning and value fromit. If nothing else, just a landing page that explains what happened, otherwise we wil stop giving a shit in the future and are unlikely to participate.

			<p><em>10 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>The latest tech news to come out of IBM this week is a brand new business group to push innovation around the IBM Watson platform, with IBM committed to spending $1B on the new business group, with $100M set aside to fund startups who build on top of the Watson platform. The introduction of the new business group may be in response to the media&rsquo;s, and analyst&rsquo;s chatter about less than impressive results so far with the Watson platform&rsquo;s ability to generate revenue, with $100M revenue over the last three years, according to the Wall Street Journal. There was a post on on ReadWrite today, called IBM's Watson Fails To Compute In A World Of Open-Source Hadoop, where Matt Assay nails the reason: Where Are The Watson Developers? When you visit the "IBM Watson Ecosystem Program&rdquo;, you get a lot of text, and then even more text contained in PDF&rsquo;s telling how much you can innovate with the platform. Then when you are ready there is a pretty lengthy form to fill out, where you can tell them what you want to do with Watson, and hit submit and hope they will let you in. They also have a Twitter, Facebook and Youtube account, but really it doesn't smell of &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; where &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; is happening. I've looked at over 10K &ldquo;ecosystems&rdquo;, which about less than 500 are truly &ldquo;innovating&rdquo;, and after a while you start to be able to smell the signs of success. I&rsquo;m not saying the IBM Watson platform doesn&rsquo;t offer value, I&rsquo;m just saying the team doesn't know how to make "innovation" happen. They need to loosen up, stop being so enterprise, and open up a little bit. We know you got some APIs behind there, make them accessible to ANYONE, make registration self-service, and give us some dead simple, meaningful, powerful web API endpoints to play with that will stimulate our imaginations.

			<p><em>10 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
There is an excellent post in GovFresh by former Presidential Innovation Fellow and Githubber Ben Balter (@BenBalter), Why no one uses your government data?
Ben is looking to address one of the biggest problems with open data in government. That data is just opened, purely to check a box on some requirement imposed on agencies. The data steward doesn&rsquo;t actually put any thought into how the data will be used, and is just taking advantage of positive re-enforcement associated with opening up the data.
This is not just a problem in federal, state or city government. This same problem occurs in the private sector as well. While it takes work to open up data and other resources via APIs, it takes even more work to see things through the eyes of a consumer. Making the data clean and actually usable by data journalists, in visualizations and applications is hard work.
We need to raise the bar when it comes to open data. If you work in government, non-profit or company, your work isn&rsquo;t done when you release your open data or API, you need to see things through and ask yourself one simple question: How can you optimize the experience for the consumer?

			<p><em>10 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Building on my last post,&nbsp;Lessons In Gov Open Data: Optimize For Consumer, I want to share another important lesson for people working on open data in government. This very important lesson is about good data narration or storytelling around your data, not just publishing it as is.
This lesson is triggered by a great post over at Gnip, where Eric Swayne, Director of Product of MutualMind talks about the fundamentals of good data narration.  Swayne starts out by saying that:
People that live in data analysis have the crucial opportunity for extracting meaning that transforms businesses through data-driven decisions, and it takes much more than just pushing out the monthly graphs and charts
Swayne continues to talk about the trademarks of good data narration which include true insights, user-centric approach, and idea inception. This is critical in releasing data in government, it isn&rsquo;t just about the release, it is about releasing the data, providing insights associated with the data, and tailoring it for as wide as possible audience, with the goal of triggering something new within the minds and imaginations of these potential consumers.
Remember, if you are opening up data in government, your work is not done once you release. It is your role as a data steward to narrate and tell the story of the data in a way that will relay the value to potential end-users and consumers, so that they may build on that value through visualizations, applications and even other stories--without the story it is just data. :-(

			<p><em>10 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I got a email today letting me know that cloud platform Exicon, purchase API management provider ApiAxle, further whittling away at all of the original and second wave of API management providers I&rsquo;ve been tracking on over the last 4 years.
ApiAxle first showed up as a blip on my 2012 API management provider roundup when:
ApiAxle started out as a side project when Phil Jackson was CTO at Qwerly and found their API management provider didn't quite fit the needs of a busy, commercial API. API growth had already exploded back then and so, in the same way you could pick from a plethora of databases or webservers, there seemed an obvious space for an open source API management platform. That's when ApiAxle was born.
According to Phil Jackson, the ApiAxle brand will continue to live as part of the Exicon suite of products, and he will keep evolving his baby. While it is 2014 now, I would consider this acquisition the last of a string of API management acquisitions we saw in 2014 which included Layer7, Mashery, and Apiphany.
These leaves just a handful of API management providers on the acquisition table in 2014, including 3Scale, Apigee, Mashape and Apiary.io. Who is next? Will API management platforms be as hot of a commodity in 2014?

			<p>Data.gov has continued to evolve, adding data sets, agencies and features. With recent, high profile stumbles like with Healthcare.gov, it can be easy to fall prey to historical stereotypes that government can't deliver tech very well. While this may apply in some cases, I think we can confidently get behind the movement that is occurring at Data.gov, with 176 agencies working to add 54,723 data sets in the last 12 months. I feel pretty strongly that before we look towards the future of what the roadmap looks like for Data.gov, we need to spend a great deal of time refining and strengthening what we currently have available at Data.gov, and across the numerous government agency developer areas. Even with these feelings, I can't help but think about what is needed for the next couple years of Data.gov, in a more technical sense. Maybe I'm biased, but I think the next steps for Data.gov is all API. How do we continue evolving Data.gov, and prepare to not just participate, but lead in the growing API economy? Management Tools for Agencies We need to invest in management tools for agencies, commercial providers as well as API Umbrella. Agencies need to be able to focus on the best quality data sets and API designs, and not have to worry about the more mundane necessities of API management like access, security, documentation and portal management. Agencies should have consistent analytics, helping them understand how their resources are being accessed and put to use. If OSTP, OMB, GSA and the public expect consistent results when it comes to open data and APIs from agencies, we need to make sure they have the right management tools. Endpoint Design Tools for Data Sets Agencies should be able to go from dataset to API without much additional work. Tools should be made available for easily mounting published datasets, then allow non-developers to design API endpoints for easily querying, filtering, accessing and transforming datasets....[<a href="/2014/01/09/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy-getting-technical/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>It has taken me a while to respond to a post I read this weekend, by Mike Caulfield (@holden) called Revenge of the OS. In short he points out the fragment world we live in with all of our apps, and the shortcoming of tech companies to actually deliver a solution that truly works for end-users. Our desktop computer has always been the doorway to our digital worlds, and then came the Internet, and the Web 2.0 age where iGoogle (now dead), Facebook Apps (how many apps do you use these days), and other &ldquo;mega-services&rdquo; promised to be the doorway to our now online digital worlds. Mike talks about how his daughter, who 4 years ago depended on Facebook to access her world, now &ldquo;moves fluidly between Tumblr, Snapchat, Instagram, and Vine accounts, with the notifications panel her point of integration&rdquo;. Our devices have become the doorway to our online, digital lives. All of this is the result of tech companies, driven by their VC overlords, pushing to become the point of control for user identity and the pipes in which that users data flows&mdash;-at all costs! Sure these companies pay lip service to the interoperability that could fix this and employ OpenID, oAuth and use APIs, but without true investment and an honest belief in interoperability with other platforms, even competitors, it all means absolutely nothing. The tech giants have the power to lead, come together and establish strong openID or oAuth alliances, strengthening tools, simplifying user experience, but they don&rsquo;t. Innovative startups like oAuth.io from Webshell, and Zapier are left to do the heavy lifting, and the user is still left with a fragmented, cumbersome experience as they jump from cloud to cloud, across potentially several devices like smart phone, laptop, xBox, and tablets. This world is only going to get worse, tech companies of all sizes show very little interest in truly working together.

			<p><em>09 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Building on my thoughts around preparing your API for wholesale access, I&rsquo;m thinking through the problem of developer API access when you have API providers offering up each others APIs, and bundling them seamlessly as part of their own API stack.
In this scenario I&rsquo;m working through, API provider A has an API they offer up wholesale to partners, and API provider B wants to bundle API provider A&rsquo;s API along with their own, adding value to their API and developer community.
In this scenario API provider B doesn&rsquo;t want their developers to have to sign up for a separate API key with API provider A, the developer should just have to create one account and use one key for their application.
To make this seamless, both API providers need to have their own APIs for their API management system, allowing users and keys to be provisioned programmatically. All API provider A needs to do is create a service tier for their wholesale partners to have access to account and application provisioning, so their partners can seamlessly generate new accounts for their new developer accounts and switch API keys when developers uses the wholesale API.
This isn&rsquo;t just an academic exercise. It is possible when your API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers. I just think API providers aren&rsquo;t thinking at this level yet, and thinking about how the future of how their APIs will be consumed in the future, and the potential of sharing users with their API partners.
I&rsquo;ll keep exploring the various elements needed to make your API available in a wholesale way. Having an API for your API management infrastructure is definitely essential, and next I will be looking at having a machine readable API definition, and permissible terms of service (TOS).

			<p><em>09 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
As the number of public APIs grows well beyond 10K, expecting that developers will discover, let alone come to your developers area regulary will be reduced to just a fantasy. In this new API driven economy, your API will need to be decoupled, portable, and available in a wholesale manner, allowing other API providers to hang your valuable API resources in their own developers area.
If your API is developed in a simple, standard way, described using a common API definition format like Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, your account provisioning and management has an API, and terms of service (TOS) are flexible--you will be bundled with leading API platforms, available in the growing number of backend as a service (BaaS) platforms, and easily listed in API hubs like Mashape and APIHub.
In 2014 it won&rsquo;t be enough to just have an API and a developer area with all the essential building blocks, you need to make sure your API is ready for re-use and re-sale. Sure we all want to be the Twilio of the API universe, but in reality we need developers to use our resources. Of course this approach to API deployment won&rsquo;t be for every API, some resources just can&rsquo;t be resold like this, but for many of the API resources I&rsquo;m seeing in the space, it will be the difference between life or death.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The Dwolla API sent out an email to developers today, letting us know that, "Effective January 21, 2014, all timestamps returned by REST API endpoints will be in UTC format.&rdquo;  Dwolla is looking to fix the issue of ambiguous timestamps, where the time zone is&nbsp;variable and not indicated in the timestamp.
Currently the timestamps look like: 9/20/2013 12:45:07 AM
After the switch to UTC they will look like: 2010-11-12T13:14:15Z
Formatted according to the ISO 8601 standard. This is a much cleaner, internationalized approach. I&rsquo;ve seen this mistake a lot, and still do it myself on some new systems. As an self-centered american, we tend to think the world evolves around us, and we don&rsquo;t think about these scaling issues ahead of time.
Are your API data formats in UTC? No? Maybe it is something you want to change before you grow too big and get too many developers on your API.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>I stopped counting the number of successful applications that have had their private APIs reversed engineered by some savvy users,&nbsp;Most recently Snapchat, and famously the original rogue Instagram API was developed this way, and even auto maker Tesla had their API reverse engineered. This is fresh on my my mind because of the Snapchat security breach, in which this savvy tech user notified Snapchat back in August, and the company instituted rate limiting, but still left the API exposed for further attack, which the user took full advantage of in December by scraping all users after documenting and expoiting the private API. If you are developing a mobile application, you are building an API. Even if you never intend on making this API public, there are huge benefits of going through the motions of pretending like it is&mdash;you will learn a lot! Every application API I&rsquo;ve seen reverse engineered was clearly developed in a rush, thinking that security through obscurity was a solid production strategy. When you are planning your apps API, stop! Consider what you will need to make this publicly available. The exercise is healthy. Allow for registration of developers and apps, even if it will just be your team signing up. Put in place rate limits, analytics, etc. There are a ton of features that have evolved in the public API space that are transferrable to private APIs. API infrastructure providers like 3Scale have been working at this for years. You can sign up for a free account, get started without any extra work from your dev team, and you can save any resources for making sure you monitor your API stats on a daily basis and responding to not just security threats, but find tuning how your apps are using your own API.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
If you weren't following the news over the holidays, a rogue group released SnapchatDB, containing the 4.6 million Snapchat user profiles, after exploiting the poorly secured mobile application API.
There are opposing views of what's happened, but apparently the group contacted Snapchat in August 2013 letting them know of a potential vulnerability in their API, in which Snapchat claims they responded by instituting rate limiting to address the problem.
Apparently the actual vulnerability wasn't addressed, and in December the group mapped the private API, the company uses for their mobile app. They don't officially have an API, but like most mobile applications, it is right beneath the surface.
After mapping the interface the group proceeded to suck all the data, organized and publish as SnapchatDB, in an effort to raise awareness of the issue and point out that Snapchat was to slow in responding to the exploit.
Regardless of the exact facts, it is clear that Snapchat was lax on security. API rate limiting and other common security measures are pretty common place. API providers like 3Scale have been around for years delivering plug and play infrastructure to help you deal with this. There is no reason to be caught with your pants down.
It doesn't matter whether your API is public, private or just for partners, you need to have your security practices tight. You owe it to your users and developers.
Disclosure: 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.

			<p><em>07 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
After watching the API space evolve, I've learned one thing, that there are lots of factors that influence the industry, and that the best solution doesn't always win.
As I'm studying the rise of Internet enabled devices, also known as Internet of Things (IoT), you see some devices embrace a RESTful approach to integration with their devices, but often times you see APIs released, but they are wrapped with SDKs.
I'm not making any assumption that SDKs or REST is better when it comes to IoT devices, technically an SDK may or may not provide a stronger solution. However within this approach I think it is easy to pave over the API, making it an after thought--stifling potential innovation that can occur around open endpoints.
When it comes to developing APIs for IoT I don't think engineers are consciously pushing out REST and web APIs, I think they stick with what they know. Without proper education around the larger potential of APIs + SDK, vs SDK only, engineers with go the path of least resistance, and the one they are familiar with.
As the space expands, we need to make sure there are sufficient stories available for IoT engineers to discover, making them aware of the potential of keeping their APIs front and center when integrating their devices to the Internet.

			<p>The time has come. In 2014 I will be spending a lot more energy, helping you understand what a Hypermedia API is, and if you should be considering it as part of your own API strategy. I won&rsquo;t be in the business of telling you Hypermedia is always the answer, or that it is bad, I will be working to better understand myself, and along the way hopefully I can share some knowledge with you. As I do with other technical issues that surround APIs, I will work to simplify, to help reach a wider audience, beyond the development community. If you are a developer and looking to understand Hypermedia APIs I recommend Googling, and exploring other resources (there are plenty). I want to help business leaders understand the potential, not sell developers on the concept. In my mind, there are two key things that make hypermedia APIs different from common web APIs: Shared, common way that developers can communicate with the API Guiding developers with what actions they can take along the way There are plenty of other differentiators, but these are the two that stand out to me. So let&rsquo;s apply. Say you have a product API. A common web API approach might be to return a product, in a JSON format, which will probably be just a list of fields from the database where the products are stored, with the JSON structured in a way that makes sense to you and your development team. It is now up to the developer to interpret how the API responses are structured, and how to integrate into their application. Pretty standard stuff, right? Now with a Hypermedia API, the API will use a registered media type such as&nbsp;HAL&nbsp;or&nbsp;Collection-JSON, providing a common framework for developers to communicate with the API&mdash;reducing the unknowns in API integration. With the product request, you will get get the same details on the product, but along with the product details you...[<a href="/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I was doing some research in the area of harvesting and scraping APs. I was taking another look at Web Scrape Master, a simple scraping API that allows you to pass it a URL and it harvests structured data and content from the page.
The Web Scrape Master is a pretty dead simple API, with a purpose. It does one thing and it does it well. What I found really interesting though, was the fact that lower on the page, below the API documentation the API was for sale. You could buy a copy of the server side of the API and client side tooling as a bundle.
It is a pretty interesting approach, especially for these utility style APIs. You can either use the API provided as a service or you can download, install and use it within your own infrastructure, adding the API to your own stack.
While this isn't possible for all APIs, I think it has promise for many API providers, delivering a sort of on-premise version of their API. I'm getting in the habit of publishing server side code for many of my API designs, I'm will consider some APIs for possible sale in the future as well.
When you think about the growth of containers like Docker and the PaaS solutions like OpenShift, it makes the possibility of rapidly deployment of utility APIs much more of a reality.

			<p>I was asked to provides some thoughts on what is next for the US Government API strategy. I've been thinking about it during my work and travels over the last couple months, and I keep coming back to one thought:&nbsp;Strengthen What We Have! I wish I had some new technology or platform for the next wave of government APIs that would ensure success with APIs in Washington, but in reality we need to do what we've been doing, but do it at scale, and get organized and collaborative about how we do it. Release More Data Sets There are thousands of data sets available via Data.gov, across 176 agencies and numerous categories. We need more. When any content or data is published via a government website, that data needs to also made available via agencies data repositories and Data.gov. Agencies need to understand that releasing open data sets it not something you do every once in a while to meet a mandate or deadline--it is something you do always, forever. Refine Existing Data Sets There is a lot of data available currently. However much of it is in various formats, inconsistent data models and isn't always immediately available for use in spreadsheets, applications, visualizations or analysis. There is a great deal of work to be done in cleaning, normalizing and refining of existing data, as well as deploying APIs around open data that would increase adoption and the chances it will be put to use. Refine Existing APIs Like open data, there are many existing APIs across the federal government, and these APis could use a lot of work to make them more usable by developers. With a little elbow grease, existing APIs could be standardized by generating common API definitions like Swagger, API blueprint and RAML, which would help quantify all APIs, but also generate interactive documentation, code samples and provide valuable discovery tools for helping understand where interfaces are and what they offer....[<a href="/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Major newspapers having APIs is nothing new. We've heard stories out of the Guardian, New York Times and USA Today having APIs, but after several years where are these API initiatives headed? What is next? Is there innovation going on in the area journalism when it comes to APIs? This dive into the world of journalism will take some time, but I will start with what I consider to be the leader, The Guardian Open Platform. The UK paper has all the essential building blocks I would want in an API provider, starting with a clean overview and getting started pages to get developers and data journalists up to speed. The Guardian Open Platform revolves around two API resource, the Content API and Politics API and a vast data store of spreadsheets and other data sets that the Guardian has gathered throughout news cycles. There is an API Explorer which allows you to quickly get your hands dirty with the Guardian APIs, which is essential. There is also a variety of code libraries including Java, Scala, Ruby and ColdFusion flavors, as well as an App Gallery showcasing what has been built on the Guardian APIs. The Guardian Open Platform is supported by an active blog, forum and Twitter account, providing the necessary building blocks to build community around the API. There appears to be some unique gems under the surface with the Guardian Wordpress plugins and their MicroApp Framework looks like it could be interesting, but I just don't see a lot of information available on it. The Guardian Github account is pretty active, but most of it is around the Guardian front-end, not for any innovation that you'd expect around open data and APIs. On the surface, the Guardian Open Platform appears to have everything you need for a successful API platform, but I just don't see anything that stands out and screams "innovation in journalism using APIs". With that said, I have to...[<a href="/2014/01/06/state-of-apis-in-journalism-the-guardian/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Jan 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I use screenshots across the API Evangelist network. I take screenshots of stories I curated, companies I track on and API developer areas I'm monitoring. Historically I've used a variety of screenshot APIs, to generate the 1000's of screenshots I need to make my network function.
This last week I was running through my network, and noticed the screenshot API had stopped working. It isn't a critical piece of infrastructure so I've used free services and don't really feel the need to monitor in real-time, I just respond when I stop seeing screenshots on the news listing page.
This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, and when I started looking for a new screenshot API I noticed the majority of them now charge, and was in a range I just didn't feel I couldn't afford being a one man show. I knew in the back of my mind that I could develop my own screenshot API solution.
After test driving several image libraries I settled in with PhantomJS, which allows me to load and manipulate web pages in an object, and then take a screenshot of the web page in that state. I quickly wrapped in a web API using the Slim Framework in PHP.
Once I had the API deployed I wrapped with my 3Scale API management infrastructure, which requires an API key before you can use any of my APIs. Next I updated my company, API and news screenshot tool to use my new screenshot API.
After I get some free time I will clean up the code and publish via Github, so others can deploy their own screenshot API and take the same path I chose.

			<p>I look at a lot of APIs, I work hard to brainstorm ideas for potential new APIs, and I can't think of a more important API to not just the API economy, but to the overall economy, than an IRS API that would give citizens access to their income and tax history. We know the APIs exists, since the same resources are made available via the IRS Modernized e-File system to tax professionals. I'm not talking about an API that gives access to every detail of my tax history, but the data I've entered into common forms like W2, 1099, and 1042. This IRS API would provide simple REST API access to these values, along with an oAuth framework allowing any approved application developer to access all or portions of our most relevant income and tax data. With oAuth being the access layer to all of this, it would give us, the citizen control over who has access to our history, and how applications can use it. An IRS API would be used to streamline numerous processes like home loans, student financial aid and other transactions actions we take in our everyday lives. These transactions occur over and over each year, and require manual entry, manual validation and other often cumbersome interactions. The introduction of an IRS API with oAuth, would also do amazing things for basic digital literacy around oAuth, and who is accessing to our vital information. This type of literacy around APIs, oAuth, and data access, is critical to not just a healthy API economy, but is quickly blending with the regular economy. I'm not naive regarding the politics of such a move, which would uncover huge amounts of corruption, false statements, potentially disrupt existing jobs that are dedicated to these bureaucratic functions, and introduce a new wave of security concerns. However I think the benefits will outweigh the negatives and this represents the next generation of financial literacy. It is up...[<a href="/2013/12/20/the-holy-grail-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Dec 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I'm working on an API design for the free application for federal student aid form, also known as FAFSA, over the last couple weeks. I took the form which had over 150 separate fields, and turned into a basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) API. I even added an endpoint that allows you to query and get a list of the fields.
The project is a proof of concept to show the Department of Education what is possible around a FAFSA API. I'm not sure if the API will ever be deployed or adopted by the Department of Education or if by other 3rd party providers, establishing a sort of federated FAFSA API network. My goal is to just generate the API definition with supporting server and client side tooling, to show what is possible.
As I assess my work over the last couple weeks on FAFSA, I can't help but think how this should be standard practice for all forms. If you do a simple search at google for "forms", you get IRS forms, immigration, legal, voter registration and yes the FAFSA forms. It is clear that forms still dominate our lives--print and PDF.
I'm thinking that simple, open designs and tooling around forms would help us continue evolve the concept of the "form" beyond the just the PDF. Sure the PDF still has a place, and some tooling can work with consuming and publishing as PDF, but APIs could help us innovate around what is a form, how users enter their data into them, and take advantage of newer technologies like tablets.
In my opinion, every form should be an API. If you'd like help developing a new form as an API or evolving an older print or PDF form as an API, feel free to reach out.

			<p>I spend a lot of time talking to folks on the phone, Skype, in Google Hangouts and in person about their API business models. Not everyone I talk with is willing to share their story public, so I'm also happy when I meet folks who are as open and transparent about figuring all of this out as I am. This morning I spoke with Anne and Bailey over at the Pop Up Archive about their upcoming API, and potential business model(s) for their API when ready. We talked about their immediate API release and then brainstormed about how to get the word out, how people might use the API, and possible approaches monetization. The Pop Up Archive is an audio transcription service, allowing you to publish audio files and receive back full text transcriptions of the audio. It is a pretty straightforward service, and they will be releasing an API so others can use the audio transcription service in their own apps, as well as access the wealth of audio resources they are amassing in their archive. Even with the straightforward nature of this upcoming API resource, the question of who will use this service, and what they are willing to pay comes up--something we spent the good part of an hour discussing. We should have recorded, then we'd have the transcription, but since we didn't here are some of my thoughts from today's discussion. Your API Is Tech and Business Research &amp; Development The tech space moves fast, and success is all about getting your API up and running, allow for developers to use, even if it is just within a trusted group, then iterate and evolve as you gain more knowledge about what people want and how they will be using it.

			<p><em>16 Dec 2013</em></p>
			<p>The question of whether government should charge for APIs and other digital services came up again this week during a Google Hangout I did with Luke Fretwell(@lukefretwell) of @GovFresh. I began exploring this concpet last year in my post, Should the Government Subsidize and Profit from Data Market, after talking with several city government open data folks. Luke had pointed me to a page on the Hawaii.gov website that described their subscriber services: A subscriber account offers the benefit of monthly invoicing and payment and provides convenience to users who conduct large volumes of online transactions through our website. In some cases, a subscriber account is also required to access a specific online service. Many people I talk to in the open data space have reacted negatively when I propose the idea of government charging for access to services, but as reflected in Hawaiis approach, this is just for higher volume and heavy commercial use cases. It costs money to gather and organize government data, design, deploy and manage APIs. I feel strong that many of the resources coming out of government should be free and open for access, but in the cases where it is incurring huge costs for government to provide, it might make sense to pass costs off to consumers. Think of any other physical government assets like city, county, state, or national parks. These are open for anyone to access, and many are even free, but if you want to use them for commercial purposes, you have to pay. Virtual resources should be seen in a similar light. However, this could easily evolve into a negative analogy, because park access fees sometimes can seem ridiculous, and I want to incentivize consumption of government open data and APIs through as wide of access as possible--not scare people away. My goal here is to not take a for or against stance, but to stimulate conversation around the topic and see where it makes...[<a href="/2013/12/16/charging-for-higher-levels-of-access-to-government-data-and-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The terms of service for APIs is the single most important building block of an API strategy, one that dictates how developers can access and put API resources to use and sets the tone for an entire API ecosystem. Your API can be publicly available, but the terms of service and licensing will determine whether it is truly open. Even with the importance of this area of API operations, there aren't a lot of open resources to help guide you through crafting your API licensing and terms of service properly--until now. A group of swedish entrepreneurs Daniel Rudmark of Viktoria Swedish ICT, Elias Arnestrand of Samtrafiken, Anna Mirsch lawyer at Mannheimer Swartling,&nbsp;and Andreas Krohn at Dopter have come together to create a new project to address this need, called Swedish API License. The goals with the project was to create an API license that... Is open and free for anyone to use, encouraging maximal adoption Is flexible enough to fit many different use cases Respects both the publisher and the consumer of the API. Easy to understand for people without a law degree The Swedish API license covers the following areas: License Intellectual Property Rights Processing of Personal Data Technical Requirements and Limitations Other Requirements of Use Liability Changes Terms and Conditions The Swedish API license even has an API license wizard that walks you through 13 steps of constructing and customizing your license, keeping within the legal and commercial considerations your company has around your API. While the Swedish API License is published in Sweden, the site and licenses are in english and all the work is licensed under CC-BY license. This opens up a whole lot of opportunity to use the model around the globe. I will be spending more time getting familiar with the approach to developing terms of service by the Swedish API License, and consider it side by side with existing efforts like Terms of Service Didn't Read and TOS...[<a href="/2013/12/16/api-terms-of-service-wizard-from-swedish-api-license/">Read More</a>]</p>

I got back from Paris, France this Sunday, after Audrey (@audreywatters) and I spoke at API Days last Thursday. This was the second annual API event, which kicked off last year around the same time. I've been a supporter of the event since Mehdi (@medjawii) of Webshell told me about the idea.
Last years event was small, and over half the audience seemed to be imported API specialists such as myself, where this year it was clear--this was a french conference. A passionate community of API enthusiasts has grown over the last year, producing an impressive line-up of speakers and attendees.
I learned a lot about the space ranging from containers and oAuth to revelations about how we can learn from history and make the right decisions as we move forward in a world of APIs.
I encountered some pretty smart folks who knew a lot about technology, APIs and open data, that I hadn't encountered before in the online API world. This shows me the value of this type of event, and the importance of bringing folks together from around the world and share API stories.
Thanks Webshell and FaberNovel for making it happen, and bringing Audrey and I out to be part of such an important event.

			<p><em>11 Dec 2013</em></p>
			<p>I was able to give my FAFSA API project a little more attention in preparation for some data jams later this week. While there is still a lot of work to happen, I feel pretty good about what I have been able to get done. I'd love to reflect on the API design, get some feedback before I move it forward too much more. 75% Github As with all of my projects, the FAFSA API is mostly deployed via Github, except for the actual API. The project was born as a Github repository and expanded as a Github Page. Using Github I'm able to manage the project, while also making it open by default so anyone else can fork and put the work to use. Designing The API Once the repository was created, I got to work on an API design. For this project I started with a Swagger specification, and developed a basic CRUD interface and data model that was derived from the list of 100+ fields from the FAFSA form. Now I had a basic API design I could work with as guide for developing my API, generating my documentation and code samples. It isn't perfect, but it is a good start. Deploying The API Next with API design in hand, I got to work deploying an actual API that would allow developers to build applications that could create, update and manage FAFSA application. I selected the Slim framework and PHP to deploy the first iteration of the FAFSA API. This allowed me to rapidly produce server side code in a common programming language. I will be deploying Python, Ruby and Node.js versions in the near future. Interactive Documentation The first step in quantifying an API interface and make it something you can see and understand, is by developing documentation. In 2013 the common way to do this is with interactive documentation, which you can generate directly from the previously generated Swagger specification....[<a href="/2013/12/11/my-free-application-for-federal-student-aid-fafsa-api-project/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Dec 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm just getting time to read through the news coming out of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the next phase of the Oracle v. Google case, which kicked off December 4th in California courts. A panel of three judges presided over the Oracle v. Google Android/Java copyright appeal hearing, and after reading several accounts of the hearing, all three judges seem to all agree that the Java API should protected under copyright, but whether Google's use of portions of the Java API is fair use, is still unclear--potentially overturning Judge William Alsup earlier ruling. I strongly feel that APIs are the "fair use tip" of software that could potentially be covered by copyright and patents. As demonstrated by my support of the Electronic Frontier Foundation amicus brief, I think API definitions remaining fair use is critical to interoperability and and not just a healthy API economy, but the the larger economy. The hearing last week is just the beginning, the legal battle is likely to go on for a while, potentially making its way to the Supreme Court and / or possibly heading back to a lower court. Even if the earlier Oracle vs. Google ruling, that APIs aren't copyrightable is upheld, I anticipate we will see many, many legal battles on this front in coming years. As we increase our vocabulary for describing and designing API interfaces, with approaches such as Swagger, RAML and API Blueprint, attempts to protect these definitions by copyright will increase. While I will continue to support efforts to defend APIs in their entirety as being protected under fair use and free from copyright, I will be focusing my efforts on encouraging healthy API design, sharing and collaboration through placement of API definitions into the API Commons. While Oracle vs. Google remains a critical case that will have a major impact on the world of APIs, whichever way the case goes, it won't change...[<a href="/2013/12/11/it039s-between-copyright-and-fair-use-in-oracle-vs-google-api-case/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Dec 2013</em></p>
			<p>
We have added the OpenEd API to the API Commons. OpenEd provides open educational resources like courses, videos and games for teachers to use in their classes.
Using the API, developers can read and write resources to the platform, which currently houses 250K openly licensed educational resources.
In addition to making all of the content openly licensed, the OpenEd.io site is also open sourced on Github. Making the OpenEd API definition a perfect candidate for the API commons.
The OpenEd team designed their API using Apiary.io, defining it using API Blueprint, a web API language that allows for the description of APIs using markdown.
OpenEd is a great open educational content API blueprint to follow, and we are honored to have it in the commons!

			<p>
I'm getting more PR folks reaching out to me trying to get me to review their client's API program. I'm happy to add these to my list and make time each week to review them alongside the other new APIs I find each week.
I'm not willing to jump on the phone and hear a pitch about the API. You should send me a short succinct email, or even better a Tweet with a URL and I'm happy to add to my list and make time when i can.
I'm not the usual blogger who just wants to regurgitate what you told me in a briefing or in a press release. Your API and its supporting area should do the talking. I should be able to click on a single link, understand what you do, and be able to find what I need within 5 minutes or less.  If I can't? Well I will let you know.
Think of me as a developer. I will be reviewing your product from that perspective.
So if you are doing PR for an API company, make sure and read my blog, engage me on Twitter and save the briefings and emails for other bloggers. I'm more concerned with the value your client is bringing to the table, and their approach to delivering a self-service API platform.
No briefing required. :-)

			<p><em>30 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I'm pretty excited about heading to Paris this week to speak at API Days.  The is the 2nd edition of the original french edition of API Days, and they have organized over 60 talks across two days: December 4th and 5th.
I'm particularly excited about sitting in on these talks:

Mike Admundsen, LAYER7 - Telephones, Mechanical Turks, and the Future of APIs
Joffrey Fuhrer, Docker.io - Shipping code in a service oriented world
St&eacute;phane Legouffe, CTO of Paris - APIs and Cities
Renaud Visage CTO, Eventbrite - From a Monolithic to a Distributed Architecture 
Steve Klabnik - JSON API: convention driven API design 
Romain Huet, Twitter - Twitter APIs: connecting to the pulse of the planet
Guillaume Balas, 3SCALE - Which Business Model to Win in the API Economy?

I will be talking about API Commons, and Bringing API Design Out Of The Shadows And Into The Commons--helping share the vision Steve Willmott and I have behind the new project that 3Scale and API Evangelist are partnering on.
I'm looking forward to hanging out with all these API freaks, and of course experiencing the amazing city of Paris again.
OMG! I almost forgot. My girlfirend @AudreyWatter is speaking too!! Education APIs: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly!! Its gonna be wild!

			<p><em>29 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>This fall while working in Washington D.C. I was introduced to the concept ofrepresenting government services with JSON-LD. Using the&nbsp;civic services schema.org&nbsp;proposal you can represent common government services that target indvidiuals and businesses, providing a standard that developers can use when presenting government services in websites and mobile applications. I was working on a project to help publish services from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I wanted to enable people who work at the VA, as well as other agencies to be able to generate and manage JSON-LD representations of their services in the easiest way possible. So I thought to myself, what is the number one way for people in government to manage data? Spreadsheets of course! I decided to start with Google Docs, and generate a simple JavaScript tool to take a Google Spreadsheet template that was setup with the required fields for a government services schema. Next I wrote an import script using Tabletop.js that would grab the contents of the Google Spreadsheet template and using JavaScript to generate the JSON-LD. This thanksgiving holiday I decided to add one more tool to my work with government services and JSON-LD, and build a form that anyone could fill out and generate their own government services JSON-LD. The result is a Bootstrap, JQuery form that you can fill out, then hit publish JSON and using JavaScript it generates the JSON-LD representation for you. I started a project to organize my work around government services and published the Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD and the form to JSON-LD generators. Next I will be adding the ability to save generated files to the Github master repository, making the whole thing a formable, government JSON-LD generator and storage repo. I'm enjoying developing forms that generate JSON lately. I built an API Commons manifest generator the other night, and using the same momentum I developed the government services JSON-LD generator. I couldn't think of a more worthy project...[<a href="/2013/11/29/government-services-schemas-with-jsonld/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>My friend @harmophone, Director of Platform for the Klout API, wrote up a great piece before #APIStrat, called A Short Proposal for Robots.json. This is a topic that I've been meaning to make time to discuss, but only now finding time. I love exchanging ideas with @harmophone, because we tend to disagree on some important API related topics, however he is extremely knowledgeable on the space, and like me he possesses some strong opinions and is very open to lively discussion via blogs, twitter and on stage at events. On the topics of web scraping, API rate limits, and API access that exist in the realm of what I call the politics of APIs, @harmophone and I couldn't disagree more on what is acceptable use in the API economy. What is interesting though, within this disagreement we find affinity in the topic of the robots.json. @harmophone&nbsp;has a very succinct description of what a robots.json file would be: A Robots.json file, or something like it, would contain all desired rules for retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody, business models and other use cases allowed and encouraged for developers. I think a machine readable file that provides access to all aspects of an APIs terms of use is a great idea. Beyond the obvious benefits of publishing a robots.json file for API providers and consumers, I think the practice would help standardize industry best practices for API terms and conditions. In my experience most API providers just emulate what they see in the space and if top players lead on this subject, others will follow. @harmophone and I both agree that there should be a robots.json, however we come at it from two opposing viewpoints. @harmophone is coming at from an API vendor position, and I'm coming at from the stance of an API consumer. @harmophone wants to establish a definition of where the provider stands, setting the "rules of the road" as Twitter...[<a href="/2013/11/25/early-thoughts-on-robots-json/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>On November 6th, 2013 the Associated Students, University of California(ASUC) Senate submitted SB 48: A Bill in Support of Student Information Systems Application Developers, stating that "open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System". UC Berkeley has embarked on a "Student Information System Replacement Project" that is looking to "replace its constellation of aging, unique, disparate home-grown student systems with a modern, nimble and effective vendor-supported system". Systems including financial aid, registration, enrollment, admissions and records are being targeted for replacement. The existing Student Information Systems(SIS) has been in place for over two decades, and facing the same for future systems, the students led organization that represents over 35K students, is taking a stance to ensure that all future systems have APIs. That is some serious forethought and leadership on behalf on the ASUC Senate! SB 48 puts forth that: an API, or Application Programming Interface, is a foundation put in place on top of a system to securely make specific information and data public to developers for those developers to create third-party extensions and applications pertaining to their specific uses for the data and program API and Integration Architect of UC Berkeley, George Atala(@gmatala) adds: &ldquo;An SIS API would be critical for supporting the many user applications and other campus systems that serve students. These systems change and evolve continuously, and a real time read/write API is necessary to enable this. The API must cover the full range of core functionality in the SIS, and should support appropriate levels of security for private and public data.&rdquo; The bill authored by Sahil A Pandya and Quinn Z Shen nails some of the critical areas around APIs being a vital aspect of university operations, and that much of the SIS overhaul will not happen all at once, when in reality the evolution of all campus systems should happen in smaller, bite-size chunks. APIs would help evolve campus information systems...[<a href="/2013/11/21/university-of-california-student-senate-submits-bill-stating-student-information-systems-must-have-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm working on an API for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. I'm working my way through a document from Department of Education called the 2013-2014 Application Processing System Specifications for Software Developers. I'm isolating various datasets, and data models, trying to get a feel for all the API resources I will need for the FAFSA API. The specifications provides several tables of data and data models for me to use, including the actual fields for the FAFSA form. One dataset that is provided in the PDF is a list of states. It makes sense that a list of states is included for any developer who is building a federal student aid application. And I have a states API available elsewhere, that I've used in several other applications, so building this API will for the project will be easy. Next I'm thinking..how do I replicate this utility API easily for an external API project like this? One of the architectural considerations for the FAFSA API is to make an API that anyone could fork and easily setup for their own use. That includes the state API resource. This got me thinking about APIs in general. When it comes to APIs, they are ften attached to brands, like the Twilio API or Twitter API. We do not think of single API definitions as ubiquitous, as utilities or as commodities yet. However there are a lot of common API resources like states, IP addresses, counties, cities and many more, that are essential to many web and mobile applications. Sure these datasets are widely available, but you need to actually design and deploy the actual API. How do we make utility APIs like this deployable anywhere? Anytime? I should be able to select from a library of common API definitions and easily fork, then deploy to my AWS EC2, AWS Cloud Formation or OpenShift platform.

			<p>
I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a &ldquo;need analysis&rdquo; based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.
I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created this umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work, and created an individual project site just for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid API.
You can participate in the design and development process via the Gitihub repositories, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.
Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA...

			<p><em>21 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I've been pushing the boundaries of open data and API deployment using Github. I have a project I've been evolving since August called Simple API and its sister implementation api.ongithub.com, which allows you to launch an API by forking common API definitions that are hosted on Github.
I was recently introduced to similar approach to geospatial API deployment using GeoJSON stored on Github called GitSpatial. Using the same approach, GitSpatial lets allows you to oAuth into the API deployment platform using your Github login, then spiders your repositories and let's you sync the repositories that contain GeoJSON.
Then using three URL parameters:

user_name - Your GitHub user name
repo_name - A GitHub repo name
feature_set_name - A file in your repo that contains GeoJSON

GitSpatial allows you to construct a geo spatial API resource URI: http://gitspatial.com/:user_name/:repo_name/:feature_set_name
Pretty cool stuff! I might be a little biased here, but I think this type of API deployment via Github blueprints, plus JSON data stores is going to be big. I've been experimenting with API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift, and it seems like the next evolution in cloud driven API deployment to me.
The best part to this approach is that your data, configurations and core elements are maintained within your world as simple, open formats like JSON--then you get to externally connect, using Github, to premium API services that augment and enhance your existing resources.
Lookout for an increase in the number of Github + API solutions in the coming months...

			<p><em>20 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I created 11 very simple API designs for the launch of API Commons. We needed some API definitions to show the potential of the commons, so I wanted to design a handful of common API patterns to seed the launch.
For all 11 API designs I started with a Swagger definition, then using PHP and the Slim framework I quickly generated server side code for each API. I generate this code programmatically from the Swagger spec, but I also prefer going through the generated code and giving it a human touch.
This approach isn't just for these 11 API design templates, I'm using it for all my projects right now. I'm designing the API definition, generating and modifying the server side code, publishing Swagger UI documentation, then any client side code libraries I will need.

I'm publishing the API definition and Swagger UI, plus a project overview completely on Github. Currently I'm generating PHP / Slim framework driven code on AWS EC2 instance. I'm will expand this to include server side frameworks in Ruby, Python, Node.JS.
Next I will take each API definition + server-side code in PHP, Ruby, Python and Node.js and running on Amazon EC2 and port to run in AWS Cloud Formation and OpenShift from RedHat--providing an open API blueprint that others can deploy in the cloud.
This will be my basic process for any standard API design I'm evolving for API Commons, APIs I develop internally, as well any API that I design, develop and build for external projects.  As with my stories and open data, I want any API I design to be open and reusable by anyone who is in need of the same API.

			<p><em>20 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
With the growing number of hypermedia API deployments, hypermedia haters&copy; are going to lose a major argument, that hypermedia is just an academic exercise and will never work in the wild. ;-)
The latest hypermedia API I was told about&nbsp;in the wild(thanks @johnmusser), is from Amazon Web Services with the recent AppStream API--"a flexible, low-latency service that lets you stream resource intensive applications and games from the cloud".
The AWS AppStream API is an API that uses Hypertext Application Language (HAL),  a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between API resources, created by Mike Kelly(@mikekelly85) of Stateless.co. When HAL is used, with each API request, you get a  wealth of links that allow you to programmatically explore the functionality of an API.
For example, you can explore the JSON returned in each response from the application API endpoint, about a specific app you are streaming including using the services, you will find links to determine application status, show information on current session and many more.
Normally with APIs, developers have to explore each API endpoint, and read through documentation to understand the different actions that can be taken against an API. With HAL, API owners can craft links that provide meaningful actions that can be discovered and implemented by developers along the way, teaching them about what is possible with each API call.
Hypermedia goes a long way in extending business rules to developers, not just directing them to what next steps may be taken at each API request, but really save them a lot of homework on how your API business model works, and how to best build an application around an API.
There are other hypermedia APIs in the wild, including the very important Public Media Platform (PMP), but the numbers are still low. I will keep finding quality hypermedia solutions in the wild and sharing them with you as I find.

I was going through the Free Law Project Court Opinion API today, playing with the API and data, while developing some server and client side tooling.  All the API endpoints are pretty consistence because they used their Django model and the Tastypie framework to generate most of the API.
There is one endpoint that is radically different from the rest of the opinion API: the /search endpoint. The Free Law Project used Apache Solr to generate the /search endpoint results and instead of directly hitting just the database for information it utilized Solr index to do the heavy lifting.
Using Solr opens up a whole world of search by introducing common concepts like AND, OR, NOT, fielded queries, wildcards, fuzzy searches and much more when it comes to searching for court opinions.
While the on-boarding of Solr newbies to an endpoint like this takes some education, and the opinion API /search endpoint docs could use a little more polishing to  make it easier to start using, but the concept of a Solr driven endpoint is still very interesting.
Using Solr like this might not work for all API providers, but for some who are heavily using data stores that include document repositories as well, it might be a good idea.&nbsp;
While I have advocated for using Solr to generate an API before, this is the first time I've seen it bundled alongside another API offering so seamlessly, just to drive the search endoint.  I'll be keeping an eye out for others during my regular monitoring.

			<h3><a href="/2013/11/19/the-free-law-projects-launches-court-opinion-api/">The Free Law Projects Launches Court Opinion API</a></h3>
			<p><em>19 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
The Free Law Project has launched a U.S. court opinions API as part of the Court Listener project, which currently aggregates 2,204,339 court opinions, from 350 jurisdictions.
The Court Listener Opinions API is a well designed, dead simple REST API with 7 endpoints to search opinions, citations across jurisdictions, using Basic Auth to secure the API.
Along with the simple API and docs, the Court Listener provides a blog and forum to support developers, and bulk downloads of all data in addition to the REST API.
The court opinions API implementation is a model to follow for other public sector open data and API projects. The API and supporting developer area is simple and very well done, providing all the essential building blocks needed to grow an ecosystem around the API and data.
The entire API and data is released in the  public domain, and relies on donations to do the work and keep the lights on--something that should be the bar set for all public data projects.
This external, open approach to liberating, aggregating and improving on vital public sector data, is a model we need to replicate across all areas of city, county, state and federal government in all sectors.

			<p><em>18 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I'm tracking on the evolution of Executive Order 13642 from last May, which was the White House directive to make open and machine readable the new default for government information. The piece that I'm tracking on specifically right now is around the OMB Memorandum M-13-13 Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, in which one of the items require agencies to publish a data.json file that provides a machine readable inventory of each agencies public data assets.
Much like the tracking I did around the digital strategy, I've stood up a monitoring script that I got from Philip Ashlock's Github, which I will be running daily to track on which agencies have published their data.json in anticipation of the November 30th deadline. A handful of agencies already have their data.json file up, others show a green check, but in reality their HTTP status codes are incorrect, as I've talked about before.
I'll re-run this script nightly and keep an eye on which agencies publish their data.json and highlight what types of data sets they've made available. I think in reality, the challenges faced in taking inventory of open data, getting them published will prevent many agencies from making the deadline. Something that was just made worse by the government shutdown in October.
Even with these challenges, I'm hopeful that agencies will surprise us and publish some amazing stuff.

			<p><em>18 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
The folks over at Dyn who provide traffic, message, remote access and domain services, including a suite of SOAP and REST based APIs, have released some interesting stats on their API usage.
Dyn has 500 managed DNS users and partners using their APIs, growing from 7.3 million monthly API requests in January 2012 to 38.1 million API requests in September 2013, that is a 420% growth over 20 months.
In their data they split out who is using SOAP vs REST APIs, with only 3.3% of their total API requests being SOAP, with almost no growth in same time period, compared to the 420% growth in REST usage.
I don't think the data is particularly noteworthy, it represents what we already know about the space and see reflected in other charts. What I think is noteworthy is Dyn sharing the data. You don't see many API publishers sharing their numbers, and its something I'd like to see more of.

			<p><em>17 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>photo credit I'm totally thankful for the experiences I've had over the last 90 days in Washington D.C. as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and even more thankful I'm able to keep doing much of the work I was doing during my fellowship. In reality, I'm actually doing more work now, than I was in DC. While there were several challenges during my time as a PIF, the one that I regret the most, and is taking the longest to recover from, is losing my storytelling voice. This is my ability to capture everyday thoughts in real-time via my Evernote, sit down and form these thoughts into stories, and then share these stories publicly as the API Evangelist. During my time in DC, I was steadily losing my voice. It wasn't some sort of government conspiracy. It is something that seems to happen to me in many institutional or corporate settings, amidst the busy schedule, back to back meetings and through a more hectic project schedule--eventually my voice&nbsp;begins to fade. In July I wrote 61 blog posts, August 41 and September 21. A very scary trend for me. My blog is more than just just stories for my audience and page views generated. My blog(s) are about me working through ideas and preparing them for public consumption. Without storytelling via my blog(s) I don't fully process ideas, think them through, flush them out and think about the API space with a critical eye. Without this lifecycle I don't evolve in my career, and maintain my perspective on the space. In October I've written 28 posts and so far in November I've already written 27 posts, so I'm on the mend. In the future, I'm using my voice as a canary in the coal mine. If a project I'm working on is beginning to diminish my voice, I need to stop and take a look at things, and make sure I'm not heading in a negative direction....[<a href="/2013/11/17/on-losing-my-storytelling-voice/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Sometimes no matter how hard you try, you can't get the buy in for APIs within a company or organization. There are many reasons why API efforts will fail within entrenched companies, organizations or government agencies, but in the end you may have to look for alternatives.
If you want to fullfill your API vision, many times you will need to go outside normal operations to get things done. I have multiple projects on my plate right now that have been started as internal projects, but after hitting roadblock after roadblock, key players have approached me to consider doing as an outside project.
One of the best ways to get people interested in APIs, is to get everyone around them talking about APIs or even getting key partners to adopt an API driven approach to a problem. If you can get traction for an API design externally, you may be able to change attitudes.
APIs are about opening up resources for access and use. If you can't get an API designed, developed and deployed internally, consider maybe doing it from the outside-in.

			<p><em>17 Nov 2013</em></p>
			<p>
API Commons is about providing a simple and transparent mechanism for the copyright free sharing and collaborative design of API specifications, interfaces and data models. When learning about API Commons it can be easy to focus on the obvious technical deliverables of the project, API definitions, data models, schemas and specifications.
While API Commons is about providing a place to house these very technical design specifications, the largest benefit of API commons will be the process  , community and culture that will form around it. Bringing API design across government and industries out into the open, focusing on sharing, collaboration, reuse and operability will be the true end product--not just the tangible API definition.
As I work on a handful of new API designs for various projects, that I plan on putting in the commons when ready, the importance of API Commons becomes ever clearer. While the end goal appears to be populating the commons with API designs, the real work is about bringing everyone out of the shadows, working on their API designs in a collaborative, re-usable way.
Laying the right foundation for this new API economy.
