        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/11/05/project-idea-codenvylike-containerized-spreadsheets/">Project Idea: Codenvy-Like Containerized Spreadsheets</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/docker-spreadsheets.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote a story about a company I&rsquo;m advising for last week called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">Codenvy, who is delivering modular, scalable, cloud development environments using their web IDE and Docker</a>. I'm currently working my way through the spreadsheet to API, and API to spreadsheet solutions I track on, and it is making me think that someone should deliver a <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>-like containerized spreadsheet environment.</p>
<p>With this type of environment you could forever end the emailing of spreadsheets, allowing people to craft spreadsheets, complete with all the data and visualization goodness they desire, and clone, fork, share, and collaborate around these containerized spreadsheets. You could have a library of master planned spreadsheets that your company depends on, and manage user permissions, analytics, and even scalability, performance, and distribution of vital spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Using this platform you could easily spawn spreadsheet driven APis using services like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>, and you could come full circle and have spreadsheets that obtain their data directly from valuable API driven resources, to really blow your mind. Personally I'm not a big spreadsheet lover, but I do recognize that it is where a majority of the worlds data resides, and the user interface of choice for many business folk--making it a good candidate for the next generation of containerized API data sources, and clients.</p>
<p>Just another one of my random ideas that accumulate in my Evernote, that I'll never have time to build myself, and hoping you will tackle for me. As I review all of the existing spreadsheet APi solutions available currently, I&rsquo;m sure I'll have more API centric, spreadsheet ideas bubble over t o share with you.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://messente.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/messente-sms-api.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I found the DNS implementation over at the Messente SMS API interesting, and worth of sharing for deeper evaluation. I've been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/26/gathering-my-thoughts-around-common-patterns-for-base-urls-across-nearly-700-apis/">considering the various approaches by API providers when crafting their domains, or subdomains for API access</a> heavily over the last couple weeks.</p>
<p>During some research time today I stumbled across the M<a href="https://messente.com/">essente SMS API</a> which opts to provide two domains for making HTTP(S) requests of their API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>api2.messente.com</li>
<li>api3.messente.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Messente provides a little disclaimer to handle the developer side of manual load-balancing these API calls:</p>
<blockquote><em>These two domains have the same final destination regarding the API functions. In order to ensure that your requests always reach Messente API services, please use one of them as primary and the second one as backup. Both API domains work as equal, but in case of any unexpected downtime with one of them (HTTP 5xx), the other one must be used on client side.</em></blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure this manual approach to providing API endpoints is the optimal path when delivering on the stability of your API, let alone the location of your resources, but it does provide an interesting contrast on the perspectives that are available out there in API-land.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I should rebrand as API Anthropologist, as I find the approach of my fellow API providers more interesting than what I'd expect to find in a mature API landscape. This reflects the importance of showcasing what is going on, to help bridge to where we should be, rather than focusing exclusively on where we should be. (deep shit, man)</p>

<p><em>This is a guest post from one of our sponsors. We actually cringed, and puked in our mouth a little bit when we saw an email come in from this company, requesting a post, but they paid us well, and we knew the topic would generate an insane amount of page views, so what the hell&mdash;we can drink more so we can sleep at night.</em></p>
<p>Our company didn't actually write this post, we just grabbed it from a blog that we regularly read, written by someone who actually understands the topic. This approach is much more beneficial to us, as we don't actually have to have any creativity, or skill, and it doesn't cost us a dime! #winning</p>
<p>When we found this post, it had an informative title, but for the purposes of this guest post we changed the title a little bit, in an effort to make it more desirable, clickable, and shareable by our readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This post also had a lot more context when we found it, but for the purposes of this guest post we are going to remove most of that context. We also want to make sure and not cite the author, and potentially provide any unnecessary background--well maybe a Twitter account so people can spew venom at them. All of this goes along way in making sure the article invokes the passion we are looking to generate, which will result in the volume of traffic we desire.</p>
<p>Once this is posted, we will syndicate to the places on the Internet where the worst people you can imagine dwell. This is the tech industry, so there are some pretty proven places to go to find these types of folks. These people don&rsquo;t represent the entire Internet, but because they are so outspoken, you'd think they do. All we have to do is post a link, artificially pump up the first few votes, and the community does the rest. #magic</p>
<p>We just want to encourage a &lsquo;conversation". We don't care if people are actually represented fairly, that any critical context is missing, or people might not be safe&mdash;we just want the page views. Thank you for joining us to bring out the worst of the Internet, and ensuring a very vocal minority continues to have a platform to spread the worst aspects of our society.</p>
<p>This is the beauty of the Internet and advertising models, is that we get paid to continue making the Internet a total cesspool. #thankyou</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.carvoyant.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/carvoyant/carvoyant-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m digging deeper into my Evernote lately, getting back to those half written stories I have laying around, and next up is about the Carvoyant API sandbox and simulator. I came across their <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/2014/10/31/free-connectedcar-data-candy-in-the-sandbox/">Free #connectedcar data candy in the Sandbox blog post</a>, and was intrigued by the concept of a simulator, not just for IoT related APIs, but potentially for any API.</p>
<p>Carvoyant provides a free API account which comes with a <a href="https://sandbox-driver.carvoyant.com/">sandbox API for playing with the platform</a>, and a <a href="https://sandbox-auth.carvoyant.com/login/auth">traffic simulator that allows you generate vehicle and trip data</a> for use in developing applications. I can see how a sandbox plus simulator is essential for developing automotive related applications, as you can&rsquo;t be expected to have real car connection and data in all scenarios, something clearly Carvoyant has put a lot of thought, and work into.</p>
<p>Providing an API sandbox plus API simulator seems like it could also be two essential building blocks required for all device based API platforms, aka Internet of Things. This approach would be significant in on boarding new developers, providing them with immediate scenarios they can hack against, to learn about an API, as well as light the fire within their imagination regarding what is possible with the platform's API.</p>
<p>I already have a sandbox as one potential <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building block</a> that API providers should consider. I think I will also add a simulator to the API management building blocks, and keep an eye out for other API simulators in the wild. I know I&rsquo;ve covered <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/salesforce-adds-sandbox-templates/">sandbox templates from SaleForce</a> in the past, but usually once I&rsquo;ve seen something in the wild a couple of times, and add it as a formal building block to track on, I immediately tend see more of it out in the space. Have you seen any cool API simulators?</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="90" align="right" /></p>
<p>One pattern I'm seeing emerge on some of the API platforms I&rsquo;m watching from week to week are integration pages, showcasing the other 3rd party services than an API has integration with. An integration page is similar to an application showcase, but instead of showing apps build on an API, you are showcasing other platforms that are already integrated with.</p>
<p>A recent one that I&rsquo;ve seen out in the wild is from web development annotation platform <a href="https://usersnap.com">Usersnap</a>, showing the platforms they connect to:</p>
<p><a href="https://usersnap.com/connect"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/usersnap/usersnap-integrations.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The second I came across was from <a href="http://www.opsgenie.com/">OpsGenie</a>, the alerts and notification platform, showcasing all of the common platform they work with:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opsgenie.com/integrations"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/opsgenie/opsgenie-integrations.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add an integrations page to my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks for API providers</a> to consider. An integration page can showcase a wide range of integrations that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">introduce reciprocity into platform operations</a>. Integrations could start with using Zapier, but could also be seamless, providing plug and play connectors for users. I would say integrations goes right up to what I call platform development kits (PDK), which would be open source code that developers could use to get up and running on 3rd party platforms.</p>
<p>If you don't have any existing integrations to showcase, I recommend spending some time and figure out the top 5 platforms that would complement the value delivered by your API, and get to work integrating. Existing API integrations are great for stimulating the imagination of developers, as well as provide ready to go solutions for non-developers--either way an integrations page will help onboard new API consumers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-stack-api-frameworks.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I write up a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/03/the-expanding-api-universe-more-api-sdk-focused-services-emerge/">story on Magnet</a>, another one of the API SDK service providers to emerge in the space, I can't help but evaluate what other building blocks have the potential to evovolve, and be offered as a specific service. Machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://bitly.com/1tnYxV8">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> make services like <a href="http://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> and Magnet possible, and I enjoy thinking about other potential services that could be easily generated from definitions in this way.</p>
<p>One possiblity that comes to mind is server side scaffolding, and the possibilities of generating server side scaffolding for your APIs in a variety open source API frameworks, using machine readable definitions. It is difficult to generate 100% of the server side of an API using machine readable API definitions, but you sure can go a long way in auto generating a scaffolding that will get you most of the way there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m picturing a whole library of every REST framework known to man (and woman), and the ability to select framework, and upload a machine readable Swagger specification, and the service generates a zip file, or publishes to Github for you. The service would save you the time of going out and finding the latest version of your favorite (or clients) REST framework, and do most of the heavy lifting in setting up, configuring, and crafting API endpoints. Eventually you might think about other ways to distribute, like docker containers on AWS, Google, and even PaaS services like Heroku.</p>
<p>It would be easy to use <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files to find API design patterns, and make those available in a library alongside all of the available REST frameworks. I would build this myself, but I just don't have time, and it isn&rsquo;t an idea I think anyone is going to get rich off of, but I think you could make a good living charging a couple bucks to generate server side API scaffolding, and keep tabs on the latest REST API frameworks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep sharing these ideas that are generated from my monitoring of the API space, in hopes some of you take advantage of them, and bring them to life.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/elasticsearch/elastic-search-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>, the open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine just announced that it is introducing a security layer on top of their API driven search platform.  Historically you have to secure any APIs exposed via Elasticsearch through your own proxy or firewall solution, now with "<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/shield">Shield</a>" you can natively manage your APIs directly in Elasticsearch.</p>
<blockquote><em>Shield, in the same spirit of Marvel, is built on top of Elasticsearch public extensions points, and is easily installed as a plugin to add security features to any existing Elasticsearch installation. It does not require a different distribution of Elasticsearch, and relies heavily on the open public APIs Elasticsearch already exposes.</em></blockquote>
<p>The security Elasticsearch is bringing to the table reflects the core features you see in the API space from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3scale.net/">API infrastructure providers like 3Scale</a>--providing the basics of what you need to secure access to API endpoints:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Role-based Access Control - </strong>Set granular cluster, index, and alias-level permissions for each user of your Elasticsearch cluster. For example, allow the marketing department to freely search and analyze social media data with read-only permissions, while preventing access to sensitive financial data.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication System Support -</strong> Shield integrates with LDAP-based authentication systems as well as Active Directory, so your users don&rsquo;t need to remember yet another password. We also provide a native authentication system, for those who want to manage all access within Elasticsearch.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Communications -</strong> Node-to-node encryption protects your data from intruders. With certificate-based SSL/TLS encryption and secure client communications with HTTPS, Shield keeps data traveling over the wire protected.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Logging - </strong>Ensure compliance and keep a pulse on security-related activity happening in your Elasticsearch deployment; record login failures and attempts to access unauthorized information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've had Elasticsearch in the <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment research project</a> for some time now, but now I will add it to my&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research as well.</a> If you can manage your API access, user roles, and generate log files for analytics from Elasticsearch API endpoints, the tool is moving squarely into the API management category.</p>
<p>I makes me happy to see open source tools like Elasticsearch improving their security features. Elasticsearch is something I recommend to government agencies to use when looking to open up access to document stores, using APIs. I would like to see more of the API management players working together to allow for interoperability between management platforms, but I&rsquo;m guessing this is a wish I won&rsquo;t get anytime soon.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.</em></p>

I wrote about <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a> a few months back and how they are focused on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/07/evolving-how-we-approach-the-api-lifecycle-with-apimatic/">generating high quality SDKs</a> from machine readable API formats like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>.</p>
<p>This last week I was introduced to another provider, <a href="https://magnet.com/">Magnet</a>, and their <a href="https://developer.magnet.com/">rest2mobile service</a> which will &ldquo;generate mobile native code for REST services&rdquo;.  Magnet has chosen to focus exclusively on mobile SDKs, where Apimatic is focused on web and mobile SDKs. I consider web SDKs one building block, and mobile SDKs another building block, and companies should evaluate their need for them side-by-side, something service providers like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a> and <a href="https://magnet.com/">Magnet</a> are looking to assist with.</p>
<p>As the API universe continues its expansion we will see more API services like these emerge who are focused on helping API providers better deliver the building blocks of their API platforms. I will keep tracking on the common building blocks of API design, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, and continue to showcase interesting companies stepping up to provide services that deliver the valuable building blocks the space needs to operate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://readme.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/readme/readme-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It makes me happy to see new arrivals in the world of API management service providers, especially after all the consolidation we saw last year with many of the 1st and 2nd wave of providers like Mashery, Vordel, Layer7, and Apiphany. One of the new API management providers that have emerged is <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme</a>, who is looking to provide an attractive, simple, and intuitive way to launch developer portals for your APIs.</p>
<p>Readme reminds me of some of the landing page tools designed for web marketers over the last decade, to provide informative gateways for site visitors, but ReadMe is all about providing meaningful doorways to our API resources. First, I like ReadMe's definition of what is a developer hub?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Topical guides, tutorials and troubleshooting.</li>
<li><strong>API Reference </strong>- Low-level, deep-dive reference material.</li>
<li><strong>Community -</strong> Provide support and answer questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their definition of what is a developer hub is goes beyond just the technical documentation as what many developers see, and acknowledges that your portal should be about providing the resources necessary to educate API consumers, and potentially build community around their needs. ReadMe provides the essential building blocks I'd expect of any modern API portal builder:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Theme Builder </strong>- Easily create a beautiful dev community that matches your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Editor - </strong>Markdown-based drag-and-drop editor makes documentation almost fun.</li>
<li><strong>API Explorer - </strong>Let users play with your API right inside the documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Application Keys - </strong>Your users can view their application keys embedded right in the docs.</li>
<li><strong>Support - </strong>Let users ask questions and request features in the support forums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then ReadMe goes a little further to include some concepts that I see in some of the leading API providers, features that go beyond just basic features, allowing you to better manage your API portal:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Collaboration -</strong> Crowdsource your docs! Users can keep docs current by suggesting changes.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Sync -</strong> Keep auto-generated reference docs synced with your actual code changes.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning - </strong>Maintaining old or testing beta versions of your docs is a breeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, emulating the social elements that Github has introduced into the world of coding, in your API program is essential. You cannot manage your entire API community by yourself, and including your developer in the process is essential. This adds relevant layers to the term "open" that everyone likes to use, providing the roots you will need to actually build trust with your developers, in something that goes both ways, and will also grow your own trust of developed within your own API community.</p>

<p>I'm keeping an eye on what ReadMe is up to, alongside the other API management providers I've been tracking on. I haven't give a lot of attention to the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> space in the last year, as I've been focusing on the faster growing areas like API <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, but now that I see new players stepping up, I will make sure and give the area equal attention in my research and monitoring.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2014</span>
        <p>I know. I&rsquo;m kind of a broken record this week, but I&rsquo;m trying to quantify the business model, and monetization strategies of APIs across various industries, and understanding what companies are charging for their services just makes me crazy sometimes. I don&rsquo;t know what people are thinking when they craft their approach to explaining what an API will cost to access.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about over at <a href="http://www.stocklytics.com/">Stocklytics</a>. When you land on Stocklytics home page, this is what you see:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/stocklytics/stockyltics-completely-free.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>After spending some time looking for anything else about pricing, I signed up for the service, and after I logged in to my account I found this page, which then takes me directly to a Paypal page:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/stocklytics/stocklytics-credit-account.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Do companies even think about what this does to the on-boarding process? I&rsquo;m not evening focusing on the errors in my brand new developer account that I had to contend with before I discovered the add credits page. At this point, why would use this service? Even if the data is amazing? You just bullshitted me into signing up for your service. There was never a mention of cost until I signed up.</p>
<p>This is one of the things I love about the API space--the dead simple lessons in the value of honesty and transparency. I really don&rsquo;t care how you structure the pricing for API, I&rsquo;ll let developers vote with their usage of your API decide that. What I do care about is how you communicate your pricing. There really isn&rsquo;t any reason to hide your pricing&mdash;just be straight up about it, and I bet you&rsquo;ll do a lot more business as a result.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-magic.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you look through as many APIs as I do, you start to get a feeling for many of the subtle signals, that can result in a wealth of information about the actual viability of an API. One signal I'm starting to track on more is pricing, and I'm gathering more details about how an API provider articulates their pricing, or often times doesn&rsquo;t. The way an API provider discusses their business model can tell you so much about their motivations, the amount of resources they have available, and the experience they have in managing APIs and engaging developers.</p>
<p>Pundits in the space love to talk about the viability of public vs private API, and that public APIs just aren't viable, and will be going away soon. When in reality the public vs. private discussion is not the issue, it is lack of business model, and monetization strategy that is the real tell in all of this. Public APIs like Twilio and Amazon do not have a problem, because they have put a lot of thought into their business models, and their pricing is well thought out, competitive, and front and center in their API developer areas--they aren't in danger because they are public?? DOH!</p>
<p>The companies who will be shuttering their API programs often do not have clear pricing on their site, reducing pricing to be simply a question in the FAQ, and something you have to request more information on.  Many companies are trained in sales techniques and are just looking to apply this knowledge in the world of APIs, but I&rsquo;d say for many of the companies I evaluate, hiding or obfuscating your pricing is not about entrenched sales practices, it is more about exploitation at every turn.</p>
<p>As I go through the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700 API companies in my API Stack</a>, I&rsquo;m tracking on the details of their business model, and will be judging APIs on how they showcase their pricing (or don't). I don't care if companies are still working to figure it out, or have top tiers that are &ldquo;enterprise pricing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;request more details&rdquo;. What I do care about is how communicative you are about your pricing, and enforcing that the pricing for API resources is one of the most important signals you can send as part of your API management strategy.</p>
<p>Remember, when you use Twitter as and example of how public APIs aren&rsquo;t viable, you are actually referencing the lack of a coherent business model that fully includes the developer ecosystem, and has nothing to do with the viability of public APIs. Public APIs are here to stay, but the smoke and mirrors of &ldquo;enterprise pricing&rdquo; will have to evolve if you expect to play in this new game, and actually get the attention of developers.</p>
<p><em>P.S. The magic wand is my new icon for "enterprise pricing", because I see the term being used as a magic wand for making up pricing, more than I see it used as viable sales cycles. I searched for images of pulling pricing out of your ass, but it didn't result in family friendly images I can show here, so I'm using a magic wand.</em></p>

<p>I'm just going to keep putting my ideas out there, so that y'all will build what is needed for the API space. In support of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">API design tool</a>, and my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">interactive API documentation tool</a>, I want a <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> generated visualization layer for APIs, using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m envisioning a whole marketplace of visualizations I can choose from, driven from various popular APIs like Twitter, Crunchbase, OpenCorporates, and much more. There are number of proprietary data visualizations tools emerging out there (I&rsquo;m watching you), but what I'm looking for is specifically an open solution using D3.js.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem if there are premium layers, and features that are driven by commercial APIs, or there being added charges for API consumption in general, but I want the visualization, and underlying JSON to be open and configurable&mdash;encouraging access and re-use.</p>
<p>It can be tough to help people understand just exactly what an API is, and I feel like an open visualization layer using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, driven from <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> would be one of the quickest ways to help people understand exactly what value an API can deliver.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dictionary.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through each of the 100+ business sectors I track on as part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>. As I make my way through each sector, and generate <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files, the language of the resources used across a particular sector starts to come into focus. I&rsquo;m talking about the words used for crafting URLs, parameters, and the underlying data models for common APIs.</p>
<p>In a perfect world everyone would come together and use something like <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, and work to extend, in an organized, collaborative way across different industries&mdash;I would call this the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) approach. Unfortunately what we have is a shitload of dialects popping up, driven from the dark depths of our legacy IT infrastructure, only seeing the light of day when an API gets exposed, and the dialect used by an isolated IT tribe all of a sudden becomes part of the mainstream world.</p>
<p>Some weeks my inbox seems to reflect where my research is going, and as I ponder the language used by popular news sites like NYTimes, USA Today, and NewsCred, I get an email from a reader in Europe, who works at the equivalent of BBC their country, who asks:</p>
<blockquote><em>Currently I'm thinking about the API vocabulary and i wonder if there is some kind of standard out there when it comes to the verbs, parameters, etc. that are used for Media/Broadcaster API`s. I think there should be some kind of standard (used by netflix, bbc, espn, abc, etc..) Do you have any idea if there is such a standard?</em></blockquote>
<p>If there is a schema.org for the broadcasting industry I&rsquo;m unaware of it. As I generate a crude dictionary for each of my API Stack business sectors I will stop, and conduct some due diligence on what is already out there for each industry regarding standards, etc. I&rsquo;m assuming if there is, it won't always be Internet ready, let alone API ready, but hopefully there is already something that is driven by the industry that can provide a starting point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the need for a common dictionary, when it comes to API design, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my thoughts on a perfect API design editor</a>. I will work to publish any dictionaries that I aggregate, as they come into focus. As with much of the API space I suspect that dictionaries will be defined from bottom up, using common slang used in the space, as opposed to a top down from coordinated OED approach, but hopefully by aggregating and educating API designers we can make strides towards a more coherent API space in some of the business sectors currently being impacted by APIs.</p>

<p>Throughout 2014, when I look at the top 10 posts in my Google Analytics dashboard each month, there has been a consistent theme of what stories are driving page views. The concept of a page is only one metric I look at when evaluating where the API space might be going, and while I don&rsquo;t write stories specifically to page views, they do provide me with a general barometer of what my readers are interested in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing give areas consistently generating the most views across the API Evangelist Network:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal APIs - </strong>This slot is pretty much dominated by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret To Amazons Success Is Internal</a> story getting thousands of page view each month, even with being written back in January of 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page App Tooling - </strong>Simple, easy to use formable single page apps like my <a href="http://csv-converter.publicprivatesector.org/">CSV Converter</a>, and my <a href="http://data.ongithub.com/">Data.Ongithub.com</a> produce some really long lasting traffic, providing value to users.</li>
<li><strong>API Design - </strong>This is definitely the topic of 2014, with all of my stories talking about <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tools like Swagger and API Blueprint dominating the top 10.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia - </strong>Its time has come in 2014, and hypermedia stories like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">What Are Some Examples of Hypermedia APIs</a> are popular with developers, and non-developers when it comes to understand what hypermedia is all about.</li>
<li><strong>API Roundups -</strong> A pretty proven formula of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/26/payment-apis-that-i-am-watching/">rounding up listings of APIs for a specific purpose</a>, the only difference is when I do it, I personally look at each API and make sure there is something there, defining what I consider to be <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com">API stacks or collections.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll revisit this at the end of the year and see if it still stands up. For me it provides some sort of map of where my readers heads are at, and by no means is any measurement of where the API space is going, but is at least a place to start thinking about what is on people&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t spend much time looking at metrics across my platform, but I see a lot of interesting trends, and I like being a transparent layer for the API space, so I think i will try to better track on some patterns I&rsquo;m seeing in my own network, as well as across the space, and share as stories here on the blog.</p>

<p>I was taking a look through the <a href="http://www.newscred.com/developer/docs">NewsCred API</a> yesterday and there was a parameter I have seen before, but find interesting, and wanted to share with you. It was a field called query_fields, which you could include the fields you wished to have searched, using a keyword provided in the parameter &ldquo;q&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You often see a parameter which determines which fields I get back with my response, but I like the concept of have a parameter to choose which fields I want searched in the first place. I think it is a simple, parameter based way to give developers more control over their API calls, in a way that will make sense to a wide audience.</p>
<p>Now I need to figure out a way to aggregate these simple little <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tricks and make them available to readers when they are designing their APIs. My goal is to help API designers make their APIs as powerful as possible, while keeping the surface area as simple as possible along the way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2014</span>

<p>The production environment for delivering web and mobile applications has radically evolved in the last couple years, becoming more distributed, scalable, virtualized, and containerized. APIs, and new development frameworks are providing a smorgasbord of resources for developers to put to work, and devops is putting more power and control, throughout the development life cycle, directly into a developers hands. It is time that a developers environment evolves to keep pace with the environment developers are building applications for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">containerization in the API space</a>&nbsp;for a while now, something that is still a very manual process, so I have been looking out  for a potential development environment that matches my vision for orchestration with APIs for some time now. This is why I was stoked when I ran into Tyler Jewell (<a href="https://twitter.com/TylerJewell">@TylerJewell</a>) back in September, who introduced me to <a href="http://codenvy.co">Codenvy</a>&mdash;"a new SaaS developer environment that allows developers to create hosted environments optimized for creating, editing, compiling, testing and debugging applications authored in different programming languages&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://codenvy.com"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codenvy/codenvy-api-ide-screenshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At first glance Codenvy appears to be just another web-based IDE, with autocomplete, data source management, and Github integration. As you play with more you begin to realize you can configure and share projects, allowing you to setup environments, share and even clone them. Then you realize the whole IDE is configurable, clone-able, shareable, and scalable using the ever popular Docker, complete with API or CLI access to all work spaces, projects and files. This is the environment I was looking for&mdash;this is the orchestration I envision for building applications using APIs.</p>
<p>My head is swimming with ideas of how I can orchestrate application development environments now that both the development and production environments are containerized, scalable, bite-size goodness, complete with a Github layer in the middle. While many users of Codenvy will be using to manage their own devop workflow, I will be pursuing it to manage my own infrastructure, but more importantly using it as a platform to craft <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">custom API stacks</a>, share and publish publicly, and explore more opportunities around being an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/flare"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/eclipse/eclipse-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Another layer to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">release of Codenvy this week</a>, was the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20141027_cloud_initiative.php">announcement of the Eclipse project Che</a>, an open source "project to create a platform for SAAS developer environment that contains all of the tools, infrastructure, and processes necessary for a developer to edit, build, test, and debug an application&rdquo;.  Che represents the next generation IDE that runs in the cloud, which coincides with other signs I've seen around <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> moving into the IDE with signals from API pioneers like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-with-the-developers-ide/">SalesForce&nbsp;and Google</a>, or from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">Microsoft in Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about Che, but I&rsquo;m beginning to see two distinct ways Che and APIs can be employed. First lets start with the environment:</p>
<blockquote><em>You can build extensions for Che, and when those extensions are compiled into the kernel, Che creates server-side microservices, a RESTful API, and cross-browser optimized JavaScript, which is then pluggable into a browser IDE. With Che, developers are given the pluggable structure of Eclipse, but accessible through a cloud environment.</em></blockquote>
<p>This means you can orchestrate development workflows, with APIs. You can predefine, deploy, customize, maintain and orchestrate very modular development environment where everything can be controlled via API. What a perfect environment for orchestrating the next generation of application development.</p>
<p>Next I see APIs leading the development lifecycle as well, not just defining the development environment and process. Earlier stories I&rsquo;ve done on API discovery via SDKs, showcase SaleForce and Google providing native discovery of their APIs directly in Eclipse. In an Eclipse Che driven development environment, you could define pre-built, or custom API stacks, bringing exactly the API resources developers will need and bake them directly into their IDE&mdash;meaning APIs find the developers, developers don&rsquo;t have to find their own APIs.</p>
<p>This approach to API discovery via the IDE provides some various interesting opportunity for marrying with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">earlier thoughts I&rsquo;ve had around being an API broker</a>. I can envision a future where API evangelism evolves to a point where you don&rsquo;t just represent one API, you can represent many APIs, and configure API fueled developer environments for building any type of application. Think of what <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers like Parse and Kinvey</a> have been doing since 2011, but now think of pre-configured, or custom tailored IDE environments with exactly the resources you need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting started with <a href="http://docs.codenvy.com/che/">Che</a>, and <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, so it will take me a while to work through my thoughts on using it as an API brokerage platform. The one thing you can count on me for, is that I will tell stories all along the way as I figure it out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-experience-design.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I really love the thought process around API design, and I am always looking for ways to push forward my craft. Telling stories is one way I do this, forcing me to make what I&rsquo;m doing understandable to a wider audience, which is also the exact thing I&rsquo;m trying to do with my API designs&mdash;mind blown!</p>
<p>An example of this in action is with my link API, which I use in multiple places across my API monitoring system. The Link API has a pretty basic design, that reflect the resource, and its underlying database structure:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/link/ (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li>
<li>Title, Description, and URL</li>
</ul>
<p>I use this API in numerous ways, the original API design is very much based upon the resource that it is, a link. As a developer who understands REST, and very much comes from a world of databases, this works just fine. However much of the magic around my usage of links is defined in my code, and not in my API interface, something I&rsquo;d like to change.</p>
<p>After having two separate conversations with folks about my link API, I experienced two very different motivations on using said link system, and came with very different perspectives on how to use mu ink API, that had nothing to do with the database or resource this API was born from.</p>
<p><strong>Archival Motivations</strong> <br />One person I discussed my link API with wants to use it for archiving a link. When they pass the link to an API, if it isn't already recorded it logs the URL, and then grabs a screenshot of the page, as well as stores any HTML content present. This could be a one time archive, or they could also pass a parameter that would set up a daily, weekly or monthly archive to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Harvesting Desires <br /></strong>The second person I discussed my link API with wants to use for harvesting of specific things from the page, and in this particular conversation it was to harvest all other links available on the page. You would pass the URL to the API, and get back a list of URLs available on the page. The only setting was to filter and return only URLs that contained the base URL of the URL being passed to the API (mouthful of URL).</p>
<p><strong>Pushing My Resources To Deliver Experiences </strong><br />This story reflects why I feel that companies should hurry up and begin their API journey, so they can begin moving beyond just APIs designed based upon the resources as they exist, to more of an experience based focus, designing APIs that deliver &nbsp;the solutions that people desire. Both of these folks I talked to were not programmers, and only understand APIs enough to be dangerous. They understand the basic CRUD abilities I gave with my resource design, but it doesn't excite them or really mean anything. What really motivates them was satisfying a specific need that fits in with their experiences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working on what this new set of APIs will look like based upon these thoughts, but I wanted to tell the story of this slight shift in my API design thinking. It is extremely difficult to see API design this way unless you are actively on your API journey, having discussions with people who want to use your APIs. It is easy for us developers to get caught up in perfectly defining our API resources from the technical perspective, when in reality the most important part of the journey seems to me is all about learning to craft APIs that deliver meaningful experiences, not serving up just services&mdash;experience oriented architecture over service oriented architecture.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">benefits of APIs over download of data stores</a> in the government space, and I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for other interesting examples of making data available via an API, as well as a full data download. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of research right now on the financial API space, and <a href="http://blog.quandl.com/blog/quandls-first-premium-databases/">stumbled across Quandl</a>, a data provider who has free access financial data APIs, while also selling access to premium databases.</p>
<p>Quandl has <a href="http://blog.quandl.com/blog/quandls-first-premium-databases/">aggregated 7 financial and economic databases into one database solution that you can pay to download</a>, or you can freely access via their unlimited use API--Quandl puts it like this:</p>
<blockquote><em>All these new premium databases will of course automatically benefit from Quandl&rsquo;s free data-usage features: unrestricted API access, integration with 20+ libraries and tools, unlimited downloads in any format, multiple export and visualization options, and more. (Needless to say, the addition of these premium databases to Quandl will not change the &ldquo;free Quandl experience&rdquo; in any way. All data and all features that are currently available for free on Quandl, will remain free forever.)</em></blockquote>
<p>It is an interesting approach to monetizing database assets, while also making freely available via an API. I&rsquo;m not exactly clear on what you get in database vs. the API with Quandl, but now that I have the &ldquo;building block&rdquo; identified, I will keep an eye out for other API providers who are doing similar things. Right now I&rsquo;m just looking at financial, banking, payment, and other commerce APIs, but I&rsquo;m sure there are other data providers doing similar things.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://blog.snapchat.com/post/99998266095/third-party-applications-and-the-snapchat-api"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/snapchat/snapchat-logo-transparent.png" alt="" width="220" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had several browser tabs open around the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-snapchat-future-security-idUSKCN0I32UJ20141014">recent Snapchat security breach</a>, hoping to craft an API-centric story around the whole affair. I think <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/readyapi/security-lessons-courtesy-of-snapchat/">SmartBear covers the security lesson around the Snapchat breach well</a>, my motivation in writing a story would be more about incentivizing popular mobile platforms like Snapchat to establish a robust approach to APIs, and provide a platform for everyone discuss the tech, business, and politics of application integration, rather than keeping it all in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>Your Application Programming Interface Surface Is Publicly Available</strong><br /> As I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/07/mapping-the-world-of-internal-apis-via-rogue-api-registry/">play with tools like Charles</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">API tools</a>, and other proxy and application traffic management tools, I can easily map out the surface area of any iPhone application I have installed&mdash;providing me with a blueprint of an API, and potentially its underlying data model. If I can do this for your mobile app, you have a public API, regardless of how you view the world.</p>
<p><strong>Bring More Awareness, Control, Security, And Stability To Platform</strong><br /> The benefits of have a public API approach to delivering a public mobile application gives you a new layer to understand how not just your mobile app is using resources, it gives you a central channel for al mobile, web, and Internet of Things apps to use. An API focus gives you a central point to log how resources are being access and put to use, introduce analytics, monitoring, and other vital security components into operations. There are a wealth of API management services available on the Internet, and having an API management strategy can open up a company to a wealth of vital resources across an application's lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimize 3rd Party Developers With A Modern API Platform</strong><br /> The 3rd party developer who was responsible for the latest Snapchat breach was not given official access to Snapchat APIs, because there is not formal API program. If there was a Snapchat API platform program, users could request access, and the platform could still deny acess to anyone they wished, and all applications would have to adhere to a standardized approach to dealing with identity, and access management for all resources. With a modern approach to API management, developers can be legitimized, while also providing a more secure perimeter to keep rogue applications from gaining access, and compromising privacy and security.</p>
<p><strong>Empower End-Users With Identity And Access Control (oAuth)</strong><br /> If you have a public mobile app available today, you owe it to your end-users to provide them with the latest in account management, and tools for managing who has access to their data. If you need a model for where the bar should be set, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/06/05/google-accounts-as-blueprint-for-all-software-as-a-service-applications/">go look at what Google does</a>. Modern approaches to API management, along with a common approach to using oAuth, provides the tools all mobile application users should have, allowing them to help contribute to their own security.  End-users need to be aware that they should only use mobile applications that provide API access, and oAuth controls, allowing them to take control over their digital footprint, and play an active role.</p>
<p>APIs are not a cure-all. I'm not prescribing APIs because they fix everything. I&rsquo;m prescribing APIs because it provides a layer where a platform, its users, 3rd party developers, and the public can come together and make sure any platform is seriously addressing security and privacy. APIs aren't just about innovation and all that bullshit you hear from us in Silicon Valley, they are about providing the access, and tools necessary to strike a balance in providing remote access (aka mobile) to wide variety of partners, 3rd party developers, all in support of end-users.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.snapchat.com/post/99998266095/third-party-applications-and-the-snapchat-api">Snapchat issued a response to all the API discussion on their blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>It takes time and a lot of resources to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem. That&rsquo;s why we haven&rsquo;t provided a public API to developers and why we prohibit access to the private API we use to provide our service. Don't get us wrong - we're excited by the interest in developing for the Snapchat platform - but we're going to take our time to get it right. Until then, that means any application that isn't ours but claims to offer Snapchat services violates our Terms of Use and can&rsquo;t be trusted.</em></blockquote>
<p>It does take time to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem, but with the proven blueprints already in existence, and a growing number of API service providers, it doesn't take a lot of resource. What Snapchat and other mobile providers lack is a healthy awareness of not just the tech of APIs, but also the critical business and political aspects of API operations, and just putting their head in the sand and pretending like these issues do not exist.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/api-management.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you have a publicly available mobile application, you have a publicly available API, and you should possess a modern API management strategy to protect the privacy and security of your end-users. How open you make access to this API is up to you, but I encourage you to make it as open as possible, providing transparency into security, and platform operations.  I don't feel like this is something state or federal government should be enforcing, but is something that should be the acceptable approach to delivering public applications, something that is enforced by end-users be educated about avoiding web and mobile applications that do not have an API, and this transparent approach, demonstrating they have each users privacy and security in mind.</p>
<p>What has happened to Snapchat will continue to happen to other companies, with an increased frequency. You can greatly mitigate the risks of having a public web or mobile application, with a formal API strategy, and <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/readyapi/security-lessons-courtesy-of-snapchat/">listening to security advice from providers like SmartBear</a>, as well as protecting the interests of your end-users.  If you do not have the expertise on staff at your company or organization, let me know, I can help point you in the right direction to find the resources you will need.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-stack/api-stack-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just finished going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and recording some information about each of the providers in my API monitoring system. When I started looking through my stack a couple days ago there was 830 companies listed, and after this pass through I carved the stack down to 690--why?</p>
<p><strong>APIs Go Away</strong><br /> It is a fact of life, APIs go away. I'm always amazed at how quickly an API will disappear or just fall into disrepair. I don&rsquo;t have time to assess what exactly has happened to all APIs, but if I get 404s, or can't find signs of an API program in 10 seconds, and a quick Google search, I pull them from the stack. I've noticed many start-ups seem to be coming out with a slick mobile app + API, and then a few months later the API seems to disappear. I'll start tracking on things better, and see if I can&rsquo;t produce some better examples to discuss this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Raising The Bar</strong><br /> As I look at hundreds of APIs, and try to get familiar with them, I can't help but get frustrated by certain things, something that inevitably raises the bar of what I include in my API stack, all along the way. Sometimes I'll notice an API is actually a SOAP web service, or after playing with I find it very difficult to navigate, on-board, and actually put to use. Whatever the reasons I will remove some companies from the stack, and while I will still be keeping an eye on what they are doing (or not doing), the API is not something I'm looking to shine a light on as part of my stack.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding The Docs</strong><br /> One thing I feel like I keep coming across as I look through APIs, are companies pulling back their API documentation. As with APIs going away, I don't always have details about what types of documentation were available historically (something that is changing), so it is hard to tell if an API had docs, then moved them behind a password protected area. Regardless, if I can&rsquo;t learn about an API, without registering for yet another account, you aren't in the stack. I will not be requesting access, signing up for, or begging you for the opportunity to learn about, and showcase your API.</p>
<p><strong>API Is A Priority</strong><br /> Your API is not a &ldquo;support entry&rdquo;, or &ldquo;advanced feature&rdquo;. Your API is the next step in the evolution of your companies online presence. While I may still showcase some seemingly dysfunctional APIs, usually there is other value present there, otherwise I wouldn't be highlighting a company's effort. If your API is buried deep within your CMS, or barely a footnote in your online presence, it is likely I won't be talking about it. You can tell sites where APIs are a priority, because they have portals available at http://developer.example.com, modern API documentation, simple sub-domains like http://api.example.com for their APIs, and a link to APIs in the header or footer navigation for a site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my API Stack will grow and shrink over time, and new APIs will come, and others will mature and be put back into the stack. Right now <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack is just a list of 690 companies doing interesting things with APIs</a>, and some basic details, with links to their efforts. I&rsquo;m working to better defining the over 100 business categories these companies exist in, as well as better define each API resource they possess, and I'm looking to continue providing a better defined API stack.</p>
<p>In 2014 when it comes to APIs I&rdquo;m a little more focused on quality, than quantity.</p>

<p>I just finished going through <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and looking for one simple thing&mdash;the base URL for each of their APIs. Throughout the process I looked at almost 700 API developer areas, trying to find the base URL they are using to serve up some of the most valuable API resources publicly available on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Accepting The Madness</strong><br /> When you look at 700 APIs, you have to wade through a lot of madness. When I'm looking at APIs, I&rsquo;m looking for more than just a perfectly designed API from a technical perspective, I&rsquo;m interested in value, presentation, and other more meaningful aspects. Often times I will overlook your base URL, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop me from taking note of some of the crazy domains, and subdomains people are using to provide access to their API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Patterns For Base URL</strong><br /> Once you wade through the madness, and start looking for the strongest patterns for base URLs applied across the API space, it is easy to see that two of the most common approaches are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>api.example.com -</strong> Pretty simple, common, and current approach to pointing a subdomain to a company&rsquo;s API resources.</li>
<li><strong>example.com/api -</strong> When you don&rsquo;t have control over setting up subdomains, a simple API folder is next in line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subdomain for a company&rsquo;s API effort says a lot. When you do not put much thought into the path for your API program, it demonstrates that you will probably not put a lot into your overall API effort. A subdomain may not seem like much on the surface, but it consistently provides a barometer for other things that are going on, as I wade through these APIs.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm consistently seeing, is that many API providers assume that API consumers will understand the the API is available at the root domain, and referencing /api/v1/ as a root, without directly stating the base URL is http://example.com/api/v1/. It is not a punishable offense, but something that reflects the short-sighted, siloed world that many API providers operate within.</p>
<p><strong>A Distributed, Programmable Web</strong><br /> After identifying the strongest patterns for base URLs, the next layer of domain usage, that I found interesting, was the use of account or user based, network, and geographic based subdomain API access:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>[user].example.com -</strong> A dynamic subdomain based upon a users account, allowing for API access centered around a user&rsquo;s platform account.</li>
<li><strong>[network].example.com -</strong> A select group of network, and CDN locations. Sometimes they were based upon AWS regions like east and west coast, and other times just providing DNS redundancy with know clear geographic intent.</li>
<li><strong>[geo].example.com -</strong> Other times you would clarity in assigning API domains based upon geographic regions like US, UK, and German specific locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have three motivations in telling this story, 1) for my own education, 2) encourage more consistent patterns amongst API providers, and 3) work to understand where things might be going. I think the use of a user account, network, and geographic centered URL for your API, tells something about where things might be headed. I think that your API access will be tailored just for you by delivering virtualized containers, just for your account (you can pay for more performance), that may run on specific networks, and in specific geographic regions, as the API world move forward.</p>
<p>As I struggle to deal with the madness I'm finding across base URLs for APis, and enjoying it greatly when I come across more standard approaches, but what is really interesting me is trying to better understand how we are going to scale all of this to better meet the needs of developers, end-users, and keep pace with changes like we are seeing with the Internet of Things. How do we keep things up and running, stable, while also meeting the terms or service of online platforms, ensure security across numerous 3rd party developers, while also keeping the privacy and interests of end-users in mind?</p>
<p>In the future I can see terms of service (TOS) negotiations at the API level for each user, support in their personal needs, and keep API traffic isolated in a particular region, or via a particular network base upon a countries laws, all the way to delivering on an individual citizens wishes. For now, all I can do is try to understand what is going on, and hope for a future where this type of scalability, regionalization, and interoperability is truly a reality.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/kimono-labs-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am tracking on around 2500 companies who are doing interesting things in the API space. Out of these companies about 1000 of them have blogs, which for me is a pretty important signal. About 1/4 of these companies with blogs, do not have an RSS feed, which in 2014 seems a little odd to me, but maybe I'm an old timer.</p>
<p>I believe that a blog is one of the most important signals, any API provider come put out, right alongside Twitter and Github. Historically I depend on the Twitter account for these RSS-less blogs, but now I'm taking a different path, and using <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono Labs</a> to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Using the Kimono Labs Chrome extension, I just visit the main blog page for one of these companies, and select the title of the first blog post. Kimono gives me the ability to name this field, which I usually just call &ldquo;title&rdquo;. Since the title is a link, Kimono also associates the link to the blog post, along with each title. You could also highlight the summary text, but I don&rsquo;t need this, as I have secondary processes that runs and pulls the full content of a blog post, as well as the timestamp, author, and taking of a screenshot.</p>
<p>Within a couple of seconds, using Kimono Labs, I now have an API for each companies blog, assuming the role RSS would normally play. When I have time each week, I will generate an API for the most important companies I'm tracking on. Maybe someday I will close the entire blog syndication gap for the companies I track on, but for now its nice to be able to tackle the most high value companies, and know that I have a viable solution to the problem with <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono Labs</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-api-docs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">visual API documentation</a> a few months back, after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">I looked at the approach from OpenFDA</a>, and now after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/dwolla-using-slate-for-an-evolved-api-documentation-experience/">taking a look at the value Slate brings to API providers like Dwolla</a>, these feelings are re-surfacing in my mind. Since I have limited time, I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at putting my ideas out there, allowing anyone to step up and execute on opportunities I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space&mdash;I just do not need the extra work.</p>
<p>I love me some <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>, as you can tell from the fact that all of my APIs use <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger as the API definition format</a>, as well Swagger UI for the interactive documentation. I&rsquo;m pretty convinced of the importance of documentation being a hands-on experience, but after looking at approaches like OpenFDA, and Dwolla with their Slate driven API docs, I&rsquo;m convinced they should also be more beautiful and functional.</p>
<p>Let me explain what I would like to see developed for the API space:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Definition Core -</strong> As we are beginning to see across the space with current interactive API documentation practices, everything needs to be driven by a machine readable API definition, providing a set of instructions for how any user will engage with an API.</li>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-endpoint-visualization.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<li><strong>Interactive - </strong>In 2014 the bar is already set, and API documentation should be interactive, allowing users to make live calls to a demo, or production API, making learning about an API hands-on experience. </li>
<li><strong>Inline Code - </strong>The tools are available to generate code samples from Swagger and API Blueprint, and wherever we make an API call, we should also be able see the code for making the call inline, side-by-side with wherever I am engaging with the API&mdash;in my language of choice please!</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations -</strong> I don&rsquo;t want just to get back a response from the API, I want to be able to visualize the value returned from an API. I would like a suite of <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js visualizations</a> for each API endpoint I&rsquo;m interacting with, allowing me to immediately see the value generated by each API.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet - </strong>Allow me to export a CSV, or more robust Excel or Google Spreadsheet representation of an API. Sure, this would not be applicable to all APIs, but would bring a lot of value to many APIs out there. APIs aren&rsquo;t just for developers in 2014. Oh, and make me the D3.js code for any visualization too copy &amp; paste as well.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable - </strong>I enjoy being able to deploy my Swagger UI to any Github repository using Github Pages, and I think portability is essential for the success of API engagement. I want to be able to copy &amp; paste API expressions, visualizations, and other simple, easy to use widgets to any site, anywhere&mdash;no coding experience necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source -</strong> If you are building something like what I&rsquo;m describing, it really should be open source so that all aspects of it can be reused, by anyone, anywhere. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to be a proprietary, closed solution, and you if are building something in this way you owe me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$1 million dollars</span> for my ideas. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/slate/slate-tripit.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API docs have become much more than just API documentation, they have become about API discovery, education, expression, collaborations, and interactions, going way beyond just our grandfathers way of documenting an API.  We have the language (Swagger &amp; API Blueprint) to describe our APIs, lets begin providing more meaningful ways to engage with them as well.</p>
<p>If you would like to, or are already building any of these features I&rsquo;m laying out, feel free to connect with me, and I'm happy to provide feedback anywhere during the design, development, and implementation&mdash;just let me know what you need.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m a demanding bitch in the API space, expecting people to do this work for me, but the space needs it. Thanks for building it! ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://docs.dwolla.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm liking the new&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.dwolla.com">Dwolla's new API docs</a>&nbsp;that they just launched. They are using an <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">open source API documentation framework called Slate</a>, developed by <a href="https://www.tripit.com">Tripit</a>, for their own API documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoy seeing the different directions that providers take with their API docs.  Slate's approach is a different path than we've been seeing with interactive docs using frameworks like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, but provides a very intuitive, elegant documentation experience which includes code samples tailored to each API endpoint.</p>
<p>Here are the features Slate lists on the Github repository for the project:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Clean, Intuitive Design - T</strong>he description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side. Inspired by Stripe's and Paypal's API docs. Slate is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even print.</li>
<li><strong>Everything On A Single Page - </strong>Gone are the days where your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed link-ability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.</li>
<li><strong>Slate Is Just Markdown - </strong>When you write docs with Slate, you're just writing Markdown, which makes it simple to edit and understand. Everything is written in Markdown &mdash; even the code samples are just Markdown code blocks!</li>
<li><strong>Write Code Samples In Multiple Languages &mdash;</strong>&nbsp;If your API has bindings in multiple programming languages, you easily put in tabs to switch between them. In your document, you'll distinguish different languages by specifying the language name at the top of each code block, just like with Github Flavored Markdown!</li>
</ul>
<p>Slate provides some pretty interesting tools for any API documentation toolbox. I also really like that they are Github-centric, acknowledging that many API providers will use Github Pages when deploying their docs, adding that <em>"Not only does this mean you get free hosting for your docs with Github Pages, but it also makes it's simple for other developers to make pull requests to your docs if they find typos or other problems.&rdquo; - s</em>omething I thoroughly enjoy across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.dwolla.com"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-api-docs.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>It looks like to me (maybe I&rsquo;m wrong) that the code samples are hand written? Something that could easily be remedied using Swagger. It would be way cool to see a Swagger and API Blueprint generated version of Slate emerge&mdash;merging the Slate experience, with the interactive documentation experience we&rsquo;ve seen evolve over the last couple years. This way your docs would be elegant, interactive, and very utilitarian with the inline code samples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice job <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>!</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/consistent-api-program-domains.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I know that some of my readers are URI experts, URL ninjas, and masters of the domain, but most of my readers are not, and I wanted to share some of the 100K view of what I see across the world of domains, in the API space. I&rsquo;m going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a> over the last couple days (continuing this weekend), looking at 800+ companies who have APIs, and after going through roughly half, I&rsquo;m seeing some seriously crazy practices for crafting URIs for APIs programs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the general path to your developer program, I highly recommend providing a simple subdomain, providing access to your APIs &nbsp;in a simple, consistent path like http://developer.example.com--at the very least put it in a consistent folder like http://example.com/developers. When you put your API into your http://example.com/help/bullshit-cms-system/@$~!$(bullshit-guid$#(@)/developer/ location, it really just sends a signal that your API is just a support feature, and something that is&rsquo;t getting the resources it will need for success.</p>
<p>When it comes to identity and access management for your APIs, I recommend working from your root using http://example.com/oauth for authentication and discovering of your APIs. After that I recommend taking a similar approach to the developer program, and use http://api.example.com or http://example.com/api. It really sucks to have to guess the baseURL for any API, and if I have to download your SDK to figure out the baseURL, I may skip using your API all together. I&rsquo;m stilling processing thoughts around the dynamic API subdomains like http://accountname.example.com, giving users a custom base URL for API access.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose when configuring a domain for your API efforts, I probably don&rsquo;t need to see /rest/, /tcp/, or /http/ in the URL structure. I&rsquo;m hoping your API resources are these things, you should not have to declare it. When designing your API resources, work hard to think about the core resources, and how they will be used, not necessarily how they are being transported.</p>
<p>I will get a lot of hate from my linked data friends, restafarian cool iya's, and hypermedia homies, about my simplicity and possible errors, but my goal is to just move things forward, and not necessarily convince everyone of exactly the right way of doing things. I find that taking a pragmatic tone, providing a 100K view of what others are doing across the space, is the most effective way to influence change at a macro level.</p>
<p>If I was highlight an particular implementation I would point to Dwolla. The Dwolla developer program is pretty simple, and consistent. You can get at the developer program at <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">https://developers.dwolla.com/</a>, API documentation at <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/">https://docs.dwolla.com/</a>, a blog at <a href="http://blog.dwolla.com/">http://blog.dwolla.com/</a>, and support at <a href="http://help.dwolla.com/">http://help.dwolla.com/</a>. You authenticate, and access the Dwolla API at <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/">https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/</a>, and can do the same for a sandbox environment at <a href="https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/">https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to emphasize anything, I would say that consistency is the most  important thing when crafting domains for your API program, and emphasis on the fact that your API effort is a priority, not just some sort of whacky side project ran by a single employee. (oh shit, maybe most are?) Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it is fine that your developer API program is run by one crazy person in a company (I fully support this), but you can at least put some work into looking like you are organized, and sane.</p>
<p>This goal of this post is to focus on configuring a sensible base URL for your public API surface, and isn&rsquo;t about how you should craft the path to resources you are making available. In a perfect world every domain would allow /auth from the root, and employ hypermedia across all API design, but in the world we have I think just getting folks to use simple, and consistent base URLs for key areas of public API efforts, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">considerign of the usage of a APIs.json file in the root of your domain</a>,&nbsp;can be a healthy place to start when it comes to API discovery.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-consuming.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>APIs came in to existence to satisfy a demand for access to valuable content, data and resources, and the more APis that are developed, the more the appetite for API consumption has grown. APIs enable website, web and mobile applications to build applications, using resources that were completely out of reach in even the recent past. Some API resources, like a simple city look-up by postal code, might be simple enough that a developer could recreate, but other resources such as global satellite imagery is something the average developer does not have the resources, or the time to create&mdash;the more API resources available, the cooler the apps we build,  and the more we hunger for valuable API resources grows.</p>
<p><strong>Starts with a Need</strong><br /> API consumers rarely want to use an API, just to learn about APIs, they have a need, a problem they need to solve. They want to provide a feature in their website, or mobile application. Often times people just want two systems to talk to each other, or be able to analyze and visualize information in a particular way, to accomplish a business or personal objective.</p>
<p><strong>Discovering The APIs You Need</strong><br /> The API savvy technologists are aware of the vast wealth of APis available today, and know to Google for the API they need, visit API directories like <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> or <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a>, and emerging API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br /> Before you can unlock the value of an API, you need to understand how common authentication patterns work for any API. Some API providers use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">basic authentication</a>, which is baked into HTTP, while others use application or developer keys to be able to talk with APIs. <a href="http://oauth.net/">oAuth</a> is fast becoming default for API providers who serve up private users information, allowing platforms to manage identity and access in a way that gives control over to end-users of applications built on top of APIs. Many providers are also using SSL as default for all API communication, protecting API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Integration</strong><br /> Actual integration between applications and APIs, is ultimately up to API consumers, but API providers and a growing number of API tools and services, are making API integrations easier, and often automated. Most web API resources can be accessed via a simple URL, something anyone, with a basic amount of web knowledge, can integrate API resources into their world.</p>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong><br /> There are plenty of API projects to be had for fun and hobby, but for any project to be sustainable it must generate revenue and be able to sustain itself. There several proven approaches to generating revenue around API integration including application sales, providing premium features, selling content or subscription to the content, advertising, in-app payments, affiliate links, data generation, and through partnership. Of course there is always the independently funded efforts, which make things easier.</p>
<p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong><br /> The primary motivation for API integration is to provide access to data, content, and other resources available in online Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms. Services like Evernote for notes, Pinboard for links, Flickr for photos, and Youtube for videos, all use APIs to enable integration with other applications, as well as basic data portability for software users.</p>
<p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong><br /> Like SaaS, its cousin Platform as a Service (PaaS) employ APIs to enable application providers, developers, and hackers with the ability for rapidly deploy applications ranging from Wordpress, to ElasticSearch. Usually if an application is running on PaaS platforms like Heroku, or Google Apps Engine, there is a set of APIs for configuring, monitoring and managing most aspects of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong><br /> The savviest of IT Operations have moved to the cloud, and run all of their infrastructure using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers like Amazon Web Services for everything from server capacity, and storage to DNS and content delivery networks (CDN). Every piece of IT infrastructure that runs in the cloud has an API or CLI interface for it, allowing the management of all IaaS infrastructure programmatically.</p>
<p><strong>Backend as a Service (BaaS)</strong><br /> As if we needed another acronym, but here we go, <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> is an approach for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to connect their applications to backend cloud storage and processing while also providing common features such as user management, push notifications, social networking integration, and other features that mobile users demand from their apps these days. As approaches to API deployment evolve, we are seeing more API deployment platforms emerge that very much resemble earlier goals of BaaS, allowing for the agile deployment, and consumption of valuable resources, via BaaS platform APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br /> The popularity of platforms like Twitter and Facebook owe a great deal of their buzz to the fact that there were embeddable buttons, badges, and widgets, allowing for the sharing, syndication, and engagement with their platform using API driven, embeddable tools. The ability to copy and paste a little bit of code, maybe configure a few settings, and be able to publish data, content, media, and other digital resources is the cornerstone of any API integration.</p>
<p><strong>Web Hooks</strong><br /> Webhooks enable API platforms to push data, and notify any other URL of a change or event that has occurred via the platform. Webhooks are how API platforms become a two way street, allowing API consumers to make APIs work for them, and reduce the overhead of application usage when it comes to polling API resources. Webhooks are an API integrators best friend, and always look for them on platforms before considering which resource is best for your application or use case.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /> Everything on the Internet today is guided buy the terms of service of web and mobile applications, and their underlying API platforms. TOS dictate how developers can use APIs, and the end-users can take advantage of services on the platform. Nobody reads TOS before they sign up for online services, but if you are looking to build a business on top of any API, you should read the TOS to see if it is something that will support what you are looking to do.</p>
<p><strong>In Perfect World Everyone Provides and Consumes API</strong><br /> There are over thousands of public APIs available on the open Internet, and if you are building applications, you are most likely consuming APIs, as well as designing, deploying, and managing your own APIs. The best API providers, consume their own APIs, as well as the APIs of other providers. To truly understand what makes a good API, you should be consuming, as well as providing APIs.</p>
<p>In 2014 we are moving well beyond the old days of API mashups, or even applications using just a handful of APis. Applications are depending on entire stack of APIs, employing 10s or 100s of API resources to deliver applications across multiple web and mobile channels. Consuming APIs aren't just for developers, and about building applications, APIs are fueling many new trends that allow even non-developers to consume APIs and put them to use in documents, spreadsheets, and other common tools we depend on everyday for our personal and professional lives.</p>

<p>I need your help with something. I&rsquo;m in the business of helping start-ups, all the way up to our federal government identify valuable assets, and make them more accessible for use in websites, and mobile devices. As part of this work I&rsquo;m always on the look out for valuable public assets across city, state, and the federal government, and help make sure the conversations around these assets always include APIs, so that we aren&rsquo;t just building websites, mobile applications in silos, and limiting the potential for public access, by individuals, and small businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last couple years I have cultivated a small group of API evangelists in various sectors, who help keep me informed of important government projects, and one of my partners in crime Alyssa Ravasio (<a href="https://twitter.com/alyraz">@alyraz</a>) brought a <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">pre solicitation for an RFP to my attention from the Department of Agriculture, for a &ldquo;Recreation On Stop Support Services&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;to my attention&mdash;a service you can see in action at <a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.gov</a>. In short this is an ongoing contract that our federal government engages in with a private sector contractor on, to provide access to our nations campgrounds and campsites at our federal parks.</p>
<p>I would put our national parks and campgrounds at the top of treasured assets that this country possesses, and something that we need to make sure continue to be as accessible to individuals, and small businesses as possible. I want to take the time to respond to the pre-solicitation from the Department of Agriculture, in hopes of helping them craft a better RFP, before this goes out to bid. I also want to encourage others, who are also passionate about camping and our national parks, to submit their own feedback to the Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services</a></p>
<p>The current incarnation of the one stop service for recreation project has an API...well it has web services as part of the existing <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf">Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</a>, but you also find mentions of API in the proposed RFP, under the&nbsp;<strong>5.3.9 Mapping and Geospatial Capability</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A segment of the user community will not only be accessing and viewing the mapping data through the web interface at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.recreation.gov">www.recreation.gov</a>, but will also have a need to search, retrieve, and download the geospatial data via the RIDB data sharing interface(s), or APIs.&nbsp; The Contractor shall demonstrate utilization of programming languages, formats, data types/conventions/sources, etc. which maximize the portability and usability of maps and map related data by third-parties. This minimizes the need for third-party data consumers to procure expensive and/or proprietary software to utilize, edit or manipulate the mapping data. The contractor shall ensure that all available geospatial data within R1S is incorporated into the user interface to provide users with the most complete mapping solutions available.</em></p>
<p>There is another mention of APIs under&nbsp;<strong>5.3.6 Provide Travel Planning Tools wit</strong>h:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Non Federal reservable inventory may include state and local reservable and non-reservable recreation inventory which may be incorporated into the system or accessed via various application programming interfaces (APIs).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Then towards the end you see the following needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Sharing and Data Management -</strong> Information originating from within RIDB and imported shall be presented in a manner such that the external origin of the data is transparent to users and consistent with presentation of information originating from within.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Information Sharing -</strong> The Contractor shall deliver automated and manual services for the sharing of the consolidated recreation information described herein. The sharing service shall utilize prevailing industry best practices and technologies to make the consolidated recreation information publicly available to data consumers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Information Consolidation -</strong> The Contractor shall deliver automated and manual services for collecting of a wide variety of recreation information from a wide range of sources including Federal Government Agencies and Federal Partner organizations such as Historic Hotels of America.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, all of this infers that whoever wins the contract will need to at least maintain what is available via the RIDB, which is nice, but it is just a web service, not a modern web API, and only reflects providing access a small portion of the valuable resource that will need to be made available via Recreation.gov, to partners, and the public at large. We can do better. An API needs to be a first class citizen in this RFP, something that is not just an afterthought, and a connection to the database that just needs to be maintained&mdash;an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API will be central to deliver the resources</span> needed for a "one stop services for recreation".</p>
<p><strong>Camping Resources<br /></strong>When you look through the requirements for this project you see all the building blocks for allowing individuals to engage with campsites across our nation, inventory, ticketing, lotteries, permitting, day use and group facilities, special events and use, equipment rentals, recreational and pass sales. All of this keeps our national parks accessible to campers.</p>
<p><strong>Mapping and Geospatial Resources<br /></strong>Camping resources are meaningful to us because of where they are located. Mapping and geospatial resources will be vital to enabling users to discover the parks and campsites where they wish to stay on their camping trips. The ability to search, and navigate campsites via modern mapping, providing geospatial resources is central to the one stop service for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Resources<br /></strong>A third cornerstone of the recreation one stop support services platform are the financial resources. The ability to accept and process credit cards, cancellations, modifications, and refunds will play a role in every engagement on the platform. Access to to all aspects of commerce via the platform will make or break operations at every level for the one stop service for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>User Resources<br /></strong>I&rsquo;d say the fourth corner of the one stop service for recreation platform is the user. Providing secure, seamless access to user profiles, and history throughout the Recreation.gov experience will be critical to it all working. User resources are central to any modern web or mobile application in 2014, and depends on camping, geo, and financial resources to bring it all together.</p>
<p><strong>Recreation.gov Website<br /></strong>All of these resource need to be made available on at Recreation.gov, in the form of fully functioning web application providing a content management system (CMS) for managing the site, complete with a reservation system that allows users to discovery camping resources, via mapping geospatial resources, and pay for their reservations via financial resources&mdash;all via a secure, easy to access user profile.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Planning Tools<br /></strong>Beyond the core public website, and its reservation system the requires call for travel planning tools including point-to-point itinerary planning, field sales and reservations sales, third party sales, and reservable inventory management. While these tools are likely to primarily be web-based, the requirements call for remote sales and management of inventory, which requires a central API solution.</p>
<p><strong>Robust Reporting Solutions&nbsp;<br /></strong>Reporting is prominent through the requirements requiring web analytics, canned reports, customizable reports, monthly performance reporting, and enterprise reporting systems (ERS). In short, reporting will be essential to all aspects of the one stop service for recreation for both the contract winner and operator, as well as all of the agencies involved. I would add in that end-users will also need some views into their own Recreation.gov usage, adding another layer to the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Data Accessibility &amp; Portability<br /></strong>Another element that is present throughout the requirements is data access and portability, of the camping, reservation, customer (user) and resulting financial data. Pretty much everything in system should be accessible right? This definitely goes beyond just what is available va the RIDB, and requiring all aspects of the one stop service for recreation to be accessible for use in any other system, or just as download.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Required Applications &amp; Platforms<br /></strong>As part of the requirements, there is a minimum requirements for browsers, and mobile platforms that the one stop service for recreation should operate on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"> 
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Apple Safari</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platforms: &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"> 
<ul>
<li>Android Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Apple iOS Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Apple Desktop OS</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows PC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For me this portion of the requirements are extremely vague. I agree that the Recreation.gov and travel planning tools should work in all these browsers, and be responsive on mobile browsing platforms, but these requirements seem to allude to more, without actually going there. In 2014-2016 you can&rsquo;t tell me that native mobile experiences won&rsquo;t be something end users of recreation.gov and the overall system will be demanding? Mobile wills be the gateway to the platforms mapping and geospatial resources, and APIs are how you deliver the resources needed for developing mobile applications on all of the platforms listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A One-Stop Service for Recreation Requires A Multi-Channel Approach<br /></strong>The one stop service for recreation requires a multi-channel approach to deliver the camping, mapping &amp; geo, financial and user resources to the main Recreation.gov website, supporting reservation system, travel planning tools, reporting solutions, and potentially any other web or mobile applications, and round it all off with needing to provide the data accessibility and portability that is demanded of a modern federal government platform.</p>
<p><strong>Transform The RIDB Web Service Into A Modern API And Make The Center<br /></strong>The only way you will engage with users Recreation.gov on the web and mobile locations they will demand, as well as deliver the reservation, travel planning, and reporting solutions, while making sure everything is portable, the RIDB database and supporting web services needs to be brought up to date, and transformed into a modern web API. &nbsp;The&nbsp;RFP_-_Attachment_10_-_Notional_Future_RIDB_Data_Flow_-_Sep._22_2014.pptx even reflects this vision, but the actual RFP severely falls short of describing the role an API will play in the platform.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/forest-service/ridb-api.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p><strong>Making Security A Priority Across All Aspects Of Operations<br /></strong>With a single API layer being the access layer for all web, mobile, reporting, and data accessibility channels, security takes on a whole new meaning. APIs provide single access point for all access to platform resources, allowing security, and auditing to occur in real-time, using modern approaches to API management. APIs use existing web technology, and don&rsquo;t require any special technology, but do provide a single layer to enable, monitor, and deny access to all resources, across the one stop services for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>A Centralized Metrics, Analytics, and Reporting Layer<br /></strong>Married with security, an API centric approach allows for a platform wide analytics layer, that can drive security, but also provide the data points required for the overall platform reporting system. With an API analytics layer this data can be delivered to platform, government, developer, and end-user reporting solutions. A comprehensive metrics, analytics, and reporting strategy is essential to a modern one stop services for recreation platform.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Let In the Sunlight Enforcing Transparency &amp; Accountability<br /></strong>One critical aspects of a modern, API-centric approach is the transparency and accountability it can provides. All database connections, and web or mobile applications are brokered via an API layer, requiring all applications to rely on the same pipes for reading, writing, modifying, and removing data from the system. This approach provides a secure window into all aspects of platform operations, providing the accountability requirements set forth in the proposed RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Some Constructive Criticism For Language in the Proposed RFP<br /></strong>There are some points in the proposed RFP that in my opinion move the conversation backwards rather than looking to the future, and fulfilling a vision of what the "one stop services for recreation platform" could be. One example is <strong>5.3.6.3 Third Party Sales</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government anticipates that during the potential 10-year period of performance after go-live there may be an interest by commercial travel and recreation planning companies (such as Travelocity, Expedia, etc.) to utilize R1S inventory and availability data to facilitate R1S transactions. The Government may be open to such Third Party Sales arrangements, provided the business, financial and legal terms of the arrangement are in the Government&rsquo;s best interests. At the Government&rsquo;s request, the Contractor shall lead exploratory meetings, including Government and applicable industry representatives, to determine commercial interest in such a service and also explore the technical and fiscal feasibility of such Third Party Sales arrangements. Upon the conclusion of all necessary exploratory meetings, and should the Government decide to implement Third Party Sales, the Government will issue a formal modification to the R1S Support Services contract to incorporate the service. There is no requirement for the contractor to provide Third Party Sales services until a post-award modification is issued requiring them.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be an interest by commercial travel and recreation planning companies (such as Travelocity, Expedia, etc.)?&rdquo; In the current online environment I am pretty sure that this shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;may&rdquo;, this should be &ldquo;will&rdquo;, and that the pace of business today moves quite a bit faster than this section describes. APIs enable a new approach to business development, that was coined 10 years ago by the co-founder of Flickr, the popular sharing platform. I understand that you will have to certify developers, but this should not get in the way of small business developers experimenting and innovating with the resources available via the platform. Business development via an API has been going on in the private sector for 10 years, and isn't something the Department of Agriculture should be putting off until the next procurement cycle for the platform.</p>
<p>The proposed RFP states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The current contract is a Variable Quantity contract with Fixed Price per-transaction pricing such that the Contractor earns a fixed fee for each transaction processed via the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.recreation.gov">www.recreation.gov</a>&nbsp;website, the telephone customer support line, or in-person at participating Federal recreation locations.&nbsp; The fixed fees under the current contract vary depending on the type of inventory being reserved, the sales channel, etc.<br /></em></p>
<p>In an era where we have over 10K API resources to use in applications, where cloud-based utility pricing is successfully being applied, and you pay for what you use across numerous industries, you can&rsquo;t have a business model like this for a public / private sector partnership, and not put APIs to use, and enabling trusted partners to build a business model around the commerce opportunities available via a platform. Right now this is exclusive to the current contract holder&nbsp;Active Network, d.b.a. ReserveAmerica, and for the next round should not be something that is exclusive to the contract winner--it should be open to the thousands of businesses that serve the parks &amp; recreation space.</p>
<p>Another item I have an issue with is ownership over the source code of the platform:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government owns all of the inventory, transaction and customer data associated with&nbsp;<a href="http://Recreation.Gov">Recreation.Gov</a>; however the reservation system remains the sole proprietary property of the current service provider.</em></p>
<p>I know this is the current situation, but I strongly urge that for the next relationship, this is not the case. The government should own all of the inventory, transaction, and customer data, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the reservation system should be open source</span>. Period. The chances that there will be innovation via the platform if it remains a proprietary solution is slim, and requiring that the core reservation system, and supporting API platform remain open source will stimulate innovation around Recreation.gov. Any business, including the winner of the contract, can still build proprietary solutions that use the API to deliver specific applications, or end-user solutions, and premium features, but the core software should be open this time.</p>
<p><strong>Some Praise For What Is In The Proposed RFP<br /></strong>I am not one to just criticize, without providing at least some praise, acknowledging where the Department of Agriculture is looking towards the future. One area I have to note is their inclusion of the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>, where&nbsp;#3 on the checklist for deploying in a flexible hosting environment is "resources are provisioned through an API&rdquo;, and #2 on the checklist for defaulting to open says that you should provide data sets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces). I think the&nbsp;<a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>&nbsp;should be included with ALL federal government RFPs, and it makes me happy to see it in here.</p>
<p>I also understand the number of agencies involved in the project include the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Department of the Interior (including at least the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service), the National Archives and Records Administration and other potential Federal partners to be determined at a later date.&nbsp; Agencies involved in the trip planning component include the agencies named above, as well as the Department of Transportation; Federal Highway Administration (FHA), the Department of Commerce; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the Smithsonian Institution. &nbsp;This is a huge undertaking, and commend them on the effort, but can't also help myself in throwing in that this is all the more reason the one stop services for recreation has to have an API. ;-)</p>
<p><strong>In Closing<br /></strong>I think I&rsquo;m finished with my response to the <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services</a>. I would like to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">request that they extend the deadline for response for another 30 days</span>, to allow me to drum up more feedback, as well as put some more thought into the RFP myself. Following your own lead of including the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, I would also recommend bringing in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a></strong> - Building on the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, 18F has an amazing set of resources to help the Department of Agriculture move forward with this RFP in a way that is in line with other leading platform efforts in the federal government&mdash;please make sure 18F is involved.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Round 3 PIFs -</strong> This is probably already be in the works, but make sure there is someone from the recent round of Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs) are on board, helping make sure this project is headed in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I think all the right parts and pieces are present for this project, but when it comes to &nbsp;finding the right language, and vision for the RFP, it needs a lot of help, and I'm confident that 18F and PIFs can help bring it home. The most important element for me is that <a href="http://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf">web service from the RIDB</a> needs to be transformed into a modern web API, and brought front and center to fuel every aspect of the platform. I&rsquo;m confident that if the RFP speaks the right language, the winning contractor will be able to translate the RFP into the platform it needs to be, and serve the expectations of the modern consumers who will be using the platform in coming years.</p>
<p>If this RFP goes out the door without an API vision, planning of the family camping trip will done in a silo, at Recreation.gov, and not on the mobile phones that are ubiquitous in our everyday life. User do not need a web experience that is translated to function in mobile browsers, they need a web experience when it makes sense, and a native mobile experience, and even offline when necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planning the family vacation will not happen from just Recreation.gov, it needs to be part of a larger vacation planning experience, occurring via the online platforms we already use in our daily lives. If the Department of Agriculture focuses on an API-first vision for delivering the one stop service for recreation, it will live up to its name&mdash;truly being a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one stop service</span> that can be used for planning your recreation from any platform or device.</p>

        <p><a href="https://siftscience.com/"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/1475_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time reaching out directly to API providers, in an effort to better understand what they are up to. A couple weeks ago, I asked Sarfaraz Rydhan (<a href="https://twitter.com/safoo">@safoo</a>)&nbsp;from the <a href="https://siftscience.com/">Fraud Detection API platform SiftScience</a>, what is the biggest challenge you face in attracting developers to your system?</p>
<blockquote><em>In many cases, the biggest challenge is developers needing context into the business and operations side of the companies they work for. We offer a machine learning powered fraud detection product to help internet companies in many verticals fight fraud. In an e-commerce integration, for example, a developer may need to know about how users interact with the store, when a customer's credit card is charged, how order information is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment, how operations analysts work within the e-commerce system.</em></blockquote>
<p>Context--something that is so important, and is often lost in translation, or forgotten entirely when APIs are purely an IT or developer led initiative. As a developer I can easily see the many uses of an API, but articulating to someone who is actually living within one of these use-case scenarios, is very difficult&mdash;something that takes a lot of practice.</p>
<p>You can see SiftScience working to provide context to its users via its <a href="https://siftscience.com/">website</a>, <a href="http://blog.siftscience.com/">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/siftscience">twitter</a>, and other <a href="https://siftscience.com/resources/tutorials/integration.html">tutorials and resources</a>. As API providers, this is why we provide essential storytelling building blocks like a blog, tutorials, and other resources&mdash;to provide the critical context someone needs to understand the value that our APIs deliver.</p>
<p>Are you providing enugh context for your users?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/10/15/reworking-my-api-101-content-providing-apis/">Reworking My API 101 Content: Providing APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gift.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The world of APIs starts with an individual, company or organization, with some sort of content, data, or other digital resource, wanting to make it available, on the Internet, in a machine readable way, so that others can build sites, and applications around it. Even though APIs use the Internet for communication, it doesn't mean that they are openly accessible to anyone. Providing APIs, is very similar to providing websites, you can control which users have access to it, where they can go, and what they can do&mdash;APIs are just meant for other websites, web applications, and mobile developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solving a Problem</strong><br /> APIs are all about providing solutions, to everyday problems in our increasingly digit worlds, from sharing data with partners, developing mobile applications, to disrupting an entire legacy industry who refuses to change and evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Resources</strong><br /> Providing APIs is about open up access to content, data and other complex objects, or systems that exist within a company or organization, in a way that anyone can use the resulting resources in any programming language or external system.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Solutions</strong><br /> APIs are about the path of least resistance when making content, data, and other resources available, and in the world of APIs you see a lot of initiatives that are born in the shadows of existing company efforts, scraped from existing websites, and are often organized by rogue groups outside of normal business or even IT groups. APIs are about getting things done.</p>
<p><strong>Design First</strong><br /> Providing APIs has evolved beyond just exposing an interface that exactly reflects the content, database or other resource being made available, and establishing a design first approach where you mock, share, and collaborate around the value an API delivers, before any code is even written.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient Deployment</strong><br /> There are many roads an individual or company can take when providing APIs, from DIY approaches using open source API frameworks, to gateways provided by IT that access internal resources, and a new breed of cloud based solutions for deploying APIs from any existing systems. Whichever path a provider takes, deploying APIs is about finding the quickest, most efficient way to making API resources accessible, being used, and moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Operations</strong><br /> Once the API is deployed, the work doesn't stop. Over the last decade, API pioneers have establish some pretty proven ways to manage API operations, by providing documentation, code resources, support, monitoring, communication and other resources that consumers of an API will need to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Service Composition</strong><br /> A single API, is an opportunity to provide multiple internal, external, and public consumers the ability to access resources in a variety of ways. Service composition provides a way that API providers can allow for a wide variety access to resources, to only the groups of consumers they want, charging for services in optimal ways that meet their business goals.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Monetization</strong><br /> API providers have established some new, and innovative ways for monetizing APIs, ranging from API consumers paying for use in a utility style approach, paying API consumers for driving traffic, to other more indirect ways of generating value, while covering operational costs, and monetizing usage beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Available For Discovery</strong><br /> As part of evangelism, there are emerging approaches to ensuring APIs are discoverable, by generating machine readable API definitions, and making sure APis are available to API search engines and directories. Discovery by design, is emerging as the way that API providers reach API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful Evangelism</strong><br /> There is no &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo; in the world of APIs. Even for internally focused APis, it will take a solid amount of evangelism to make consumers aware that an API exists, as well as achieve successful integration into any website, web application, or mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Emmbeddable Everywhere</strong><br /> Some APIs lend themselves to driving data, content, and other functionality across web sites, applications, and spreadsheets. JavaScript, plus APIs, are a common way to provide embeddable, API driven functionality that any site owner, social media user, and other Internet user can find API driven solutions to their problems.</p>
<p><strong>Security a Priority</strong><br /> Since APIs employ HTTP, the same communication protocol as the World Wide Web, security becomes a big priority in API operations. Most APIs are NOT publicly available, employing SSL, application keys, and other approaches to securing API access, including new standards like oAuth for handling both identification, and access to valuable API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Web Hook Relationships</strong><br /> APis don&rsquo;t just receive information, they increasingly are making calls to outside URLs, allowing API consumers to receive real-time notifications, when any data, content or other event occurs around the API resources their applications and system deepened on&mdash;making APIs a two way street.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced Terms of Service</strong><br /> In our online, digital worlds, terms of service dictate all relationships, and this is no exception in the world of APis. API terms of service make or break API operations, allowing for adjustments that protect API providers interest, but also enable API consumers to successfully integrate, and put API resources to use. Some API providers have found a balance to API terms of service, while others struggle finding the balance that will bring in API consumers, and keep them integrated.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Baked In</strong><br /> The privacy of everyone involved with providing APIs, consuming APIs, and ultimately the websites, applications, and systems that end-users are depending on is critical. Whether it is purely internal corporate systems, federal government applications, or a publicly available social network application like Facebook, privacy will set the tone for all platform operations.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency As Part Of Your DNA</strong><br /> Finding success with APIs takes a different breed of business and organizations, requiring a certain amount of transparency in operations that some people just aren't ready for. However, many companies and organizations find that by becoming an API provider, they experience a transformation, that teaches them to be more transparent, open to external ideas&mdash;resulting in changing culture.</p>
<p>Providing APIs will be something every company, non-profit organization, and government agency will be doing after 2015. APIs will be how content, data, and resources shared, and consumed in the future. In 1995 every company, organization, and government  agency was faced with the question of whether or not they should have a website, and by 2000 that question was yes. In 2010 every company, organization, and government agency was faced with the question of whether or not they should have an API, and by 2015 that question will be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YES</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The concept of providing APIs is not something exclusive to organizational entities, it is something that is also a reality for the individual. In practice, the Twitter API, enables all Twitter users to have their own API, and platforms are emerging that take this to the next level, and allow users to have content and data storage lockers, and using their own personal APIs to share, and reclaim the content and data they generate across the web each day, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p>Everyone has a website in 2014, everyone will have an API in coming years.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/ada-lovelace/ada-lovelace-1.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I track on the API space, the gender gap becomes increasingly obvious. As with many other guys, I&rsquo;m struggling with coming up with the most constructive way that I can contribute to closing the gender gap in technology. As I do with the rest of the API space, I figured I can work harder to tell more stories about women doing interesting things in the API space, while also working to understand the history of women in the space.</p>
<p>With this in mind I took the opportunity on Ada Lovelace Day, to publish a project dedicated tracking on women doing interesting things in the world of APIs, and as with the other 75+ projects, I will spend time each month moving the project forward. My goal is to find more stories for my blog, more speakers and attendees for API industry events, and make sure women are better represented across my research.</p>
<p>To kick things off, I wanted to showcase notable women in the history of compute, and by spending my day looking beyond just the Wikipedia entry, I was able compile a <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/noteable-women-in-history-of-tech.html">pretty impressive list of women who have made a significant impact on technology</a>. The list I compiled is not complete by any means, but it is far more complete than any one list I have found out there, and the big difference is my list is machine readable--meaning you can pull <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/noteable-women-in-history-of-tech.html">the JSON listing of notable women in compute history</a> and use on any other website, or in mobile applications.</p>
<p>Next up, I want to make an functional web API so anyone can search the listing, as well as provide the ability to add, and update the list via API. I want to also take advantage of the fact that my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech">women in tech research website is build on Github</a>, and encourage visitors to help me make the list more complete, and extend the reach of the information available here.</p>
<p>If you know someone or something that should be represented here, feel free to reach out via the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech/issues/new">Github issues</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, or feel free to fork the project and contribute in any way you see fit. Use the <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/updates/">updates</a> and <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> pages to find out what I&rsquo;m working on, and where I am planning to take my research next.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.ou.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-university-of-oklahoma.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote a story a couple of weeks ago, about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/09/30/where-do-we-start-with-apis-at-the-university-of-oklahoma/">how to kickstart APIs at the University of Oklahoma (OU)</a>. I ended the post, saying I would find some easy targets for generating the initial APIs, and publish a basic developer portal using Github Pages. After some work I think I have enough done to initiate another conversation with my friends at OU.</p>
<p>In any company, organization, government agency, or institution, where you are trying to decide where to start with APIs, the public website is the place to start. If data and content is already published to the website, it should also be available in a machine readable format via an API&mdash;this is the obvious place to start at OU.</p>
<p>To help find the low hanging fruit, when it comes to data and content at OU, I wrote a simple script that would slowly spider every page of the ou.edu website, looking for the opportunities, providing some potential targets for deploying APIs. So far my script has identified 183,094 pages across university sub-domains, and processed 52,281 of these pages looking for any HTML tables on pages, with over 20 rows, as well as .xls spreadsheet files, and XML files.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running the script slowly in the background, as I don&rsquo;t want to put any burden on OU sites, and just pulling pages every few seconds. To date I&rsquo;ve identified 252 pages that have large HTML tables, 330 spreadsheets, and 68 XML files. While the script will still be running and looking for more, I think this represents a pretty good start when it comes finding the low hanging fruit for open data and content at OU--resources that should be APIs.</p>
<p>As I do with all my projects, <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">I published my work for the OU API effort on Github, as an open repository</a>. Using this repository, I&rsquo;ve published the low hanging fruit as JSON, and HTML pages to allow for easy browsing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Tables (252) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-tables.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-tables.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets (330) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-spreadsheets.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-spreadsheets.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>XML Files (68) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-xml.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-xml.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/discussion.html">created another page which is driven from the Github issues for the repository</a>, to help handle discussion around which tables, and files should be targeted. I will put some thought into how to improve the process, better using Github to move the conversation forward. I&rsquo;m not going to be able to do this alone, ultimately we need the students and factuality at OU to get interested in participating, but this will take time&mdash;something which Github is well suited to help manage asynchronously.</p>
<p>The next steps for this project, is to have another conversation with Mark and Adam from OU, and look through some of the low hanging fruit I&rsquo;ve identified. After that I will put together a strategy for using <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a> to help us easily publish APIs from the targets I&rsquo;ve identified. I also suspect that as part of this process there will be a lot of de-duping, and other data janitorial work before we can publish some usable APIs, and move things forward.</p>
<p>You can follow my work on this at the <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">OU API project Github repository</a>, and when it makes sense I will publish stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dictionary.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways to compose, and examine collections of APIs. I have a database of over 2500 API that I keep an eye on, and for some of them I&rsquo;ve been generating Swagger specs, and using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to compose them into collections. I did this with 1<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">0 APIs I'm calling my utility stack</a>, because they are some of the fundamental utility style resources I depend on to make the API Evangelist network function.</p>
<p>I generated Swagger specs for the 10 following APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>bitly Data API Search</li>
<li>FullContact Name API</li>
<li>FullContact Location Normalization API</li>
<li>Pinboard All Posts API</li>
<li>AngelList Startup API</li>
<li>Wordnik WordList API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Keyword and Term Extraction</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API</li>
</ul>
<p>Then using these Swagger definitions, I outputted any parameters that are used for endpoints, as well as the fields for all of the APIs underlying data model. I grouped all of these fields together and created a sort of dictionary for my utility stack API collection. By doing this I&rsquo;m learning a lot about the vocabulary that each of these API providers are using, as well as beginning to see patterns across similar APIs, like text extraction APIs, and URL shortener APIs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/utility-stack-dictionary.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>In a perfect world, APIs would use commonly established vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, but in the imperfect API world we are given, I&rsquo;m enjoying taking a look at the sort of API slang that has emerged across the various types of popular APIs we are adopting.  API definition formats like Swagger give me a great way to define the surface are of APIs, and these exercises allow me to push forwards tools and approaches to understanding this new landscape.</p>
<p>The more APIs I generate Swagger definitions for, and the more tools I develop to analyze the landscape, the better I will get at communicating the interesting patterns I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space, and hopefully extract some blueprints that I can follow in my own API design work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://poemofthetimes.laneworks.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/poem-of-the-times/poem-of-the-times.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first started Poem of the Times back around 2003, and for about five years I harvested a poem each day, from the top headlines across the  top english speaking newspapers around the world.  Sometime in 2008 I stopped generating the poem, but in an effort to showcase the potential of APIs, I thought it would be a good time to revive the project.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 of Poem of the Times used RSS to pull its headlines, and for version 2.0 I want to use APIs. Something that seems impossible when you are faced with the fact that most of the top newspapers do not have APIs, which is very sad. ;-( However in 2014 we can make APIs from any web page using Scraping to API tools like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Using Kimono Labs I created an APIs for each of top 25 newspapers. I worked my way down a list of top newspapers around the globe, and using Kimono&rsquo;s Chrome add-on I was able to map my API to whatever part of the news homepage featured the latest stories. This was different for each news site, and some of them threw errors when I ran Kimono, but when this happened I quickly moved on until I had 25 successful APIs&mdash;something that took me about an hour and half.</p>
<p>Now that I had 25 separate news APIs I <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/poem-of-the-times/tree/gh-pages/definitions">published a machine readable Swagger definition for each</a>, and then published an <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/poem-of-the-times/blob/gh-pages/apis.json">APIs.json listing all 25 APIs in a single Poem of the Times API collection</a>. Right now this is manual, but I know this is something that is on the Kimono roadmap, introducing the ability to automatically generate Swagger specs, and build APIs.json collections from your Kimono API catalog.</p>
<p>Next I wrote a simple PHP script that pulled the APIs.json, spidered all 25 APIs, made a call to each one, and randomly grabbed a single headline, adding to an overall poem for the day. Once I had collected 25 news stories, I hit shuffle on them again, making sure the poem was in no particular order. After that I published the results to a single HTML, and JSON file, providing a single poem for each day.</p>
<p>As I do with all of my projects, <a href="http://poemofthetimes.laneworks.net/">I published Poem of the Times as standalone Github repository</a>, and I am publishing each poem as a Jekyll blog post, and linking to each days poem JSON file. I have a job setup each day to pull the poem, but the publish to Github will be manual until I get it working 100%. My Poem of the Times projects was a great &nbsp;vehicle for learning more about <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>, while also get to play around with another way to tell stories using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-broker.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways of building API collections using <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, and building on a concept I saw introduced by <a href="https://medium.com/@cyrilgaillard/i-dont-need-a-business-co-founder-i-need-an-api-broker-c9be536cf8fa">Cyril Gaillard&rsquo;s story titled "I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker</a>", something which was expanded on by Patricio Robles (<a href="https://twitter.com/probles">@probles</a>) on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/would-your-company-benefit-having-api-broker/analysis/2014/09/29">ProgrammableWeb with "would your company benefit from having an API broker</a>?"</p>
<p>The concept of an API broker is interesting. If you had talked to me a year ago, I would have framed my thoughts on API brokering in a more algorithmic way, but after reading these posts, I am looking to merge in my thoughts around API evangelism, taking more of a human approach to API brokering. While I think API brokering in the future might look like more like high speed trading with algorithms doing the heavy lifting, I&rsquo;m thinking for right now it is something we need humans to bridge, bringing a more personal approach during the wild wild west days of APIs.</p>
<p>To push forward my thoughts on API brokering, I&rsquo;m playing around with describing various APIs using <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0</a>, then building a collection of these APIs using APIs.json, and publishing it all to a Github project&mdash;which for now I&rsquo;m calling the <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">Utility Stack</a>. In this exercise I&rsquo;m organizing 10 separate APIs that provide me with a very useful stack of API resources. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I will be building with all of this, but the current stack reflects what I&rsquo;m already using to manage the API Evangelist network, so I know they are useful.</p>
<p>Here are the 10 APIs I&rsquo;m working with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Keyword &amp; Term Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API</li>
<li>Angellist Startup API</li>
<li>Bitly URL Data API</li>
<li>FullContact Location Normalization API</li>
<li>FullContact Name Normalization API</li>
<li>Pinboard Bookmark API</li>
<li>Wordnik Word Lists API</li>
<li>Wordnik Words API</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all API resources that provide some very useful elements in my operations. I use them to pull details about blog posts, look-up start-ups, shorten URLs, organize bookmarks, and other very utilitarian functions that I perform across my platform. I use these APIs for my own purposes, but for this project I&rsquo;m looking to assemble them potentially as a collection that can be used in the development of a specific application, or for ongoing development within specific company or group.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Swagger version 2.0 to describe these APIs, and publishing all of it to Github, using APIs.json as an index of the collection. This allows me to generate interactive documentation for each API in the collection, which makes the entire stack accessible via a <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">single development portal</a>. I&rsquo;m still working on the authentication across all of these resources, some of which are basic API keys, and other are BasicAuth or oAuth. Its all doable though, and based upon work I&rsquo;ve done before I can easily store API keys, and oAuth credentials in the master branch of the Github repository which I keep as private.</p>
<p>To summarize this exercise, as an API broker I could easily find the resources my clients will need to build a specific web or mobile application, or accomplish a specific system integration. I could setup all of the accounts for each of the resources in a central, private configuration file that can be used by the developer hub I&rsquo;ve setup so developers can explore using interactive documentation, as well as use directly within an application.</p>
<p>Think of this applied to Cyri&rsquo;s vision of needing an API broker, or possibly something that every company would have as Patricio suggests in his ProgrammableWeb post. With this project, I&rsquo;m not deploying any APIs, I&rsquo;m merely aggregating and brokering a machine readable collection across numerous other API resources. This exercise has also shown me that I can easily identify gaps within any stack I&rsquo;m working on, and make suggestions for new APIs that help developers accomplish a specific project objective.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Imagine if I needed to add an image stack, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, or my <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulate API</a>? I could easily added in other features, and resources that developers are needing, allowing them to do what they do best, building applications, and delivering on system integrations. As a broker I can do the legwork of finding the resources they need, and aggregating into a single developer hub.</p>
<p>The fun in all of this is that I have each of these API definitions in a central system, allowing me to orchestrate collections like this <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">utility stack</a>, or possibly <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/launching-25-apis-to-assemble-a-single-poem-for-each-day/">API stacks like my poem of the times</a> that all work towards a single objective, no matter whether its for developing a specific mobile application, single page application, or any other system integration you can imagine&mdash;even just writing a simple poem each day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m doing my usual monitoring of the API space, and while looking at various developer areas, I stumbled across the <a href="https://developer.target.com/">Target Developer Portal</a>. I find the Target developer portal interesting because it is publicly available, but before you can get any information you have to register or login.</p>
<p>When you land on the landing page for developer.target.com you simple get a page that says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Please Note: Access to the developer portal is restricted to Target employees and trusted third parties that currently have a working relationship with Target Corporation. Registration requests that do not meet these guidelines will be rejected.</em></blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more information about Target&rsquo;s API efforts, which I think they could do without giving away business intelligence, but overall I support the line they are walking with their API efforts. To me, Target is making a statement that they have an API, and if you are <em>"Target employees and trusted third parties"</em>, you can get more access--it is a start, so I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>I'm part of many private API discussions lately, where I&rsquo;m trying to educate companies about the benefits of being more public, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more companies take targets approach to publishing their developer API portal in coming years.</p>
<p>My only hope is that more of them will also share a blog, and other details about what they are up to, and hopefully some day even some publicly available APIs providing access to information that is already available on their website.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="http://api.report/2014/10/07/hacker-news-launches-official-api/">API news story of the day was the release of the Hacker News API</a>. I&rsquo;m only lightly interested in the fact that HN now has an API because, honestly I don't feel like an API at this point in the evolution of tech curation site is something to applaud, but their approach to making their API real-time I think does subtly reflect other currents in the API space.</p>
<p>HN partnered with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> to make sure the tech news curation site doesn't just have an API, it has a real-time API. Meaning you can now get HN links in machine readable way, so that you can build the popular flow of tech information into other web, and mobile applications&mdash;in real-time! HN launching an API&hellip;yawn! HN launch an API with Firebase bkked in, reflects a growing trend from influential APIs. For me this is more about real-time and Firebase, than it is about HN.</p>
<p>You see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">other API providers like Nest from Google baking in real-time frameworks into their APIs</a>. Real-time isn&rsquo;t something every type of API should be considering as a default feature, but there are definitely areas where the real-time flow of data is not just a nice to have, it is essential to demonstrating the value of APIs. In my experience, I would say that there are several sectors like news, financial, Internet of Things where I'm seeing real-time being present as a fundamental ingredient for the API platform--something I will be keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>As I said before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">some of the trends I&rsquo;m tracking on are quickly moving from trend to being baked into APIs</a>, going beyond just the release of web APis, and adding additional layers that developers are demanding to deliver the features their end-users are demanding.</p>

<p>I've been a big proponent of APIs in the federal government, and it makes me really happy to see <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> using <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/api.json">APIs.json to provide an inventory of APIs available at the federal agency</a> dedicated to strengthening "the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements".</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, it is the open format that <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist are working on to help make APIs discoverable. You can see APIs.json in action at the <a href="http://apis.io">open source API search engine APIs.io</a>, where the <a href="http://trade.gov/">International Trade Administration (ITA)</a> has submitted their APIs.json file for inclusion. ITA is the first of many federal agencies I will get to adopt the APIs.json format, and help make their valuable API resources much more discoverable, and ultimately more consumable.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a future where <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all global trade</span> is machine readable by default, and there are millions of simple, discoverable APIs available to help stimulate, as well as regulate industry? A future where the Department of Commerce and other relevant agencies are at the center, with the highest quality APIs you can imagine, and the healthiest outreach to not just industry, but also individual business owners.</p>
<p>Trade.gov&rsquo;s impressive entry into the world of APIs with <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.gov</a>, their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">quick responses to feedback</a>, and the publishing of an APIs.json file for the agency, makes me optimistic for this vision of the API economy. If our federal government can do it, then I think industries can follow the lead, ensure that the future of trade and commerce is more real-time, transparent, and accessible to everyone.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent some time this weekend updating a handful of my APIs to the new <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0 API definition format</a>. I was already using an older version of Swagger, so the migration wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. I have about five new APIs I want to roll out over the next couple weeks, and I wanted them to up to date, using the latest version, so moving forward my knowledge using my existing APIs was the best way to prepare.</p>
<p>I moved forward the five "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>", as I call them, analysis, APIs, building blocks, curated, and tools, to all use Swagger 2.0. These APIs provide access to my monitoring system I use to keep track of the space. I also migrated two of my "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a>", i<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">mage manipulation</a>, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture</a>, which are designed to be general purpose, utility APIs &nbsp;I use across my platform.</p>
<p>To support the migration I wrote a Swagger manager for my API monitoring system, which I use to track on 2794 APIs, from 3215 companies, which API Evangelist is one of these companies. Using this new tool I imported my old Swagger 1.2 versions, and after a little touching up in my new editor, I published brand spank&rsquo;n new Swagger 2.0 definitions for all seven my APIs.</p>
<p>The process reminded me of how API definitions really can help you describe, see, understand and ultimately communicate the API surface area you posses. I&rsquo;m going to take this and apply it to a couple of business sectors I&rsquo;m tracking on as part of my API Stack, and see what the process does for me there. After that I&rsquo;m going to get to work on the next five APIs I&rsquo;m designing, and see how Swagger 2.0 contributes to my design of brand new APIs, as well as later on in the life cycle.</p>
<p>I'm using my Swagger API definitions as a central truth for driving server side code, and my documentation. I&rsquo;m eager to continue exploring how it can further generate my client side code libraries, as well as SDKs, and help me better test, and monitor my APIs. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll perfectly automate every step in the API life cycle with Swagger, but it damn sure is making some of the steps much less painful, and following a central design truth, that in this case is a simple Swagger JSON file that I keep in a library, pushing forward my catalog of API resources, at the same time I push forward my own understand of what is possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/business/hewlett-packard-announces-breakup-plan.html?_r=0"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/HP-large.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/business/hewlett-packard-announces-breakup-plan.html?_r=0">hear stories of the HP separation today</a>, I'm reminded of how companies of all shapes and sizes interact, both historically, and in this potentially new API driven business landscape we find ourselves in. I&rsquo;m not an expert in running any size company, but this won&rsquo;t stop me from being a pundit on the subject! ;-)</p>
<p>The HP story brought me back to a conversation I was having the other day with a VC, regarding what is next for Apigee, and when I said IPO, the VC asked me if maybe SAP would buy them. I know that SAP and Apigee are partnering, but honestly I don't know jack about Apigee&rsquo;s business model, or even SAP, so I really don't have a clue what is next, I can only guess.</p>
<p>The conversation did prompt me to create this Evernote (birth of any API Evangelist blog post), helping me flush out some of my thoughts on how companies could potentially work together in an API driven business environment. I know that one way that big companies get the talent and market share they need is through the acquisition of smaller companies, something that has worked well for some time. However, another aspect to this history that only rarely gets discussed, is how many people, and brands just disappear into these acquisitions&mdash;never to be seen or heard from again (until their next start-up of course).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not inferring that big companies shouldn't acquire little companies. The point I'd like to make, is that maybe larger companies should consider how they could be a little more interoperable, and achieve numerous loosely couple relationships, versus always just acquiring a company. You never know, you maybe get all of the benefits of a relationship, without the negative of bringing a start-up in house only to see it chewed up by your internal bureaucracy&mdash;you know it happens!</p>
<p>I see plenty of large multinational corporations working through subsidiaries, shell companies, and other incarnations to move money around and avoid tax burden, you'd think it would make sense from an efficiency, agility, and cost saving standpoint as well. I know many companies are being built, exclusively for acquisition, but when they are going something very well in the space, generating value &ldquo;as a start-up&rdquo;, why do you want to throw a wet blanket on that? There are other ways to invest, and engage with these start-ups to benefit from the exhaust they generate.</p>
<p>Anyways, I guess I made my point. I just personally feel that the way we work as individuals is forever changing because of the Internet, and I can't help but think the era of bigcos will begin to fade, and the companies that succeed will learn to be leaner, and develop the loosely couple partnerships they need from companies, to be successful, and yes sometimes this requires investment, but doesn&rsquo;t have to involve full blow acquisitions.</p>
<p>Who knows, I could be high on my own farts here, but I think divorces, mergers, and acquisitions will look very different in the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">outspoken advocate for more open source API management tooling</a>, for some time now. I'm sensitive to the fact that startups have to make money in the API space, but in my opinion a certain layer of the API space needs to remain open and interoperable for this all to work, and I feel that open source tools are an important variable in this equation. When I last checked into what was available in the space, there really wasn't much, so in 2014 I figured I'd take another look.</p>
<p>Originally there is just one player on the space who was completely open source, and that is WSO2:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://wso2.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/wso2-logo-white-800X360.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>
<td>API management is just one tool in the massive open source catalog that WSO2 brings to the table. The company provides a number of open source tools including identity &amp; authentication, ESB, data  and <a href="http://wso2.com/">API management solutions</a>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>WSO2 is the shining open source example in the space currently, and <a href="http://www.liljeholmensstadshotell.se/">I was very happy to see them emerge on the landscape</a>. I feel WSO2 plays a strong role in the API space, but their approach to open source is the enterprise version, where the open gets rid of software licensing cost (yay), but is targeted specifically at an enterprise audience. I&rsquo;m not the enterprise, so to compliment what they bring to the table, I&rsquo;m also looking for a different version of &ldquo;community&rdquo;, and eager to see smaller players step up as well.</p>
<p>After WSO2 I got a taste of open source from Alcatel Lucent, with their release of API Grove, which was a whole other definition of open source:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://apigrove.net/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/alcatel-lucent/apigrove/apigrove-logo.png" alt="" width="75" align="center" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apigrove.net/">API Grove</a> was open sourced late in 2012 by Alcatel Lucent, holding some promise that another strong enterprise open source player would step up, but within months it would be clear that it was not a live open source offering, but Alcatel abandoning their API program, and publishing as open source to get the press release.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I&rsquo;d call API Grove, enterprise fire sale open source, and while the code is out there (I think), there is nobody home, not an enterprise, or other community to be seen. This type of open source releases just make me sad.</p>
<p>After WSO2 and API Grove, the only other player that saw emerg on the scene was ApiAxle:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://apiaxle.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/api-axle-logo-3.png" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apiaxle.com/">ApiAxle is an proxy</a> that sits on your network, in front of API(s)and and provides common API management features like rate limiting, authentication and caching. ApiAxle was recently purchase by application platform infrastructure provider Exicon.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>ApiAxle has been on my list for a couple years now, and was recently purchased by <a href="http://www.exiconglobal.com/">Exicon</a>. The site is pretty good looking, but I can't tell if there is any activity in the community recently. The blog is silent, but the site was updated a few days ago, and the Github repo for the project was last updated July 31st&mdash;it can be hard to tell sometimes, just how active an open source project is.</p>
<p>Beyond ApiAxle, there are two API management pioneers who been hard at work releasing open source tooling:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://www.3scale.net/api-management/api-proxy-for-api-traffic-management-by-3scale/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="110" align="center" /></a></td>
<td>3Scale is one of the original API infrastructure providers, and has developed an <a href="http://www.3scale.net/api-management/api-proxy-for-api-traffic-management-by-3scale/">open source API proxy using the NGINX Web Server</a>, designed to work independently, but also be able to take advantage of freemium 3Scale API analytics, billing, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="https://github.com/apigee-127/volos"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/apigee-logo.gif" alt="" width="90" align="center" /></a></td>
<td>Like 3Scale, Apigee is one of the original API infrastructure provider, and has been working on <a href="https://github.com/apigee-127/volos">Volos an open source Node.js solution for developing and deploying production-level APIs</a>, providing common features such as oAuth 2.0, caching, and quota management into APIs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It can be hard to envision exactly how open source fits into 3Scale or Apigee&rsquo;s business model, but as the core features of API management become more commoditized, I can't help but think that open source tooling will increasingly be a reality on the front-line for these API infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>After these projects from leading API management providers, I hadn't see any other open source API management tooling until I started to look closer at APIs in the public sector:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://www.socrata.com/products/open-data-portal/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/socrata_logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> has been providing API and open data management tools to government of all shapes and sizes for some time now, and along the way is open sourcing many of its tools including an <a href="http://www.socrata.com/products/open-data-portal/">open source developer portal</a> that anyone can use to management their API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100"><a href="http://nrel.github.io/api-umbrella/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/api-umbrella-logo.png" alt="" width="100" align="center" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://nrel.github.io/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a> was born out of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to manage their own APIs, but then has evolved to be used by other agences, as well as being adopted by central data.gov efforts within the federal government.&nbsp;<span>API Umbrella is a proxy that sits in front of your APIs. It can seamlessly add common functionality like api keys, rate limiting, and analytics to any API.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think what is happening in the public sector API space, reflects what the private sector is needing as well, in regards to open, interoperability, and the room to play, experiment and figure things out before you have to start putting to much cash on the line.  I just think the government is in more of a position to mandate this, where in the public sector freemium solutions from 3Scale have been a buffer for this demand, but as the space expands I think open source tooling will begin to evolve to provide further relief valves.</p>
<p>In doing this research, what has really caught my attention, is the number of new players that are picking up momentum in 2014:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellpadding="2" width="90%">

<p>Overall I think these new players reflect the maturation of the space, but beyond that I'm not sure what it means for the API world, it will take some time for me to work through what features are being offered, and what business models exist around these open tools. In my experience, the motivations behind open source mean everything, and the relationship a open source project has to their parent company can make or break the momentum any open source project will possess--setting the tone for any community, enteprise or otherwise.</p>
<p>Eventually I'll bring together the open source tools I've found in the API management layer, with the open source design tooling I'm seeing from Apiary and Swagger, and other <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API design providers</a>, as well as the wealth of tooling I'm seeing for <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a>&mdash;still playing catch up on the roundup here. When I squint my eyes, and think about the space, I can't help but feel that we are getting closer to my earlier vision of open source in the API space, but we still have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>What else am I msising from the pool of open source API management tooling? I depend on my audience letting me know what they are using.</p>
<p><em>P.S. I know I'm going to get an email from Mulesoft on the piece, I&rsquo;m sure you guys fit in here somewhere, but honestly I spent about 2 hours looking through your stuff, and I can&rsquo;t figure out just exactly what version of open source you guys are. I understand the <a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/">Mule ESB is open source</a>, which isn't squarely in my API management category, and after that I really can't tell with the other open tooling you guys have&mdash;feel free to post a blog post response, helping me, and the community understand better.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com/index.html">home page of API Evangelist</a> has always been my API 101 page, where any new visitor can land, not know a thing about APIs, read the page, and walk away understanding at least what an API is, and hopefully also a greater understanding of how it impacts their world. From the beginning the API Evangelist home page always had a lean toward API providers, and over time I've added information about consuming APIs, as well as trends in the API space I'm seeing.</p>
<p>In my opinion my 101 content has become too lengthy, and not properly onboarding people to the multiple areas of APIs like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/provide/">providing APIs</a> vs <a href="http://apievangelist.com/consume/">consuming APIs</a>. I think it is time to overhaul my 101 section, and produce some newer, more relevant API 101 content for 2014. To support this, I'm working on a series of 15 API 101 segments, with each one having a story version, as well as a slideshow edition, complete with audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finished the first one, which is my 100K view, API 101 introduction. I'm still working on the slideshow version. Once I'm done I"ll move on to providing APIs, and as I finish each one I'll hang on the homepage, as well as publish out via the blog, and Twitterz.</p>

<h1>API 101</h1>
<p>APIs, also known as Application Programming Interfaces, at their most basic level, allows applications to talk to other applications, but they are so much more than this when you begin to explore the world of APIs further. APIs are slowly becoming part of every aspect of our personal, and business worlds, often even without us knowing. If you surf the web, and use a mobile phone, this explanation of what an API is for you. APIs are affecting your life right now, and with a little more understanding you can learn to identify APIs, and put them to work for you, even if you are not a geek.</p>
<h2>861,379,000 Websites</h2>
<p>There are 861,379,000 websites registered in 2014, making up what we know as the World Wide Web. In 2014 it is easier to build a web than it has at any other pointing in the history of the Internet, allowing any individual, company or organization to publish a website and even point a custom address to it.</p>

<p>In 1995 only the most tech savviest had websites, and by 2000 many businesses realized having a website was the normal way of doing business. In 2010 many of the tech savviest companies had APIs, and by 2015 many businesses are realizing that having an API is the normal way of doing business--imagine what the Internet will look like by 2020.</p>
<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p>Websites like Facebook allow us to interact with friends and family, sharing messagings, photos, links, and other essential life bits, establishing a social platform for us to engage in our online lives.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/facebook-screenshot.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>Facebook is a daily destination for users around the world, with much of the interactions via an increasing number of mobile devices that all of us have in our pockets. These mobile devices all use APIs to connect our mobile app to Facebook.com.</p>
<h2>Yahoo</h2>
<p>Yahoo has long been a staple of the Internet providing users with access to their news, sport, weather, stock, and other important bits of our daily lives. Yahoo was an early player on the web, and continues to find new ways to compete in 2014 via the web and mobile.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/yahoo-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>Yahoo may not be what it used to be, but the company continues to innovate through acquisitions, and still plays a role as the home page for many users who were first introduced to the World Wide Web through Yahoo search and directories.</p>
<h2>Youtube</h2>
<p>YouTube provides us with hours of online entertainment, bringing home user-generated, and sometimes professionally produced videos, ranging from family home videos to music videos, and live concerts. YouTube is quickly replacing the television of the previous century, re-inventing how we are entertained in our homes.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/youtube-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>YouTube users often spend time watching videos on the main YouTube website, but also consume a considerable amount of videos using the universal embeddable video player allowing Youtube videos to be embedded on any website around the web, all driven by APIs.</p>
<h2>Amazon</h2>
<p>Amazon has made e-commerce part of the mainstream conversation, allowing us to order almost any physical, or digital product we can imagine from the vast warehouses that Amazon posses, as well as those of its affiliates. Amazon found got started with physical products like books, but in 2014 has led the charge in delivering virtual goods such as movies, e-books, and other online products consumers are craving.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/amazon-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>Selling you products is just the first part of the conversation when it comes to Amazon, they also want to provide with consumer any possible channel they could possibly choose to purchase their products, including providing infrastructure for web, mobile, and tablet developers, and even producing their own tablet device, and supporting platform.</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter allows us to send short, SMS style messages across the public Internet, and follow, or be followed by the people we find ost interesting. Twitter has gone beyond just a messaging platform, or even a social network, and has become the pulse of the online world through its API driven platform.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/twitter-screenshot.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>Everything you know about Twitter was originally developed using the Twitter API, its mobile applications, desktop applications, buttons, widgets, and other analytics and visualizations are all developed using the Twitter public API, which makes the entire Twitter platform available to developers.</p>
<h2>Pinterest</h2>
<p>Pinterest provides users with a simple, yet addictive way to share photos on the open Internet, and with friends. Photos play an important role in our lives, and Pinterest stepped up as a new way to express ourselves using these valuable photos and images.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/pinterest-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>Only part of the interactions with Pinterest occur via their website, the majority of engagements occur through sharing on other sites and social networks, and via mobile applications that allow users to quickly share and express themselves with photos.</p>
<h2>Reddit</h2>
<p>Reddit is the home page of the Internet, providing users with links to the important stories, products, and conversations of the day. Redditors curate the best links that are submitted through the site, and through user engagements the best of the best floats to the top for everyone to explore.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/reddit-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" /></p>
<p>Reddit demonstrates the real-time network effect that we often associate with the Internet, providing a heartbeat of the best links being viewed, and engaged with across the Internet, making the trillions of web pages, across billions of websites accessible each day by average people.</p>
<h2>Bits Of Our Life Across These Sites</h2>
<p>All of these websites are built by other people, but as users of these sites we all leave a little bit of ourselves in these locations, each time we visit. Whether its just a comment, photo, all the way up to sustained engagement via our mobile phones, we are consistently leaving ever growing footprint across this digital landscape of web sites, and mobile applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/tag-cloud-life-bits.png" alt="" width="625" align="center" /></p>
<p>It has taken decades to go from just a handful of the first sites on the World Wide Web to the 861,379,000 we have in 2014. It is taken the hard work of web site designers and developers to make these sies a reality, but increasingly through the use of API driven interactions via 3rd party websites and mobile devices, all the information on these sites are being generated by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU</span></strong>, the user.</p>
<h2>Hand Written Websites Using HTML</h2>
<p>Iin the early days, all websites were hand coded, with web designers writing all the HTML, and building their own images. Individuals spent numerous hours maintaining each page across vast sites, and often hired large teams help maintain single sites that could span millions of actual web pages.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 200px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-html.png" alt="" width="200" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/yahoo-screenshot-og.png" alt="" width="300" align="center" /></p>
<p>As the number of websites grew this became even more tedious to maintain, but savvy designers turned developers were finding innovative ways to create, publish, and maintain the growing number of websites. While some websites are still hand-coded, the majority of sites are generated, published, and maintained by an ever evolving set of web development software, and Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms.</p>
<h2>Website Content Was Coming From Databases</h2>
<p>Eventually the concept of a database driven website came to be, allowing websites to evolve from sites into applications, and all the content across a website was stored in a database. Now your site was more than just publishing content from a database, you also allowed users to interact, purchase, and generate content as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 50px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-database.png" alt="" width="150" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/facebook-screenshot-og.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="center" /></p>
<p>Databases allowed websites to evolve, and go beyond just content publishing, potentially making their websites not just about the delivery of valuable content, but you could also encourage users to create content either knowingly or unknowingly, and not just on a single website, but across hundreds or thousands of sites around the world.</p>
<h2>Adding An Amazon Product Widget</h2>
<p>Along the way it became clear that it wasn't enough to have just your products on your website, or maybe you were a content site and didn't have your own products. Either way, users needed a way to put widgets, and other syndicated content on their site, which would pull products from other sites, which is something Amazon became very, very good at.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/amazon-widget.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="425" align="center" /></p>
<p>API driven content widgets became a great way to publish products onto the growing number of blogs, review, and other sites that were popping up across the Internet. These approaches to content delivery proved to work not just for product owners, but eventually any content could be syndicated across websites using simple, small, embeddable widgets, benefitting an entire network of connected sites.</p>
<h2>Add A Delicious Bookmark Widget</h2>
<p>As the social evolution of the Internet began, links to valuable content, and the social influence behind these curated groups of links became apparent. It wasn't just about bookmarking your favorite sites, it was about grouping, curated, and sharing of this content across any website that would have you, using embeddable tools.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 150px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/delicious-widget.png" alt="" width="150" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="425" align="center" /></p>
<p>Curated links often show as spammy advertised links, but can also show relevant links based upon what you are searching for, what your friends are doing, and in other ways, that makes the embedding of links, or groups of links, an important way to share information across the Internet.</p>
<h2>Add Twitter Widget</h2>
<p>With the social movement in full swing, just posting links to your favorite sites was not enough. Users wanted to be able to communicate in real-time about the sites they were visiting, what they were reading, watching online, and increasingly what people were doing offline. With the introduction of Twitter users wanted to be able to show what what on their mind, not matter where website it was on the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/twitter-widget.png" alt="" width="150" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="375" align="center" /></p>
<p>Widgets were now allowing every piece of your life that was generated online to live beyond just the website where you created it, and could travel around from any website, to any other site or application that it could. Embeddable content and tools elevated the World Wide Web beyond just any single site, it was a distributed Internet now.</p>
<h2>Content Comes From Many Databases &amp; APIs</h2>
<p>If you were a website developer, your website content no longer comes from any single database. You were pulling your content from a variety of databases, and API resources that you may or may not own. Product sites like Amazon, and social networks like Twitter were emerging, equipped with APIs they were generating content, and allowing it to come in from, and be published back to any website on the open Internet.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 100px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="125" align="center" /><img style="padding-bottom: 100px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-database.png" alt="" width="100" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="center" /></p>
<p>Having a direct database connection to your content wasn't enough anymore. You needed to have APIs so that trusted partners, as well as potentially the public, can get access to data, content and other information, for use across other websites, anywhere on the Internet. Just as this concept was spreading across the Internet, another thing happened, that would forever change how we interact online.</p>
<h2>Then The IPhone Happened</h2>
<p>On June 29, 2007 the first edition of the iPhone was release, and slowly over the next 3 years computing would undergo a transformation, building on existing approaches that first were used to distribute content to website, but would also prove to be low cost, efficient ways to distribute content to a growing number of mobile devices.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/iphone-series.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>While the iPhone is just one of many mobile devices being manufactured today, it did set in motion a new way of designing, and developing applications that could run on the web, or mobile devices, anywhere in the world using simple web-based APIs. Mobile application development has brought many changes to the world of compute, but simple API access to valuable data, content, and other resources has been the most significant.</p>
<h2>Foursquare</h2>
<p>Mobile applications came with the simple knowledge of your location, as well as where you were at online, enabling a new form of communication, called the check-in. A new breed of mobile apps like Foursquare allowed users to see where they were, find friends, as well as places and experiences nearby, making the Internet a more local affair.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/foursquare-mobile-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="450" align="center" /></p>
<p>From this point forward, the longitude and latitude of each online user would be an option when receiving messages, photos, videos and other life bits from users, changing how we think about developing applications--it was a mobile app world now.</p>
<h2>Instagram</h2>
<p>In addition to knowing the location of each application user, each user was potentially given a high quality, internet enable camera on their mobile device. With the ability to take a picture, anywhere, anytime, new applications like Instagram emerged providing users with new features, and social capabilities built around photos.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/instagram-mobile-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="450" align="center" /></p>
<p>Photos continue to be one of the most important, and valued life bits that we can generate across the Internet pipes, providing a very basic ingredient for use in online communication. This is something that would prove essential to users of all ages, from teens all the way up to grandparents discovering the potential of web and mobile apps.</p>
<h2>Pandora</h2>
<p>As with photos, music plays a central role in our life, and it is no accident that along with the introduction of the iPhone, Apple brought along its successful model for a music platform centered around their portable music player, the iPod. Music is an extremely valuable space when it comes to our life bits, something developers and platforms are looking to capitalize on by delivering the next generation of music apps.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/pandora-mobile-screenshot.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /></p>
<p>APIs are stimulating our musical tastes beyond just our Pandora or Rdio playlists, by allowing us to interact with friends, watch videos, purchase concert tickets, buy merchandise, and much, much more. The music industry has been slow to change, but ultimately consumer interests are winning out, and the industry is slowly understanding that a mobile experiences is where today's music experience is at.</p>
<h2>WhatsApp</h2>
<p>In an online, mobile world, staying in touch is one of the most important elements of our digital self. Staying in touch with friends, co-workers, and the ability to organize into groups and meet for sport practice, or to protest the government, is the focus of leading messaging apps like WhatsApp.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/whatsapp-mobile-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="450" align="center" /></p>
<p>Companies like WhatsApp are seeing record investment, valuations, and usage by users around the world--showing that messaging online is an important part of the online and mobile experience, and building apps that connect users in real-time, when they they want, and how they want, is a huge opportunity for start-ups.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Powering Websites</h2>
<p>APIs have been powering websites for almost 15 years now, delivering data, content, and other digital information to the websites we use everyday like Amazon, Twitter, and Pinterest. The average website gets its content from a variety of API driven resources, both from public and private sources, making the aggregation of content a viable business model in 2014.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 100px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/website.jpg" alt="" width="375" align="center" /></p>
<p>Using content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, combined with API driven plugins, anyone can be a curator of content, providing a website where users can find stories, photos, videos, and other valuable resources. In 2015 WordPress will also launch its own API, which will give 65 million websites their own API, turning many average site owners, into API providers.</p>
<h2>API Are Powering Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>The number of mobile phones in our pockets will reach 7.3 billion in 2014--equally the population of the world. Of course not everyone has a cell phone, but it shows the ubiquitous nature of these devices, and shows the size of the opportunity to provide API driven resources like messaging, products, images, videos, and the other life bits we generate, and depend on each day.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 100px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/iphone-6.jpeg" alt="" width="275" align="center" /></p>
<p>Web APIs are well suited for sending and receiving the small, bite-size chunks of data, content, and other digital resources we use through our personal and business worlds. Mobile apps are not just being developed by the latest tech start-ups, mobile apps are becoming the normal mode of operations for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Powering Buttons, Badges, and Widgets</h2>
<p>APIs break up our valuable data and content into small bite-size chunks for transmission to mobile devices, but also so that they can be moved around the web, and published to where we need them. APIs are powering a wide range of buttons, badges, and other widgets that are making any single website, into a globally distributed network of content publishing and creation.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 100px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/buttons-widgets.png" alt="" width="325" align="center" /></p>
<p>Buttons, badges and widgets are extending likes, follows and favorites from your favorite social network to any other site you may be reading or participating on, providing a bridge between all of the application you use on the web and your mobile devices. Facebook is a big part of the identity of any online user, and being able to log-in, share, and participate on the open Internet using our Facebook profiles has become normal for the average Internet user.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Powering Spreadsheets</h2>
<p>APIs are quickly finding their way beyond web and mobile applications, and are being used in spreadsheets to provide the data needed for business calculations, analysis and visualizations. A large amount of the worlds data exists in spreadsheets and the next wave of API developers are currently spreadsheet administrators, they just have not been informed that they can get the data they need via APis.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 75px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/google-spreadsheet.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="center" /></p>
<p>The days of emailing around spreadsheets, having out of date excel documents strewn here and there, is going away. Spreadsheets are connecting to APIs using excel connectors, and online using Google Spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are being constructed to make sense of Tweet streams, aggregate comments or messages, and number crunch the latest industry numbers from the government.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Powering Devices</h2>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say APIs are penetrating almost every aspect of our world. APIs are being used to connect physical devices in our lives like thermostats, smoke detectors, automobiles, clothing, glasses, and just about every object you can imagine, and some you can't.</p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom: 50px; padding-right: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="center" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/nest.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="center" /></p>
<p>In 2014 a wave of new start-ups, calling themselves Internet of Thing companies, have emerged to build on the API movement, extending the low-cost, simple approach to delivering resources to the physical world around us. Using APIs, the Internet is moving offline, and wiring up almost every aspect of our personal, public, and professional life.</p>
<h2>Not Just For Developers</h2>
<p>APIs are not just for developers. If you can use a web page, you can use most APIs. There are a great deal of educational materials (like this), to get you up to speed with APIs. API providers are also working to make it a priority to focus on non-developer users, such as data journalists, analysts, and many other non-programming user types.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-programmer.png" alt="" width="375" align="center" /></p>
<p>Even if an API has a more developer focus to it, often times you can just ask questions of the community, or the API provider and they will help you understand the value an API delivers, and how you can possibly put it to use. One of the characteristics of Software as a Service (SaaS) applications that people are using, is there is an API behind the scenes, something that only the API savviest of users are aware of.</p>
<h2>Orchestrate Using APIs With IFTTT And Zapier</h2>
<p>A new generation of services have emerged, acknowledging the wealth of API resources available, and the growing number of SaaS applications that have APIs, and are delivering tools that help anyone put APIs to work. Services like IFTTT and Zapier provide very simple recipes that allow anyone to migrate content, data, and other digital resources between online platforms--no code necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/"><img style="padding-left: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/IFTTT-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="320" align="center" /></a><br /><a href="https://zapier.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zapier/zapier-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="350" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>These API enabled orchestration platforms allow anyone to automate, migrate, and keep their online worlds in sync. These services are targeting non-developers, but provide such instant value, they are often used by programmers to make their worlds go around. This approach to using online services, is allowing companies, organizations, and even individuals to find new found freedom and control in their digital lives.</p>
<h2>Making Companies More Nimble &amp; Agile</h2>
<p>Companies are learning that when they make all data, content, and other digital assets available via well designed, simple, and modular APIs over the Internet, they find a new nimbleness and agility in how they operate internally, engage with partners, and even are able to interact with the public at large.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-running.png" alt="" width="300" align="center" /></p>
<p>While APIs are technical in nature, their simplicity, and efficiency are meant to make things more accessible, in simple but secure way, using the path of least resistance. Historically valuable digital resources are locked up by software developers and information technology groups, API developers are looking to change this, making resources available to as wide of an audience as possible.</p>
<h2>Making Companies More Open &amp; Transparent</h2>
<p>Another aspect that is transcending the technology of APIs, is the openness and transparency it can introduce into company, organizational, institutional, and government operations. This isn't always good by default, but when done properly it can let a little sunlight into a potentially closed process, and eliminate some illnesses that occur behind closed doors.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-windows.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="center" /></p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to business, sometimes transparency can work against you, but many corporations, and young start-ups find that being closed can hurt not just potential competitors, but also slow your own company in finding success. As we've learned from open source software, openness can actually boost security, privacy and many other concerns, and a true approach to using APIs can bring some of the same effects to organizations of any size.</p>
<h2>Allowing Companies To Be More Competitive</h2>
<p>The ability to rapidly design, develop, deploy and iterate websites, mobile applications, while also empowering workers to be more effective via API driven spreadsheets and widgets, is giving companies a competitive edge. APIs open up a new way of doing business that the savviest of online businesses are participating in. There is a stunning amount of investment for start-ups looking to disrupt even the most entrenched industries, and companies, but it also doesn't take a start-up to make change, and many large businesses are also taking notice and getting to work on their own API efforts.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/101/bw-competition.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="center" /></p>
<p>In the next five years, it will become evident which companies, and organizations do not have APIs, as they will not be participating at the levels of API driven companies. Large organizations will not be able to keep up in an always on, real-time business environment, something that APIs power across multiple channels including web, mobile, devices, and other ways of doing business online, in this new environment.</p>
<h2>Empowering Individuals To Take Control Online</h2>
<p>The most important thing APIs are bringing to the table, is the empowerment of the average online individual. APIs are providing access to much of the data and content we are generating online. APIs are how we can get access to the photos of our children on Facebook, and our home videos we've shared on YouTube. APIs are not just about driving business innovation, it is how the average user is taking back their digital self from a growing wave of data hungry start-ups.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-fist.png" alt="" width="200" align="center" /></p>
<p>API literacy is much like financial literacy. You don't have to understand the inner workings of banking and credit card industry, but you damn sure need to be educated enough to understand who has access to your bank account and credit card statement. With API literacy you don't have to understand how APIs work, but you should only use online services that have an API, and know who has access to your data and content, while also being able to download and walk away with your own valuable information that you have generated via <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANY</span></strong> online service.</p>
<h2>APIs Are Important, Please Keep Learning</h2>
<p>This is just the first of a series of 101 tutorials on the world of APIs. On the home page of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> you can find other tutorials on providing APIs or consuming APIs, and the research that went into this material. I have other research areas like real-time, and voice APIs, which as I have time will be generating 101 tutorials for--let me know if there are any of them I should prioritize</p>
<p>I will be adding new tutorials as I have time, until then you can tune into the news stream from each area of research on the API Evangelist network, as well as tune into the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> blog for the latest analysis on the business of APIs, <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a> for the latest on the politics of APis, and the <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a> the latest in news from the APi space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elastic-path-logo-2014.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving my <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/">hypermedia API research</a> a little love today, and as part of this I was reviewing examples of hypermedia in the wild like with the <a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/hypermedia-api">Elastic Path Cortex API</a>. Elastic Path was the first company to introduce me to the possibilities around hypermedia way back in 2011, so I enjoy checking in regularly to see what they are up to with their APIs.</p>
<p>As of January 2014 <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">I&rsquo;ve committed more time to doing research on hypermedia APIs</a>, as well as work to tell stories about how hypermedia is being applied by companies, in a way that anyone can understand. This last summer at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/28/video-from-the-hypermedia-panel-at-apicraft-in-detroit-last-month/">API-Craft in Detroit, the hypermedia community acknowledged</a> that they have an image problem, and had some significant work ahead of them when it comes to storytelling, specifically around speaking to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t 100% speak hypermedia-eze, but I know with some practice I can get better at translating. I also know that some of the hypermedia folks aren&rsquo;t so good at speaking plain english to normal people, but with some practice I htink they will also get better. To help me in my jouney I figured I&rsquo;d translate what Elastic Path has written on their Cortex API page, but first I want to acknowledge the image they have--which is the first sophisticated hypermedia visual I&rsquo;ve seen, and I want to work on creating more like it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/hypermedia-api"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elastic-path-developer-cortex-diagram-2.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get on with the translation from hypermedia-eze to plain english. Elastic Path starts with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Cortex is a mediation layer that uses patent-pending dynamic linking technology to discover and assemble resources from multiple business platforms into one consistent interface. Data and services from enterprise applications like Commerce Engine, Adobe&reg; Experience Manager, OpenText&reg; CEM, and others are mapped to Cortex using a lightweight schema. Once abstracted, these resources &mdash; from any source &mdash; are linked together to generate Cortex Business APIs that securely project your unified services to the world.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation: </strong>Cortex brings together all your information, no matter where it resides, into a single, consistent API that you can then securely share with anyone you desire.</p>
<blockquote><em>Cortex mediation completely decouples client applications from business platforms, yet enhances their ability to securely retrieve data and perform transactions. This breakthrough hyper media approach gives designers, developers, and API consumers the unprecedented freedom they need to create unique digital experiences &mdash; from mobile apps to Internet Retailer&reg; Top 500 websites &mdash; that engage customers and create business value.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Cortex understands that you are delivering information to a wide assortment of web, mobile and tablet devices in 2014, and Cortex handles the heavy load, abstracting away the complexity for API developers, allowing them deliver more meaningful experiences for end-users, agnostic of any platform they use.</p>
<blockquote><em>A hypermedia API means self-serve e-commerce.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> A hypermedia API means self-serve e-commerce.</p>
<blockquote><em>Unified services from your application portfolio are exposed via Cortex Business APIs, a set of highly scalable REST interfaces that conform rigorously to the HATEOAS constraint and Level 3 of the Richardson Maturity Model. This means that client applications can securely access enterprise data and perform authorized operations using only the hypermedia controls generated by the mediation layer. No deeper knowledge of your business platforms is required &mdash; so the tyranny of constant integration work ends with Cortex. It's simply the best API for ecommerce platforms.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation: </strong>Similar to understanding all of the devices you will be delivering information to, Cortex understand which users are accessing your information, and securely delivers only the information they have access to, and enables them to only take the actions they have afforded to them, again abstracting away the complexity of business operations for developers.</p>
<p>My translations may not be perfect, but in short, because the they employ hypermedia design patterns, the Cortex API can more intelligently consider which internal, or external systems your information is being pulled from, while also understanding the context of the end-user who will be accessing this information, both who they are, and what device(s) they are using, potentially handling all of this logic for developers, leaving them to do what they do best.</p>
<p>You see, APIs have been abstracting away the complexity of back-end system for a while now, but hypermedia has the potential to abstract away a couple more of the key  layers for developers--who the user is, and what device (channel) they are engaging upon. When done right, this has the potential to make the delivery of digital resources via APIs, to any number of online channels much more streamlined and efficient for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Of course, even though all of this is a reality with Elastic Path right now, we have huge hurdles to jump in helping resource owners, and application developers understand the benefits hypermedia can bring to their operations, and this is why I'm honing my hypermedia translation and storytelling skills so I can help be a conduit in these ongoing discussions.</p>

<p>As the popularity of APIs rapidly increases, I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets play a growing role in both providing APIs, as well as consuming APIs. On the road to #APIStrat Chicago I came across a company who has a pretty dead-simple approach to using spreadsheets to drive data via APIs, called <a href="https://www.dataeverywhere.com/">Data Everywhere</a>.</p>
<p>Data Everywhere describes their service:</p>
<blockquote><em>Select the cells in your existing spreadsheet and click publish. Your data will be instantly available in other spreadsheets. Our REST API makes your data available in databases, phones, websites, and other applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>Whether we want to admit it or not, most of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and providing dead simple tools to liberate this data via APIs are a very logical solution. We aren't just talking about taking an entire spreadsheet and turning it into an API with <a href="https://www.dataeverywhere.com/">Data Everywhere</a>, we are seamlessly making data available from spreadsheets via API, leaving the existing workflow in tact.</p>
<p>Educating the &ldquo;every day &ldquo; spreadsheet user of the importance of APIs in making their work interoperable, and accessible in web and mobile is definitely a priority for me in the coming years. I feel like this education process will continue to be an important layer to my evangelism work for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. </strong>Thank you to Data Everywhere for helping moderate the data session at @APIStrat!</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ying-yang.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend many of my days talking to startups, SMB, SME, larger enterprise, institutions, and federal government folk about APIs&mdash;if you haven&rsquo;t heard, its what I do. I&rsquo;ve become the sort of counselor for the world of APIs, sometimes just listening, but often times giving advice, and sharing random thoughts with a wide variety of characters, who are looking to understand the world of APIs.</p>
<p>One pattern I've been consistently seeing across many of these API sessions, is that questions around internal API strategy are trumping any external or public API questions. These usually discussions start with questions of API design, deployment and management, but then often times move to strategies around internal evangelism, and incentivizing the usage of APIs in general, not just consuming your own internal APIs. Many are recognizing that the path towards being a healthy API provider, involves also being a healthy API consumer&mdash;a sort of yin yang of APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m realizing that for many of these folks that I speak with, the challenge of selling the concept of APIs internally is often a bigger, and more daunting challenge than designing, developing, managing, and evangelizing an API to partners, or even the public. I think we are underestimating the challenge our friends at larger organizations are facing when they try to get the resources they need to be successful within their own work, let alone also contribute to the overall success of their company, agency, or organization.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding that many of these conversations only occur because I do not have anything to sell them. Many of the people I talk to are starved for an educated, outside perspective, even before any desire to understand, and learning about the larger API space. If you are an API service provider in the space, this is a layer of the API economy you need to help me with. How do we onboard these folks as they come into the space, and equip them with the tools, information, and yes the services they will need to be successful&mdash;yet also understanding that they are just starting on a journey that will take some time, and we all should think critically about when we push our warez on them, or just sit, listen, and provide some valuable advice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2014</span>

<p>I was doing some research on travel and transportation APIs over the last couple of weeks, and one of the developer portals I was looking at was one of the enterprise leaders in the space, the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/">Sabre Dev Network</a>. I really like the overall implementation from Sabre, except for one thing...</p>
<p>There is no pricing page for the Sabre Dev Network. ;-( The only place you find a mention of pricing is in the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/resources/FAQ">FAQ page</a>, where it says:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have a number of different pricing options for our services. Whether you are a company just starting out or an established travel provider, we have pricing options that will fit your business needs.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>I understand you are a little apprehensive about sharing your pricing, or maybe you haven&rsquo;t really thought it through all the way, and just want to shake the trees and see what falls out. Whatever the reason, when it comes to APIs you should be a little more transparent about what is going on.</p>
<p>Additionally, as far along as you are with some of the other parts of your developer program, you should have a pretty robust service composition page, and a partner and certification framework for developers to work towards.</p>
<p>Other than the lack of information about what everything costs, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/">Sabre Dev Network</a>, as a platform. I have two other stories to do around their approach, but wanted to start with the constructive criticism before I move into the praise. ;-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working through my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design stories</a>, and was working through some research on the origins of <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and as I'm writing a paragraph on <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, I became distracted around how Swagger was born out of this "word" startup. You see, Wordnik presents themselves as "a new way to discover meaning", and out of this work, Swagger, "a new way to discover meaning" from APIs was born.</p>
<p>Words are an important building block in communication, and I see APIs as a similar, more structured way to approach online communication on the open Internet. Swagger has given us a new vocabulary, providing a new way to describe, and communicate around APIs. You can programmatically pull a a Swagger specification for an API, and within a few seconds you have an idea of what the API resources means, and has to offer.</p>
<p>There really isn't any major point to this story, other than the fact that I find it interesting that a company who is striving to discover meaning among words, would also be looking to help us discovery meaning of APIs. I think this essence is why so many are adopting Swagger to define their valuable API resources, because it comes from a purer place, than just trying to sell you API tooling, and is actually working to help you find and communicate the meaning amongst APIs.</p>

<p>As the API lifecycle continues to expand and comes into focus, new services are emerging to help both API providers, and consumers, better manage API operations from start to finish. New API integration services like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> have emerged to better understand how APIs are actually being consumed, and services like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a>&nbsp;are born out of the need to produce better quality SDKs for developers--it only seems natural that eventually these services would start working together.</p>
<p>APIMatic will now generate SDKs in 7 languages that are designed, and enabled to inspect/debug all of the requests and response data between their API, and the applications that depend on them.  This will provide both API provider, and consumer with vital details on the integration in real-time, that can help ensure applications integrations are all optimized.</p>
<p>All of this is made possible because <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/overview">Runscope has APIs</a>, and APIMatic was savvy enough to weave in integration, monitoring and testing capabilities directly into the SDKs of any API. APIMatic will import API definitions in WADL, Swagger, I/O Docs, API BluePrint, or Google Discovery, then generate SDKs for you in Android, Windows, iOS, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, complete with Runscope integration, monitoring and testing! Something made possible because you have a machine readable API definition for all of your APIs.</p>
<p>This latest expansion of the API lifecycle I feel was kicked off by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a>, introducing the ability to generate interactive docs, server and client code for your APIs. This was then expanded upon by <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a> by allowing you to mockup APIs using <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and now APIMatic and Runscope are expanding the lifecycle to include SDKs and API monitoring. It makes me happy to see the API definition continue to play such an important role, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/">as the central truth in the API lifecycle</a>, enabling all of these API services along the way.</p>
<p>Someday I'll create a cool little lifecycle visualization that shows each step in an APIs life, and what is enabled by using a central, machine readable API definition for all of your APIs, and underlying data models, but we all know graphics isn&rsquo;t one of my strengths, so we'll see..</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

        <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.ou.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-university-of-oklahoma.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dedicating more time lately to research how APIs are being used at universities, and a couple months back I published my first <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/white-paper.html">white paper on using APIs in higher educatio</a>n. As I do with other sectors, I would like to shed light on how APIs are being used at universities, and potentially share best practices, and stories between higher educational institutions, amplifying the positive effects of APIs.</p>
<p>My efforts are beginning to pay off, and I was recently contacted by two friends, Mark Morvant (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMorvant">@MarkMorvant</a>) and Adam Croom (<a href="https://twitter.com/acroom">@acroom</a>), at the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/">University of Oklahoma</a>. They had seen my&nbsp;<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">University research</a>, and read my white paper, but what really lit their fire was the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/nyregion/students-inventing-programs-to-streamline-their-colleges-data.html?_r=3">piece in the NY Times about student-built apps teaching colleges a thing or two</a>&mdash;after reading that, they decided to give me a call to discuss APIs more.</p>
<p>I started with the two approaches to using APIs that I am seeing at <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/universities.html">universities</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Access To Institutional Resources - </strong>APIs being deployed to provide better access to data, content, and other digital resources across campus, allowing integration with internal or external systems, and across campus web and mobile applications.</li>
<li><strong>Using Public APIs On Campus - </strong>Putting APIs from the public space, like Twitter and Google Maps to use in classrooms, and even in administrative operations, allowing for the better access to information, and seamless integration with existing campus workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I discussed the different approaches to introducing APis on campus that I've come across so far:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Top-down IT Lead APIs -</strong> School executives take the initiative to make APIs a mandate across all campus operations, acknowledging the benefits APIs can deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Middle-in Faculty Lead APIs -</strong> API efforts led by teachers and other faculty, taking advantage of APIs in their daily work, and hopefully also in the classroom.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom-up Student Lead APIs - </strong>The kids today get online technology, and encouraging them to use APIs in all aspect of their learning will only increase overall digital literacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, we talked about what the best way might be to kick off an actual API platform at OU. There wasn&rsquo;t a clear top-down mandate at OU, so I figured the best place to start was middle-in, as well as bottom-up. We had the middle-in started, with Mark and Adam wanting to see APIs at their institution, but how could we plant the seeds for a bottom-up, student led movement, something that would ultimately get us to where we could demonstrate the value of APIs to campus leaders.</p>
<p>Without any clear place to start, I&rsquo;m exploring the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/">ou.edu website</a> looking for any spreadsheets, CSV files, or obvious tables that could contain some easy data or content that I could easily turn into APIs--pulling ideas from my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">university API building blocks list</a> in my research. Once I have a few targets established, I will then setup a basic developer portal to house all of the early API efforts.</p>
<p>Once I have a basic developer portal, and a couple of data or content APIs, I can then make a plan for what is next. My goal is to just get going, and tell the story about APIs at OU. I&rsquo;d say this is definitely the most basic API effort I&rsquo;ve ever kicked off. We are truly starting at ground zero here, and even though we have the initial desire to have APIs, we don&rsquo;t know exactly the how or what of APIs at OU, but we have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>This is what I love about APIs. Where do I start? What will make the difference? There are no perfect answers, and there is so much work to do, but we have to start somewhere. Hopefully I can find some easy targets for generating the initial APIs, and publish a basic developer portal using Github Pages, and jumpstart the API conversation at OU. Once I do that I will connect back with Mark and Adam, and I&rsquo;m sure by then I will have more ideas of what we can do next when it comes to APIs at the University of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>I get asked about hiring developer advocates, and API developers quite often during the week, but this specific question in my inbox from <a href="http://augmate.com/">Augmate</a>, I found more interesting. I thought their usage of a &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; was a little different, which gave me a reason to provide some fresh thought on the subject.</p>
<p>After reading the question, my first response was going to be: API developer for consuming APIs or providing API?  A thought which I immediately nullified, because any &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; is both. You should never just consume APIs, or just develop APIs, you should always do both&mdash;something that will give you the healthy perspective that I would be looking for when hiring.</p>
<p>Next, there is the matter of which programming language they should be fluent in. I'll leave it to you to test for skills and knowledge that is relevant to your technology stack. Having been a director of IT, and development team manager, the requirements are always different in each environment I've worked in&mdash;I won't pretend there is one HR process to rule them all. You know your environment and needs, and you should develop a line of interview questions that reflects your objectives.</p>
<p>In addition to your regular line of questioning, I would suggest that you also want someone who is language curious, and has played around with many of the popular languages, and not just stuck in one discipline like enterprise (C# &amp; Java), web (PHP, Python, Ruby, JS), mobile (Obj-C), and even someone who plays around with leading edge approaches using Node.js, Scala, and Go. You want to make sure they are proficient in the languages and technologies that speak to your core operations,  but someone who is also aware of what is going elsewhere in the landscape&mdash;making for much more of a pragmatic developer, and reducing dogma to healthier levels.</p>
<p>Beyond the code I&rsquo;m also looking for signs that a developer is well read, and communicative, and the best ways to identify this in 2014 via their blog, Twitter, Stack Exchange and Github accounts. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of scenarios where you want a developer who is better coder than communicator, but when it comes to API design and development, I want someone who is a rabid consumer of other blogs, active communicator, and isn't afraid to publish code in the public sphere. Your API is about communicating with external systems and applications, and if your developer isn't a communicator, will they be able to do this?</p>
<p>To be a modern API developer, you should be fluent in multiple languages, active across relevant communities, via Twitter, and Github, and have an active blog demonstrating your passion for your craft. I know this isn&rsquo;t the perfect formula for you to follow when embarking on your API developer hiring process, but hopefully it gives you some important tools you can use to help find what you are looking for. Additionally, each of the tools I&rsquo;ve referenced have APIs themselves, and maybe its time that our hiring processes moved online, become more interoperable, playing both a synchronous, and asynchronous role in hiring developers, while also keeping pace with where the API space is headed?</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usitc/pub4485.pdf" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usitc/united-states-internation-al-trade-commission-report.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Those of us who live and breathe the API space, throw around a phrase, &ldquo;The API Economy&rdquo;, quite a lot. Referring to the increased usage of APIs across vital industries to drive web and mobile applications, but we as we do often, the phrase is used to describe the future of things, rather than where things actually are. While we are seeing APIs begin to affect global economies, we really don't have much hard evidence that "The API Economy" is a thing beyond our own techno fascination.</p>
<p>With the release of a new report from the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), called <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usitc/pub4485.pdf">Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies</a>, us API geeks are getting the first actual evidence of "The API Economy", with a section in the report called "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces".</p>
<p>The USITC reached out to me several months back, and interviewed me as part of the work on the report, and this week I finally got to see the resulting work. The report is the second of two compiled by committee, with the first report, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usitc/pub4415.pdf">Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 1</a> published last year. The earlier report laid the groundwork for the second report by providing an overview of trends in U.S. digital trade, describing the ways digital trade facilitates trade in other sectors, and approaches for estimating the economic impact of digital trade on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Now with Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 2 the commission is focusing on the value of U.S. digital trade and the potential growth of this trade, providing insight into the broader linkages and contributions of digital trade to the U.S. economy (aka API economy). The report that includes a survey of U.S. firms in industries particularly involved in digital trade, also examines the effects of notable barriers and impediments to digital trade, and presents case studies that examine the importance of digital trade to selected U.S. industries, including the case study: "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It makes me happy to see APIs reflected alongside other aspects of our increasingly digital economy, and not just the good represented, but also many of the challenges we will face. It is my mission to make sure everyone understand that APIs are not good, bad or neutral, and that they are just the digital pipes that are making up the underbelly of this new economic landscape. My goal in using the word &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;, is to highlight best practices around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, not to just get everyone hyped with yet another meaningless tech phrase.</p>
<p>After four years of hard work in the industry, it is good to see things beginning to mature, and go from just something just us alpha API geeks are paying attention to, to something government and industry leaders are taking notice of.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://apistrategyconference.com/images/apistrat-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>We just wrapped up the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">4th edition of @APIStrat in Chicago</a> last week, and once again I&rsquo;m very happy with the way things went, as 400+ folks gathered to discuss APIs. The event had the right tone, and I got the usual flood of comments from attendees, speakers, and sponsors about what a great experience the event was.</p>
<p>I would love to take credit, but all of the responsibility goes to <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> for making it happen. 3Scale takes all the risk, and their rockstar team makes the event a reality&mdash;I just help get folks to the conference, contribute ideas to the schedule, present, and MC as much of the event as I possibly can.</p>
<p>@APIStrat has been helping move forward the conversation in the API space for two years now, starting with <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/">New York</a> and <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/">San Francisco</a> in 2013, and now <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">Chicago</a> in 2014, all made possible because of 3Scale's investment.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The number one priority for 3Scale, when it comes to @APIStrat, is to move the conversation forward, while investing in the API community. This is why the event is a success, setting the tone for the conversation amongst sponsors, speakers, and attendees. I&rsquo;m thankful for being able to to take part in @APIStrat, and look forward to digesting all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">videos from Chicago, which are already on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already announced that the next @APIStrat will be in Berlin, spring 2015, and we are <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/2014/09/24/as-apistrat-chicago-kicks-off-apistrat-europe-and-us-for-2015-are-in-the-works--we-want-your-input/">accepting input on where it should for the fall of 2015</a>. Let me know if there are any topics you&rsquo;d like to see discussed at @APIStrat 2015, and we'll see about getting your ideas into the lineup.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.report/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-report/api-report-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I curate a lot of interesting stories across the API space from my RSS feeds, the Twittersphere, and my overactive email inbox each day. Only a small percentage of these stories ever make it to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">business of API analysis site apievangelist.com</a>, or my <a href="http://apivoice.com">politics of APIs analysis at apivoice.com</a>.</p>
<p>Over the summer, this got me thinking, and while wandering around Detroit after <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft Detroit</a> this last July, Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I were talking about the rapidly expanding API space, and both felt there was a gap in the news reporting for the API sector. <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>&nbsp;(PW)&nbsp;does a good job of providing API news and analysis for the space, but because of my monitoring of the space, I know there is a lot more news that never sees the light of day.</p>
<p>Steve and I both aggreed that PW is the tip of the API news iceberg, and while API Evangelist, and API Voice provide some added analysis, there was no straight news site that showcased all of the news across the thousands of companies doing interesting things in 2014. Beyone PW,&nbsp;<a href="http://apiscene.com/">APIScene</a> and <a href="http://apicodex.3scale.net/content/Welcome">API Codex</a> are aggregating stories from across the blogosphere, providing access to the best stories across the blogosphere, but still do not reflect the wealth of stories I see being published by both API providers, and consumers.</p>
<p><a href="http://api.report/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-report/api-report-news.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Out of this conversation, the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a> was born. The API.Report is a Github Pages hosted API news site, that anyone can post short, concise blog posts that are no more than 500 words, with supporting links to additional sources of information. There are two ways you can post:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Fork and Post to Github -</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-report">entire site runs on Github</a>, and if you understand how Jekyll works you can easily publish your own story to the _posts folder, and submit a pull request to have added to the daily stream of stories. </li>
<li><strong>Email Your Story - </strong>If you don't want to use Github, you can easily email a story, and supporting image to <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a> and I will post the story for you. Stories on Github will get priority, but emails will be processed as I have time.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will take a couple of weeks before the site will get up to a regular pace, as I'm the only one writing for the blog at the moment, but as more writers step up, the number of stories should increase. I&rsquo;m going to play around with a couple of other features, like a list of all companies who are referenced in news stories each week, and rolling out a custom advertising network for the news site, allowing people to purchase monthly advertising slots.</p>
<p>If you want to become an author, or would like to advertise on the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a>, feel free to <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">tweet</a> at me, and I'll get you plugged in. If you have any feedback, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-report/issues">issue management for the site</a>, and I&rsquo;ll work to incorporate your ideas into the site.  While the <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a> is part of the API Evangelist network, I consider it a community site, and would like for you become part of the storytelling for the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1qOp06R"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/clarify/clarify-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on a growing number of video, and voice enabled APIs lately, and one that is continually popping up to the top of my API monitoring list is <a href="http://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.clarify.io/docs/">description Clarify provides on their docs page</a> is pretty concise:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Clarify API provides a RESTful API to extract knowledge from audio and video content</em></blockquote>
<p>Why is Clarify popping up on my list lately? There are a number of things that will cause an API related company to show up on my radar, but Clarify has several things going for it lately:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Shift -</strong> Recently they migrated from being Op3nVoice, which I didn&rsquo;t think wasn't that hard to spell, but I know that many people would have trouble with, to being Clarify&mdash;which is a cleaner brand.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Clarify is an extremely well designed API which employs <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL, and hypermedia JSON format</a> for al API responses.</li>
<li><strong>SDK Writing Guide -</strong> They provide an <a href="https://developer.clarify.io/docs/#sdk-writing-guide">SDK writing guide</a> for anyone looking to develop SDKs for Clarify, making sure they are consistent from language to language.</li>
<li><strong>Story on Helper Libraries -</strong> Clarify produced a great blog post called "<a href="http://clarify.io/blog/spoil-your-users-with-great-helper-libraries-2/">SPOIL your Users with Great Helper Libraries</a>", which I added to my curation, and stories around API management.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">15 separate APIs as part of my voice API research</a>, and <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=video-stack">18 as part of my video API research</a>. These are fast growing spaces, and the problem of delivering indexable meta data alongside audio video is only going to increase, something startups like Clarify is looking to provide an API driven solution for.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> is over, I'm going to take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">video from the conference</a>, and run through <a href="http://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a>, to get a feel for how the API works, and see first-hand the value it adds to my existing audio and video content.</p>
<p>Clarify is a well designed API, and now that they've found their footing with their new brand, I predict Clarify will be one of those high value APIs like Twilio and SendGrid, that we are all talking about, and showcasing when it comes to how to do API right.</p>
<p>Look for more stories on <a href="http://bit.ly/1qOp06R">Clarify</a> as I get time to process the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat</a> content.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/workshops.php"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-101.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on the details of my <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/workshops.php">API 101 workshop</a> with Kirsten Hunter (<a href="https://twitter.com/synedra">@synedra</a>) next week. She is delivering most of the content for the 2 hour workshop, as she has evolved a pretty sophisticated set of API 101 materials. My contribution will be from my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a>, and my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">API trends</a> material, helping people understand the how we got here, and some thoughts on where we are going.</p>
<p><strong>History of APIs</strong><br /> As I continue to make sense of the API space, I'm evolving my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs story</a>, adding and consolidating areas that I think have significantly contributed to the overall growth of the API space. While <a href="http://theapistack.com/">I track on 100+ categories, or business sectors, in which I think APIs are being applied in some interesting ways</a>, I feel these seven areas are the cornerstones of the app, and its underlying API economy.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Commerce</strong> - Beginning with API pioneers like Salesforce, eBay, and Amazon to payment leaders like Stripe, and Paypal.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Teach us how to share, interact in collaborate with Deliciious, Facebook, and Twitter, to more recently Google+.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon forever chagned how we will use APIs</a>, enabling us to go beyond hobby, and actually deploy global infrastructure using web APis.</li>
<li><strong>Geo</strong> - Google Maps brought the resources web and mobile developers would need, and Census, MapBox, and others are pushing forward a valulable stack of geo API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Flickr brought the businesses of APis into the mainstream consciousness, and Instgram, YouTube, and others stream rich media into our worlds via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - Twilio, Sendgrid, and other messaging APIs provide valuable resources for developers, and also show the rest of us API providers how to manage and evangelize your APIs right.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are definitely other valuable API resources that are contributing to the success of the space, these six areas represent the bedrock of the app, and API economy. You can find these areas playing a role in two major channels for delivering applications.</p>
<p><strong>Channels</strong><br /> I do not think we can adequately talk about the history of APIs without discussion the motivations for deploying, and consuming APIs in the categories listed above. Historically there as been two main areas motivating companies to put APIs to work:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web</strong> - Delivering valuable data and content byeond just a single website, and allowing distribution to hundreds, or thousands of websites using APIs is of growing importance in a globally distributed Internet fueled economy.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Mobile is outpacing web, as the number of reason for deploying, and consuming APIs. Simple web APIs are well suited for deliverin gthe resources need to develop mobile applications.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are definitely other motivations for deploying APIs, but when we start labeling something as a definite part of history, I think these areas dominate. In 2014 I think mobile has definitely overtook web as a driving force, but distributed data, content, and other compute resources web still plays an important role.</p>
<p><strong>Trends</strong><br /> At the same moment I&rsquo;m trying to understand the past, I&rsquo;m also working hard to understand where we are going, based upon what companies are up to in the API space. I also track on six other interesting areas, that I&rsquo;m closely watching, adding new players, trying to understand what their bringing to the table, and putting them into buckets I&rsquo;m calling API trends.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">Aggregation</a></strong> - Bringing together several APIs into a single, aggregate endpoint. Example could be bringing together image APIs from Flickr, Instagram, and Facebook into a single resource.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a></strong> - The forward motion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">extract, transform, and load (ETL)</a> into a more cloud-centric environment. IFTTT and Zapier are leading in this new world of moving valuable resources, around the globe, using the open Internet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">Realtime</a></strong> - Some APis require more than just a basic request / response approach, resulting in a variety of real-time technologies from prototcols like XMPP or Web Sockets, to frameworks like Firebase, and Fanout.io.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">Voice / Speech</a> </strong>- Apple's Siri embodies this latest wave of voice enabled APis, providing the sources you need to bridge the physical world of speech to a vast array of digital resources made available via APis.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com">Single Page Apps (SPA)</a> </strong>- Moving forward the web channel, and delivering simple, single page applications using common frameworks, and API resources to deliver data, content, and other digital resources needed for these SPAs.</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) </strong>- Using simple web APIs to deliver and consume information from physical objects, in our homes, businesses, and spread across public and private spaces.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these trends are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">beginning to get baked directly into some SaaS, PaaS, and API platforms I&rsquo;m tracking on</a>. Each of these trends are delivering value in different ways depending on which industry your looking at, such as real-time might be more important to financial APIs over regular business listing APIs. Areas like IoT are already expanding beyond just label into wearables, automobile, and other fast moving, but currently niche areas.</p>
<p><strong>Maturing</strong><br /> Even with the innovation in all of these areas by a handful of tech giants, and the long tail of tech startups, the space is slowly maturing in two key areas, which in the future will become bedrock cornerstones for the entire app and API economies. These areas are slowly maturing, and not moving as fast as some of the other areas I&rsquo;m tracking on, but will be critical to the future of the API economy.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">Government</a></strong> - Federal, state, and city governments are opening up data, and APIs at an increasing pace, making some very valuable resources available to developers. Government APIs will be fuel to the app, and its underlying API economy, in coming years.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">Enterprise</a></strong> - The largest companies in the world are slowly beginning to see the potential of evolving their SOA approach to include an API-centric approach to delivering products and services It will take the enterprise to truly scale the API economy into the next decade.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-chicago/api-strategy-practice-chicago-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that we are only 2-4 years into these layers tot he API economy, and there is a ton of work to do. We need leaders in these space to step up and help evangelize a sensible approach to APIs in their industry, but we also need the rest of the API space to be patient, and also contribute to helping guide government of all sizes, large enterprises, and institutions in understanding the tech, business, and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm biased, because I've been tracking on the API space for a while now, but I&rsquo;m pretty happy to see things maturing, and after 14 years of playing around with web services, and more recently APIs, I feel good that we are moving past the wild west, and beginning to stabilize things a little bit, while still also experimenting with API trends in some pretty exciting (and scary) ways.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/09/19/some-advice-for-the-enterprise-when-beginning-your-api-journey/">Some Advice For The Enterprise When Beginning Your API Journey</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hiking.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm seeing the enterprise wake up to the potential of an API centric approach to doing business, slowly evolving beyond a Service Oriented Architectural (SOA) approach, and trying to understand why APIs are superior for delivering resources to the web, mobile, and Internet of thing (Iot) apps they are delivering, and increasingly depending on. Even though we are clearly in an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">enterprise phase of the API evolution</a>, I&rsquo;m watching many leading enterprise entities struggle with their early API efforts, producing some pretty weak solutions, that developers are not finding useful, and hurting their efforts right out of the gate.</p>
<p>I know that many enterprise API architects will dismiss my advice, because they know better than I do, but I feel compelled to share my thoughts, in hopes that even a handful will be more successful with their API efforts, which I think will also help the overall space as well. When embarking on your API journey, you are going to be handicapped right out of the gate, because as a large enterprise organization, you do not have many of the essential characteristics necessary in your DNA to be successful with APIs, but this is why it will require an API journey, to reprogram your DNA, and better operate on the open Internet.</p>
<p>Before you start planning your APIs, and the supporting developer area, you need to play with other public APIs, to better understand what makes APIs different. I am always amazed at how many enterprise API architects that I engage with, when I ask them what public APIs they have used, admit that they have never used one. They just have heard of many of the common APIs out there, so to prime the API pump, let&rsquo;s hack on a couple of the most popular API solutions out there:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter</a></strong> - Hacking on the Twitter API provides some very important lessons when it comes to API design, as well as developer support.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Github</a></strong> - Github is an essential tool in an API providers toolbox on so may levels, but using their API for managing code is an important experience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a></strong> - Twilio is a god when it comes to API providers, and we all look up to them, so if you aren&rsquo;t familiar make sure and hack together a simple API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not skip this section, you may think you understand how these APIs operate, by visiting their developer areas, and I know you come to the table with a wealth of experience, and this is your handicap. You have a serious amount of technical experience, way more than I do, but what you are missing is an understanding of many of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">business and political building blocks that are making all of this work</a>, ares that you have very little experience within the enterprise.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Simple, Simple, Simple</li>
<li>Begin With API Definition</li>
<li>Interactive Documentation</li>
<li>Self-Service Registration</li>
<li>Play With Service Composition</li>
<li>Telling Meaningful Stories </li>
<li>Showcase  Your Developers</li>
<li>Establish Feedback Loops</li>
<li>Flexible Terms of Service</li>
<li>Invest In Your Developers</li>
<li>Internal Evangelism</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology is part of all of these suggestions, but ultimately APIs represent a new way of doing business that you just aren't used to, and you will have to learn it&mdash;something that will take time. Even once you launch your API, you won&rsquo;t be ready, you will have to learn over time, and this is what the API journey is all about, in addition to the core proposition of making vital company resources available to the public, partners, and internally across the enterprise.</p>
<p>Your biggest challenge, beyond the ones listed above will be what you face internally. Getting developers to use your API resources is tough, getting them to deeply integrate them into applications is even harder, but changing culture at your company and getting the support and resources you will need will be a massive undertaking!</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Up  Change</strong><br /> Your senior leadership will most likely not be on board with an API way of operating, and will need a lot of convincing, and most likely ask you for more &nbsp;evidence of why this will work, before they will give you any resources to embark on your journey. They will want the type of ROI that can kill any API effort before it even gets going, so you will have start small, produce results, and demonstrate the value an API delivers in small, bit-size chunks, week by week. This is not field of dreams, nobody will come once you build it, but this is why you start small, iterate, tell stories, showcase what has been done, and evangelize heavily internally to change senior leaderships view, and win hearts and minds with every integration.</p>
<p><strong>Top Down Change</strong><br /> Even if you have the luxury of having the buy-in of senior leadership, which is extremely unusual, this doesn't mean that your API effort will be a gravy train. Chances are you will hit obstacles, and resistance all along the way. All the advice listed above is meant for your public, and partner audience, but also needs to target your senior, and mid-level management. If you don't have the buy in of the people in the trenches, your API efforts will stumble, and probably fail. The growing number of reasons API fail, are not technical. APIs fail because they do not deliver the value developers actually need, and fail to get the internal change needed to maintain the resources you will need to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>The Enterprise In Age Of Internet</strong><br /> APIs are not just about the enterprise exposing technical endpoints that provide access to your vital resources, and giving you the control you need to govern the usage of these resources. APIs are about the enterprise learning to operate in the age of the Internet, a world that is much more open, global, and distributed, requiring a different approach to business that is about investing in innovation, and less about governance and control. The reason you are probably looking at APIs, is the desire to be more agile, nimble, and deliver web, mobile, and Iot applications faster, better, and cheaper than your competitor&mdash;something that takes a shift from your legacy approaches, and slowly shift your culture to reflect the Internet.</p>
<p>You will not be able to master plan your API strategy, and ensure success. You will need to open up a simple, useful API developer area, with a handful of valuable API resources that can be applied internal, bring value to your partners, and quite possibly the public, and get the wheels of change rolling forward. Only then will then will you start to understand the world of APIs, and if you neglect the simplicity, storytelling, showcasing, and other critical elements needed to develop the feedback loops that are necessary to keep the wheels rolling, you will doom your efforts. APIs don&rsquo;t fail because they are public, or not what is relevant, they fail because you don't see the elements that make them successful, and lack the culture necessary to be an API driven company&mdash;get started making the change that will give your organization the tools it needs to not just be competitive, but lead in the Internet age.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-20.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://swagger.io/">machine readable API definition format Swagger</a>, just rolled over to version 2.0. I use Swagger to describe all of my APIs, and I largely associate the creator of Swagger, <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a> for kicking off this latest renaissance in defining APIs in a way that provides us with a machine readable vocabulary to talk about all of these valuable resoures that we are exposing via APIs.</p>
<p>There are other formats out there, older ones like WADL, and more recent ones like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, but Swagger was the one that revived this movement, helping us create ways for generating important elements throughout the API lifecycle, from mock interfaces in the design process, to testing and monitoring of product APIs.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't much of the details of what has changed from version 1.0 to 2.0, except that with version 2.0 you can use YAML to describe your API, just like competitor RAML, or markdown as with API Blueprint. The common assumption is that by using YAML and Markdown, even non-programmers will be able to communicate around APIs without having to navigate JSON&mdash;something I'm not entirely sold on, but will keeping looking for signs of in the wild</p>
<p>When it comes to the rubber meeting the road, I think Swagger has an advantage because of the amount of adoption, and the tooling available in the community. Swagger has a pretty significant lead when it comes to language libraries, both server and client side, as well as converters, and other integration tooling you will need. There are some areas like an API design editor, where Swagger has been playing catch-up, but overall the community has a pretty significant lead from my vantage point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working to convert all of my Swagger files from version 1.3 to 2.0, then I'm sure I will have more thoughts about the latest version, once I get down into the weeds, but for now I&rsquo;m just happy to see the focus Wordnik is giving <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and that it is continuing to mature in the way that it has, providing us with a much needed way to describe and communicate around APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I'm preparing for a talk at the <a href="http://sgip.org/2014-SGIP-Fall-Conference">The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel Second Annual Conference</a>, in Nashville Tennessee, specifically participating on a panel titled "Using Power Grid Open Data Initiatives". I accepted the request to go speak as part of my wider work on the Green Button iniative out of The White House, DOE, NIST, and the GSA. I was asked to provide some thoughts on how to help move the Green Button efforts forward earlier this winter, and again in the spring, and just haven't had the bandwidth to give any energy, so I saw this as a great opportunity to make some time as part of this panel.</p>
<p>In May, The White House, 18F, some Presidential Innovation Fellows, and myself were asked to move the Green Button ball forward, resulting in a new website, and developer area that is all hosted on Github. I'm bummed I wasn't able to make time to participate, but now I have been able to go through the new site, and developer area, and gather my thoughts on where we could go next with the effort.</p>
<p>Before we get started, lets start with the basics, what is Green Button? Nick Sinai (<a href="https://twitter.com/NickSinai">@NickSinai</a>), Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>Green Button is a policy idea.  It's the notion that customers &ndash; residential, commercial, industrial, and yes, government customers of energy &ndash; ought to get access to their own energy data, in a standard digital format.  The Administration has articulated this several times, in a number of Administration energy, climate, and smart grid policy documents.  The government is a big customer of energy, and we deserve our own energy usage and price data.</p>
<p>Green Button is also a public-private initiative, in response to a 2011 White House call to action.  The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA have been collaborating with the utility and tech industries on this growing effort for a few years now.  The White House has been convening industry and celebrating its progress. NIST has been supporting industry on development of the standard, DOE has been working with utilities, and GSA has been an early adopter.</p>
<p>Finally, Green Button is an actual data standard, for formatting and transferring energy usage and price data.  This standard can be implemented in both utility and non-utility contexts.  Customers can manually download or upload a file formatted in the standard, and IT systems can automatically transfer data between them using the standard.</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>The White House, 18F, and fellow PIFs, have done a great job organizing everything under a single, Github pages site, at <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. The site is a big improvement over what was there before, and moves us closer to solving the fragmentation in the Green Button effort, which I believe is the fundamental issue that is holding it back from being fully realized. Green Button is a big vision, and it is going to take some serious effort to bring together all of the industry, and 3rd party efforts, and most importantly getting individual consumers on-board with taking control over their own energy data.</p>
<p>To help organize my thoughts on how we can move Green Button forward, something I will be discussing on stage in Nashville, I wanted to walk through the site, and take a snapshot of where we are at, then work on a strategy for what is needed to keep the momentum we already have moving forward. Green Button is an extremely critical effort in not just   empowering individuals and institutions to take control over their energy data, but also for the overall health of the energy sector, and whether the utility companies can see it or not, open data and APIs will be central to their continued success. So as I do with other areas, let's walk through where we are at currently with Green Button, to help prime the discussion about where we should go.</p>
<p><strong>First Impressions</strong><br /> When you land on the <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> site, it looks like a modern, clean website effort, with a simple tagline and meaningful image to help you understand what Green Button is all about. The first description is "Helping You Find and Use Your Energy Data", and then when you scroll down you see an answer to the question What is Green Button? -- "Green Button is a secure way to get your energy usage information electronically. I like the concise messaging, but it is solely focused on the consumer, and leaves out the commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations listed on the "use" page. I know this all revolves around energy data, but when you land on site, you should have the site speak to you, no matter who you are.</p>
<p>I think the "use" page does a great job in breaking down who the target audience is, but the first impression doesn't reflect this, and I don't think there is any path for these users to follow, once you do find yourself on <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. As a data custodian, or 3rd party developer, I think the build or developer page will quickly speak to you, but as a consumer, you are quickly dropped from the focus of the site and will be completely lost in the rich information that is available. To on-board each user properly, we will need to begin to carve out paths for each user, one that start with a meaningful first impression off of the home page, then puts them on a path that leads them twoard action and the relevant resources they will need, depending on their role.</p>
<p><strong>Learn About Green Button</strong><br /> I really like the learn page for Green Button. It is clean, simple, informative, and not overwhelming for me to learn about what Green Button is, from any perspectives. My only suggestions for next steps is that we begin massaging some of the rich content available under "library", and link to specific learning opportunities from this page. Each summary should provide users with links to follow, taking them to the detail they will need to fully understand each aspect of Green Button as it pertains to their position. However, with that said it is critical to keep this page a simple overview of Green Button, and make it an easy doorway to the world of energy data.</p>
<p><strong>Using Green Button</strong><br /> As I said above, the "use" section provides a nice overview of who should be using Green Button, with sections focusing on commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations, as well residential consumers. What is needed for each of these sections, is a clear call to action, taking you to another page that is a "getting started" specifically targeting your role in the Green Button movement. I don't think the lack of this, is a deficiency of what is currently there, it is just the next logical step for evolving this page to better onboard users, now that these roles are better defined.</p>
<p><strong>The Green Button Community</strong><br /> This is the first time I've seen the Green Button community reflected on a single page like this, and is exactly what is needed to help reduce the fragmentation currently present across the community. Presenting the four groups in this way, complete with links to their sites, and relevant contact information to get involved, is very important for bringing together the community. My only critique is that the page could use a little more layout love, formatting, logos, and some polish to keep it looking as good as the rest of the site&mdash;nothing major.  Eventually it would also be nice to have some sort of stream of activity across all of these efforts, aggregated here. I'm not sure how this would occur, as the groups are all using different ways to keep members informed, but something should be considered, further bringing together the community.</p>
<p><strong>Build With Green Button</strong><br /> The developers section probably needs the most help right now, and I'm not 100% sure of how to make more coherent. It is a little redundant and circular, and its called "build" on home page, and "developers" in the top navigation, something that should be consistent. The RESTful APIs is represented twice, and i see glimpses of trying to provide separate information for data stewards, and 3rd party developers. Along with the development of specific paths for different target users, this needs to be reworked, and woven into those efforts, but I do like the focus on the open source nature of Green Button. The first time I landed on Green Button, I didn't fully grasp that it was an open source API that anyone can deploy, and that the sandbox version that is in operation is just a demo, something that I think we need to make fully clear to users of all types.</p>
<p>We have a big challenge ahead when it comes to helping data custodians understand what is possible, and hopefully we can help spur 3rd party developers in not just build around existing Green Button code, but also work to develop new versions in other languages, as well as specific cloud offerings on maybe Amazon or Heroku. The sky is the limit when it comes to developing, and building Green Button solutions, both server and client side, and we need to make the separation as clear as possible. It will take some serious architectural vision to help bridge what code is currently available for Green Button, and stimulate commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations in understanding what is possible, and incentivize them to deliver solutions that are quickly deployable across the cloud landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Library</strong><br /> As with the "learn" and "use" sections of the site, the current library section was a great step forward in bringing together the wealth of current resources available to support Green Button efforts. What is needed now is just the refinement of what is there, making it easier to access, and learn from, while also making sure that resources are appropriately grouped into buckets targeting each of the Green Button user groups. As I'm working through the the library of materials, I can see there are some seriously rich resource available, but there is a lot of disconnect between them because they are designed, developed and deployed to support different goals, by different authors&mdash;we need to establish some consistency between them.</p>
<p>Right now the library is very much a list of resources, and it would be nice to make sure it truly is a library that is organized, indexable, and is easy to navigate. Having all of these resources in a single location is an excellent start, but how do we start refining them, and making them much more usable by all users? Documents should have a consistent document formats, videos should have single Youtube (or other) channel, and much more. All of this would make it much more likely that these resources would be explored, an consumed by a wider audience, beyond just the alpha geek crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Testing Tools</strong><br /> I'm happy to see the Green Button testing tool here, but ultimately it feels like one tool, that should be in a toolbox. Right now it is its own top level navigation item, and I don't think a single tool should be elevated to this level. I would change this to tools, and make the testing tool the one item in the toolbox right now, and I'm sure there are others we can quickly add to the toolbox as well. As with other areas, we should break down the toolbox by user group, making sure consumers easily find what they need, as well as utility providers, 3rd party developers and the other user groups.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started With Green Button</strong><br /> I was excited to see the Getting Started button, until I realized it was just an email address. ;-(  That isn't getting started, it is sending an email. Getting started should be prominent, and truly provide users with easy paths to well...get started. If you are data custodian, utility, or energy provider, you should have a simple page that explains how to get started, in a self-service way&mdash;no email needed. Separately, there should be contact information for Green Button, something that hopefully includes much more than just an email address, with no face and personality behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging Where We Are</strong><br /> That is a quick walkthrough of where things are at with <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>, and in my opinion, things have come a long ways from what I was seeing spread across the Green Button landscape this last winter. Most importantly it is aggregating the community, developer, and the wealth of other resources into a library, which is a very critical step to continue moving Green Button forward. In my opinion the v1 tech of Green Button tech is in place, it is just lacking all the refinement, storytelling, and relationship building that is necessary to move Green Button into the consciousness of utility companies, 3rd party developers, and the average, everyday energy consumer&mdash;so how do we do this?</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Needs A Champion</strong><br /> First, before we get into any of the nuts and bolts of what we can do to keep <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> rolling forward, the project is going to need a champion. I think The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA are doing an amazing job of making sure things move forward, but <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> needs someone who is super passionate about energy data, APIs, understands the energy industry, and wants to put in the hours necessary to refine the information currently available, build relationships, and generate new content that will bring in new players. This role isn't some cushy job that you will get a regular paycheck for, but for the right person, I think it could be pretty lucrative, if you get creative in piecing together sponsorship and support from industry players, organizations, and worked hard on the grant writing front. Essentially you need The API Evangelist, for energy data and APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Who's offering Green Button?</strong><br /> I think the first place to start is visible right on the home page, and looking at who is already putting Green Button data to work. I see 50+ entities who are already putting Green Button to work, so who are these people, and how can we showcase what they are up to.  There are some meaningful implementations here, and I know there is some great material here to demonstrate the power, and importance of Green Button, and help spark the imagination of new visitors.  Green Button has traction, the problem is not enough people know about it, or have the imagination to understand how it is being used. Let's take the time to showcase this, and create some really great content that will make the site more educational. This is something that can be led by the Green Button evangelist I talk about above, but is also something I think the community should also contribute to. I'm going to carve out some time to reach out to some of the providers listed, and see if i can showcase how they are putting Green Button to work, and generate more detail, and content that can be contributed to <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. Do you want to help?</p>
<p><strong>Showcase Of How Green Button Is Used</strong><br /> Building on the work above, we need a place to showcase how Green Button is being put to use. I'm not sure this should be a top level navigation item, but if we group each entry in the showcase, by the type of user, I think we can make it one stop of the path each user takes, as they learn about Green Button. As each commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations, and individual energy users is learning about Green Button, they should also be exposed to examples of other similar individuals or companies like them that are already putting Green Button to work. This will go a long way in helping people see the potential of Green Button, and begin the journey of putting it to work across the energy industry landscape in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>Blog For Bringing Green Button To Life</strong><br /> The <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> site needs a blog. This is something that will be difficult without a champion to keep alive, but a blog is going to be essential in bringing the site to life, helping share stories about the value Green Button is bringing to companies, organizations, institutions, and most importantly the average consumer. Without a blog, any developer community will not have a soul, or a personality, and it will be difficult to convince anyone that someone is home, and that they should trust and care about Green Button. I think a blog could easily be crowdsourced, allowing passionate folks like myself to post, as well as other organizations, companies, and key stakeholders to post relevant stories, that will give the site a heartbeat. A blog will be central to any of the suggestions I will have to help move things forward, and give <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> a personality that will go a long way in building trust amongst users, and across the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Giving Some Coherence To The Developers Section</strong><br /> The developer section of <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> will be essential to scaling the effort, and right now the page is a little all over the place, and will take some significant effort to simplify, make usable, and bring the wealth of developer resources into focus. This will take some serious work, by someone who is a developer, architect, and can make actually organize everything into something that easily on-boards data custodians, and 3rd party developers with as little friction as possible. You have to walk them through the wealth of tooling that is already available, show them what is possible, and then give them the downloads they need to get things working in their world.</p>
<p>There is also a need for some other additional tooling, some of the current solutions are very enterprise oriented, and I think with some encouragement, providers could replicate Green Button tooling in other languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, and other platforms that will encourage rapid adoption by other providers. There also needs to be some ways to help people quickly bring Green Button to life using cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, Google, Azure and other platforms that companies and individuals are already depending on.</p>
<p>The developer section is something that will take some deep thinking, hacking, and architectural magic from the champion, and Green Button evangelist. They will have to look at it through the eyes of each of the data custodians, and 3rd party developers who are already putting Green Button to use, and try to deliver things in a way that will speak to this, as well as potentially other new users. This type of work is not easy, and takes some serious effort, something you can't expect to happen overnight. However, if it is done right this can really help scale the number of Green Button implementations in the wild, and take things to the next level much quicker.</p>
<p><strong>Turning The Library Into A Consistent Resource</strong><br /> I am happy to see all of the rich Green Button resources brought into a single location, but I wouldn't call it quite a library yet. It is a listing of valuable resources, that aren't really organized in a way that speaks to the different Green Button users, and are not consistent in form because they come from different sources. Even with this said, their is a wealth of resources available there, and with some work you could build a really nice, interactive library that can help educate users on how to put Green Button to work. Similar to the showcase, once the library is organized, and grouped by target user, I think the library can be a stop on the path that each user takes, showing them exactly the resources they need in the library to help onboard them properly.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Paths For Green Button Users</strong><br /> As I discussed above, each user needs a path they can take from the "use" page to begin their journey. Right now the "use" page is a dead end, where it should actually be a call to action, providing each visitor the chance to take a path through the site that speaks to them, without forcing them to have to wade through the wealth of resources that are currently there. From the "use" page, each user can be taken to a showcase of other implementations from similar users, then depending on their role, could be walk through other sections of the site, landing in the library, presenting with exactly what they need to get going. I'm not exactly sure what the user experience will be on these new paths, but I think once we profile the existing uses of Green Button, and unwind the developer and library resources, a pretty orderly route can be established for each user group. These paths will go a long way to onboard users in a fraction of the time, and maximize the potential reach, and scale of the platform&mdash;adding more implementations to the Green Button platform, and scaling the audience with each new user.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Green Button From Site to Community</strong><br /> I will stop here. I think this is all that should be focused on for now, when it comes to moving Green Button forward. It is important to not bite off too much, and make sure we can be successful in moving things forward, and not make things more complex. The goal is to simplify what we have, now that we have everything organized into a single site, and begin the process of bringing <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> to life. With someone at the helm, an active blog, and a more coherent focus on each user group, I think that things will start picking up steam, and with more outreach, and involvement with existing Green Button implementations, and the existing Green Button community, we can move <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> from being just a site, and put it on its way to becoming a community.</p>
<p>It is important that Green Button evolves to become a community. It cannot remain just a government initiative. Green Button has to be a vibrant community that commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, energy efficiency organizations, and individual energy users are all part of, otherwise it will always remain just something being pushed from the top down. Green Button has to be also owned by the individual energy users, and institutions, providing essential bottom up momentum to match the energy given from the top by the federal government partners&mdash;without this the energy industry will never buy in.</p>
<p>Profiling the existing Green Button implementations, and making the site speak to each of the user groups will be important for taking things to the next step. This process will help communicate to a next generation of implementations what is possible, and through regular showcasing and storytelling we can move Green Button beyond just a policy idea, and initiative from government, or just a technical data standard, and transform it into something that is a default part of the energy industry. In this new world, energy users will be used to having control over their data, and entirely new markets will be established delivering services to energy consumers, within this new space.</p>
<p>All the parts and pieces are there, and much like last round of work on the <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>&nbsp;site brought all these resources together, we need to figure out how to bring the energy industry together and show them the potential of Green Button data and APIs. We need to make sure energy consumers, both individual and institutional, understand the importance of having control over their energy data, and show data custodians that this is the future of doing business in the energy space. Once we can achieve this, Green Button will take on a life of its own, driven not just by the government, or even the utility providers, but by the energy of 3rd party companies who are delivering meaningful solutions for institutional, organizational, and individual energy consumers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The conversation around open data and APIs in government is dominated by talk of making resources available to the public, which is a good thing, but is only 1/3 of the discussion that should be occurring amongst gov-focused techies, as well as the project owners, and data stewards who are managing these vital public resources across federal agencies.</p>
<p>APIs are not just deployed to support public access to resources, this has just been the trend that is getting all the headlines, and there is still lot of value to be realized when putting APIs to work within an agency, opening up access to data, content, and other digital resources, increasing efficiency agency-wide using Internet technology. The best example of this in action is out of the private sector from Amazon, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">story of the important role internal APIs have played in the company's success</a>, across internal operations, but also in the public as a commerce, and a cloud computing leader.</p>
<p>To help you relate to the idea of an internal API, think of all the times you've had to ask IT for access to something from a database, like a list of facility locations, government programs, or maybe an employee directory. You have to find out where the source of these resources are, track down the right contact information, then put in a request to get a copy of the data or content you are looking for. Often times even once you get the data dump, it could be the wrong information, or missing what you are needing, requiring you to go back, yet again, to get what you are looking for--not very efficient, and also extremely frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Access To The Resources You Need</strong><br /> When you open up data or content via an API, despite common belief, you aren't necessarily making the information available to anyone on the open Internet, you are just using Internet technology to make it accessible. In some cases, you may publish the fact that the information is available in a public location, but can require that only internal staff has access to it. Regardless of exactly how you approach, the information, and registration for access of an API should always be available in a self-service way, allowing anyone to discover, and gain access without requesting permission from IT, or having to hunt down the source. In a perfect API world every agency will have a central API area where anyone can find all the resources available across the agency, eliminating many of the bottlenecks that commonly exist across government.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Are Not Just For Developers</strong><br /> Developers would like to think APIs are just for them, but this is a reflection of the historic power and control IT has wielded when controlling access to databases, file stores, and other digital resources that are used across government agencies. Sure, APIs require knowing how to access the resource, and potentially the ability to write code that will pull, parse, and publish information to where it is needed, but APIs can just as easily be connected to spreadsheets, documents, and have ready to go HTML listings, details, and other fully functional widgets. This approach to API consumption has been pioneered by private sector technology companies, allowing tech savvy users to reverse engineer API access or put to use as is&mdash;no development experience necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Data And Content Kept Up To Date In Realtime</strong><br /> Without APIs, when you finally do get the list of facilities, programs or contacts from IT, it might already be out of date. If you are requiring IT to provide a dump of data in XML, CSV, spreadsheet or other format, it is just that&mdash;a dump. Any changes made in the central database will not be reflected in your dump, rendering your work obsolete, and potentially turning it from information, to misinformation. APIs allow you to keep a connection between the information source, and your web and mobile application, spreadsheet or other system, up to date in realtime. Even if updating your project is manual, at least you have a realtime connection to the original source that you can use to update as you dictate, not based on only when you can get &nbsp;the IT resources to help.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics For Data And Content Owners On Who Is Using</strong><br /> APIs are not just about getting users access to the data and content they need in their projects, it goes both ways, and can provide a wealth of valuable information to the database administrator, content owner, and data steward who is in charge of the vital government resource. With everyone accessing your resources via an API, you have a realtime pulse on who has access to your resources and rich details on how they are using it. Do you know who is consuming your digital resources today? It is likely you do not, and this new approach using web APIs come with built in tools for truly understanding who has access, while also allowing for access in realtime without demanding extra time and attention, but when you are ready you can audit and understand how these resources are actually being put to use across an agency.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking Beyond Public APIs At Your Agency</strong><br /> Understanding that APIs are much more than just making data available to public developers is extremely important, and can transform how your agency works. Amazon managed to internalize APIs in such a way that changed not just how they do business when it came to online commerce on Amazon.com, but transformed the way we all do business on the Internet. Imagine if a federal agency could see APIs the same, and allow the accessing of internal resources in a similar way, it could entirely change how government services are delivered.</p>
<p>If all digital resources at an agency could be made available via APIs, it has the potential dramatically shift how agencies operate. Right now most agencies already have a wealth of internal web services that somewhat resemble modern web APis, the problem is they are designed by, and deployed for IT and developer stakeholders, not everyone else in the organization. The significant difference between web service and APIs is that APIs use Internet technologies to make data and content available in a very simple way, that if bundled with the right building blocks can make vital resources accessible to anyone across the agency.</p>
<p>IT and developers are fine with just publishing an API and calling it good, as they know how to access these APis without assistance. With just a little more thought, and work, connectors, widgets, and spreadsheet tools can make resources much more widely available across an organization, department and even agency-wide. Undoubtedly it will take a lot of work to shift how IT makes resources available, but there are also tools to help content owners, and data stewards to deploy and consume their own APIs. There are wealth of database, and <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">spreadsheet to API solutions</a> available, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">content management system (CMS) to API solutions for common platforms like Drupal and Wordpress</a>. Ideally IT gets on board with an API centric vision, but it isn't a requirement in 2014, where waves of web APIs are emerging providing access to the resource you need to solve the problems you face in your everyday world, with or without IT being involved.</p>

<p>I am working on a white paper for a big enterprise provider who is looking to deliver solutions in the API space. At their request I&rsquo;ve gone through six industries and looked for companies who have over 5k employees and are doing interesting things with APIs--a request that produced some great research for the white paper, as well as for stories here on API Evangelist.</p>
<p>It can be hard to find large enterprise organizations who are doing full blown "API", because honestly many of them just do not get it yet. Sure I can find many that are doing web services, and dabbling with APIs, but it can be downright difficult to find examples of companies that I would showcase as a healthy API patterns.</p>
<p>Doing this research I was looking more for examples of anything &ldquo;API&rdquo; happening, any bare-bones, positive signals that could be emulated, and try and demonstrate what huge opportunities there are in these industries, for anyone who could do it right. I got my first draft ready, and submitted for review, and jumped on a call to discuss.</p>
<p>Everything looked great in the paper, except senior leadership said there was a lack of detail demonstrating how developers were building applications on these enterprise public APIs, They would need more hard examples of how these large company APIs were being used, how this benefited the API provider, and some hard numbers of usage, revenue, showing how business models, products and services were being developed.</p>
<p>After smiling, I told them I could guarantee that most of these providers themselves don't have that detail, and are still working to figure this out. Your request is exactly why we do APIs, and begin to establish an external R&amp;D lab for providing answers, in realtime. Even if some of the more mature providers have this information, I can guarantee they aren't going to share it publicly. Maybe if they were a startup, this type of sharing might be in their DNA, but not the enterprise, sorry.</p>
<p>These types of questions are what I got from government agencies (and still get) two years ago after President Obama mandated that all federal agencies go machine readable by default. They wanted to see the ROI from other agencies doing APIs, before they'd do it too. I wish I had all the answers to make risk averse government agencies, institutions, and enterprise feel warm and fuzzy about APIs, but just like it has taken all of us over two years to get any results in the federal government, and four years for me in the wider API space. It is going to take a lot of hard work before you will see those numbers, and if you require these before you get your feet wet, I can guarantee the numbers will be generated by your competitors before you do.</p>
<p>You have to be a little adventurous, agile, and nimble to operate in this realm. If you aren&rsquo;t, I recommend starting with some of the low hanging, safer fruit in your company, and just get started, because then you can hopefully learn from the API process. Once you begin your journey you start to see cultural benefits of an API-centric focus&mdash;otherwise you can sit back and watch a new wave of startups and your existing competition do it for you.</p>

<p>I used to work hard to write blog posts on API Evangelist that would have broad appeal with the Hacker News community, and at first I didn't have any luck, after trying to engage with readers on posts, I found myself blacklisted, where nothing I submitted showed up. I lived in some kind parallel universe, all because I argued with a couple influential HN users, who didn't like what I had to offer.</p>
<p>I started a new account for API Evangelist, and began playing the game with a little different approach. I didn't engage with users, and wrote posts with titles that would bring in readers, kept things short and superficial, and had some front-page exposure, which would result in thousands of pageviews, and then would dissipate. This type of storytelling ever really turned into meaningful traffic, an engaged audience, conversations, or brought any value to my overall mission.</p>
<p>Early last year I stopped posting to HN, only occasionally posted a story, but never really used it in the same way that I had before. I was worried my traffic would be hurt, but I went back to work, trying to write meaningful posts, that brought value to my target audience, and supported my mission. In the last year and a half, I've seen my sustained monthly traffic go from 500 page views a day to almost 2000 a day, all by just my sticking to my mission.</p>
<p>The audience that does visit my blog, for the most part engages with me, shares posts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other channels, and I see much of what I write echoed on other blogs, and in conversations I see on social media, and in person at events. This approach to building my audience, and ultimately traffic to my site has been very healthy in helping me obtain my objectives. My goal is not pageviews for advertising sake, it is to build an awareness in the average business person, and the everyday individual, about the importance of APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post because see echoes of HN in another blog DZone, which I don&rsquo;t actually syndicate to, but because of the history behind my kin lane.com blog, some of my posts still get hand selected by the DZone staff, and syndicated to the blog. Many of these blog posts get some pretty good comment activity, and the other week a blog post I wrote on Google&rsquo;s hiring process, which got quite a bit of comments, including some pretty trollish ones.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of feeding the trolls, something I don't usually do, but I can&rsquo;t help myself occasionally, and it made me think of this same illness that many advertising driven technology sites possess. I&rsquo;m so happy to have my blog, something I know that reaches a wide range of people, not just because of the page views, but also because of the online and in-person feedback I get. The alpha geek crowd is not my audience, and I don't care what they think about what I&rsquo;m saying, but the trollish comments still get to me sometimes. i quickly shrug them off, but writing about these emotions is one way I do that&mdash;resulting in this post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to have a mission driven blog, that goes beyond monetization through advertising. My audience may be small compared to DZone or Hacker News, and what I do may not matter to a lot of their users, but at least I have purpose that involves helping educate people, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to tell people how stupid they are, and that what they do is worthless. I can&rsquo;t imagine being so lost, that doing that makes you feel better. It makes me sad, but then I get back to work, and move on, keeping on with my mission.</p>

<p>In 2014 we are making significant progress in deploying APIs in support of city operations, but we still have so much more work ahead of us when it comes to making public resources available. You can find a dedicated developer area full of data sets, and APIs, in most major US cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and many more, but what else can we do to really pick up the momentum and quality?</p>
<p><strong>Standardizing API Design Practices</strong><br /> APIs are not that difficult to design with the right education, and experience. Developers who work on city contracts, or are employed by the city should all be taught common web API design practices, and be exposed to modern API design tooling like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a>. Even with this type of education, there will still be many differences between city deployments based upon needs, and tactics, but a little training could go a long way to make city operations more streamlined.</p>
<p><strong>Open Solutions For API Deployment</strong><br />There are a lot of common approaches to delivering city services, which means there should also a be a number of ways to provide standardized, open solutions for deploying APIs that support city operations. There should be a wealth of open source, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/22/wordpress-style-api-modules-for-government/">Wordpress like solutions for deploying APIs in support of government operations.</a> Sometimes connecting to legacy systems is just to much work, and deploying a simple, standalone solution, then syncing using data dumps or directly with backbend system might be more fruitful.</p>
<p><strong>Common API Management Vision</strong><br />I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the standard approach to deploying city developer areas, and delivering data sets, and APIs, but in reality this is the result of the hard work of <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, one of the API management providers dedicated to the government space. I think Socrata, and the other vendors out there are definitely one piece of the puzzle for managing APIs for city operations, but I also think we need other competing, open solutions similar to <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a> which is being used across the federal government.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling Across Cities</strong><br />When it comes to helping cities better serve their citizens, and save money along the way, I can&rsquo;t think of a better place to start than by providing common, open source tools for delivering web, and mobile applications on top of city data and APIs. We have to stop re-inventing the wheel for each city when it comes to developing common apps, city needs are going to be very similar across cities--just take a look at solutions like <a href="http://www.open311.org/">Open311</a>, and the let&rsquo;s get to work on delivering similiar solutions for every part of city operations.</p>
<p>There is no reason each city should have to go at it alone when it comes to designing, deploying, managing, evangelizing, and putting APIs to work across city operations. We should have standard data models, API definitions, and a wealth of open source tools for cities to put to work.</p>
<p>I don't see APIs as the solution for all cities problems, but I do think that APIs should be common practice for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> cities. Every city should be publishing all of their data and content in machine readable way, without causing employees any extra work&mdash;it should just be part of normal operations.</p>
<p>In the future, all cities will have standard APIs across all cities, and common open source solutions that can be put to work serving citizens in all aspects of city operations. This is how we are going to empower our cities to more with less, and make governing a more inclusive for everyone.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I saw another story about whether or not public APIs are going away, which is another story in a fairly long line of stories I&rsquo;m seeing lately from enterprise outlets about whether or not the demise of Netflix, ESPN, and now Aetna means public APIs are a bad idea, unsustainable and now will be going away&mdash;proving enterprise API architects right that an SOA is the way to go.</p>
<p>If you are looking at the bigger API picture, the answer to this question is clearly no. Amazon, Salesforce, Twilio, and many other public APIs with straightforward business models are doing just fine. Just because a handful of companies who never quite had a business model, and never really gave their API efforts &nbsp;the resources they needed to be successful, doesn't mean that public APIs are a bad idea.</p>
<p>Looking through my list of 2500+ APIs I track on, I can point to numerous other APIs that are about to shutter, which has nothing to do with the fact that they are public, and everything to do with not having the right business and political building blocks for their API. I&rsquo;m sorry if you are just in the game to exploit developers and get them to build things for your company, you can&rsquo;t be exploitative in this game and last, developers smell that shit a mile away--you have to give, just as much as receive.</p>
<p>To be successful when it comes to APIs, you can't just launch an API, spend 100K on a popular API management solution, hire one guy (you know it, you hired a guy), and expect miracles within a couple months. It just doesn't work that way. APIs take a lot more grassroots building of an evangelist team, investment in a lot of projects, telling of many meaningful stories, and going to many conferences, Meetups, and events before anyone will know you exist, let alone building anything on your APIs.</p>
<p>Public APIs being a failure is something the enterprise wants you to believe so they can sell you their SOA solutions disguised as API ones, Public APIs disappearing is more about the business and politics of APIs, and less about the technology and whether something is publicly available or not. If you don't have the company culture to invest in transparency, outreach, and providing meaningful resources that developers will need to be successful, you will fail in the public API game, so give up now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about how the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">open source API search engine APIs.io</a> can be deployed as an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/an-apisjson-collection-of-api-resources-across-your-public-partner-or-internal-resources/">internal API search engine</a>, as well as for public API discovery in the past. One aspect of this approach that I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, is that the search engine doesn&rsquo;t just return APIs in the search results, it can <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/">provide access to supporting building blocks</a> as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a> doesn't just provide a machine readable way to describe, and index your APIs, it also provides a way to describe the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that support your APIs like code samples, SDKs</a>, and other things API consumers will need when putting APIs to work for them.</p>
<p>The indexing of these API support elements really starts to benefit company operations when you also bundle tools for non-developers alongside internal APIs, like spreadsheet connectors, <a href="http://d3.js">d3.js visualizations</a> built on top of APIs, and other elements that any user can reverse engineer, or just put to work immediately--no configuration necessary.</p>
<p>Imagine if your internal staff could access any digital resources across the company, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">similar to what Amazon has done internally</a>, and not just find the API driven resources they need, but also the tools they need to apply them in their jobs. This is where APIs started getting really powerful, allowing anyone at your company to put APIs to work and get their jobs done in a self-service way, with a limited amount of IT resources required.</p>

<p>I get a lot of folks who engage me about the API space, most of them are API providers, many are focused on API consumption, with only just a small few are looking the evangelism and analyst side of things. As far as I know I&rsquo;m the only individual out there looking at all industries, across all of these areas, working hard to understand how APIs are being applied across the board.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always keeping an eye out for talent that is also working to expand their knowledge in the same way, but as the API universe expands I think this is going to be increasingly difficult, and I think we are going to start needing more analysts who focus within specific domains, and business sectors.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching Mark Silverberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/skram">@skram</a>) over at <a href="http://SocialHealthInsights.com">SocialHealthInsights.com</a>, and is what I&rsquo;d considered to be an API expert when it comes to the convergence of healthcare and APIs.</p>
<p>Mark is always hacking on interesting things related to healthcare, and pushing the envelope when it comes to healthcare APIs, by not just hacking on healthcare APIs, but also developing apps for Google Glass. Mark has developed his expertise in a similar way as I do, by hacking, telling stories, and consulting--which I think is the best way to develop yourself as an API expert.</p>
<p>Earlier this spring the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">FDA was preparing their new developer area</a>, including the release of a handful of APIs like the drug labeling and adverse effects APis, and a handful of us with DC connections that were on the backchannel, providing feedback for the FDA during this beta period. Unfortunately I was too busy traveling to participate, but Mark was front and center providing some serious feedback on the API, resulting data, and the overall approach by the FDA.</p>
<p>It has taken me four long years to develop my eye for not just the technical, but the business and political approach to delivering APIs, and it is something I&rsquo;ve only lightly touched on when it comes to the healthcare sector. I would say that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark is this</span>, cultivating a pretty critical eye for what is important when it comes to APIs in the healthcare space. If you are needing any guidance when it comes to planning, designing, deploying, and managing your healthcare APIs I recommend you connect with Mark, he can help you out like nobody else I know&mdash;make sure and tell him I sent you his way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Sep 2014</span>

<p>One question I get pretty frequently from my readers, is about how they should explain APIs to their senior leaders, specifically the non-tech savvy executives. In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones, not just for a single company, but potentially an entire industry. To help support this effort, I&rsquo;m working through several stories that anyone can put to work when trying to convince their senior leaders that APIs are a thing--this week is about access to resources.</p>
<p>APIs are all about making vital company resources available in a self-service, and secure way over the open Internet. Despite popular belief, most APIs are not publicly available, just the overview, documentation, code samples, and other building blocks are publicly available. If a developer actually wants to use an API they have to register, and be given access to API endpoints, before they can do anything with them. There are some pretty&nbsp;<a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">proven approaches to API management</a>&nbsp;out there, which include a centrally located developer center, simple API registration form, and potentially multiple service levels, that all help manage how APIs are accessed and put to use.</p>
<p>API resources can be anything from a company directory, to details of specific projects, or possible access to company compute, storage and other common IT resources. Anything you do on your computer at work, or have published via your website, can be made available via APIs, and easily accessed through a public or private portal, in a 24/7, self-service manner--all without needing to make a request for IT resources. This type of efficiency is what every company needs to be competitive in coming years, ensuring that every employee has access to the resources they need to get their job done.</p>
<p>Access to corporate or organization resources via APIs doesn&rsquo;t have to be something just for programmers. It is pretty likely that you already have web services at your company, but these APIs have been designed just for IT and geeks, where modern APIs come with supporting building blocks like widgets, spreadsheet connectors, and other tools that make API resources accessible and usable by anyone. This is an important distinction, one that is democratizing vital resources, and putting them into the  hands of people who can benefit the most, and not restricted by classic IT bottlenecks.</p>
<p>IT, and developers will often say APIs aren&rsquo;t for the average business person, and many business folks are used to this type of rhetoric and have been trained to avoid anything API related, feeling this isn&rsquo;t for them&mdash;something tech folks like, because it keeps them in control, feeding into classic IT power structures. However, for the last 14 years, web APIs have been making vital resources available to internal and external developers who are building web and mobile applications, as well as the internal power user, and are something every company should consider, when looking to help everyone in a company do their job better.</p>

<p>When I think about the concept "API mashup", It conjures up visions of clever hacks using Twitter and Google Maps from 2008 or 2009, where savvy developers would find innovative ways to mashup two or more APIs, and deliver some sort of web, and eventually mobile application on top of a couple of common APIs.</p>
<p>In 2014 I think the concept of a mashup has evolved, and while the term has fallen out of popularity with some people, I think the topic is still extremely relevant, and is something I want to discuss more at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> at the end of this month. To continue this discussion we've asked four leaders from the world of APIs to join me on stage for a panel discussion we are calling &ldquo;The Next Generation API Stack&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issac Roth (<a href="https://twitter.com/ijroth">@ijroth</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="http://strongloop.com/">StrongLoop</a></li>
<li>Kyle Wild (<a href="https://twitter.com/dorkitude">@dorkitude</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://keen.io/">Keen.io</a></li>
<li>Antony Falco (<a href="https://twitter.com/antonyfalco">@antonyfalco</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="http://orchestrate.io/">Orchestrate.io</a></li>
<li>Mehdi Medjaoui (<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/OAuth_io">oAuth.io</a></li>
<li>Justin Karneges (<a href="https://twitter.com/jkarneges">@jkarneges</a>) of <a href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout.io</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to discuss the concept of &ldquo;mashup&rdquo; which I think historically has represented what we do in the world of APIs, but is a term that has significantly moved on for experienced API developers.  I&rsquo;m looking to discuss this from a client side perspective, but also from the API provider, API aggregator, and analystics perspective as well. When you look at what innovators like StrongLoop, Keen.io, Orchestrate, and Webshell are doing, it is much more than just mashing up two APIs and building a web app.</p>
<p>Today's tools allow you to quickly mashup multiple APIs into new API stacks, bringing together your own resources, as well as those of other API providers, and deliver an intelligent stack of resources that any web, mobile, or Itnernet of things developer can use to build apps. Another thing that has evolved is the number of APIs being used, based only upon my own usage, my apps have gone using 2-3 APIs in 2009, to using potentially 20-30 APIs in a single app&mdash;dramatically upping the stakes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still pulling together the topics and questions I&rsquo;ll be bringing up with Issac, Kyle, Antony, and Mehdi during The Next Generation API Stack panel at APIStrat, so if there is any topic you&rsquo;d like to discuss, please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll consider adding to the list. I&rsquo;ll see you in Chicago in a couple of weeks--<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/register.php">make sure and get registered ASAP</a>!</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/tech-business-politics-03-2014.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>There was a very interesting piece from venture capitalist Albert Wenger (<a href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger">@albertwenger</a>) of <a href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a> over the labor day weekend, called <a href="http://continuations.com/post/96355016855/labor-day-right-to-an-api-key-algorithmic-organizing">Labor Day: Right to an API Key (Algorithmic Organizing)</a>,&nbsp;that I&rsquo;ve had open ever since and wanted to take a moment to add my thoughts to. First let me say, I agree 100% with Albert&rsquo;s post, but I felt that the piece left out some very critical elements, which I think Albert simply left out because he was just trying to get a short thought published over a holiday weekend, but I feel pretty strongly these points are critical to his argument, and should be put out there.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="http://continuations.com/post/96355016855/labor-day-right-to-an-api-key-algorithmic-organizing">full post over on Albert's blog</a>, but I think this statement sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote><em>There is a simple and universal regulatory change that would dramatically shift the bargaining power: an individual right to an API Key. By this I mean a key that would give an enduser *full* read/write access to the system including every action or screen the enduser can take or see on the web site or application. Alternatively one could think of this as an individual right to be represented by an algorithm.</em></blockquote>
<p>Shortly after Albert published his post, his partner Fred Wilson (<a href="https://twitter.com/fredwilson">@fredwilson</a>) chimed in with his own post, called <a href="http://avc.com/2014/09/algorithmic-organizing/">Algorithmic Organizing</a>,&nbsp;and again I took just single paragraph that I think sums it up:</p>
<blockquote><em>I believe that in the long run these platforms may/will be replaced by blockchain based networks of labor where there is no platform middleman and there would be no need for a legal right to an API because all the data would be public by default.</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree with what both Albert and Fred are saying, and it makes me happy to see such prominent VC firms seeing the future in this way. What I wish to add to this conversation is some critical thought around the the business and political building blocks that often times don't get discussed in these conversations, but are actually the real reason this vision can work, but at the same time are why this vision could also become more dangerous than the one we currently have.</p>
<p>The dangerous part I refer to, is the blind faith that the algorithm can represent us, providing some neutral, pure extension of ourselves, free of the power structures that perpetuate much of the divide between the haves and have nots that we see in the physical world. I believe that APIs have all the potential to deliver a better future, but the API, and the keys, are just two variables in the algorithm in which they Albert and Fred speak of, when in reality there are numerous other variables at play that need to be discussed as well, or we will find ourselves in the same situations we currently are, but a potentially more dangerous world where the algorithm obfuscates any exploitation that is happening, and protects the perpetrator.</p>
<p><strong>Passive Aggressive API Rate Limiting</strong> <br />The easiest way to limit the power any developer or end-user that is given by an API, is rate limiting. Rate limits can be established to restrict what you can access by the second, minute, hour, day, or any other configuration, making it pretty near impossible to realize any power or control you may think you have been given by a service. Most API providers are transparent with their rate limiting, and publish simple explanations of what they limit, and why, acknowledging the real world need to reduce overhead in API operations, and provide a certain quality of service for everyone. The problem with rate limiting comes in when platforms are not clear about their motivations for rate limiting, what the limitations are, and the actual rate limits to do reflect what is published publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding Motives Behind API Error Handling </strong><br />Error handling on API requests are great way to limit actual access to any API resource, allowing the API provider to hide behind errors in the system, when in reality they are purposefully working to limit what you can actually do with the API. Errors can be generated per user, application or for entire groups, making it almost impossible to hold platforms accountable when it comes to making resources truly accessible. I&rsquo;m not saying this is a common practice for  API providers, I&rsquo;m just saying that it is technically feasible, and I am pretty damn sure I&rsquo;ve seen it in the wild, making it a real concern for me. Even if it occurs due to incompetency, it is still preventing you from being truly accessing any resources, and making the truly algorithm represent you.</p>
<p><strong>Service Stability Can Bring Down Any Vision </strong><br />Building on the API error handling described above, overall service stability is a common way that API driven resources can be also rendered useless. Sure a company has an API, and you have an API key to access resources made available via that API, but if you can&rsquo;t actually connect to the API in a reliable way, what does it matter? There are a number of reasons service stability can be unreliable, it can be due a lack or resources, incompetence, or it can be intentional&mdash;as a recovering IT director, I can guarantee I&rsquo;ve seen this in action. I don&rsquo;t care how open your API is, if it isn't reliable it will not provide any value to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Security Needs To Be Priority </strong><br />An open, publicly available API might be great for you to gain access to your online resources, and the assets of any company, organization, or government agency, but the same can instantly be used against you if security is not given top priority. Security is not a reason to avoid APIs, just like websites, and other systems, APIs can be secured, but if it is not done right, and systems are not properly monitored, any API can be breached, going from APIs being a good thing, to APIs being the worst thing on earth&mdash;demonstrating pretty clearly this is more than just about the technology of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service Rule Everything </strong><br />The Terms of Service (TOS) provide a legal framework for developers, and end-users to operate within, set forth by a platform. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API, and ultimately how end-users can make a system work for them. If the TOS are out of balance, no amount of API access will matter if you are legally compromised in what you can actually do with resources.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency in Partner Tiers Of Access</strong><br />One of the benefits of modern approaches to APIs is the ability to compose different sets of services, and multiple access levels for different partners. Partner access is a great way to incentivize development on top of any platform, and give higher levels of access to those who contribute to the value of a platform.  Where this model begins to break down is when there is a lack of transparency, and platforms do not share information about what levels of access actually exist, which basically brings us back to the good ol boy networks we currently see across virtually any industry.</p>
<p><strong>Paying Attention To Privacy </strong><br />Privacy policies also protect the interests of partners, developers and platform users, while also protecting the API owner from damaging activity on their platform. Like an API terms of service, privacy policies need to strike a balance that protects everyone involved, while also allowing for innovation and commercial activity. APIs can very technically sound, but if the privacy of end-users are not respected, an API can become a liability for everyone involved. Privacy is another area that we will see increasingly become a problem in the future, preventing many from seeing APIs as a good thing, but if done right we can make sure APIs reflect the vision Albert and Fred speak of.</p>
<p><strong>Who Owns The Information I Pull Via An API </strong><br />Content and data ownership is an extremely contentious topic right now, with platforms claiming they own content that is generated using their services, and end-users rightfully feeling they have a stake in ownership of the content, data, media, and other information they generate on the platform. What good is API access, if I have no ownership of the content we generate via the platform? Sure I can access valuable resources, but if I can&rsquo;t legally do anything with it, what value is created by the API and its underlying algorithm?</p>
<p><strong>The Deprecation Of Any API Led Vision </strong><br />An API deprecation policy sets expectations with API consumers about when and how API resources will be shut down. These policies help build trust with API developers and end-users, giving them an idea of how long they can depend on an API resource, and what they can expect when an API reaches the end of life. You may have access to data and content that a platform contains, complete with API access, but if that service can go away at any point after an acquisition, or due to lack or resources or leadership, and you do not have any sort of heads up, an API is immediately rendered meaningless in this wider discussion.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Industry Influence </strong><br />As I watch the enterprise and government take notice of the API space, I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty clear examples of industry influence over the value brought to the table by APIs. I do not care how open, transparent, and technically sound your API is, and you can follow every bit of my advice, but if the 1000 lb gorilla in any industry is not happy with a service, an API will be no defense against acquisition, shutdown, or their legal attack. If a large corporate or government entity doesn't like your platform, they can shut you down, even if it is just through a sustained legal attack. This is one of my biggest concerns about VC investment in seemingly open, and altruistic APIs driven platforms, is that your investors always provide a doorway for industry influence to change the course of your API, no matter what you might believe as the platform owner.</p>
<p><strong>The Smoke And Mirrors Of "Open"<br /></strong>One of the most used terms in the world of APIs is &ldquo;open", and at the same time is also one of the most abused terms I know of. All of the reasons listed above can affect how truly open any API, platform and company is, preventing Albert and Fred&rsquo;s vision from ever becoming a reality. I could list another 50 ways that API providers prevent &nbsp;access to content and resources via APIs, ranging from lack of communication to complex pricing. My goal with this post is to show that there are some very real ways in which APIs can be used against the average worker and citizen, and that APIs are not good, bad, nor neutral&mdash;just like algorithms. They just reflect the intentions of their creators, and while I think there are many opportunities to make sure they reflect us, the end-user, citizen and worker, I think more often than not, they reflect the desires of their owners.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter As The Perpetual Poster Child </strong><br />I really love Twitter, and I think the platform is amazing. The company has made some very serious effot to improve problems on their API platform, but they still are the best example I can use to demonstrate how every one of these variables listed can be used against the access and freedom an API could provides, without you even knowing it. When it comes to demonstrating the power that APIs bring to the table, and the democratization of our digital resources, Twitter is a shining example. When it comes to demonstrating how an API can be leveraged against its users, and algorithmic organizing can just as easily be used against us, Twitter is a shining example. Search across the API Evangelist network and you will see I&rsquo;m both a lover and critic of Twitter, and I do not believe Dick Costolo is Mr. Smithers plotting and scheming how Twitter can screw us all over, but I do think at scale, after you&rsquo;ve taken a certain amount of funding, and you become interesting to the powers that be&mdash;things change, and an API, and the algorithms behind can be used in very harmful ways.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithmic Transparency </strong><br />It is easy to get excited about the potential around APIs and algorithms. I don't have a problem with this, more power to you (pun intended), however I personally feel algorithmic solutionism, and API solutionism for that matter, is not healthy. The way forward involves transparency, and communication around some of the very difficult areas I&rsquo;ve listed. Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) wrote a great post at TechRepublic earlier this year, called <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-driven-policy-and-commerce-requires-algorithmic-transparency/">data-driven policy and commerce requires algorithmic transparency</a>, which I think sums up this concept very nicely. For all of this to work, there has to be enough sunlight to keep things disinfected or we are going to see many of the same problem we see in the physical world, as well as a whole bunch of new problem we&rsquo;ve never anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithmic Accountability </strong><br />Additionally, I don&rsquo;t feel that even algorithmic transparency will be enough, we have to make sure companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and individuals are held accountable for their actions. If there is no way to hold companies accountable for their violations in the ways discussed above, what does an open, transparent API or algorithm even matter? It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, and it doesn&rsquo;t give us any balance, it just transfers the same power structures we&rsquo;ve known in the physical world to the virtual world, but now things are even more difficult to understand or hold any individual or company accountable for their malicious activity.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I totally agree with Albert Wenger and Fred Wilson on their labor day API thoughts. I feel that every company, organization, institution, government agency, and even many individuals should have APIs, and that they are the key to a better future. However I think many of these entities will also omit very important detail from API discussions, similar to each of Albert and Fred&rsquo;s posts. I do not believe they did it intentionally, or have any ill intent, but I think in our obsession with technology, algorithms, and APIs, we can miss a lot, and this is what many companies will count on, and use to their advantage.</p>
<p>If we do not pay attention to how the technological, business, and political building blocks are being used for exploitation, and manipulation, we are creating an even more dangerous divide between the haves and have nots, while opening up serious opportunities for abuse by the ruling merchant class, and further erode the rights we enjoy as workers, not moving them in a more positive direction. The real scary part for me, is that you probably won&rsquo;t ever even notice that any of this exploitation is evn occurring, and it will be very difficult to hold anyone accountable, all because of the magic of the algorithm and APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-knowledge-transfer.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>One question I get pretty frequently from my readers, is how should they explain APIs to senior leaders, specifically the executives who aren't tech savvy. In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones for not just a specific company, but potentially an entire industry&mdash;so I wanted to provide some material you can use in your own conversations.</p>
<p>First APIs are just like websites, but instead of being for humans they are meant for other desktop, web, server, and mobile applications. When you go to twitter.com you get an HTML listing of tweets, and when you go to api.twitter.com you get back JSON which is meant for other application to read, where the HTML is meant to make visible for the human API--that is it, that is the difference.</p>
<p>I use Twitter in this example, but APIs can be used to deliver any data, content, or even programmatic resource like say an image resize or convert a Word document to a PDF file. APIs act just like web or mobile applications, and let you read, update, add, or delete any of these resources that have been made available via an API.</p>
<p>When having this conversation, make sure and remind your leadership of the years between 1995 and 2000, when we were trying to convince our leadership that we should have websites. Remember all that selling we had to do to convince leadership that our company should have a website? Is there any question about whether or not your company should have a website in 2014? NO! This is the same thing that is going on with APIs between 2010 and 2015, and by 2015 to 2020, if your company doesn't have an API you will be at a serioius disadvantage.</p>
<p>To get started, any data or content that you have on your website should be available via an API. This helps you easily make things like company directory, product and service listings, and a blog accessible to be on any mobile application, website, or any server or desktop application. APIs are not about the next crazy software trend, it uses the same technology as delivering your website, but instead of launching a single site, your valuable resources are now instantly available for integration with any website and mobile application.</p>
<p>I have about ten separate examples like this to help you have conversation with your leadership about APIs. My goal is to try and keep them short, concise and something you can easily use to help convince your company that an API centric approach is right for your business. If you have specific scenarios you&rsquo;d like to address, feel free to ping me and let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://familysearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/250px-FamilySearch_logo.svg.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In my work everyday as the API Evangelist, I get to have some very interesting conversations, with a wide variety of folks, about how they are using APIs, as well as brainstorming other ways they can approach their API strategy allowing them to be more effective. One of the things that keep me going in this space is this diversity. One day I&rsquo;m looking at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/swagger-apisjson-and-review-for-the-new-developertradegov/">Developer.Trade.Gov for the Department of Commerce</a>, the next talking to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">WordPress about APIs for 60 million websites</a>, and then I&rsquo;m talking with the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the Family Search API, which is actively gathering, preserving, and sharing genealogical records from around the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so lucky I get to speak with all of these folks about the benefits, and perils of APIs, helping them think through their approach to opening up their valuable resources using APIs. The process is nourishing for me because I get to speak to such a diverse number of implementations, push my understanding of what is possible with APIs, while also sharpening my critical eye, understanding of where APIs can help, or where they can possibly go wrong. Personally, I find a couple of things very intriguing about the Family Search API story:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mapping the worlds genealogical history using a publicly available API &mdash; Going Big!!</li>
<li>Potential from participation by not just big partners, but the long tail of genealogical geeks</li>
<li>Transparency, openness, and collaboration shining through as the solution beyond just the technology</li>
<li>The mission driven focus of the API overlapping with my obsession for API evangelism intrigues and scares me</li>
<li>Have existing developer area, APIs, and seemingly necessary building blocks but failed to achieve a platform level</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to talking with anyone about their startup, SMB, enterprise, organizational, institutional, or government API, always leaving open a 15 minute slot to hear a good story, which turned into more than an hour of discussion with the Family Search team. See, Family Search already has an API, they have the technology in order, and they even have many of the essential business building blocks as well, but where they are falling short is when it comes to dialing in both the business and politics of their developer ecosystem to discover the right balance that will help them truly become a platform&mdash;which is my specialty. ;-)</p>
<p>This brings us to the million dollar question: <em><strong>How does one become a platform?</strong></em></p>
<p>All of this makes Family Search an interesting API story. The scope of the API, and to take something this big to the next level, Family Search has to become a platform, and not a superficial &ldquo;platform&rdquo; where they are just catering to three partners, but nourishing a vibrant long tail ecosystem of website, web application, single page application, mobile applications, and widget developers. Family Search is at an important reflection point, they have all the parts and pieces of a platform, they just have to figure out exactly what changes need to be made to open up, and take things to the next level.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s quantify the company, what is FamilySearch? &ldquo; For over 100 years, FamilySearch has been actively gathering, preserving, and sharing genealogical records worldwide&rdquo;, believing that &ldquo;learning about our ancestors helps us better understand who we are&mdash;creating a family bond, linking the present to the past, and building a bridge to the future&rdquo;.</p>
<p>FamilySearch is 1.2 billion total records, with 108 million completed in 2014 so far, with 24 million awaiting, as well as 386 active genealogical projects going on. Family Search provides the ability to manage photos, stories, documents, people, and albums&mdash;allowing people to be organized into a tree, knowing the branch everyone belongs to in the global family tree.</p>
<p>FamilySearch, started out as the Genealogical Society of Utah, which was founded in 1894, and dedicate preserving the records of the family of mankind, looking to "help people connect with their ancestors through easy access to historical records&rdquo;. FamilySearch is a mission-driven, non-profit organization, ran by the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All of this comes together to define an entity, that possesses an image that will appeal to some, while leave concern for others&mdash;making for a pretty unique formula for an API driven platform, that doesn&rsquo;t quite have a model anywhere else.</p>
<p>FamilySearch consider what they deliver as as a set of record custodian services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image Capture -</strong> Obtaining a preservation quality image is often the most costly and time-consuming step for records custodians. Microfilm has been the standard, but digital is emerging. Whether you opt to do it yourself or use one of our worldwide camera teams, we can help.</li>
<li><strong>Online Indexing -</strong> Once an image is digitized, key data needs to be transcribed in order to produce a searchable index that patrons around the world can access. Our online indexing application harnesses volunteers from around the world to quickly and accurately create indexes.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Conversion -</strong> For those records custodians who already have a substantial collection of microfilm, we can help digitize those images and even provide digital image storage.</li>
<li><strong>Online Access -</strong> Whether your goal is to make your records freely available to the public or to help supplement your budget needs, we can help you get your records online. To minimize your costs and increase access for your users, we can host your indexes and records on <a href="http://familysearch.org/">FamilySearch.org</a>, or we can provide tools and expertise that enable you to create your own hosted access.</li>
<li><strong>Preservation -</strong> Preservation copies of microfilm, microfiche, and digital records from over 100 countries and spanning hundreds of years are safely stored in the Granite Mountain Records Vault&mdash;a long-term storage facility designed for preservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>FamilySearch provides a proven set of services that users can take advantage of via a web applications, as well as iPhone and Android mobile apps, resulting in the online community they have built today. FamilySearch also goes beyond their basic web and mobile application services, and is elevated to software as a service (SaaS) level by having a pretty robust developer center and API stack.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Center<br /></strong>FamilySearch provides the required first impression when you land in the <a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/">FamilySearch developer center</a>, quickly explaining what you can do with the API, "FamilySearch offers developers a way to integrate web, desktop, and mobile apps with its collaborative Family Tree and vast digital archive of records&rdquo;, and immediately provides you with a getting started guide, and other supporting tutorials.</p>
<p>FamilySearch provides access to over 100 API resources in the twenty separate groups: Authorities, Change History, Discovery, Discussions, Memories, Notes, Ordinances, Parents and Children, Pedigree, Person, Places, Records, Search and Match, Source Box, Sources, Spouses, User, Utilities, Vocabularies, connecting you to the core FamilySearch  genealogical engine.</p>
<p>The FamilySearch developer area provides all the common, and even some forward leaning technical building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>oAuth 2.0</li>
<li>simple, consistent web API design</li>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/guides/hypermedia">hypermedia</a></li>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/libraries">code libraries</a></li>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/sample-app">sample apps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To support developers, FamilySearch provides a fairly <a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/support">standard support setup</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/ldsmail.net/forum/#!forum/fsdn">Google Group</a></li>

<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/faq">FAQ</a></li>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/change-log">Changelog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To augment support efforts there are also some other interesting building blocks:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/guides/throttling">Throttling</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the stage for FamilySearch evolving to being a platform, they even posses some necessary partner level building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/certification">Certification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/partnering">Partner Tier</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is even an application gallery showcasing what web, mac &amp; windows desktop, and mobile applications developers have built. FamilySearch even encourages developers to &ldquo;donate your software skills by participating in community projects and collaborating through the FamilySearch Developer Network&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Many of the ingredients of a platform exist within the current FamilySearch developer hub, at least the technical elements, and some of the common business, and political building blocks of a platform, but what is missing? This is what makes FamilySearch a compelling story, because it emphasizes one of the core elements of API Evangelist&mdash;that all of this API stuff only works when the right blend of technical, business, and politics exists.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing A Rich Partnership Environment </strong></p>
<p>FamilySearch has some strong partnerships, that have helped establish FamilySearch as the genealogy service it is today. FamilySearch knows they wouldn&rsquo;t exist without the partnerships they&rsquo;ve established, but how do you take it to the next and grow to a much larger, organic API driven ecosystem where a long tail of genealogy businesses, professionals, and enthusiasts can build on, and contribute to, the FamilySearch platform.</p>
<p>FamilySearch knows the time has come to make a shift to being an open platform, but is not entirely sure what needs to happen to actually stimulate not just the core FamilySearch partners, but also establish a vibrant long tail of developers. A developer portal is not just a place where geeky coders come to find what they need, it is a hub where business development occurs at all levels, in both synchronous, and asynchronous ways, in a 24/7 global environment.</p>
<p>FamilySearch acknowledge they have some issues when it comes investing in API driven partnerships:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Platform&rdquo; means their core set of large partners</li>
<li>Not treating all partners like first class citizens</li>
<li>Competing with some of their partners</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use their own API, creating a gap in perspective</li>
</ul>
<p>FamilySearch knows if they can work out the right configuration, they can evolve FamilySearch from a digital genealogical web and mobile service to a genealogical platform. If they do this they can scale beyond what they&rsquo;ve been able to do with a core set of partners, and crowdsource the mapping of the global family tree, allowing individuals to map their own family trees, while also contributing to the larger global tree. With a proper API driven platform this process doesn&rsquo;t have to occur via the FamiliySearch website and mobile app, it can happen in any web, desktop, or mobile application anywhere.</p>
<p>FamilySearch already has a pretty solid development team taking care of the tech of the FamilySearch API, and they have 20 people working internally to support partners. They have a handle on the tech of their API, they just need to get a handle on the business and politics of their API, and invest in the resources that needed to help scale the FamilySearch API being just a developer area, to being a growing genealogical developer community, to a full blow ecosystem that span not just the FamilySearch developer portal, but thousands of other sites and applications around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>A Good Dose Of API Evangelism To Shift Culture A Bit</strong></p>
<p>A healthy API evangelism strategy brings together a mix of business, marketing, sales and technology disciplines into a new approach to doing business for FamilySearch, something that if done right, can open up FamilySearch to outside ideas, and with the right framework manage to allow the platform to move beyond just certification, and partnering to also investment, and acquisition of data, content, talent, applications, and partners via the FamilySearch developer platform.</p>
<p>Think of evangelism as the grease in the gears of the platform allowing it to grow, expand, and handle a larger volume, of outreach, and support. API evangelism works to lubricate all aspects of platform operation.</p>
<p>First, lets kick off with setting some <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">objectives</span></strong> for why we are doing this, what are we trying to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase Number of Records - </strong>Increase the number of overall records in the FamilySearch database, contributing the larger goals of mapping the global family tree.</li>
<li><strong>Growth in New Users -</strong> Growing the number of new users who are building on the FamilySearch API, increase the overall headcount fro the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Growth In Active Apps -</strong> Increase not just new users but the number of actual apps being built and used, not just counting people kicking the tires.</li>
<li><strong>Growth in Existing User API Usage -</strong> Increase how existing users are putting the FamilySearch APIs. Educate about new features, increase adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -</strong> One of the top reasons for designing, deploying and managing an active APIs is increase awareness of the FamilySearch brand.</li>
<li>What else?</li>
</ul>
<p>What does <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>developer engagement</strong></span> look like for the FamilySearch platform?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active User Engagement - </strong>How do we reach out to existing, active users and find out what they need, and how do we profile them and continue to understand who they are and what they need. Is there a direct line to the CRM?</li>
<li><strong>Fresh Engagement - </strong>How is FamilySearch contacting new developers who have registered weekly to see what their immediate needs are, while their registration is fresh in their minds.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Engagement -</strong> How are historical active and / or inactive developers being engaged to better understand what their needs are and would make them active or increase activity.</li>
<li><strong>Social Engagement -</strong> Is FamilySearch profiling the  URL, Twitter, Facebook LinkedIn, and Github profiles, and then actively engage via these active channels?</li>
</ul>
<p>Establish a Developer Focused <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blog For Storytelling</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects - </strong>There are over 390 active projects on the FamilySearch platform, plus any number of active web, desktop, and mobile applications. All of this activity should be regularly profiled as part of platform evangelism. An editorial assembly line of technical projects that can feed blog stories, how-tos, samples and Github code libraries should be taking place, establishing a large volume of exhaust via the FamlySearch platform.</li>
<li><strong>Stories -</strong> FamilySearch is great at writing public, and partner facing content, but there is a need to be writing, editing and posting of stories derived from the technically focused projects, with SEO and API support by design.</li>
<li><strong>Syndication -</strong> Syndication to Tumblr, Blogger, Medium and other relevant blogging sites on regular basis with the best of the content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mapping Out The Geneology <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Landscape</strong></span></p>

<li><strong>Top Apps - </strong>What are the top applications in the space, whether built on the FamilySearch platform or not, and what do they do?</li>
<li><strong>Social -</strong> Mapping the social landscape for genealogy, who is who, and who should the platform be working with.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords -</strong> Established a list of keywords to use when searching for topics at search engines, QA, forums, social bookmarking and social networks. (should already be done by marketing folks)</li>
<li><strong>Cities &amp; Regions -</strong> Target specific markets in cities that make sense to your evangelism strategy, what are local tech meet ups, what are the local organizations, schools, and other gatherings. Who are the tech ambassadors for FamilySearch in these spaces?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding To <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Feedback Loop From Forum</strong></span> Operations</p>

</ul>
<p>Being Social About Platform Code and Operations With <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Github</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setup Github Account - </strong>Setup FamilySearch platform developer account and bring internal development team into a team umbrella as part of.</li>
<li><strong>Github Relationships -</strong> Managing of followers, forks, downloads and other potential relationships via Github, which has grown beyond just code, and is social.</li>

</ul>
<p>Leverage <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Social Engagement</strong></span> And Bring In Developers Too</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook -</strong> Consider setting up of new API specific Facebook company. Posting of all API evangelism activities and management of friends.</li>
<li><strong>Google Plus -</strong> Consider setting up of new API specific Google+ company. Posting of all API evangelism activities and management of friends.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn -</strong> Consider setting up of new API specific LinkedIn profile page who will follow developers and other relevant users for engagement. Posting of all API evangelism activities.</li>

<li><strong>Number of Apps -</strong> How many applications are there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essential <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Internal Evangelism</strong></span> Activities</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling - </strong>Telling stories of an API isn&rsquo;t just something you do externally, what stories need to be told internally to make sure an API initiative is successful.</li>
<li><strong>Conversations - </strong>Incite internal conversations about the FamilySearch platform. Hold brown bag lunches if you need to, or internal hackathons to get them involved.</li>
<li><strong>Participation -</strong> It is very healthy to include other people from across the company in API operations. How can we include people from other teams in API evangelism efforts.  Bring them to events, conferences and potentially expose them to local, platform focused events.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting -</strong> Sometimes providing regular numbers and reports to key players internally can help keep operations running smooth. What reports can we produce? Make them meaningful.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this evangelism starts with a very external focus, which is a hallmark of API and developer evangelism efforts, but if you notice by the end we are bringing it home to the most important aspect of platform evangelism, the internal outreach. This is the number one reason APIs fail, is due to a lack of internal evangelism, educating top and mid-level management, as well as lower level staff, getting buy-in and direct hands-on involvement with the platform, and failing to justify budget costs for the resources needed to make a platform successful.</p>
<p><strong>Top-Down Change At FamilySearch</strong></p>
<p>The change FamilySearch is looking for already has top level management buy-in, the problem is that the vision is not in lock step sync with actual platform operations. When regular projects developed via the FamilySearch platform are regularly showcased to top level executives, and stories consistent with platform operations are told, management will echo what is actually happening via the FamilySearch. This will provide a much more ongoing, deeper message for the rest of the company, and partners around what the priorities of the platform are, making it not just a meaningless top down mandate.</p>
<p>An example of this in action is with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">recent mandate from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">President Obama</span>, that all federal agencies should go &ldquo;machine readable by default&rdquo;</a>, which includes using APIs and open data outputs like JSON, instead of document formats like PDF. This top down mandate makes for a good PR soundbite, but in reality has little affect on the ground at federal agencies. In reality it has taken two years of hard work on the ground, at each agency, between agencies, and with the public to even begin to make this mandate a truth at over 20 of the federal government agencies.</p>
<p>Top down change is a piece of the overall platform evolution at FamilySearch, but is only a piece. Without proper bottom-up, and outside-in change, FamilySearch will never evolve beyond just being a genealogical software as a service with an interesting API. It takes much more than leadership to make a platform.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom-Up Change At FamilySearch</strong></p>
<p>One of the most influential aspects of APIs I have seen at companies, institutions, and agencies is the change of culture brought when APIs move beyond just a technical IT effort, and become about making resources available across an organization, and enabling people to do their job better. Without an awareness, buy-in, and in some cases evangelist conversion, a large organization will not be able to move from a service orientation to a platform way of thinking.</p>
<p>If a company as a whole is unaware of APIs, either at the company or organization, as well as out in the larger world with popular platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and others&mdash;it is extremely unlikely they will endorse, let alone participate in moving from being a digital service to platform. Employees need to see the benefits of a platform to their everyday job, and their involvement cannot require what they would perceive as extra work to accomplish platform related duties. FamilySearch employees need to see the benefits the platform brings to the overall mission, and play a role in this happening&mdash;even if it originates from a top-down mandate.</p>
<p>Top bookseller <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amazon</span> was already on the path to being a platform with their set of commerce APIs, when after a top down mandate from CEO Jeff Bezos, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon internalized APIs in such a way, that the entire company interacted, and exchange resources using web APIs</a>, resulting in one of the most successful API platforms&mdash;Amazon Web Services (AWS). Bezos mandated that if an Amazon department needed to procure a resource from another department, like server or storage space from IT, it need to happen via APIs. This wasn&rsquo;t a meaningless top-down mandate, it made employees life easier, and ultimately made the entire company more nimble, and agile, while also saving time and money. Without buy-in, and execution from Amazon employees, what we know as the cloud would never have occurred.</p>
<p>Change at large enterprises, organizations, institutions and agencies, can be expedited with the right top-down leadership, but without the right platform evangelism strategy, that includes internal stakeholders as not just targets of outreach efforts, but also inclusion in operations, it can result in sweeping, transformational changes. This type of change at a single organization can effect how an entire industry operates, similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen from the ultimate API platform pioneer, Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Outside-In Change At FamilySearch</strong></p>
<p>The final layer of change that needs to occur to bring FamilySearch from being just a service to a true platform, is opening up the channels to outside influence when it comes not just to platform operations, but organizational operations as well. The bar is high at FamilySearch. The quality of services, and expectation of the process, and adherence to the mission is strong, but if you are truly dedicated to providing a database of all mankind, you are going to have to let mankind in a little bit.</p>
<p>FamilySearch is still the keeper of knowledge, but to become a platform you have to let in the possibility that outside ideas, process, and applications can bring value to the organization, as well as to the wider genealogical community. You have to evolve beyond notions that the best ideas from inside the organization, and just from the leading partners in the space. There are opportunities for innovation and transformation in the long-tail stream, but you have to have a platform setup to encourage, participate in, and be able to identify value in the long-tail stream of an API platform.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Twitter</span> is one of the best examples of how any platform will have to let in outside ideas, applications, companies, and individuals. Much of what we consider as Twitter today was built in the platform ecosystem from the iPhone and Android apps, to the desktop app TweetDeck, to terminology like the #hashtag. Over the last 5 years, Twitter has worked hard to find the optimal platform balance, regarding how they educate, communicate, invest, acquire, and incentives their platform ecosystem. Listening to outside ideas goes well beyond the fact that Twitter is a publicly available social platform, it is about having such a large platform of API developers, and it is impossible to let in all ideas, but through a sophisticated evangelism strategy of in-person, and online channels, in 2014 Twitter has managed to find a balance that is working well.</p>
<p>Having a public facing platform doesn&rsquo;t mean the flood gates are open for ideas, and thoughts to just flow in, this is where service composition, and the certification and partner framework for FamilySearch will come in. Through clear, transparent partners tiers, open and transparent operations and communications, an optimal flow of outside ideas, applications, companies and individuals can be established&mdash;enabling a healthy, sustainable amount of change from the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>Knowing All Of Your Platform Partners</strong></p>
<p>The hallmark of any mature online platform is a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/03/taking-a-quick-look-at-the-leading-api-partner-programs/">well established partner ecosystem</a>.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve made the transition from service to platform, you&rsquo;ve established a pretty robust approach to not just certifying, and on boarding your partners, you also have stepped it up in knowing and understanding who they are, what their needs are, and investing in them throughout the lifecycle.</p>
<p>First off, profile everyone who comes through the front door of the platform. If they sign up for a public API key, who are they, and where do they potentially fit into your overall strategy. Don&rsquo;t be pushy, but understanding who they are and what they might be looking for, and make sure you have a track for this type of user well defined.</p>
<p>Next, quality, and certify as you have been doing. Make sure the process is well documented, but also transparent, allowing companies and individuals to quickly understand what it will take to certified, what the benefits are, and examples of other partners who have achieved this status. As a developer, building a genealogical mobile app, I need to know what I can expect, and have some incentive for investing in the certification process.</p>
<p>Keep your friends close, and your competition closer. Open the door wide for your competition to become a platform user, and potentially partner. 100+ year old technology company <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/">Johnson Controls&nbsp;(JCI)</a> was concerned about what the competition might do it they <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix-developer-center)">opened up their building efficient data resources to the public via the Panoptix API platform</a>, when after it was launched, they realized their competition were now their customer, and a partner in this new approach to doing business online for JCI.</p>
<p>When Department of Energy decides what data and other resource it makes available via Data.gov or the agencies developer program it has to deeply consider how this could affect U.S. industries. The resources the federal agency possesses can be pretty high value, and huge benefits for the private sector, but in some cases how might opening up APIs, or limiting access to APIs help or hurt the larger economy, as well as the Department of Energy developer ecosystem&mdash;there are lots of considerations when opening up API resources, that vary from industry to industry.</p>
<p>There are no silver bullets when it comes to API design, deployment, management, and evangelism. It takes a lot of hard work, communication, and iterating before you strike the right balance of operations, and every business sector will be different. Without knowing who your platform users are, and being able to establish a clear and transparent road for them to follow to achieve partner status, FamilySearch will never elevate to a true platform. How can you scale the trusted layers of your platform, if your partner framework isn&rsquo;t well documented, open, transparent, and well executed? It just can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful Monetization For Platform</strong></p>
<p>All of this will take money to make happen. Designing, and executing on the technical, and the evangelism aspects I&rsquo;m laying out will cost a lot of money, and on the consumers side, it will take money to design, develop, and manage desktop, web, and mobile applications build around the FamilySearch platform. How will both the FamilySearch platform, and its participants make ends meet?</p>
<p>This conversation is a hard one for startups, and established businesses, let alone when you are a non-profit, mission driven organization. Internal developers cost money, server and bandwidth are getting cheaper but still are a significant platform cost--sustaining a sale, bizdev, and evangelism also will not be cheap. It takes money to properly deliver resources via APIs, and even if the lowest tiers of access are free, at some point consumers are going to have to pay for access, resources, and advanced features.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">conversation around how do you monetize API driven resources is going on across government, from cities up to the federal government</a>. Where the thought of charging for access to public data is unheard of. These are public assets, and they should be freely available. While this is true, think of the same situation, but when it comes to physical public assets that are owned by the government, like parks. You can freely enjoy many city, county, and federal parks, there are sometimes small fees for usage, but if you want to actually sell something in a public park, you will need to buy permits, and often share revenue with the managing agency.  We have to think critically about how we fund the publishing, and refinement of publicly owned digital assets, as with physical assets there will be much debate in coming years, around what is acceptable, and what is not.</p>
<p>Woven into the tiers of partner access, there should always be provisions for applying costs, overhead, and even generation of a little revenue to be applied in other ways. With great power, comes great responsibility, and along with great access for FamilySearch partners, many will also be required to cover costs of compute capacity, storage costs, and other hard facts of delivering a scalable platform around any valuable digital assets, whether its privately or publicly held.</p>
<p>Platform monetization doesn&rsquo;t end with covering the costs of platform operation. Consumers of FamilySearch APIs will need assistance in identify the best ways to cover their own costs as well. Running a successful desktop, web or mobile application will take discipline, structure, and the ability to manage overhead costs, while also being able to generate some revenue through a clear business model. As a platform, FamilySearch will have to bring to the table some monetization opportunities for consumers, providing guidance as part of the certification process regarding what are best practices for monetization, and even some direct opportunities for advertising, in-app purchases and other common approaches to application monetization and sustainment.</p>
<p>Without revenue greasing the gears, no service can achieve platform status. As with all other aspects of platform operations the conversation around monetization cannot be on-sided, and just about the needs of the platform providers. Pro-active steps need to be taken to ensure both the platform provider, and its consumers are being monetized in the healthiest way possible, bringing as much benefit to the overall platform community as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Open &amp; Transparent Operations &amp; Communications</strong></p>
<p>How does all of this talk of platform and evangelism actually happen? It takes a whole lot of open, transparent communication across the board. Right now the only active part of the platform is the FamilySearch Developer Google Group, beyond that you don&rsquo;t see any activity that is platform specific. There are active Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and mainstream and affiliate focused blogs, but nothing that serves the platform, contributed to the feedback loop that will be necessary to take the service to the next level.</p>
<p>On a public platform, communications cannot all be private emails, phone calls, or face to face meetings. One of the things that allows an online service to expand to become a platform, then scale and grow into robust, vibrant, and active community is a stream of public communications, which include blogs, forums, social streams, images, and video content.  These communication channels cannot all be one way, meaning they need to include forum and social conversations, as well as showcase platform activity by API consumers.</p>
<p>Platform communications isn&rsquo;t just about getting direct messages answered, it is about public conversation so everyone shares in the answer, and public storytelling to help guide and lead the platform, that together with support via multiple channels, establishes a feedback loop, that when done right will keep growing, expanding and driving healthy growth. The transparent nature of platform feedback loops are essential to providing everything the consumers will need, while also bringing a fresh flow of ideas, and insight within the FamilySearch firewall.</p>
<p><strong>Truly Shifting FamilySearch The Culture</strong></p>
<p>Top-down, bottom-up, outside-in, with constantly flow of oxygen via vibrant, flowing feedback loop, and the nourishing, and sanitizing sunlight of platform transparency, where week by week, month by month someone change can occur. It won&rsquo;t all be good, there are plenty of problems that arise in ecosystem operations, but all of this has the potential to slowly shift culture when done right.</p>
<p>One thing that shows me the team over at FamilySearch has what it takes, is when I asked if I could write this up a story, rather than just a proposal I email them, they said yes. This is a true test of whether or not an organization might have what it takes. If you are unwilling to be transparent about the problems you have currently, and the work that goes into your strategy, it is unlikely you will have what it takes to establish the amount of transparency required for a platform to be successful.</p>
<p>When internal staff, large external partners, and long tail genealogical app developers and enthusiasts are in sync via a FamilySearch platform driven ecosystem, I think we can consider a shift to platform has occurred for FamilySearch. The real question is how do we get there?</p>
<p><strong>Executing On Evangelism</strong></p>
<p>This is not a definitive proposal for executing on an API evangelism strategy, merely a blueprint for the seed that can be used to start a slow, seismic shift in how FamilySearch engages its API area, in a way that will slowly evolve it into a community, one that includes internal, partner, and public developers, and some day, with the right set of circumstances, FamilySearch could grow into robust, social, genealogical ecosystem where everyone comes to access, and participate in the mapping of mankind.</p>

<p>There is nothing easy about this. It takes time, and resources, and there are only so many elements you can automate when it comes to API evangelism. For something that is very programmatic, it takes more of the human variable to make the API driven platform algorithm work. With that said it is possible to scale some aspects, and increase the awareness, presence, and effectiveness of FamilySearch platform efforts, which is really what is currently missing.</p>
<p>While as the API Evangelist, I cannot personally execute on every aspect of an API evangelism strategy for FamilySearch, I can provide essential planning expertise for the overall FamilySearch API strategy, as well as provide regular checkin with the team on how things are going, and help plan the roadmap. The two things I can bring to the table that are reflected in this proposal, is the understanding of where the FamilySearch API effort currently is, and what is missing to help get FamilySearch to the next stage of its platform evolution.</p>
<p>When operating within the corporate or organizational silo, it can be very easy to lose site of how other organizations, and companies, are approach their API strategy, and miss important pieces of how you need to shift your strategy. This is one of the biggest inhibitors of API efforts at large organizations, and is one of the biggest imperatives for companies to invest in their API strategy, and begin the process of breaking operations out of their silo.</p>
<p>What FamilySearch is facing demonstrates that APIs are much more than the technical endpoint that most believe, it takes many other business, and political building blocks to truly go from API to platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saswatanand"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/saswat-anand.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I get quite a few nice comments about my blog(s) behind the scenes. Many are from the enterprise or insttutions, where I know I could never get away with publishing publicly. As the APi space has heated up in 2014, more people are trying to make sense of this API mayhem, and ultimately they come across my blog, and find &nbsp;valuable information that really helps them in their journey.</p>
<p>I have been considering adding a page, listing some of the kind words I get from folks--maybe I will someday, but today I received a nice email, one I couldn't help but ask if I could repost--so here is a nice message from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saswatanand">Saswat Anand</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been reading your blogs and following you on Twitter for a couple of weeks now. I am a researcher in the Stanford&nbsp;University. By following your blogs and twits, I have been trying to understand the problems and opportunities in the API space.</p>
<p>I just wanted to drop a quick note to thank you for being a true evangelist for API's. I find your blogs very interesting both because of valuable information and your writing style.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Saswat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't lie, the number one reason I do API Evangelist is for me, but the number two reason is to help folks like Saswat make sense of the space. I don't care whether you are a researcher in higher education, startup founder, or work at a government agency, I want you to understand APIs.</p>
<p>I couldn't be more stoked in my career right now, and be happier with what I'm doing. I was a little concerned if I had made the right decision to start API Evangelist back in 2010 and 2011, but in 2014, it has turned into some pretty meaningful work for me.</p>
<p>Thanks Saswat! Glad you find it valuable.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I never properly wrapped up my experience at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft</a> last month, where I moderated a pretty important panel discussion on hypermedia with Mike Amundsen (<a href="http://bit.ly/1mtrwki">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="http://bit.ly/1hBxi4m">@mikekelly85</a>) Steve Klabnik (<a href="http://bit.ly/1wv9KVR">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="http://bit.ly/1oC7Udw">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discussion was pretty amazing, I will let you watch for yourself. The action actually starts right at about 30:00 minute mark, so there is a lot of dead space until then.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/50652146?v=3&amp;wmode=direct" width="480" height="302"> </iframe> <br /><a style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; font-weight: normal; text-align: left;" href="http://www.ustream.tv" target="_blank">Broadcast live streaming video on Ustream</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Careful it is 3 hours of some pretty geeky talk, you might experience some hypermedia side effects. Seriously though, this is a pretty important video discussion about a very relevant, and often misunderstood part of API evolution. I highly recommend watching.</p>
<p>I'm just getting back down to this time period in my Evernote stack, so look for some more stories out of API Craft and hypermedia after rewatching this talk. Also stay tuned for upcoming stories from <a href="http://iloveapis2014.com/">I Love APIs in San Francisco</a>, <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/">#API360 Summit in Washington DC</a>, and of course <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> at the end of September.</p>

<p>I am making another pass through <a href="http://theapistack.com/">821 companies doing interesting things with APIs</a>, and flagging a handful of them as inactive. I will then attempt to contact each of the companies to see if anyone is home. All signs point to a handful of them being dormant projects, with silent blogs, twitter accounts, and other common streams you normally see flowing from API platforms.</p>
<p>If any of them are indeed shutting down, I&rsquo;m going to urge them to consider open sourcing as much of their API platform as they can, from server side, and client side code to API definitions. At the very least I would like to capture a snapshot of the API, the title, description, image, and a machine readable Swagger spec of the interface, to help record the pattern for future consideration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some of these APIs will have investors they will have to consult before they can do something like open sourcing their API, and I&rsquo;m sure many of them won&rsquo;t even respond&mdash;I know how difficult it is after you have to put your startup down. Regardless I will at least flag them, make an attempt to contact, and if they don&rsquo;t respond I&rsquo;ll queue them up for profiling, and build an archive of abandoned API.</p>
<p>In forty years I&rsquo;ll be that old crazy guy in the neighborhood who has piles and piles of old APIs laying around his yard. ;-)  These damn things will be worth a fortune some day!!</p>
<p>Seriously, if you have an API that you are planning to deprecate, please reach out, I'd be happy to help archive it for the history books.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m needing to quantify the work i do around APIs in higher education for a university in the U.K., so I figured I&rsquo;d craft into a story that I can share with my readers, and potentially other schools who would ask what it is that I do.</p>
<p>I am interested in APIs in higher education because I feel strongly that our institutions are a fertile environment for ensuring that the next generation of our society possess the digital literacy they will need to navigate and find success in our increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>When I mention that higher education institutions should be incorporating APIs into daily operations, most folks immediately think of a very technical, IT directed effort, which is one layer to the discussion that should be considered, but ultimately it is about developing an awareness, and engagement by administration, faculty, and the students with the increasingly public APIs that surround us, as well as internal institutional APIs.</p>
<p>Our personal, and business lives are moving into the cloud. We are increasingly dependent on web-based and mobile applications in many aspects of our lives, and a growing number of these software services have APIs, and API-enabled actions that can be taken by anyone, even non-developers.</p>
<p>My mission as the API Evangelist is to help everyone be aware that APIs exist, and that they are there to assist you in your personal and business life. Which brings me back to higher education institutions being an important place to expose students, and faculty to the benefits of APIs&mdash;in preparation for the increasingly API driven world unfolding around us.</p>
<p>While I pay attention to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">over a 100 categories of APIs</a>, let&rsquo;s take one area, <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=images-stack">photos and images</a>, and use as a backdrop for what I do. I pay attention to over <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=images-stack">25 photo and image APIs</a> that provide image related services for developers, as well as direct access to the popular photo and image platforms we often depend on like Flickr and Instagram.</p>
<p>As the API Evangelist I seek to pay attention to three key layers of the API space.</p>
<p><strong>Technology of APIs - </strong>The geeky detail of how APIs work.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How do I authenticate?</li>
<li>Where do I read data from?</li>
<li>How do I write data?</li>
<li>Where are their code samples in my language?</li>
<li>Where is the WordPress plugin?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business of APIs - </strong>The business profile behind any online service.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How much does the service cost?</li>
<li>What are the limitations of what I can read or write?</li>
<li>What kind of support is available to me?</li>
<li>What are the long term plans of company?</li>
<li>Is the platform and tools well documented?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Politics of APIs -</strong> The often complex politics behind the curtain.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Do I own my data? Do I own my photos?</li>
<li>Can I specify the license for my photos?</li>
<li>What are the security practices?</li>
<li>Do I have control over who access my data (aka oAuth)?</li>
<li>Are code libraries, tools, and other code open sourced?</li>
<li>Are the terms of service easy to understand? Fair?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are much more than just technology and when you compare platforms like Flickr and Instagram which both act as photo sharing platforms, but have widely different approaches to the technology, business, and politics of each of their APIs. Sometimes it is just small details that can make the difference in whether or not a platform is the right choice or not for any individual or business.</p>
<p>Beyond the technology, business, and politics I also pay attention to a handful of important trends that are growing out of the API space, to support API consumers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">Realtime</a> -</strong> What options are there to interact in realtime.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How do I send / receive push notifications?</li>
<li>How do I use webhooks to receive updates?</li>
<li>Does this API have a streaming API?</li>
<li>What frameworks are available for real-time delivery?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">Aggregation</a> -</strong> Details on API data and information aggregation.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Can I get all of my images from Flickr, Instagram in a single feed?</li>
<li>Can I publish to one place, and have it syndicate out?</li>
<li>What options do I have for POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a> </strong>- Approaches to moving data from one system to another.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Can I migrate all of my flickr images to dropbox?</li>
<li>Can I keep all of my flick, instagram, and other photo sites in sync?</li>
<li>Where is the best place to store my photos?</li>
<li>Can I transform images when moving from location to location?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just about watching, and monitoring what is going on in the API space, my mission demands that I take what I learn and produce content that everyone else can benefit from. To fulfill this, I take all of my curation, analysis and awareness, and I work to create rich content that is designed for the widest distribution possible:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Short Form -</strong> Blog posts on my primary blogs (apievangelist.com, apivoice.com, api.report, theapistack.com, ipaevangelist.com, and kin lane.com)</li>
<li><strong>Long Form -</strong> White papers and ebooks that get published either public, or in some cases privately for internal organizational distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Presentations -</strong> Walkthroughs, talk presentations, and other interactive content that introduce people to the world of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Videos - </strong>Generating video content, around my research and presentations for publishing to YouTube and other video distribution sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly feel that it isn&rsquo;t enough that I'm doing all of this work online, I&rsquo;m also invested in stimulating in-person conversations in the following formats:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Conversations -</strong> In person, small group conversations with team members about APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Classrooms -</strong> Teaching large, or small classrooms at institutions around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Meetups -</strong> Supporting the creation of, and guest speaking of API focused meetup groups around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Conferences -</strong> I support up to 10 API conferences, while also putting on my global conference on APIs called @APIStrat</li>
</ul>
<p>API evangelism for me is not just about educating developers that APIs exist, it is about bringing awareness to the masses that APIs exist, and they are just the next evolutionary layer of the web that has penetrated almost all aspects of our lives. I focus on bringing an awareness of APIs to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Individuals -</strong> Every citizen. API literacy is like financial literacy, you don&rsquo;t need to understand the entire banking system, but you will need some basic financial literacy to manage your bank account, and credit cards&mdash;the same applies in the API space, you don&rsquo;t need to understand everything about oAuth, but you should know who has access to your bank account, Facebook, and YouTube accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Business -</strong> More business activity is occurring online, and APIs are rapidly making business data and information available to the average business user for use in spreadsheets, mobile and web applications. Basic API literacy is fast becoming a requirement for many business sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Institutions -</strong> Over the last 15 years, many institutions have moved online, establishing a web presence, and connecting with partners, and constituents via the web. Large organizations need to understand how to use APIs to become more resilient, agile, and nimble in an age where much is changing when it comes to how the institutions of yesterday are perceived and stay relevant in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Government - </strong>Our government is required to do more with less, and APIs are the way we are slowly shifting government of all sizes, operate and engage constituents. Federal, state, and local governments are opening up data, making resources available via APis, and shifting the burden of governance to private sector partners, and even the public using APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Helping everyone understand the API undercurrents that are occurring right now all around us, is my mission as the API Evangelist. Everyone needs to understand that APIs exist, and have a basic understanding of how they can put them to use in their personal and business world. This isn&rsquo;t some grand, techno vision being sold from Silicon Valley that I'm looking to sell to universities, this is about what is already happening around us on the web, via our personal mobile devices, our homes, businesses, cars, and much much more. API Evangelist is about helping regular folks see what is happening, understand as much of it sa they can, allowing them to take meaningful action with the context of their lives.</p>
<p>Continuing to bring this higher education API venn diagram tighter, is additional work I&rsquo;m doing with in two very quiet, but extremely important initiatives.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://umw.domains/">Domain of One&rsquo;s Own</a> -</strong> A program occurring at a handful of higher education institutions, where students get their own domain upon entering school, which can be used for their projects throughout their academic career, and even beyond if they choose&mdash;giving each student the gift of web literacy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a> - </strong>A secondary project spun out of Domain of One&rsquo;s Own which is about providing education materials, tools, and other resources for students, and any other individual to map out their online domain, and put together a strategy for reclaiming parts of their digital identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do my work I use my own custom developed internal system, where I aggregate information about over 2500 APIs, 1500 RSS feeds, 2500 Twitter accounts, and 750 Github accounts. From there, all of my short form and long form content, as well as presentations, and other supporting research gets published to <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">75 individual open source research projects managed using Github</a>. My intent is to make sure all of my research, and resulting data is publicly available in open formats, allowing anyone to fork, extend, and expand on what I do.</p>
<p>How can my research help your institution better understand, internalize, and apply APIs?</p>

<p>When it comes to APIs, the quickest way to get an API for your company, organization or government agency is to choose to only use online services that have APIs. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Github, Instagram, Flickr, and many other popular services you already use, all have APIs.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m expanding on my tracking of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment tools</a>, to include deploying APIs via Google Spreadsheets, and to scraping data from websites, I can&rsquo;t help but step back and consider truly what is the easiest way to deploy an API, which really is about choosing to use online services that already have an API--no connecting to your backend systems necessary!</p>
<p>We talk about APIs in the context of developers, using APIs to build applications for end-users, and provide system integrations. What if we talked about it in context of the users, and helping individual users aggregate their APIs into a single, personal API stack?</p>
<p>As Joe or Jane user, I could have my own personal API hub, with code samples, and other resources to understand how to access my APIs. I&rsquo;m not sure how oAuth would be triggered in this scenario (needs more thought), if a developer wanted access to my Facebook or other private data, but if I ran WordPress, and included my Flickr photos in my API stack, API access could be pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Thinking of this in the context of enabling personal API hubs is a pretty far out there concept, but understanding that you can have an isntant API just by using common services that have APIs, is pretty powerful. In reality, the average person will rarely ever need a personal developer hub with a stack of APIs, but if we teach people that they need an API with all the service they use, so they can use services like Zapier, and the other API-enabled tools, we might just be able to keep SaaS providers honest, ensuring they always public APIs, transparency and data portability for end-users.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-excel-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the usage of spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs for several years now. Spreadsheets are everywhere, they are the number one data management tool in the world, and whether API developers like or not, spreadsheets will continue to collide with the API space, as both API providers, and consumers try to get things done using APIs.</p>
<p>APIs are all about getting access to the resources you need, and spreadsheets are being used by both API providers and consumers to accomplish these goals. It makes complete sense to me that business users would be looking for solutions via spreadsheets, as they are one potential doorway to hacking for the average person&mdash;writing macros, calculations, and other dynamic features people execute within the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I know IT would like to think their central SQL, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and other database are where the valuable data and content assets are stored at a company, but in reality the most valuable data resources are often stored in spreadsheets across an organization. When it comes time to deploying APIs, this is the first place you should look for your datasources, resulting in Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet to API solutions like we&rsquo;ve seen from <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets used by companies to deploy APIs in some of the following ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Microsoft Excel - </strong>Turning Microsoft Excel spreadsheets directly into APIs. by taking a spreadsheet, and generating an API is the fastest way to go from closed data resource to an API for anyone to access, even without programming experience.</li>
<li><strong>Google Spreadsheet -</strong> Mounting public and private Google Spreadsheets is an increasingly popular way to publish smaller datasets as APIs. Since Google Spreadsheets is web-based, it becomes very easy to use the Google Spreadsheet API to access any Spreadsheet in a Google account, then generate a web API interface that can allow for reading or writing to a spreadsheet data source via a public, or privately secured API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond deploying APIs I&rsquo;m seeing API providers provide some innovative ways for users to connect spreadsheets to their APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Client -</strong> Electronic parts search API Octopart has been providing a bill of materials (BOM) solution via <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">Microsoft Excel</a>, and now <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/25/ocotoparts-open-source-google-spreadsheet/">Google Spreadsheets</a>&nbsp;for their customers--providing a distributed parts catalog in a spreadsheet, that is kept up to date via public API.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Cache -</strong> I&rsquo;ve talked with U.S. Census and other data providers about how they provide Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet caches of API driven data, allowing users to browse, search and establish some sort of subset of data, then save as a spreadsheet cache for offline use. </li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Catch-All -</strong> Spreadsheets aren&rsquo;t always being used just about data, you can see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio storing SMS</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/13/using-excel-for-crowdsourced-data-gathering-and-reporting/">NPR using as crowdsourced engine</a>, making spreadsheets into a nice bucket for catching just about anything an API can input or output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving out of the realm of what API providers can do for their API consumers with spreadsheets, and into the world of what API consumers can do for themselves, you start to see endless opportunities for API integration with spreadsheets using reciprocity providers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> - </strong>There are five pages of recipes on the popular API reciprocity provider Zapier that allow you to work with Google Docs, and 57 pages that are dealing directly with Google Drive, providing a wealth of tools that non-developers (or developers) can use when connecting common APIs up to Google Spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough movement in the area of Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets being used with APIs to warrant closer monitoring. To support this I've started publishing most of my research to an <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist spreadsheet research site</a>, which will allow me to better track, curate, tag, and tell stories around spreadsheets and APIs.</p>
<p>As I do with my <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ API research projects</a>, I will update this site when I have time, publishing anything I've read, written, and companies I think are doing interesting things spreadsheets and APIs. I'm pretty convinced that spreadsheets will be another one of those bridge tools we use to connect where we are going with APIs, with the reality of where the everyday person is, just trying to get their job done.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/jive-software/jive.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/">Enterprise social API Jive Software</a> wins for the best developer landing page. Normally I tell folks, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">like I did with Trade.gov last week</a>, that your landing page should have a short, precise description of what you API does&mdash;this is some seriously valuable real estate, and you have one chance to make an impression.</p>
<p>I would put Jive Software into the category of more making a first impression, than providing a short description of what the API does:</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/jive-software/brew-up-something-awesome.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this approach for every API provider, but if you can do it right, and make a solid first impression&mdash;run with it! As an <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and <a href="http://ipaevangelist.com">IPA Evangelist</a>, I can seriously get behind a message like &ldquo;brew up something awesome&rdquo;. +1</p>
<p>I like how they have apps, docs, APIs, and IPAs as taps, and the taps even work when you mouseover!  Seriously, all of this API shit is hard to make entertaining (trust me I know), and when you can provide this human touches while inciting innovation, they can go a long way in breaking the ice with consumers.</p>
<p>Right above the taps Jive Software provides the essential getting started, and register links for their APIs, which signals that beyond the fun facade, they mean business, and want to help you onboard with using their APIs. I haven&rsquo;t dug deep into the Jive Software API to see what else is going on, but after this first impression it is likely I will be looking around more, now that they made a good first impression.</p>

<p><a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">Containers</a> are a fast growing trend when it comes to delivering compute resources online. Reflecting the world of API design, I feel containers are about deploying exactly the cloud resources you will need to complete a specific compute objective, then putting everything into a single virtualized container definition, that can be forked, clone, scaled, and evolved indpendently of any other resources. Each individual container posesses everything it will need from the operating system, file system, database, necessary libraries, and APIs to accomplish its given objective.</p>
<p>Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I would consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are often sold B2B, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use anywhere in the API economy.</p>
<p>My goal is to understand how APIs and containers work together, and as I do with all of my research <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo</a> for tracking every piece of container news I read that I feel is relevant, each company doing interesting things containers, tools for working with containers, and ultimately my analysis. Cloud computing will continue to be the lead driver of innovation in the API space, and I feel the introduction of cloud computing in 2006&ndash;2008 gave legitimacy to web APIs&mdash;you could now deploy global infrastructure using web APIs, game on. I think containerization will take API design, deployment, management and integration to the next phase, and closer the early visions of a programmable web we all started envisioning around 2005.</p>
<p>I will be taking each of my API designs, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">developing an Amazon Machine Image, Heroku App version, as well as a docker container definition</a>. I want every one of my open source API designs to have the option to be deployed in any cloud environment, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/23/push-button-api-deployment-with-the-heroku-button/">preferable with the click of a button, as with Heroku</a>. In the future it won&rsquo;t about knowing about all the APIs, it will be about having the right stack of APIs, that you can deploy anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>I will be talking on this subject at <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat in Chicago this September</a>, and also at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag in Colorado this November</a>, let me know if you want to connect around the subject.</p>

<p>I have been doing a lot of research into the world of financial APIs, specifically looking at some of the larger companies providing APIs that deliver market news, data, corporate profiles, and other data that make markets go round.</p>
<p>As I consider some of the common building blocks that are common across many financial API--real-time data frameworks, and visualization tools are two of the top items that I think will be part of every financial API stack in the future. Almost every API I looked at had some sort of real-time stream, promising data faster, as well as a way to extract meaning from these streams using template, or custom visualizations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time API services</a> and tools, and i&rsquo;ve been seeing some of these frameworks, like Firebase <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">getting baked in by default to some API platforms</a>. I am also tracking on visualization tools, I just don&rsquo;t have the research published as a Github repository yet, like I do with my real-time research.</p>
<p>I will keep tracking on API providers who are doing interesting things with real-time or visualizations, and hopefully be able to publish more examples. I can&rsquo;t help but think there are some pretty interesting opportunities for open frameworks, and white label solutions for API providers when it comes to real-time, and visualization layers on top of their existing APIs.</p>

<p>I was keeping an eye out for interesting API stories on <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a> the other day and came across an cool notification startup that lives in the Stripe API ecosystem, called <a href="https://hooked.io/">Hooked</a>.</p>
<p>Hooked allows users to set up notifications for any events related to a Stripe account. Hooked uses the Stripe API to disocver events, and then employs webhooks to send notifications.</p>
<p>As I'm writing this story, I realize this is very similar to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/26/realtime-and-visualizations-will-be-key-in-financial-api-deployments/">previous story today about real-time and visualization layers for APIs</a>, and that notifications could easily be provided as a white label solution for API providers, giving them a ready to go notification layer to their APIs.</p>
<p>Right now I lump notifications in my research under <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, but I think I will be pulling it out into its own research area. Notifications are real-time, but they are more messaging than just a real-time feature, but they are kind of more real-time than just a message too. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>We'll see. That is the fun of my API Evangelist research network, is that all of it is pretty liquid&mdash;allowing me to keep moving things around until they make sense in my head.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://ziplocate.us/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/ZipLocate.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My friend Mark Silverberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/skram">@skram</a>), pointed out a very cool API the other day, that geolocates zip codes, and appropriately named&nbsp;<a href="http://ziplocate.us/">ZipLocate</a>. What I really like about ZipLocate is that they do one thing, and they do it well. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love me some AWS and Twilio, who have industrial grade APIs, but I also have a love for simple, lightweight APIs that focus on one thing.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing about ZipLocate is that it is always free, and never rate limited. He says that it is relatively cheap to host the API, because bandwidth usage is light, with all API calls are heavily cached. I like this type of micro service design--I want thousands more just like it.</p>
<p>What I also dig about ZipLocate is that if you <em>&ldquo;...don't trust the API to be around tomorrow? Host it yourself. Source code and data import scripts available on Github&rdquo;</em>. This is possible because the ZipLocate API is open source, and the data comes from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html">Census Bureau</a>. This approach to developing dead simple APIs on top of government data is really important, and I personally feel that <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/25/6482-datasets-available-across-22-federal-agencies-in-datajson-files/">all 6,482 data sets across 22 federal agencies who have published their data.json file</a>, should have APIs just like ZipLocate.</p>
<p>It looks like ZipLocate is a project developed by Nathan Cahill (<a href="https://twitter.com/nathancahill">@nathancahill</a>). I like his style, and think his approach is simple, elegant, yet extremely powerful, and provides a blueprint that others can follow when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/23/models-for-api-driven-startups-built-around-public-data-/">designing, developing and deploying APIs built on top of public data</a>.</p>

<p>I have been slowly producing my own stack of APIs, which I'm putting under <a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a> brand. My goal with each of these APIs is to do one thing, and do it well, then package up the server side code, API definition, and publish as its own standalone Github repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an Evernote full of ideas for APIs, and I'm seeing plenty of great API designs that I could easily emulate from the rest of The API Stack. As I have time, I will deploy each of my API designs as an API Stack API, eventually looking to build a robust stack of utility APIs.</p>
<p>To support this I've separate out my APIs here into two separate pages, my <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>, which will provide access to content across the API Evangelist network, and my <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a> which will all be the modular, API Stack designs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I'm done deploying any new design, and I feel it is ready for primetime, I will list here for every to check out and play with.</p>

<p>I was looking around the Google Developer area as part of some regular work, and I noticed an interesting page Google has under their mapping session, that <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/api-picker">help users decide which API they need</a>&nbsp;based upon their goals.</p>
<p>As the page says: "<em>The API picker lists the most common things you may want to do on a map or with location-based data, and suggests the API that most suits your needs. For details about each API, follow the links to the related documentation.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/api-picker"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google/which-api-do-i-need.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think that the table layout Google uses is a particularly good one, resulting in a pretty busy looking matrix. I don't think it is a perfect solution, but I like the idea of providing developers with some sort of assistance in understand which API to use, based upon their goals.</p>
<p>This is something that a larger API provider would probably do, but a simple little needs calculator that could help users translate what they are looking for into what the API does, is an interesting concept to play with for some API providers.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m riding the build up for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">APIStrat in Chicago</a>, and preparing for <a href="http://iloveapis2014.com/">I Love APIs in San Francisco</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/">API 360 Summit in DC</a>, I can&rsquo;t help but think about how busy the API event scene is getting&mdash;in 2014 there are 14 separate conferences focused on the world of APIs.</p>
<p>In the beginning there was just <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiconference.com/">Business of APIs</a>, then 3Scale and API Evangelist got together and started planning for @APIStrat, then immediately <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> happened, <a href="http://nordicapis.com/">Nordic APIs</a> came on the scene, <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft</a>a&nbsp; grew beyond just Meetup, and before you know we have 14 separate events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be biased here, because @APIStrat is my baby, and I&rsquo;ve been involved in supporting API Days since day, so these two events will always have a special place in my heart. Even with this I believe in interoperability in the community and I am working to support all of the events equally, so if you are organizing make sure and reach out.</p>
<p>You can find me at I Love APIs in a couple weeks in San Francisco, as well as at API 360 in Washington DC the same week, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September, and Nordic APIs in October. Unfortunately we messed up in planning @APIStrat, and made it at the same time as REST Fest, which seriously pissed me off&mdash;so I won&rsquo;t be attending REST Fest yet again this year. :-( This is part of the reason I'm putting together this research, so I don't make this mistake again.</p>
<p>As with the rest of my work, <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo, and website to give me a single place to aggregate information on API events</a>. I will do my best keep up to date, for my own education, but I am also looking to help you understand each of the events, the organizers, sponsors, speakers, and also who is attending. As I have time I will aso add a section for API Meetups, so we can keep tabs on the smaller API gatherings that are going on in various cities around the globe.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to participate in one of the conferences listed as a speaker or sponsor let me know, I&rsquo;ll hook you up with the organizer. If you&rsquo;d like to organize a meet up in your town, or you would like to bring in guest speakers from the outside API community, let me know as well&mdash;no guarantees, but I will see what I can do.</p>
<p>As with the rest of the space, I will do my best to keep my <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">API events research</a> up to date, and as with the rest of my research, feel free <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-events">fork and contribute</a> where you can&mdash;I need all the help I can get!</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/curtacircuitos/octopart-google-app">open source Google Spreadsheet API connector</a>, you can connect to the latest electronic parts pricing and availability in your Google Docs, kept up-to-date using the <a href="http://octopart.com/api/home">Octopart API</a>&mdash;providing a pretty interesting way to maintain a bill of materials (BOM), across multiple providers.</p>
<p>Octopart's approach to using both Microsoft Excel, and Google Spreadsheets as an interface for the average business person is pretty interesting, not because it is the perfect technological solution, but because it brings the value of APIs closer to the actual business problem owners.</p>
<p>Octopart <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">helped increase my awareness of spreadsheets being in conjunction with APIs</a>, but after seeing other providers like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio using Google Spreadsheet for storing SMS</a>, and the increased usage of <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers like Zapier</a>, making me think spreadsheets have quite a future in the API space.</p>

<p>I am super stoked to announce that we have Andrew Nacin (<a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a>), the lead developer from WordPress keynoting <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago</a> next month. We are looking to continue the conversation around an official WordPress API, scheduled for inclusion in the WordPress 4.1 release.</p>
<p>While an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">API for WordPress may not seem like anything that big</a>, when you think about it being baked into WordPress by default, it means that over 60 million websites will potentially get an API, and 22% of the top 10 million websites run WordPress&mdash;a pretty significant shift.</p>
<p>WordPress is still taking feedback on their upcoming API release, and you can <a href="http://wp-api.org/">visit their website and participate there</a>, and now you can also come to Chicago the end of September, and hear Andrew talk about his work at WordPress, and participate in the convversation around the WordPress API afterwards in the halls.</p>
<p>Make sure and <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/register.php">get registered soon</a>, you only have 4 weeks left before we all come together for @APIStrat in Chicago.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heroku/heroku-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The new <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button">Heroku Button</a> gets us one step closer to a new age of API deployment, where anyone can deploy the APIs they need without any developer or IT resources. As I&rsquo;m working on packaging up API designs for my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation API</a>, this type of approach is what I&rsquo;m envisioning for all of my APIs in the future&mdash;push button API deployment.</p>
<p>You shouldn't have to wait to deploy the API you need. Just as we are beginning to deploy pre-packaged application stacks like Wordpress, and Drupal, we should be able to deploy common API deployments for images, blogs, videos, and much, much more, with a single click of a button. Once any new API is launched it can be configured, and connected to other systems using the API, allowing it to operate as part of larger stack, or stay as completely independent node &nbsp;that just checks in with the mother ship from time to time.</p>
<p>While there will remain a handful of API leaders like Twilio and SendGrid who will have a big presence, many of the APIs in this next wave of API deployment will be smaller, and more transient in nature, taking advantage of current cloud trends around PaaS, and containerization.  This new type of APis will possess a self contained blueprint for the OS, database, server-side code, API definition, and even configuration, integration, and automation tooling for the API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on Docker definitions for <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">creen capture</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation AP</a>, as well as other APIs I develop in the future, but first I think any API I deisn shouldl run as a Heroku app, that anyone can deploy in their own account with a single click of a button. It won't take much work to make this happen for any API I deploy, and since <a title="3Scale API Infrastructure" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, which I use to secure my APIs, already <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/deploying-apis-using-heroku-and-3scale-addon/">runs on Heroku</a>--making securing, and managing my Heroku deployed APis seamless.</p>

<p>The other night I was <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/18/all-government-should-have-a-social-media-directory-api/">writing about the need for a social media directory API</a>, like the one <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/">the GSA has launched for the federal government</a>, but specifically for the City of Chicago. I was trying to get a list of each of the City of Chicago Twitter accounts, and while I&rsquo;m glad there is a <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/narr/misc/social_media.html">central social media account list</a>, I always want an API so I can eliminate the need for data entry.</p>
<p>After I posted my story, Oliver Seiler (<a href="https://twitter.com/0seiler">@0seiler</a>) emailed me the <a href="https://www.govt.nz/api/v1">API endpoint for the New Zealand Government Directory API</a>, which doesn't include the social media information that our <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">federal government social media directory API</a> delivers, but offers another look at what one possible pattern for government directory APIs is.</p>
<p>This is one of the by-products of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">my profiling of federal government APIs</a>, that I will begin to see API patterns that ALL government possess, things like a directory API. There should be a WordPress of the government directory API, a open source PHP Web API, possessing a common API definition, allowing any government agency, of any level, to be able to quickly download and deploy a directory API for their branch of government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping when I&rsquo;m done with my profiling of 120 federal government APIs, I'll have better suggestions of which APIs patterns government agencies should be offering by default. I will also have API definitions for all of these government API patterns, which I can probably pretty quickly crank out server side API code to support&mdash;who knows maybe <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">Wordpress 4.1 will be available by then and I can use Wordpress as an API deployment framework</a>.</p>
<p>Until then I will just start tracking on all the common patterns for government API deployment, and publish as stories her on API Evangelist, and on my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">federal government research site</a>. I'm thinking other things I'm tracking on, like API deployment using containers, and deployment via PaaS platforms like Heroku, will contribute to this type of API deployment across government as well, making it a very interesting time to be in tech.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">I stumbled across a cool resource out of Heroku today, their </a><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">HTTP API design guide</a>, which intends to direct practices for API design on the Heroku API platform.</p>
<p>Heroku&rsquo;s goals around APIs design are, "consistency and focusing on business logic while avoiding design bikeshedding&rdquo;.  They put out the guide to drive consistent aPI design practices at Heroku, but are also interested in sharing with the wider API community.</p>
<p>I think API design best practices are something every API provider should have, and publish publicly (on Github). I think it is ok to even fork, and modify existing guides like Heroku&rsquo;s or maybe <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">from 18F out of federal government</a>. This most important thing is that you have a guide that can guide your team, or other teams within your organization.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-bread.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my monitoring of the API space, when I started seeing a large number of blog posts, tweets, companies, and other elements I track on get tagged with the same tag over and over, I take notice. My blogging, CRM, and news curation system all have their own <a href="http://theapistack.com/">tag cloud interface</a> for the week, showing which tags have been applied--so if a tag gets heavy usage, I know it.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I've spun up new research into other areas within the world of APIs, beyond my core <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, and <a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> research. I created separate buckets beyond just provide and consume to track on these new areas, called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">trends</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/opportunities/">opportunities</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/priorities/">priorities</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014 it is beginning to seem like each of my trend research areas are getting baked directly into API platforms, ranging from real-time features with Firebase, to reciprocity by default using Zapier. API providers are learning that having a real-time layer, or a reciprocity layer baked into their platform is a good thing, and why reinvent the wheel when you have kick ass solutions like <a title="Firebase" href="http://bit.ly/1w9oJSq">Firebase</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/SzPnEh">Zapier</a>.</p>
<p>It makes sense that API providers would be looking externally to deliver&nbsp;<a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a>, <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and even <a title="Voice APIs" href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a> layers for their API platforms--this stuff is hard, and why spread yourself too thin. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">Intuit just bought reciprocity provider itDuzzit</a>, and I think we will more providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">integrating Zapier into their platforms by default like Nimble did</a>. We'll also see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">more API platforms bring in Firebase as a real-time layer like Nest did for their Internet of Things (Iot) thermostat API platform</a>.</p>
<p>Overall it seems like a white label solution that any API provider could put to use when considering solutions for aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice or even data solutions including spreadsheet connectors, analysis, and visualization, would do well in the space. At the very least, any company looking to step up and provide solutions in these areas, should definitely have a strong partner program like Zapier and Firebase have brought to the table.</p>
<p>I will have to start considering how to migrate aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice out of the trends bucket and into either the provide or consume buckets, or maybe both. It would seem that both API providers and consumers need to be educated in these areas, and made aware of what solutions are available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that worried about the overall structure of API Evangelist at the moment. That is one of the beautiful aspects of how I architected the site(s), is that each research area lives as its own node on the network, so I can move around, shift as I need to find the right formula&mdash;something that helps me in a very fast moving space, where my understanding is constantly shifting and evolving with the swift currents of the APi space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first wrote about <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">openFDA</a> back in June, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">showcasing the launch of their new developer area</a>, and I'm happy to see they aren't missing a beat when it comes to launching new APIs. I recently saw that openFDA just launch a new endpoint, called the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/label/">Drug Label API</a>, which allows you to query over 60K prescriptions and over-the-counter drug labels.</p>
<p>It is satisfying to see such a large government agency find their API mojo. The original spark at the FDA was lit by Presidential Innovate Fellow Sean Herron (<a href="https://twitter.com/seanherron">@seanherron)</a>, but most recently Sean has handed off the iniative to an internal team who will keep they platform moving forward using the same formula.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/Drug_facts_label_gl01.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond just the API, openFDA is also seriously putting the "open" in openFDA with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fda/openfda">Public Repo on GitHub&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">Extensive Community Q&amp;A on StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open.fda.gov/terms/">Progress Terms of Service for Government</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything the openFDA is doing provides a great blueprint for other agencies to follow, from their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">creative evolution of the interactive API documentation</a>, to encouraging other federal agencies to fork, and use the openFDA TOS in their own platforms.</p>
<p>The work coming out of the FDA makes me happy, because it sets a strong example that other agencies can follow, provides the rest of us with something positive that we can highlight when working to change public opinion, but also because it is such extremely vital data, and should be available in full download, and API format so that it can stimulate web and mobile app development, and system integration across the private sector.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m adding <a href="https://platform.pokitdok.com">PokitDok</a>, a simple API for healthcare to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, and my overall <a href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com/">APIs in healthcare research</a>. Well I didn't exactly add them, PokitDok added themselves to my healthcare research by forking the Github repository, and adding themselves to the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/healthcare/blob/gh-pages/data/companies.json">JSON data source</a>&mdash;once I received the pull request, I accepted, and they were published on the site.</p>
<p>Usually once a week I spend time to manually adding new companies I've come across in my monitoring of the API space, but being a one man show I can&rsquo;t find everything across this massively expanding space. This is why I depend on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> to help me curate the best from across the space. Not everyone knows that the entire API Evangelist network of <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ research projects</a> all runs on Github, which allows anyone to help write posts, curate industry news, and maintain the lists of API providers.</p>
<p>As soon as I accepted the pull request for PokitDok, I also tagged them as &ldquo;API Stack&rdquo;, which immediately adds PokitDok to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, listed under healthcare. No matter which doorway a company enters, I will make sure they get published to all appropriate research areas across the API Evangelist network, using my tagging system.</p>
<p>Thanks PokitDok for adding yourself, and I look forward to paying attention to the good things coming our of your API platform via your <a href="https://pokitdok.com/blog/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokitDok">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pokitdok">Github</a> profiles.</p>

<p>I depend on a <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/14/details-about-the-52-online-services-i-depend-on/">number of cloud services to make my personal and business world go round</a>. Even as a programmer, who can hand code just about any script to integrate, automate, and orchestrate my world, I find myself using more reciprocity services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity providers</a> are one of the most important evolutions of the API space, because they make the whole world of APis accessible to the normals, and not just to the geek crowd. My time is valuable, and personally I'd rather being using existing tools and services, rather than re-inventing the wheel, and when it comes to orchestrating my online life, I need all the help I can, which is why I am looking IFTTT and Zapier for help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using both platforms in 2014, but as I do with any other software I&rsquo;ve been dating for any sustained period, I start looking at getting a little more serious. This is where I have to part ways with IFTTT, and other other platforms that don&rsquo;t have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">clear relief valves for their free tier</a>, allowing me to start paying monthly or annually for my use of their service, and sensibly scale up as my needs grow.</p>
<p>Zapier has a pretty straightforward <a href="https://zapier.com/app/pricing">pricing framework</a>, giving you just enough room to get hooked, then you can pay for more usage as needed. Having a free tier for any cloud service is essential, but having a tiered business model, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">clear monetization strategy</a>, so I know that you will be around in the future, is a requirement.</p>
<p>I will keep my IFTT account to play with, but when it comes operating my business, continuing to integrate Zapier into my workflow makes sense as they have a clear business model that fits my needs. Plus <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">Zapier has an API</a>. Ummmm&hellip;hello? An API for your automation and integration layer across all the services you depend on, via their APIs--how cool is that!</p>
<p>When launching your own APIs, make sure it has a clear, visible, intuitive and ascendable service framework--it is something that will go a long way in helping companies decide if they will use your APIs, or not.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.uber.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/uber-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The sharing economy is booming, and with the release of the <a href="https://developer.uber.com/">Uber API</a>, the attention on this space will only increase. Personally I&rsquo;m only  interested in the surface area of the API that Uber has released, and what it tells about the opportunity for API designers in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>I think the surface area of the Uber API is pretty minimal, but very significant when you look at it as a glimpse of what is to come, as the sharing economy gets a direct pipeline to the API economy, and the resulting app economy. Oh yeah, I went there&mdash;I used all the economy buzzwords in once sentence. Seriously, I think the five endpoints that Uber launched with, are very telling:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/products</li>
<li>/estimates/price</li>
<li>/estimates/time</li>
<li>/history</li>
<li>/me</li>
</ul>
<p>These API endpoints represent the beginning of the shared economy API surface area, and while there will be many additions, augmentations, and different takes on what APIs look like in the sharing economy, I predict many other providers will often emulate Uber in their own design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really equipped to make a judgement on the value or importance of the Uber API. What I can do is keep an eye on Uber, and other sharing economy startup and their APIs, and look for patterns across each of the implementations. Hopefully the space can remain true to their roots, and make sure the API definitions are shareable, and reusable across the flourishing sharing app sapce.</p>
<p>Uber is focused specifically in the transportation portion of the sharing economy, and this makes me consider the bigger picture, and who will step up to serve the larger sharing economy, with an Uber API platform for the sharing economy. I think much like the wider API space, as the sharing API space matures out there will lots of opportunities for aggregation, real-time, automation, messaging, payments, and other API essentials that are in service of the sharing economy.</p>

<p>I tag a lot of interesting companies that show up during my weekly API monitoring. When I see a tag go from 1 or 2, to over 5 companies--I take a closer look to see what is going on. An increase in the number of companies focusing in a specific area could be a trend, or it could be nothing.</p>
<p>The tag "API Agency" ticked over to 6 today, when I added&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aquevix.com/">Aquevix</a>, an indian company that is focusing on API development. As of August 2014 I now have six separate agency style companies that I've found who have a focus on API design and development:</p>

<p>We'll see how many more dev shops I find in the next couple months. Sometimes when I start focusing in a new area I will find more companies working in the same area, purely because I'm looking harder, and sometimes it takes time for things to actually heat up.</p>
<p>As I'm looking at local Chicago web and mobile development shops during the lead up to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practce in Chicago</a> next month, and I'm learning that many small shops like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">SYDCON</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Blaze Portfolio</a> are using APIs, they just havn't shifted their marketing and web site content to reflect the evolution.</p>
<p>It won't take much for many of these web and mobile development shops to standardize their API design and development services, much like the evolution we saw occur from web to mobile development, shifting the focus of the small dev shop to better serve a growing demand for API design, and development. I think by 2015 I'll see over 50 development shops, who are heavily focused on API design and developmennt in my API tracking system.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking with a very nice recruiter over at Google over the last couple weeks, and she has been so kind in keeping me updated about opportunities for evangelism at Google. This is the 3rd round of talks I've had with Google while being the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, talks that historically go nowhere because of their programming test, which is a super silly aspect of their HR process.</p>
<p>I was straight up with the Google recruiter a couple of weeks ago when she first emailed me, and again when we talked on the phone last week&mdash;I do not take programming tests to open up doors for employment conversations, sorry. ;-( It is a waste of my time, and yours, and doesn&rsquo;t measure shit. I understand that you have to qualify large number of folks, at your very algorithmic-centric company, but when it comes to measuring what I do, a programming test isn&rsquo;t a thing.</p>
<p>If programming a tic-tac-toe game on a live screen share is what you need to open up a conversation with professionals around evangelizing your platform, you need to look elsewhere. Nowhere in my role as the API Evangelist do I have to code under time pressure with someone else watching, sorry. I would even say, having hacker skills, trumps programming skills in a public facing evangelism role, and speed, quality of code go out the window. This is about making connections through hacker storytelling, something that doesn't always pencil out to producing best code, and is more about helping people understand what is possible using a platform, in the most meaningful way&mdash;requiring more focus on the person and their problems, not the code or algorthm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to have man very meaningful conversations with other tech giants like Intel, IBM, large institutions like UC Berkeley, BYU, and establish fruitful relationships with partners like 3Scale and API Spark, and across federal agencies like Department of Education, Energy, NASA, and the White House around APIs--all without taking programming tests. I talk to startups, SMBs, SMEs, organizations, institutions, and government agencies a lll the time, and never have to code under pressure, in front of an audience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not under the influence that I will change your hiring practices Google&mdash;you are a very smart, and successful company. All I&rsquo;m saying is you are probably filtering out some pretty talented folks, who are extremely passionate and knowledgeable in what they do, and connected in their space, and when you won&rsquo;t engage in meaningful conversations without a programming test, your missing out.</p>
<p>I actually prefer working with organizations from the outside in, I think it better reflects the essence of API Evangelism. The companies who have trouble working with outside entities, without tradition HR processes, are probably not going to lead when it comes developing an API driven ecosystem.</p>
<p>If your company doesn't have the time to research me, and understand what I bring to the API space, and what my skills are, we probably aren't a fit. Everything about me is available online at <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">Github</a>--you just have to look.

<p>If you follow <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog">Twilio blog</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/twilio">Twitter account</a> you can always find a good API story from the API leader. It also makes me happy to see trends I&rsquo;m seeing from other provider re-enforced by the API heavyweight. This time is providing spreadsheet integration with common API resources, like Twilio SMS.</p>
<p>Twilio has a pretty slick tool they call <a href="http://twiliosheet.azurewebsites.net/">TwilioSheet</a> that allows you to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet, and created a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/connecting-twilio-sms-to-google-spreadsheet.html">pretty nice walkthrough of the entire setup</a>. Providing this type of functionality helps, as Twilio says, "make it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet&rdquo;&mdash;<strong>emphasis on the non-developers.</strong></p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet is the #1 database solution in the world, and provide a huge opportunity when it comes to bridging the world of APIs with the wider business landscape. This is something that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers like Zapier</a> have bridging for a while now, and something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">API providers like Intuit are looking to bank into their API platforms</a>.</p>
<p>When you see Twilio doing something like providing providing spreadsheet integration for their API platform, you have to stop and consider whether or not it is something that might work for your own API platform. Spreadsheet integration by default with API your driven resources is a great way to expand the reach of any API, bringing these valuable resources within reach of the actual, everyday problem owners.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.producthunt.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/product-hunt/product-hunt-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It can be hard to keep up with what the latest geek trends are--where all of the latest digital watering holes are&nbsp;(especially when your old), that allow you to find the latest info, conversations, and links to everything cool and hip. I depend on my network of API peeps for tips, and last week I was introduced to a new place that I wanted to pass on to you, called <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Product Hunt does a good job of describing what they do:</p>
<blockquote><em>Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the site open for the last five days, scanning for cool tech creations that grab my attention, and when I opened the tab today, I noticed that APIs dominated the top of the list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.producthunt.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/product-hunt/product-hunt-api.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>You see the Uber API (of course), and Zapier both jockeying for top slots, as well as Product Hunts API too. Product Hunt allows you to post product name, tagline, and url for any web, mobile or single page app&mdash;a format that is perfect for publishing and sharing your individual API resource creations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be adding Product Hunt as an <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelism building block</a>, publishing my own API creations, as well as encouraging my API readers to do the same. The platform seems like a great way to show off your API, and generate buzz (or not) around each API resource we bring to the table.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.intuit.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/intuit/intuitbig.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2014/08/13/intuit-acquires-itduzzit-syncing-data-between-cloud-apps-gets-easier">itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit</a>.  Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">reciprocity providers</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been seeing more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs</a>. I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers.</p>
<p>The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers have the potential to reach beyond a core developer audience by:</p>
<blockquote><em>The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required.  With their technology combined with the range of QuickBooks platform services we already offer, the breadth and depth of integrations our partners can build will grow tremendously. itDuzzit&rsquo;s sophisticated rules-based engine really set them apart from the competition, and their technology benefits the entire QuickBooks Online ecosystem: third-party developers, accountants and small businesses.</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cloud.itduzzit.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/intuit/itduzzit.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The world of accounting seems like a great place to start when providing interoperability, automation, and reciprocity tools that are not just developers, but also empower end-users to use API. If you are as advanced as Zapier, <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">even your reciprocity layer will have an API that developers</a>&nbsp;can&nbsp;put to use when taking advantage of the cross platform API integration and automation possibilities.</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on the <a href="https://developer.intuit.com">Intuit partner Platform</a>, and see what they end up doing with itDuzzit.  According to the press release, "<em>The Intuit and itDuzzit teams are already collaborating to fold the technology into the Intuit Partner Platform&rdquo;</em>, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see some interesting API reciprocity patterns that I can highlight here on API Evangelist, and other API providers can follow when considering their own reciprocity layer for their own platform</p>
