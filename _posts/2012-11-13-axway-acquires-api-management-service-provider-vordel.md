{% include JB/setup %}<p>I don’t know if you saw the big news last week, but software publisher Axway announced intent to acquire API service provider Vordel.I’m not a big fan of covering funding, acquisition or launch press releases, unless there a significant business story there.But the acquisition of Vordel is another important sign for the API industry in 2012.Financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, but the acquisition shows the API industry is maturing and producing desirable companies with proven API products, that larger software companies can use as a competitive advantage.While Vordels API management, SOA governance and identity management will help Axway’s customers, I think Vordel’s customers is probably the type of new client large software companies will want be also seeking out through acquisitions.</p>
