I am invited to speak at the [Washington DC API User Group][1], next Thursday January 31st 2013, at the NPR offices in Washington D.C.

It looks like a pretty sweet linup of people, gathering for API meetup:

  * 18:00 - 18:30 Food, drinks and networking
  * 18:30 - 18:40 Welcome and introductions
  * 18:40 - 18:55 Ben Balter, Presidential Innovation Fellow, MyGov
  * 18:55 - 19:10 Kin Lane, API Evangelist
  * 19:10 - 19:25 David Hale, PM for Pillbox, National Library of Medicine
  * 19:25 - 19:40 Eric Herzog, Open Data Specialist, World Bank
  * 19:40 - 19:55 Private sector presenter TBA
  * 19:55 - 20:00 Refill your beverage
  * 20:00 - 20:30 Panel discussions with Alex Howard, O'Reilly Media
  * 20:30 - 21:00 Networking

If you are in Washington DC, make sure and come by and join in the API conversation, and say hello.

I find myself talking APIs in Washington D.C. more than any other city, except for San Francisco.  

Which is a good thing!  Its one of the most important places we need to be having API discussions, so its good to see the energy from folks.
