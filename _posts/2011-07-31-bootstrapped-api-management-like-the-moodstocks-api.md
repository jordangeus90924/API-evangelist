{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was reviewing the image recognition API from Moodstocks, for a story on ProgrammableWeb today, and discovered another API management story I feel should be told.Its a story about bootstrapping your API management using existing free and low cost services.Before users adopt your API, it can be hard to justify costs around using paid API management services to support your developer ecosystem (because at that stage the ecosystem often doesnt exist).Moodstocks approach to its API community was a great example of bootstrapping API management until you can afford more.For managing its documentation, code libraries, articles and FAQs, Moodstocks turned to Github for help.</p>
