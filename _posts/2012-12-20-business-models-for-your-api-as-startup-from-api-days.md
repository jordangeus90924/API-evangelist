Here is a video of one of my talks from [API Days in Paris][1], France where I walked through potential thoughts on business model for a hypothetical startup. Â I had a separate talk prepared, but after attending the first day I went and found a french cafe, drank a couple bottles of wine, took what I learned and produced this talk.

If you want to see my slide deck from this talk, you can find a published version [business for your API as a startup][2], using deck.js off my talks sections of API Evangelist.

Thanks again to [Faber Novel][3] and [Webshell][4] for putting on such a great event, and producing these cool videos.
