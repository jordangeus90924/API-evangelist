<a title="Howard Liptzin" href="http://twitter.com/howardliptzin">Howard Liptzin</a>, at Avatar Industries prefers a more <a title="organic approach to growing an API community" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">organic approach growing an API community</a>. In his own words:
<blockquote>
     What you'll want to do is to create the conditions for a community to form, thrive, produce and grow.
</blockquote>Liptzin emphasises gardening over engineering, not managing your community, more facilitate. Before you even start, Liptzin offers a little advice:
<blockquote>
     Make sure your API actually solves a problem that merits solving!
</blockquote>Then Liptzin identifies five areas to address when growing your API ecosystem:
<ul >
     <li>Creation
     </li>
     <li>Activation
     </li>
     <li>Retention
     </li>
     <li>Productivity
     </li>
     <li>Growth
     </li>
</ul>It is great to see other API owners and evangelists share their philosophies and approach to growing their community.
