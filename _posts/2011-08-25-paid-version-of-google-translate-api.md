{% include JB/setup %}<p>Back in May Googledeprecatedthe free version of the Google Translate API, and pissed off a lot of people along the way.I talked about building your business around Google or any other APIs, and even suggested that Google offer a paid version of the API instead of just shutting down.Today Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API that provides a programmatic interface to access Googles machine translation technology, supporting translations in over 50 languages.The paid version of Google Translate API costs $20 per million (M) characters of text translated (or approximately $0.05/page, assuming 500 words/page), and allows up to 50 M chars/month.</p>
