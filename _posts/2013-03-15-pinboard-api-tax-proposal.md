{% include JB/setup %}<p>Maciej Ceglowskiis, the founder of popular social bookmarking platform Pinboard,made an interesting proposal over on the Pinboard Google Group: Ive been thinking about imposing an API tax, the proceeds of which would go into improving API infrastructure and offsetting operating costs, structured along these lines: API free to use for your own Pinboard account Every API client making requests on behalf of someone else must register an app identifier $20/year tax if your app makes requests for over 100 Pinboard accounts $100/year tax if your app makes requests for over 1000 Pinboard accounts Possibly additional price levels to waive certain rate limits Think of it as a road tax that then pays for further construction, repair, and people in orange vests.I’m guessing that Maciej has a lot of experience to back his proposal, watching how developers use Pinboard for their own purposes, or on behalf of a user via a client.I heavily depend on Pinboard for my curation at API Evangelist, so API access would remain free for me.I’m not sure how I would feel if I was building a client.On the forum, there is very interesting feedback from Matt Schmidt, developer of PinDroid, the leading Pinboard client for Android: Im very much against this.</p>
