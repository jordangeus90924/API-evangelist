			<p><em>04 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>Elasticsearch, the open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine just announced that it is introducing a security layer on top of their API driven search platform. Historically you have to secure any APIs exposed via Elasticsearch through your own proxy or firewall solution, now with "Shield" you can natively manage your APIs directly in Elasticsearch. Shield, in the same spirit of Marvel, is built on top of Elasticsearch public extensions points, and is easily installed as a plugin to add security features to any existing Elasticsearch installation. It does not require a different distribution of Elasticsearch, and relies heavily on the open public APIs Elasticsearch already exposes. The security Elasticsearch is bringing to the table reflects the core features you see in the API space from&nbsp;API infrastructure providers like 3Scale--providing the basics of what you need to secure access to API endpoints: Role-based Access Control - Set granular cluster, index, and alias-level permissions for each user of your Elasticsearch cluster. For example, allow the marketing department to freely search and analyze social media data with read-only permissions, while preventing access to sensitive financial data. Authentication System Support - Shield integrates with LDAP-based authentication systems as well as Active Directory, so your users don&rsquo;t need to remember yet another password. We also provide a native authentication system, for those who want to manage all access within Elasticsearch. Encrypted Communications - Node-to-node encryption protects your data from intruders. With certificate-based SSL/TLS encryption and secure client communications with HTTPS, Shield keeps data traveling over the wire protected. Audit Logging - Ensure compliance and keep a pulse on security-related activity happening in your Elasticsearch deployment; record login failures and attempts to access unauthorized information. I've had Elasticsearch in the API deployment research project for some time now, but now I will add it to my&nbsp;API management research as well. If you can manage your API access, user roles, and generate log files for analytics from Elasticsearch API endpoints,...[<a href="/2014/11/04/moving-elasticsearch-into-api-management-with-new-api-security-and-access-features/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm beginning to see just about every building  block in the design, deployment, management, and integration of APIs evolve into individual startups who are looking to provide services to the API sector. I wrote about Apimatic a few months back and how they are focused on generating high quality SDKs from machine readable API formats like Swagger and API Blueprint.
This last week I was introduced to another provider, Magnet, and their rest2mobile service which will &ldquo;generate mobile native code for REST services&rdquo;.  Magnet has chosen to focus exclusively on mobile SDKs, where Apimatic is focused on web and mobile SDKs. I consider web SDKs one building block, and mobile SDKs another building block, and companies should evaluate their need for them side-by-side, something service providers like Apimatic and Magnet are looking to assist with.
As the API universe continues its expansion we will see more API services like these emerge who are focused on helping API providers better deliver the building blocks of their API platforms. I will keep tracking on the common building blocks of API design, deployment, management and integration, and continue to showcase interesting companies stepping up to provide services that deliver the valuable building blocks the space needs to operate.

			<p><em>03 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>It makes me happy to see new arrivals in the world of API management service providers, especially after all the consolidation we saw last year with many of the 1st and 2nd wave of providers like Mashery, Vordel, Layer7, and Apiphany. One of the new API management providers that have emerged is Readme, who is looking to provide an attractive, simple, and intuitive way to launch developer portals for your APIs. Readme reminds me of some of the landing page tools designed for web marketers over the last decade, to provide informative gateways for site visitors, but ReadMe is all about providing meaningful doorways to our API resources. First, I like ReadMe's definition of what is a developer hub? Documentation - Topical guides, tutorials and troubleshooting. API Reference - Low-level, deep-dive reference material. Community - Provide support and answer questions. Their definition of what is a developer hub is goes beyond just the technical documentation as what many developers see, and acknowledges that your portal should be about providing the resources necessary to educate API consumers, and potentially build community around their needs. ReadMe provides the essential building blocks I'd expect of any modern API portal builder: Theme Builder - Easily create a beautiful dev community that matches your brand. Editor - Markdown-based drag-and-drop editor makes documentation almost fun. API Explorer - Let users play with your API right inside the documentation. Application Keys - Your users can view their application keys embedded right in the docs. Support - Let users ask questions and request features in the support forums. Then ReadMe goes a little further to include some concepts that I see in some of the leading API providers, features that go beyond just basic features, allowing you to better manage your API portal: Collaboration - Crowdsource your docs! Users can keep docs current by suggesting changes. GitHub Sync - Keep auto-generated reference docs synced with your actual code changes. Versioning - Maintaining old...[<a href="/2014/11/03/new-api-management-providers-clean-modern-api-portals-with-readme/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>I know. I&rsquo;m kind of a broken record this week, but I&rsquo;m trying to quantify the business model, and monetization strategies of APIs across various industries, and understanding what companies are charging for their services just makes me crazy sometimes. I don&rsquo;t know what people are thinking when they craft their approach to explaining what an API will cost to access.
Here is an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about over at Stocklytics. When you land on Stocklytics home page, this is what you see:

After spending some time looking for anything else about pricing, I signed up for the service, and after I logged in to my account I found this page, which then takes me directly to a Paypal page:

Do companies even think about what this does to the on-boarding process? I&rsquo;m not evening focusing on the errors in my brand new developer account that I had to contend with before I discovered the add credits page. At this point, why would use this service? Even if the data is amazing? You just bullshitted me into signing up for your service. There was never a mention of cost until I signed up.
This is one of the things I love about the API space--the dead simple lessons in the value of honesty and transparency. I really don&rsquo;t care how you structure the pricing for API, I&rsquo;ll let developers vote with their usage of your API decide that. What I do care about is how you communicate your pricing. There really isn&rsquo;t any reason to hide your pricing&mdash;just be straight up about it, and I bet you&rsquo;ll do a lot more business as a result.

			<p><em>03 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>When you look through as many APIs as I do, you start to get a feeling for many of the subtle signals, that can result in a wealth of information about the actual viability of an API. One signal I'm starting to track on more is pricing, and I'm gathering more details about how an API provider articulates their pricing, or often times doesn&rsquo;t. The way an API provider discusses their business model can tell you so much about their motivations, the amount of resources they have available, and the experience they have in managing APIs and engaging developers. Pundits in the space love to talk about the viability of public vs private API, and that public APIs just aren't viable, and will be going away soon. When in reality the public vs. private discussion is not the issue, it is lack of business model, and monetization strategy that is the real tell in all of this. Public APIs like Twilio and Amazon do not have a problem, because they have put a lot of thought into their business models, and their pricing is well thought out, competitive, and front and center in their API developer areas--they aren't in danger because they are public?? DOH! The companies who will be shuttering their API programs often do not have clear pricing on their site, reducing pricing to be simply a question in the FAQ, and something you have to request more information on. Many companies are trained in sales techniques and are just looking to apply this knowledge in the world of APIs, but I&rsquo;d say for many of the companies I evaluate, hiding or obfuscating your pricing is not about entrenched sales practices, it is more about exploitation at every turn. As I go through the 700 API companies in my API Stack, I&rsquo;m tracking on the details of their business model, and will be judging APIs on how they showcase their pricing (or don't)....[<a href="/2014/11/03/i-trust-api-providers-more-when-api-pricing-is-front-and-center/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I'm just going to keep putting my ideas out there, so that y'all will build what is needed for the API space. In support of my API design tool, and my interactive API documentation tool, I want a Swagger generated visualization layer for APIs, using D3.js.
I&rsquo;m envisioning a whole marketplace of visualizations I can choose from, driven from various popular APIs like Twitter, Crunchbase, OpenCorporates, and much more. There are number of proprietary data visualizations tools emerging out there (I&rsquo;m watching you), but what I'm looking for is specifically an open solution using D3.js.
I don't have a problem if there are premium layers, and features that are driven by commercial APIs, or there being added charges for API consumption in general, but I want the visualization, and underlying JSON to be open and configurable&mdash;encouraging access and re-use.
It can be tough to help people understand just exactly what an API is, and I feel like an open visualization layer using D3.js, driven from Swagger would be one of the quickest ways to help people understand exactly what value an API can deliver.

			<p><em>30 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m going through each of the 100+ business sectors I track on as part of my API Stack. As I make my way through each sector, and generate Swagger, and APIs.json files, the language of the resources used across a particular sector starts to come into focus. I&rsquo;m talking about the words used for crafting URLs, parameters, and the underlying data models for common APIs. In a perfect world everyone would come together and use something like Schema.org, and work to extend, in an organized, collaborative way across different industries&mdash;I would call this the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) approach. Unfortunately what we have is a shitload of dialects popping up, driven from the dark depths of our legacy IT infrastructure, only seeing the light of day when an API gets exposed, and the dialect used by an isolated IT tribe all of a sudden becomes part of the mainstream world. Some weeks my inbox seems to reflect where my research is going, and as I ponder the language used by popular news sites like NYTimes, USA Today, and NewsCred, I get an email from a reader in Europe, who works at the equivalent of BBC their country, who asks: Currently I'm thinking about the API vocabulary and i wonder if there is some kind of standard out there when it comes to the verbs, parameters, etc. that are used for Media/Broadcaster API`s. I think there should be some kind of standard (used by netflix, bbc, espn, abc, etc..) Do you have any idea if there is such a standard? If there is a schema.org for the broadcasting industry I&rsquo;m unaware of it. As I generate a crude dictionary for each of my API Stack business sectors I will stop, and conduct some due diligence on what is already out there for each industry regarding standards, etc. I&rsquo;m assuming if there is, it won't always be Internet ready, let alone API ready, but hopefully there is...[<a href="/2014/10/30/establishing-common-dictionaries-that-industries-can-use-in-their-api-design/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>Throughout 2014, when I look at the top 10 posts in my Google Analytics dashboard each month, there has been a consistent theme of what stories are driving page views. The concept of a page is only one metric I look at when evaluating where the API space might be going, and while I don&rsquo;t write stories specifically to page views, they do provide me with a general barometer of what my readers are interested in. I&rsquo;m seeing give areas consistently generating the most views across the API Evangelist Network: Internal APIs - This slot is pretty much dominated by The Secret To Amazons Success Is Internal story getting thousands of page view each month, even with being written back in January of 2012. Single Page App Tooling - Simple, easy to use formable single page apps like my CSV Converter, and my Data.Ongithub.com produce some really long lasting traffic, providing value to users. API Design - This is definitely the topic of 2014, with all of my stories talking about API design tools like Swagger and API Blueprint dominating the top 10. Hypermedia - Its time has come in 2014, and hypermedia stories like What Are Some Examples of Hypermedia APIs are popular with developers, and non-developers when it comes to understand what hypermedia is all about. API Roundups - A pretty proven formula of rounding up listings of APIs for a specific purpose, the only difference is when I do it, I personally look at each API and make sure there is something there, defining what I consider to be API stacks or collections. I&rsquo;ll revisit this at the end of the year and see if it still stands up. For me it provides some sort of map of where my readers heads are at, and by no means is any measurement of where the API space is going, but is at least a place to start thinking about what is on people&rsquo;s...[<a href="/2014/10/29/top-5-most-popular-themes-on-api-evangelist-in-2014/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I was taking a look through the NewsCred API yesterday and there was a parameter I have seen before, but find interesting, and wanted to share with you. It was a field called query_fields, which you could include the fields you wished to have searched, using a keyword provided in the parameter &ldquo;q&rdquo;.
You often see a parameter which determines which fields I get back with my response, but I like the concept of have a parameter to choose which fields I want searched in the first place. I think it is a simple, parameter based way to give developers more control over their API calls, in a way that will make sense to a wide audience.
Now I need to figure out a way to aggregate these simple little API design tricks and make them available to readers when they are designing their APIs. My goal is to help API designers make their APIs as powerful as possible, while keeping the surface area as simple as possible along the way.

			<p><em>29 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>The production environment for delivering web and mobile applications has radically evolved in the last couple years, becoming more distributed, scalable, virtualized, and containerized. APIs, and new development frameworks are providing a smorgasbord of resources for developers to put to work, and devops is putting more power and control, throughout the development life cycle, directly into a developers hands. It is time that a developers environment evolves to keep pace with the environment developers are building applications for. I&rsquo;ve been talking about containerization in the API space&nbsp;for a while now, something that is still a very manual process, so I have been looking out for a potential development environment that matches my vision for orchestration with APIs for some time now. This is why I was stoked when I ran into Tyler Jewell (@TylerJewell) back in September, who introduced me to Codenvy&mdash;"a new SaaS developer environment that allows developers to create hosted environments optimized for creating, editing, compiling, testing and debugging applications authored in different programming languages&rdquo;. At first glance Codenvy appears to be just another web-based IDE, with autocomplete, data source management, and Github integration. As you play with more you begin to realize you can configure and share projects, allowing you to setup environments, share and even clone them. Then you realize the whole IDE is configurable, clone-able, shareable, and scalable using the ever popular Docker, complete with API or CLI access to all work spaces, projects and files. This is the environment I was looking for&mdash;this is the orchestration I envision for building applications using APIs. My head is swimming with ideas of how I can orchestrate application development environments now that both the development and production environments are containerized, scalable, bite-size goodness, complete with a Github layer in the middle. While many users of Codenvy will be using to manage their own devop workflow, I will be pursuing it to manage my own infrastructure, but more importantly using it as a...[<a href="/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
This is a guest post from one of our sponsors. We didn&rsquo;t vet them as a sponsor, or the content they were going to write. We just cashed their check on the way to the strip club this evening, and gave the a Wordpress login, so they could post their post.
We aren&rsquo;t in the business of understanding where the actual technology space is headed, we are in the business of telling you stories of where we want the technology space go, in the service our own selfish desires. You see we view technology blogs as a PR urinal for us to piss our stories into, so we all can pretend like they are real stories.
Our technology is a cloud based REST-like hypermedia API micro services framework, that is deployed in a web-scale, reactive, docker containerized environment that run anywhere in the cloud or on-premise within your infrastructure, or a hybrid of the two. Our technology is priced to serve you, so just let us know what you want to do with it and we&rsquo;ll make up some price that we think you will pay.
Our product is what you need, and we are so convinced that we won&rsquo;t even bother making up a story, we&rsquo;ll just blow smoke straight up your ass. Since all of the tech blogs allow us to pay for the posting of our moose diarrhea, in your eyes, as a loyal reader and consumer of this shit, our technology immediately validated, solidifying it as the way of the future&mdash;it is the way it is, there is no denying the future.
P.S. Normally this type of story would be on Alternate Kin Lane, but I paid myself so much money I was able to buy a slot here on API Evangelist.

			<p><em>29 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>Another layer to the release of Codenvy this week, was the announcement of the Eclipse project Che, an open source "project to create a platform for SAAS developer environment that contains all of the tools, infrastructure, and processes necessary for a developer to edit, build, test, and debug an application&rdquo;. Che represents the next generation IDE that runs in the cloud, which coincides with other signs I've seen around API discovery moving into the IDE with signals from API pioneers like SalesForce&nbsp;and Google, or from Microsoft in Visual Studio. I&rsquo;m still learning about Che, but I&rsquo;m beginning to see two distinct ways Che and APIs can be employed. First lets start with the environment: You can build extensions for Che, and when those extensions are compiled into the kernel, Che creates server-side microservices, a RESTful API, and cross-browser optimized JavaScript, which is then pluggable into a browser IDE. With Che, developers are given the pluggable structure of Eclipse, but accessible through a cloud environment. This means you can orchestrate development workflows, with APIs. You can predefine, deploy, customize, maintain and orchestrate very modular development environment where everything can be controlled via API. What a perfect environment for orchestrating the next generation of application development. Next I see APIs leading the development lifecycle as well, not just defining the development environment and process. Earlier stories I&rsquo;ve done on API discovery via SDKs, showcase SaleForce and Google providing native discovery of their APIs directly in Eclipse. In an Eclipse Che driven development environment, you could define pre-built, or custom API stacks, bringing exactly the API resources developers will need and bake them directly into their IDE&mdash;meaning APIs find the developers, developers don&rsquo;t have to find their own APIs. This approach to API discovery via the IDE provides some various interesting opportunity for marrying with earlier thoughts I&rsquo;ve had around being an API broker. I can envision a future where API evangelism evolves to a point where you...[<a href="/2014/10/29/api-discovery-continues-its-move-into-the-ide-with-eclipse-che/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I really love the thought process around API design, and I am always looking for ways to push forward my craft. Telling stories is one way I do this, forcing me to make what I&rsquo;m doing understandable to a wider audience, which is also the exact thing I&rsquo;m trying to do with my API designs&mdash;mind blown! An example of this in action is with my link API, which I use in multiple places across my API monitoring system. The Link API has a pretty basic design, that reflect the resource, and its underlying database structure: /link/ (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) Title, Description, and URL I use this API in numerous ways, the original API design is very much based upon the resource that it is, a link. As a developer who understands REST, and very much comes from a world of databases, this works just fine. However much of the magic around my usage of links is defined in my code, and not in my API interface, something I&rsquo;d like to change. After having two separate conversations with folks about my link API, I experienced two very different motivations on using said link system, and came with very different perspectives on how to use mu ink API, that had nothing to do with the database or resource this API was born from. Archival Motivations One person I discussed my link API with wants to use it for archiving a link. When they pass the link to an API, if it isn't already recorded it logs the URL, and then grabs a screenshot of the page, as well as stores any HTML content present. This could be a one time archive, or they could also pass a parameter that would set up a daily, weekly or monthly archive to occur. Harvesting Desires The second person I discussed my link API with wants to use for harvesting of specific things from the page, and in this particular...[<a href="/2014/10/28/evolving-beyond-just-resources-towards-a-more-experience-based-api-design/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the benefits of APIs over download of data stores in the government space, and I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for other interesting examples of making data available via an API, as well as a full data download. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of research right now on the financial API space, and stumbled across Quandl, a data provider who has free access financial data APIs, while also selling access to premium databases.
Quandl has aggregated 7 financial and economic databases into one database solution that you can pay to download, or you can freely access via their unlimited use API--Quandl puts it like this:
All these new premium databases will of course automatically benefit from Quandl&rsquo;s free data-usage features: unrestricted API access, integration with 20+ libraries and tools, unlimited downloads in any format, multiple export and visualization options, and more. (Needless to say, the addition of these premium databases to Quandl will not change the &ldquo;free Quandl experience&rdquo; in any way. All data and all features that are currently available for free on Quandl, will remain free forever.)
It is an interesting approach to monetizing database assets, while also making freely available via an API. I&rsquo;m not exactly clear on what you get in database vs. the API with Quandl, but now that I have the &ldquo;building block&rdquo; identified, I will keep an eye out for other API providers who are doing similar things. Right now I&rsquo;m just looking at financial, banking, payment, and other commerce APIs, but I&rsquo;m sure there are other data providers doing similar things.

			<p><em>27 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve had several browser tabs open around the recent Snapchat security breach, hoping to craft an API-centric story around the whole affair. I think SmartBear covers the security lesson around the Snapchat breach well, my motivation in writing a story would be more about incentivizing popular mobile platforms like Snapchat to establish a robust approach to APIs, and provide a platform for everyone discuss the tech, business, and politics of application integration, rather than keeping it all in the dark. Your Application Programming Interface Surface Is Publicly Available As I play with tools like Charles, Runscope, API tools, and other proxy and application traffic management tools, I can easily map out the surface area of any iPhone application I have installed&mdash;providing me with a blueprint of an API, and potentially its underlying data model. If I can do this for your mobile app, you have a public API, regardless of how you view the world. Bring More Awareness, Control, Security, And Stability To Platform The benefits of have a public API approach to delivering a public mobile application gives you a new layer to understand how not just your mobile app is using resources, it gives you a central channel for al mobile, web, and Internet of Things apps to use. An API focus gives you a central point to log how resources are being access and put to use, introduce analytics, monitoring, and other vital security components into operations. There are a wealth of API management services available on the Internet, and having an API management strategy can open up a company to a wealth of vital resources across an application's lifecycle. Legitimize 3rd Party Developers With A Modern API Platform The 3rd party developer who was responsible for the latest Snapchat breach was not given official access to Snapchat APIs, because there is not formal API program.

			<p><em>26 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I just finished going through my API Stack, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and recording some information about each of the providers in my API monitoring system. When I started looking through my stack a couple days ago there was 830 companies listed, and after this pass through I carved the stack down to 690--why? APIs Go Away It is a fact of life, APIs go away. I'm always amazed at how quickly an API will disappear or just fall into disrepair. I don&rsquo;t have time to assess what exactly has happened to all APIs, but if I get 404s, or can't find signs of an API program in 10 seconds, and a quick Google search, I pull them from the stack. I've noticed many start-ups seem to be coming out with a slick mobile app + API, and then a few months later the API seems to disappear. I'll start tracking on things better, and see if I can&rsquo;t produce some better examples to discuss this in the future. Raising The Bar As I look at hundreds of APIs, and try to get familiar with them, I can't help but get frustrated by certain things, something that inevitably raises the bar of what I include in my API stack, all along the way. Sometimes I'll notice an API is actually a SOAP web service, or after playing with I find it very difficult to navigate, on-board, and actually put to use. Whatever the reasons I will remove some companies from the stack, and while I will still be keeping an eye on what they are doing (or not doing), the API is not something I'm looking to shine a light on as part of my stack. Hiding The Docs One thing I feel like I keep coming across as I look through APIs, are companies pulling back their API documentation.

			<p><em>26 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I just finished going through my API Stack, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and looking for one simple thing&mdash;the base URL for each of their APIs. Throughout the process I looked at almost 700 API developer areas, trying to find the base URL they are using to serve up some of the most valuable API resources publicly available on the web. Accepting The Madness When you look at 700 APIs, you have to wade through a lot of madness. When I'm looking at APIs, I&rsquo;m looking for more than just a perfectly designed API from a technical perspective, I&rsquo;m interested in value, presentation, and other more meaningful aspects. Often times I will overlook your base URL, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop me from taking note of some of the crazy domains, and subdomains people are using to provide access to their API resources. Strong Patterns For Base URL Once you wade through the madness, and start looking for the strongest patterns for base URLs applied across the API space, it is easy to see that two of the most common approaches are: api.example.com - Pretty simple, common, and current approach to pointing a subdomain to a company&rsquo;s API resources. example.com/api - When you don&rsquo;t have control over setting up subdomains, a simple API folder is next in line. The subdomain for a company&rsquo;s API effort says a lot. When you do not put much thought into the path for your API program, it demonstrates that you will probably not put a lot into your overall API effort. A subdomain may not seem like much on the surface, but it consistently provides a barometer for other things that are going on, as I wade through these APIs. Another thing I'm consistently seeing, is that many API providers assume that API consumers will understand the the API is available at the root domain, and referencing /api/v1/ as a root, without directly stating the base URL...[<a href="/2014/10/26/gathering-my-thoughts-around-common-patterns-for-base-urls-across-nearly-700-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am tracking on around 2500 companies who are doing interesting things in the API space. Out of these companies about 1000 of them have blogs, which for me is a pretty important signal. About 1/4 of these companies with blogs, do not have an RSS feed, which in 2014 seems a little odd to me, but maybe I'm an old timer.
I believe that a blog is one of the most important signals, any API provider come put out, right alongside Twitter and Github. Historically I depend on the Twitter account for these RSS-less blogs, but now I'm taking a different path, and using Kimono Labs to fill in the gap.
Using the Kimono Labs Chrome extension, I just visit the main blog page for one of these companies, and select the title of the first blog post. Kimono gives me the ability to name this field, which I usually just call &ldquo;title&rdquo;. Since the title is a link, Kimono also associates the link to the blog post, along with each title. You could also highlight the summary text, but I don&rsquo;t need this, as I have secondary processes that runs and pulls the full content of a blog post, as well as the timestamp, author, and taking of a screenshot.
Within a couple of seconds, using Kimono Labs, I now have an API for each companies blog, assuming the role RSS would normally play. When I have time each week, I will generate an API for the most important companies I'm tracking on. Maybe someday I will close the entire blog syndication gap for the companies I track on, but for now its nice to be able to tackle the most high value companies, and know that I have a viable solution to the problem with Kimono Labs.

			<p>I wrote about visual API documentation a few months back, after I looked at the approach from OpenFDA, and now after taking a look at the value Slate brings to API providers like Dwolla, these feelings are re-surfacing in my mind. Since I have limited time, I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at putting my ideas out there, allowing anyone to step up and execute on opportunities I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space&mdash;I just do not need the extra work. I love me some Swagger UI, as you can tell from the fact that all of my APIs use Swagger as the API definition format, as well Swagger UI for the interactive documentation. I&rsquo;m pretty convinced of the importance of documentation being a hands-on experience, but after looking at approaches like OpenFDA, and Dwolla with their Slate driven API docs, I&rsquo;m convinced they should also be more beautiful and functional. Let me explain what I would like to see developed for the API space: API Definition Core - As we are beginning to see across the space with current interactive API documentation practices, everything needs to be driven by a machine readable API definition, providing a set of instructions for how any user will engage with an API. Interactive - In 2014 the bar is already set, and API documentation should be interactive, allowing users to make live calls to a demo, or production API, making learning about an API hands-on experience. Inline Code - The tools are available to generate code samples from Swagger and API Blueprint, and wherever we make an API call, we should also be able see the code for making the call inline, side-by-side with wherever I am engaging with the API&mdash;in my language of choice please! Visualizations - I don&rsquo;t want just to get back a response from the API, I want to be able to visualize the value returned from an API.

			<p><em>24 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm liking the new&nbsp;Dwolla's new API docs&nbsp;that they just launched. They are using an open source API documentation framework called Slate, developed by Tripit, for their own API documentation.&nbsp; I enjoy seeing the different directions that providers take with their API docs. Slate's approach is a different path than we've been seeing with interactive docs using frameworks like Swagger, but provides a very intuitive, elegant documentation experience which includes code samples tailored to each API endpoint. Here are the features Slate lists on the Github repository for the project: Clean, Intuitive Design - The description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side. Inspired by Stripe's and Paypal's API docs. Slate is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even print. Everything On A Single Page - Gone are the days where your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed link-ability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy. Slate Is Just Markdown - When you write docs with Slate, you're just writing Markdown, which makes it simple to edit and understand. Everything is written in Markdown &mdash; even the code samples are just Markdown code blocks! Write Code Samples In Multiple Languages &mdash;&nbsp;If your API has bindings in multiple programming languages, you easily put in tabs to switch between them. In your document, you'll distinguish different languages by specifying the language name at the top of each code block, just like with Github Flavored Markdown! Slate provides some pretty interesting tools for any API documentation toolbox. I also really like that they are Github-centric, acknowledging that many API providers will use Github Pages when deploying their docs, adding that "Not only does...[<a href="/2014/10/24/dwolla-using-slate-for-an-evolved-api-documentation-experience/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I know that some of my readers are URI experts, URL ninjas, and masters of the domain, but most of my readers are not, and I wanted to share some of the 100K view of what I see across the world of domains, in the API space. I&rsquo;m going through my API Stack over the last couple days (continuing this weekend), looking at 800+ companies who have APIs, and after going through roughly half, I&rsquo;m seeing some seriously crazy practices for crafting URIs for APIs programs. Let&rsquo;s start with the general path to your developer program, I highly recommend providing a simple subdomain, providing access to your APIs &nbsp;in a simple, consistent path like http://developer.example.com--at the very least put it in a consistent folder like http://example.com/developers. When you put your API into your http://example.com/help/bullshit-cms-system/@$~!$(bullshit-guid$#(@)/developer/ location, it really just sends a signal that your API is just a support feature, and something that is&rsquo;t getting the resources it will need for success. When it comes to identity and access management for your APIs, I recommend working from your root using http://example.com/oauth for authentication and discovering of your APIs. After that I recommend taking a similar approach to the developer program, and use http://api.example.com or http://example.com/api. It really sucks to have to guess the baseURL for any API, and if I have to download your SDK to figure out the baseURL, I may skip using your API all together. I&rsquo;m stilling processing thoughts around the dynamic API subdomains like http://accountname.example.com, giving users a custom base URL for API access. Whatever you choose when configuring a domain for your API efforts, I probably don&rsquo;t need to see /rest/, /tcp/, or /http/ in the URL structure. I&rsquo;m hoping your API resources are these things, you should not have to declare it. When designing your API resources, work hard to think about the core resources, and how they will be used, not necessarily how they are being transported.

			<p>APIs came in to existence to satisfy a demand for access to valuable content, data and resources, and the more APis that are developed, the more the appetite for API consumption has grown. APIs enable website, web and mobile applications to build applications, using resources that were completely out of reach in even the recent past. Some API resources, like a simple city look-up by postal code, might be simple enough that a developer could recreate, but other resources such as global satellite imagery is something the average developer does not have the resources, or the time to create&mdash;the more API resources available, the cooler the apps we build, and the more we hunger for valuable API resources grows. Starts with a Need API consumers rarely want to use an API, just to learn about APIs, they have a need, a problem they need to solve. They want to provide a feature in their website, or mobile application. Often times people just want two systems to talk to each other, or be able to analyze and visualize information in a particular way, to accomplish a business or personal objective. Discovering The APIs You Need The API savvy technologists are aware of the vast wealth of APis available today, and know to Google for the API they need, visit API directories like ProgrammableWeb or Mashape, and emerging API search engines like APIs.io. Authentication Before you can unlock the value of an API, you need to understand how common authentication patterns work for any API. Some API providers use basic authentication, which is baked into HTTP, while others use application or developer keys to be able to talk with APIs. oAuth is fast becoming default for API providers who serve up private users information, allowing platforms to manage identity and access in a way that gives control over to end-users of applications built on top of APIs. Many providers are also using SSL as default for all...[<a href="/2014/10/16/reworking-my-api-101-content-consuming-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I need your help with something. I&rsquo;m in the business of helping start-ups, all the way up to our federal government identify valuable assets, and make them more accessible for use in websites, and mobile devices. As part of this work I&rsquo;m always on the look out for valuable public assets across city, state, and the federal government, and help make sure the conversations around these assets always include APIs, so that we aren&rsquo;t just building websites, mobile applications in silos, and limiting the potential for public access, by individuals, and small businesses.&nbsp; Over the last couple years I have cultivated a small group of API evangelists in various sectors, who help keep me informed of important government projects, and one of my partners in crime Alyssa Ravasio (@alyraz) brought a pre solicitation for an RFP to my attention from the Department of Agriculture, for a &ldquo;Recreation On Stop Support Services&rdquo;&nbsp;to my attention&mdash;a service you can see in action at Recreation.gov. In short this is an ongoing contract that our federal government engages in with a private sector contractor on, to provide access to our nations campgrounds and campsites at our federal parks. I would put our national parks and campgrounds at the top of treasured assets that this country possesses, and something that we need to make sure continue to be as accessible to individuals, and small businesses as possible. I want to take the time to respond to the pre-solicitation from the Department of Agriculture, in hopes of helping them craft a better RFP, before this goes out to bid. I also want to encourage others, who are also passionate about camping and our national parks, to submit their own feedback to the Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services The current incarnation of the one stop service for recreation project has an API...well it has web services as part of the existing Recreation Information Database (RIDB), but you also...[<a href="/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m spending more time reaching out directly to API providers, in an effort to better understand what they are up to. A couple weeks ago, I asked Sarfaraz Rydhan (@safoo)&nbsp;from the Fraud Detection API platform SiftScience, what is the biggest challenge you face in attracting developers to your system?
In many cases, the biggest challenge is developers needing context into the business and operations side of the companies they work for. We offer a machine learning powered fraud detection product to help internet companies in many verticals fight fraud. In an e-commerce integration, for example, a developer may need to know about how users interact with the store, when a customer's credit card is charged, how order information is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment, how operations analysts work within the e-commerce system.
Context--something that is so important, and is often lost in translation, or forgotten entirely when APIs are purely an IT or developer led initiative. As a developer I can easily see the many uses of an API, but articulating to someone who is actually living within one of these use-case scenarios, is very difficult&mdash;something that takes a lot of practice.
You can see SiftScience working to provide context to its users via its website, blog, twitter, and other tutorials and resources. As API providers, this is why we provide essential storytelling building blocks like a blog, tutorials, and other resources&mdash;to provide the critical context someone needs to understand the value that our APIs deliver.
Are you providing enugh context for your users?

			<p><em>15 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>The world of APIs starts with an individual, company or organization, with some sort of content, data, or other digital resource, wanting to make it available, on the Internet, in a machine readable way, so that others can build sites, and applications around it. Even though APIs use the Internet for communication, it doesn't mean that they are openly accessible to anyone. Providing APIs, is very similar to providing websites, you can control which users have access to it, where they can go, and what they can do&mdash;APIs are just meant for other websites, web applications, and mobile developers.&nbsp; Solving a Problem APIs are all about providing solutions, to everyday problems in our increasingly digit worlds, from sharing data with partners, developing mobile applications, to disrupting an entire legacy industry who refuses to change and evolve. Access to Resources Providing APIs is about open up access to content, data and other complex objects, or systems that exist within a company or organization, in a way that anyone can use the resulting resources in any programming language or external system. Alternative Solutions APIs are about the path of least resistance when making content, data, and other resources available, and in the world of APIs you see a lot of initiatives that are born in the shadows of existing company efforts, scraped from existing websites, and are often organized by rogue groups outside of normal business or even IT groups. APIs are about getting things done. Design First Providing APIs has evolved beyond just exposing an interface that exactly reflects the content, database or other resource being made available, and establishing a design first approach where you mock, share, and collaborate around the value an API delivers, before any code is even written. Efficient Deployment There are many roads an individual or company can take when providing APIs, from DIY approaches using open source API frameworks, to gateways provided by IT that access internal resources, and a...[<a href="/2014/10/15/reworking-my-api-101-content-providing-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>As I track on the API space, the gender gap becomes increasingly obvious. As with many other guys, I&rsquo;m struggling with coming up with the most constructive way that I can contribute to closing the gender gap in technology. As I do with the rest of the API space, I figured I can work harder to tell more stories about women doing interesting things in the API space, while also working to understand the history of women in the space. With this in mind I took the opportunity on Ada Lovelace Day, to publish a project dedicated tracking on women doing interesting things in the world of APIs, and as with the other 75+ projects, I will spend time each month moving the project forward. My goal is to find more stories for my blog, more speakers and attendees for API industry events, and make sure women are better represented across my research. To kick things off, I wanted to showcase notable women in the history of compute, and by spending my day looking beyond just the Wikipedia entry, I was able compile a pretty impressive list of women who have made a significant impact on technology. The list I compiled is not complete by any means, but it is far more complete than any one list I have found out there, and the big difference is my list is machine readable--meaning you can pull the JSON listing of notable women in compute history and use on any other website, or in mobile applications. Next up, I want to make an functional web API so anyone can search the listing, as well as provide the ability to add, and update the list via API. I want to also take advantage of the fact that my women in tech research website is build on Github, and encourage visitors to help me make the list more complete, and extend the reach of the information available here.

			<p><em>12 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I wrote a story a couple of weeks ago, about how to kickstart APIs at the University of Oklahoma (OU). I ended the post, saying I would find some easy targets for generating the initial APIs, and publish a basic developer portal using Github Pages. After some work I think I have enough done to initiate another conversation with my friends at OU. In any company, organization, government agency, or institution, where you are trying to decide where to start with APIs, the public website is the place to start. If data and content is already published to the website, it should also be available in a machine readable format via an API&mdash;this is the obvious place to start at OU. To help find the low hanging fruit, when it comes to data and content at OU, I wrote a simple script that would slowly spider every page of the ou.edu website, looking for the opportunities, providing some potential targets for deploying APIs. So far my script has identified 183,094 pages across university sub-domains, and processed 52,281 of these pages looking for any HTML tables on pages, with over 20 rows, as well as .xls spreadsheet files, and XML files. I&rsquo;m running the script slowly in the background, as I don&rsquo;t want to put any burden on OU sites, and just pulling pages every few seconds. To date I&rsquo;ve identified 252 pages that have large HTML tables, 330 spreadsheets, and 68 XML files. While the script will still be running and looking for more, I think this represents a pretty good start when it comes finding the low hanging fruit for open data and content at OU--resources that should be APIs. As I do with all my projects, I published my work for the OU API effort on Github, as an open repository. Using this repository, I&rsquo;ve published the low hanging fruit as JSON, and HTML pages to allow for easy browsing: Tables (252) -...[<a href="/2014/10/12/an-outsidein-approach-to-jumpstarting-an-api-effort-at-the-university-of-oklahoma/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways to compose, and examine collections of APIs. I have a database of over 2500 API that I keep an eye on, and for some of them I&rsquo;ve been generating Swagger specs, and using APIs.json to compose them into collections. I did this with 10 APIs I'm calling my utility stack, because they are some of the fundamental utility style resources I depend on to make the API Evangelist network function. I generated Swagger specs for the 10 following APIs: bitly Data API Search FullContact Name API FullContact Location Normalization API Pinboard All Posts API AngelList Startup API Wordnik WordList API AlchemyAPI Keyword and Term Extraction AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API Then using these Swagger definitions, I outputted any parameters that are used for endpoints, as well as the fields for all of the APIs underlying data model. I grouped all of these fields together and created a sort of dictionary for my utility stack API collection. By doing this I&rsquo;m learning a lot about the vocabulary that each of these API providers are using, as well as beginning to see patterns across similar APIs, like text extraction APIs, and URL shortener APIs. In a perfect world, APIs would use commonly established vocabularies like schema.org, but in the imperfect API world we are given, I&rsquo;m enjoying taking a look at the sort of API slang that has emerged across the various types of popular APIs we are adopting. API definition formats like Swagger give me a great way to define the surface are of APIs, and these exercises allow me to push forwards tools and approaches to understanding this new landscape. The more APIs I generate Swagger definitions for, and the more tools I develop to analyze the landscape, the better I will get at communicating the interesting patterns I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space, and hopefully extract some blueprints that I can follow in my own...[<a href="/2014/10/11/exposing-dictionaries-from-my-api-collections/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I first started Poem of the Times back around 2003, and for about five years I harvested a poem each day, from the top headlines across the top english speaking newspapers around the world. Sometime in 2008 I stopped generating the poem, but in an effort to showcase the potential of APIs, I thought it would be a good time to revive the project. Version 1.0 of Poem of the Times used RSS to pull its headlines, and for version 2.0 I want to use APIs. Something that seems impossible when you are faced with the fact that most of the top newspapers do not have APIs, which is very sad. ;-( However in 2014 we can make APIs from any web page using Scraping to API tools like Kimono Labs. Using Kimono Labs I created an APIs for each of top 25 newspapers. I worked my way down a list of top newspapers around the globe, and using Kimono&rsquo;s Chrome add-on I was able to map my API to whatever part of the news homepage featured the latest stories. This was different for each news site, and some of them threw errors when I ran Kimono, but when this happened I quickly moved on until I had 25 successful APIs&mdash;something that took me about an hour and half. Now that I had 25 separate news APIs I published a machine readable Swagger definition for each, and then published an APIs.json listing all 25 APIs in a single Poem of the Times API collection. Right now this is manual, but I know this is something that is on the Kimono roadmap, introducing the ability to automatically generate Swagger specs, and build APIs.json collections from your Kimono API catalog. Next I wrote a simple PHP script that pulled the APIs.json, spidered all 25 APIs, made a call to each one, and randomly grabbed a single headline, adding to an overall poem for the day.

			<p><em>10 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways of building API collections using APIs.json, and building on a concept I saw introduced by Cyril Gaillard&rsquo;s story titled "I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker", something which was expanded on by Patricio Robles (@probles) on ProgrammableWeb with "would your company benefit from having an API broker?" The concept of an API broker is interesting. If you had talked to me a year ago, I would have framed my thoughts on API brokering in a more algorithmic way, but after reading these posts, I am looking to merge in my thoughts around API evangelism, taking more of a human approach to API brokering. While I think API brokering in the future might look like more like high speed trading with algorithms doing the heavy lifting, I&rsquo;m thinking for right now it is something we need humans to bridge, bringing a more personal approach during the wild wild west days of APIs. To push forward my thoughts on API brokering, I&rsquo;m playing around with describing various APIs using Swagger 2.0, then building a collection of these APIs using APIs.json, and publishing it all to a Github project&mdash;which for now I&rsquo;m calling the Utility Stack. In this exercise I&rsquo;m organizing 10 separate APIs that provide me with a very useful stack of API resources. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I will be building with all of this, but the current stack reflects what I&rsquo;m already using to manage the API Evangelist network, so I know they are useful. Here are the 10 APIs I&rsquo;m working with: AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API AlchemyAPI Keyword &amp; Term Extraction API AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API Angellist Startup API Bitly URL Data API FullContact Location Normalization API FullContact Name Normalization API Pinboard Bookmark API Wordnik Word Lists API Wordnik Words API These are all API resources that provide some very useful elements in my operations.

I&rsquo;m doing my usual monitoring of the API space, and while looking at various developer areas, I stumbled across the Target Developer Portal. I find the Target developer portal interesting because it is publicly available, but before you can get any information you have to register or login.
When you land on the landing page for developer.target.com you simple get a page that says:
Please Note: Access to the developer portal is restricted to Target employees and trusted third parties that currently have a working relationship with Target Corporation. Registration requests that do not meet these guidelines will be rejected.
I would like to see more information about Target&rsquo;s API efforts, which I think they could do without giving away business intelligence, but overall I support the line they are walking with their API efforts. To me, Target is making a statement that they have an API, and if you are "Target employees and trusted third parties", you can get more access--it is a start, so I'm hopeful.
I'm part of many private API discussions lately, where I&rsquo;m trying to educate companies about the benefits of being more public, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more companies take targets approach to publishing their developer API portal in coming years.
My only hope is that more of them will also share a blog, and other details about what they are up to, and hopefully some day even some publicly available APIs providing access to information that is already available on their website.

One of the API news story of the day was the release of the Hacker News API. I&rsquo;m only lightly interested in the fact that HN now has an API because, honestly I don't feel like an API at this point in the evolution of tech curation site is something to applaud, but their approach to making their API real-time I think does subtly reflect other currents in the API space.
HN partnered with Firebase to make sure the tech news curation site doesn't just have an API, it has a real-time API. Meaning you can now get HN links in machine readable way, so that you can build the popular flow of tech information into other web, and mobile applications&mdash;in real-time! HN launching an API&hellip;yawn! HN launch an API with Firebase bkked in, reflects a growing trend from influential APIs. For me this is more about real-time and Firebase, than it is about HN.
You see other API providers like Nest from Google baking in real-time frameworks into their APIs. Real-time isn&rsquo;t something every type of API should be considering as a default feature, but there are definitely areas where the real-time flow of data is not just a nice to have, it is essential to demonstrating the value of APIs. In my experience, I would say that there are several sectors like news, financial, Internet of Things where I'm seeing real-time being present as a fundamental ingredient for the API platform--something I will be keeping an eye on.
As I said before, some of the trends I&rsquo;m tracking on are quickly moving from trend to being baked into APIs, going beyond just the release of web APis, and adding additional layers that developers are demanding to deliver the features their end-users are demanding.

			<p>
I've been a big proponent of APIs in the federal government, and it makes me really happy to see Developer.Trade.Gov using APIs.json to provide an inventory of APIs available at the federal agency dedicated to strengthening "the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements".
If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with APIs.json, it is the open format that 3Scale and API Evangelist are working on to help make APIs discoverable. You can see APIs.json in action at the open source API search engine APIs.io, where the International Trade Administration (ITA) has submitted their APIs.json file for inclusion. ITA is the first of many federal agencies I will get to adopt the APIs.json format, and help make their valuable API resources much more discoverable, and ultimately more consumable.
Can you imagine a future where all global trade is machine readable by default, and there are millions of simple, discoverable APIs available to help stimulate, as well as regulate industry? A future where the Department of Commerce and other relevant agencies are at the center, with the highest quality APIs you can imagine, and the healthiest outreach to not just industry, but also individual business owners.
Trade.gov&rsquo;s impressive entry into the world of APIs with Developer.Trade.gov, their quick responses to feedback, and the publishing of an APIs.json file for the agency, makes me optimistic for this vision of the API economy. If our federal government can do it, then I think industries can follow the lead, ensure that the future of trade and commerce is more real-time, transparent, and accessible to everyone.

I was already using an older version of Swagger, so the migration wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. I have about five new APIs I want to roll out over the next couple weeks, and I wanted them to up to date, using the latest version, so moving forward my knowledge using my existing APIs was the best way to prepare. I moved forward the five "core APIs", as I call them, analysis, APIs, building blocks, curated, and tools, to all use Swagger 2.0. These APIs provide access to my monitoring system I use to keep track of the space. I also migrated two of my "stack APIs", image manipulation, and screen capture, which are designed to be general purpose, utility APIs &nbsp;I use across my platform. To support the migration I wrote a Swagger manager for my API monitoring system, which I use to track on 2794 APIs, from 3215 companies, which API Evangelist is one of these companies. Using this new tool I imported my old Swagger 1.2 versions, and after a little touching up in my new editor, I published brand spank&rsquo;n new Swagger 2.0 definitions for all seven my APIs. The process reminded me of how API definitions really can help you describe, see, understand and ultimately communicate the API surface area you posses. I&rsquo;m going to take this and apply it to a couple of business sectors I&rsquo;m tracking on as part of my API Stack, and see what the process does for me there. After that I&rsquo;m going to get to work on the next five APIs I&rsquo;m designing, and see how Swagger 2.0 contributes to my design of brand new APIs, as well as later on in the life cycle. I'm using my Swagger API definitions as a central truth for driving server side code, and my documentation.

			<p>As I hear stories of the HP separation today, I'm reminded of how companies of all shapes and sizes interact, both historically, and in this potentially new API driven business landscape we find ourselves in. I&rsquo;m not an expert in running any size company, but this won&rsquo;t stop me from being a pundit on the subject! ;-) The HP story brought me back to a conversation I was having the other day with a VC, regarding what is next for Apigee, and when I said IPO, the VC asked me if maybe SAP would buy them. I know that SAP and Apigee are partnering, but honestly I don't know jack about Apigee&rsquo;s business model, or even SAP, so I really don't have a clue what is next, I can only guess. The conversation did prompt me to create this Evernote (birth of any API Evangelist blog post), helping me flush out some of my thoughts on how companies could potentially work together in an API driven business environment. I know that one way that big companies get the talent and market share they need is through the acquisition of smaller companies, something that has worked well for some time. However, another aspect to this history that only rarely gets discussed, is how many people, and brands just disappear into these acquisitions&mdash;never to be seen or heard from again (until their next start-up of course). I&rsquo;m not inferring that big companies shouldn't acquire little companies. The point I'd like to make, is that maybe larger companies should consider how they could be a little more interoperable, and achieve numerous loosely couple relationships, versus always just acquiring a company. You never know, you maybe get all of the benefits of a relationship, without the negative of bringing a start-up in house only to see it chewed up by your internal bureaucracy&mdash;you know it happens!

			<p><em>05 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been a outspoken advocate for more open source API management tooling, for some time now. I'm sensitive to the fact that startups have to make money in the API space, but in my opinion a certain layer of the API space needs to remain open and interoperable for this all to work, and I feel that open source tools are an important variable in this equation. When I last checked into what was available in the space, there really wasn't much, so in 2014 I figured I'd take another look. Originally there is just one player on the space who was completely open source, and that is WSO2: API management is just one tool in the massive open source catalog that WSO2 brings to the table. The company provides a number of open source tools including identity &amp; authentication, ESB, data and API management solutions. WSO2 is the shining open source example in the space currently, and I was very happy to see them emerge on the landscape. I feel WSO2 plays a strong role in the API space, but their approach to open source is the enterprise version, where the open gets rid of software licensing cost (yay), but is targeted specifically at an enterprise audience. I&rsquo;m not the enterprise, so to compliment what they bring to the table, I&rsquo;m also looking for a different version of &ldquo;community&rdquo;, and eager to see smaller players step up as well. After WSO2 I got a taste of open source from Alcatel Lucent, with their release of API Grove, which was a whole other definition of open source: API Grove was open sourced late in 2012 by Alcatel Lucent, holding some promise that another strong enterprise open source player would step up, but within months it would be clear that it was not a live open source offering, but Alcatel abandoning their API program, and publishing as open source to get the press release.

			<p><em>03 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The home page of API Evangelist has always been my API 101 page, where any new visitor can land, not know a thing about APIs, read the page, and walk away understanding at least what an API is, and hopefully also a greater understanding of how it impacts their world. From the beginning the API Evangelist home page always had a lean toward API providers, and over time I've added information about consuming APIs, as well as trends in the API space I'm seeing.
In my opinion my 101 content has become too lengthy, and not properly onboarding people to the multiple areas of APIs like providing APIs vs consuming APIs. I think it is time to overhaul my 101 section, and produce some newer, more relevant API 101 content for 2014. To support this, I'm working on a series of 15 API 101 segments, with each one having a story version, as well as a slideshow edition, complete with audio.&nbsp;
I finished the first one, which is my 100K view, API 101 introduction. I'm still working on the slideshow version. Once I'm done I"ll move on to providing APIs, and as I finish each one I'll hang on the homepage, as well as publish out via the blog, and Twitterz.

			<p>I&rsquo;m giving my hypermedia API research a little love today, and as part of this I was reviewing examples of hypermedia in the wild like with the Elastic Path Cortex API. Elastic Path was the first company to introduce me to the possibilities around hypermedia way back in 2011, so I enjoy checking in regularly to see what they are up to with their APIs. As of January 2014 I&rsquo;ve committed more time to doing research on hypermedia APIs, as well as work to tell stories about how hypermedia is being applied by companies, in a way that anyone can understand. This last summer at API-Craft in Detroit, the hypermedia community acknowledged that they have an image problem, and had some significant work ahead of them when it comes to storytelling, specifically around speaking to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;. Personally, I don&rsquo;t 100% speak hypermedia-eze, but I know with some practice I can get better at translating. I also know that some of the hypermedia folks aren&rsquo;t so good at speaking plain english to normal people, but with some practice I htink they will also get better. To help me in my jouney I figured I&rsquo;d translate what Elastic Path has written on their Cortex API page, but first I want to acknowledge the image they have--which is the first sophisticated hypermedia visual I&rsquo;ve seen, and I want to work on creating more like it. Let&rsquo;s get on with the translation from hypermedia-eze to plain english. Elastic Path starts with: Cortex is a mediation layer that uses patent-pending dynamic linking technology to discover and assemble resources from multiple business platforms into one consistent interface. Data and services from enterprise applications like Commerce Engine, Adobe&reg; Experience Manager, OpenText&reg; CEM, and others are mapped to Cortex using a lightweight schema.

			<p><em>02 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
As the popularity of APIs rapidly increases, I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets play a growing role in both providing APIs, as well as consuming APIs. On the road to #APIStrat Chicago I came across a company who has a pretty dead-simple approach to using spreadsheets to drive data via APIs, called Data Everywhere.
Data Everywhere describes their service:
Select the cells in your existing spreadsheet and click publish. Your data will be instantly available in other spreadsheets. Our REST API makes your data available in databases, phones, websites, and other applications.
Whether we want to admit it or not, most of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and providing dead simple tools to liberate this data via APIs are a very logical solution. We aren't just talking about taking an entire spreadsheet and turning it into an API with Data Everywhere, we are seamlessly making data available from spreadsheets via API, leaving the existing workflow in tact.
Educating the &ldquo;every day &ldquo; spreadsheet user of the importance of APIs in making their work interoperable, and accessible in web and mobile is definitely a priority for me in the coming years. I feel like this education process will continue to be an important layer to my evangelism work for many years to come.
P.S. Thank you to Data Everywhere for helping moderate the data session at @APIStrat!

			<p>I spend many of my days talking to startups, SMB, SME, larger enterprise, institutions, and federal government folk about APIs&mdash;if you haven&rsquo;t heard, its what I do. I&rsquo;ve become the sort of counselor for the world of APIs, sometimes just listening, but often times giving advice, and sharing random thoughts with a wide variety of characters, who are looking to understand the world of APIs. One pattern I've been consistently seeing across many of these API sessions, is that questions around internal API strategy are trumping any external or public API questions. These usually discussions start with questions of API design, deployment and management, but then often times move to strategies around internal evangelism, and incentivizing the usage of APIs in general, not just consuming your own internal APIs. Many are recognizing that the path towards being a healthy API provider, involves also being a healthy API consumer&mdash;a sort of yin yang of APIs. I&rsquo;m realizing that for many of these folks that I speak with, the challenge of selling the concept of APIs internally is often a bigger, and more daunting challenge than designing, developing, managing, and evangelizing an API to partners, or even the public. I think we are underestimating the challenge our friends at larger organizations are facing when they try to get the resources they need to be successful within their own work, let alone also contribute to the overall success of their company, agency, or organization. I&rsquo;m finding that many of these conversations only occur because I do not have anything to sell them. Many of the people I talk to are starved for an educated, outside perspective, even before any desire to understand, and learning about the larger API space. If you are an API service provider in the space, this is a layer of the API economy you need to help me with.

			<p><em>01 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I was doing some research on travel and transportation APIs over the last couple of weeks, and one of the developer portals I was looking at was one of the enterprise leaders in the space, the Sabre Dev Network. I really like the overall implementation from Sabre, except for one thing...
There is no pricing page for the Sabre Dev Network. ;-( The only place you find a mention of pricing is in the FAQ page, where it says:
"We have a number of different pricing options for our services. Whether you are a company just starting out or an established travel provider, we have pricing options that will fit your business needs.&rdquo;
I understand you are a little apprehensive about sharing your pricing, or maybe you haven&rsquo;t really thought it through all the way, and just want to shake the trees and see what falls out. Whatever the reason, when it comes to APIs you should be a little more transparent about what is going on.
Additionally, as far along as you are with some of the other parts of your developer program, you should have a pretty robust service composition page, and a partner and certification framework for developers to work towards.
Other than the lack of information about what everything costs, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the Sabre Dev Network, as a platform. I have two other stories to do around their approach, but wanted to start with the constructive criticism before I move into the praise. ;-)

			<p>
I&rsquo;m working through my API design stories, and was working through some research on the origins of Swagger, and as I'm writing a paragraph on Wordnik, I became distracted around how Swagger was born out of this "word" startup. You see, Wordnik presents themselves as "a new way to discover meaning", and out of this work, Swagger, "a new way to discover meaning" from APIs was born.
Words are an important building block in communication, and I see APIs as a similar, more structured way to approach online communication on the open Internet. Swagger has given us a new vocabulary, providing a new way to describe, and communicate around APIs. You can programmatically pull a a Swagger specification for an API, and within a few seconds you have an idea of what the API resources means, and has to offer.
There really isn't any major point to this story, other than the fact that I find it interesting that a company who is striving to discover meaning among words, would also be looking to help us discovery meaning of APIs. I think this essence is why so many are adopting Swagger to define their valuable API resources, because it comes from a purer place, than just trying to sell you API tooling, and is actually working to help you find and communicate the meaning amongst APIs.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE As the API lifecycle continues to expand and comes into focus, new services are emerging to help both API providers, and consumers, better manage API operations from start to finish. New API integration services like Runscope have emerged to better understand how APIs are actually being consumed, and services like APIMatic&nbsp;are born out of the need to produce better quality SDKs for developers--it only seems natural that eventually these services would start working together. APIMatic will now generate SDKs in 7 languages that are designed, and enabled to inspect/debug all of the requests and response data between their API, and the applications that depend on them. This will provide both API provider, and consumer with vital details on the integration in real-time, that can help ensure applications integrations are all optimized. All of this is made possible because Runscope has APIs, and APIMatic was savvy enough to weave in integration, monitoring and testing capabilities directly into the SDKs of any API. APIMatic will import API definitions in WADL, Swagger, I/O Docs, API BluePrint, or Google Discovery, then generate SDKs for you in Android, Windows, iOS, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, complete with Runscope integration, monitoring and testing! Something made possible because you have a machine readable API definition for all of your APIs. This latest expansion of the API lifecycle I feel was kicked off by Swagger, introducing the ability to generate interactive docs, server and client code for your APIs. This was then expanded upon by Apiary.io by allowing you to mockup APIs using API Blueprint, and now APIMatic and Runscope are expanding the lifecycle to include SDKs and API monitoring. It makes me happy to see the API definition continue to play such an important role, as the central truth in the API lifecycle, enabling all of these API services along the way.

As I do with other sectors, I would like to shed light on how APIs are being used at universities, and potentially share best practices, and stories between higher educational institutions, amplifying the positive effects of APIs. My efforts are beginning to pay off, and I was recently contacted by two friends, Mark Morvant (@MarkMorvant) and Adam Croom (@acroom), at the University of Oklahoma. They had seen my&nbsp;University research, and read my white paper, but what really lit their fire was the piece in the NY Times about student-built apps teaching colleges a thing or two&mdash;after reading that, they decided to give me a call to discuss APIs more. I started with the two approaches to using APIs that I am seeing at universities: API Access To Institutional Resources - APIs being deployed to provide better access to data, content, and other digital resources across campus, allowing integration with internal or external systems, and across campus web and mobile applications. Using Public APIs On Campus - Putting APIs from the public space, like Twitter and Google Maps to use in classrooms, and even in administrative operations, allowing for the better access to information, and seamless integration with existing campus workflows. Then I discussed the different approaches to introducing APis on campus that I've come across so far: Top-down IT Lead APIs - School executives take the initiative to make APIs a mandate across all campus operations, acknowledging the benefits APIs can deliver. Middle-in Faculty Lead APIs - API efforts led by teachers and other faculty, taking advantage of APIs in their daily work, and hopefully also in the classroom.

			<p>I get asked about hiring developer advocates, and API developers quite often during the week, but this specific question in my inbox from Augmate, I found more interesting. I thought their usage of a &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; was a little different, which gave me a reason to provide some fresh thought on the subject. After reading the question, my first response was going to be: API developer for consuming APIs or providing API? A thought which I immediately nullified, because any &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; is both. You should never just consume APIs, or just develop APIs, you should always do both&mdash;something that will give you the healthy perspective that I would be looking for when hiring. Next, there is the matter of which programming language they should be fluent in. I'll leave it to you to test for skills and knowledge that is relevant to your technology stack. Having been a director of IT, and development team manager, the requirements are always different in each environment I've worked in&mdash;I won't pretend there is one HR process to rule them all. You know your environment and needs, and you should develop a line of interview questions that reflects your objectives. In addition to your regular line of questioning, I would suggest that you also want someone who is language curious, and has played around with many of the popular languages, and not just stuck in one discipline like enterprise (C# &amp; Java), web (PHP, Python, Ruby, JS), mobile (Obj-C), and even someone who plays around with leading edge approaches using Node.js, Scala, and Go. You want to make sure they are proficient in the languages and technologies that speak to your core operations, but someone who is also aware of what is going elsewhere in the landscape&mdash;making for much more of a pragmatic developer, and reducing dogma to healthier levels.

			<p>Those of us who live and breathe the API space, throw around a phrase, &ldquo;The API Economy&rdquo;, quite a lot. Referring to the increased usage of APIs across vital industries to drive web and mobile applications, but we as we do often, the phrase is used to describe the future of things, rather than where things actually are. While we are seeing APIs begin to affect global economies, we really don't have much hard evidence that "The API Economy" is a thing beyond our own techno fascination. With the release of a new report from the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), called Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, us API geeks are getting the first actual evidence of "The API Economy", with a section in the report called "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces". The USITC reached out to me several months back, and interviewed me as part of the work on the report, and this week I finally got to see the resulting work. The report is the second of two compiled by committee, with the first report, Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 1 published last year. The earlier report laid the groundwork for the second report by providing an overview of trends in U.S. digital trade, describing the ways digital trade facilitates trade in other sectors, and approaches for estimating the economic impact of digital trade on the U.S. economy. Now with Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 2 the commission is focusing on the value of U.S. digital trade and the potential growth of this trade, providing insight into the broader linkages and contributions of digital trade to the U.S. economy (aka API economy). The report that includes a survey of U.S. firms in industries particularly involved in digital trade, also examines the effects of notable barriers and impediments to digital trade, and presents case studies...[<a href="/2014/09/30/the-u-s-international-trade-commission-includes-apis-in-latest-report/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>
We just wrapped up the 4th edition of @APIStrat in Chicago last week, and once again I&rsquo;m very happy with the way things went, as 400+ folks gathered to discuss APIs. The event had the right tone, and I got the usual flood of comments from attendees, speakers, and sponsors about what a great experience the event was.
I would love to take credit, but all of the responsibility goes to 3Scale for making it happen. 3Scale takes all the risk, and their rockstar team makes the event a reality&mdash;I just help get folks to the conference, contribute ideas to the schedule, present, and MC as much of the event as I possibly can.
@APIStrat has been helping move forward the conversation in the API space for two years now, starting with New York and San Francisco in 2013, and now Amsterdam and Chicago in 2014, all made possible because of 3Scale's investment.

The number one priority for 3Scale, when it comes to @APIStrat, is to move the conversation forward, while investing in the API community. This is why the event is a success, setting the tone for the conversation amongst sponsors, speakers, and attendees. I&rsquo;m thankful for being able to to take part in @APIStrat, and look forward to digesting all of the videos from Chicago, which are already on YouTube.
We&rsquo;ve already announced that the next @APIStrat will be in Berlin, spring 2015, and we are accepting input on where it should for the fall of 2015. Let me know if there are any topics you&rsquo;d like to see discussed at @APIStrat 2015, and we'll see about getting your ideas into the lineup.

			<p>I curate a lot of interesting stories across the API space from my RSS feeds, the Twittersphere, and my overactive email inbox each day. Only a small percentage of these stories ever make it to my business of API analysis site apievangelist.com, or my politics of APIs analysis at apivoice.com. Over the summer, this got me thinking, and while wandering around Detroit after API-Craft Detroit this last July, Steve Willmott (@njyx) and I were talking about the rapidly expanding API space, and both felt there was a gap in the news reporting for the API sector. ProgrammableWeb&nbsp;(PW)&nbsp;does a good job of providing API news and analysis for the space, but because of my monitoring of the space, I know there is a lot more news that never sees the light of day. Steve and I both aggreed that PW is the tip of the API news iceberg, and while API Evangelist, and API Voice provide some added analysis, there was no straight news site that showcased all of the news across the thousands of companies doing interesting things in 2014. Beyone PW,&nbsp;APIScene and API Codex are aggregating stories from across the blogosphere, providing access to the best stories across the blogosphere, but still do not reflect the wealth of stories I see being published by both API providers, and consumers. Out of this conversation, the API.Report was born. The API.Report is a Github Pages hosted API news site, that anyone can post short, concise blog posts that are no more than 500 words, with supporting links to additional sources of information. There are two ways you can post: Fork and Post to Github - The entire site runs on Github, and if you understand how Jekyll works you can easily publish your own story to the _posts folder, and submit a pull request to have added to the daily stream of stories.

			<p><em>29 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on a growing number of video, and voice enabled APIs lately, and one that is continually popping up to the top of my API monitoring list is Clarify. The description Clarify provides on their docs page is pretty concise: The Clarify API provides a RESTful API to extract knowledge from audio and video content Why is Clarify popping up on my list lately? There are a number of things that will cause an API related company to show up on my radar, but Clarify has several things going for it lately: Branding Shift - Recently they migrated from being Op3nVoice, which I didn&rsquo;t think wasn't that hard to spell, but I know that many people would have trouble with, to being Clarify&mdash;which is a cleaner brand. Hypermedia - Clarify is an extremely well designed API which employs HAL, and hypermedia JSON format for al API responses. SDK Writing Guide - They provide an SDK writing guide for anyone looking to develop SDKs for Clarify, making sure they are consistent from language to language. Story on Helper Libraries - Clarify produced a great blog post called "SPOIL your Users with Great Helper Libraries", which I added to my curation, and stories around API management. I&rsquo;m tracking on 15 separate APIs as part of my voice API research, and 18 as part of my video API research. These are fast growing spaces, and the problem of delivering indexable meta data alongside audio video is only going to increase, something startups like Clarify is looking to provide an API driven solution for. Now that @APIStrat in Chicago is over, I'm going to take the video from the conference, and run through Clarify, to get a feel for how the API works, and see first-hand the value it adds to my existing audio and video content. Clarify is a well designed API, and now that they've found their footing with their new brand, I predict Clarify...[<a href="/2014/09/29/extract-knowledge-from-audio-and-video-using-the-clarify-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m working on the details of my API 101 workshop with Kirsten Hunter (@synedra) next week. She is delivering most of the content for the 2 hour workshop, as she has evolved a pretty sophisticated set of API 101 materials. My contribution will be from my history of APIs, and my API trends material, helping people understand the how we got here, and some thoughts on where we are going. History of APIs As I continue to make sense of the API space, I'm evolving my history of APIs story, adding and consolidating areas that I think have significantly contributed to the overall growth of the API space. While I track on 100+ categories, or business sectors, in which I think APIs are being applied in some interesting ways, I feel these seven areas are the cornerstones of the app, and its underlying API economy. Commerce - Beginning with API pioneers like Salesforce, eBay, and Amazon to payment leaders like Stripe, and Paypal. Social - Teach us how to share, interact in collaborate with Deliciious, Facebook, and Twitter, to more recently Google+. Cloud - Amazon forever chagned how we will use APIs, enabling us to go beyond hobby, and actually deploy global infrastructure using web APis. Geo - Google Maps brought the resources web and mobile developers would need, and Census, MapBox, and others are pushing forward a valulable stack of geo API resources. Media - Flickr brought the businesses of APis into the mainstream consciousness, and Instgram, YouTube, and others stream rich media into our worlds via APIs. Messaging - Twilio, Sendgrid, and other messaging APIs provide valuable resources for developers, and also show the rest of us API providers how to manage and evangelize your APIs right. While there are definitely other valuable API resources that are contributing to the success of the space, these six areas represent the bedrock of the app, and API economy.

			<p><em>19 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm seeing the enterprise wake up to the potential of an API centric approach to doing business, slowly evolving beyond a Service Oriented Architectural (SOA) approach, and trying to understand why APIs are superior for delivering resources to the web, mobile, and Internet of thing (Iot) apps they are delivering, and increasingly depending on. Even though we are clearly in an enterprise phase of the API evolution, I&rsquo;m watching many leading enterprise entities struggle with their early API efforts, producing some pretty weak solutions, that developers are not finding useful, and hurting their efforts right out of the gate. I know that many enterprise API architects will dismiss my advice, because they know better than I do, but I feel compelled to share my thoughts, in hopes that even a handful will be more successful with their API efforts, which I think will also help the overall space as well. When embarking on your API journey, you are going to be handicapped right out of the gate, because as a large enterprise organization, you do not have many of the essential characteristics necessary in your DNA to be successful with APIs, but this is why it will require an API journey, to reprogram your DNA, and better operate on the open Internet. Before you start planning your APIs, and the supporting developer area, you need to play with other public APIs, to better understand what makes APIs different. I am always amazed at how many enterprise API architects that I engage with, when I ask them what public APIs they have used, admit that they have never used one. They just have heard of many of the common APIs out there, so to prime the API pump, let&rsquo;s hack on a couple of the most popular API solutions out there: Twitter - Hacking on the Twitter API provides some very important lessons when it comes to API design, as well as developer support.

			<p><em>19 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>The machine readable API definition format Swagger, just rolled over to version 2.0. I use Swagger to describe all of my APIs, and I largely associate the creator of Swagger, Wordnik for kicking off this latest renaissance in defining APIs in a way that provides us with a machine readable vocabulary to talk about all of these valuable resoures that we are exposing via APIs. There are other formats out there, older ones like WADL, and more recent ones like API Blueprint, and RAML, but Swagger was the one that revived this movement, helping us create ways for generating important elements throughout the API lifecycle, from mock interfaces in the design process, to testing and monitoring of product APIs. Honestly, I don't much of the details of what has changed from version 1.0 to 2.0, except that with version 2.0 you can use YAML to describe your API, just like competitor RAML, or markdown as with API Blueprint. The common assumption is that by using YAML and Markdown, even non-programmers will be able to communicate around APIs without having to navigate JSON&mdash;something I'm not entirely sold on, but will keeping looking for signs of in the wild When it comes to the rubber meeting the road, I think Swagger has an advantage because of the amount of adoption, and the tooling available in the community. Swagger has a pretty significant lead when it comes to language libraries, both server and client side, as well as converters, and other integration tooling you will need. There are some areas like an API design editor, where Swagger has been playing catch-up, but overall the community has a pretty significant lead from my vantage point. I&rsquo;m working to convert all of my Swagger files from version 1.3 to 2.0, then I'm sure I will have more thoughts about the latest version, once I get down into the weeds, but for now I&rsquo;m just happy to see the focus Wordnik...[<a href="/2014/09/19/machine-readable-api-definition-format-swagger-matures-to-2-0/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm preparing for a talk at the The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel Second Annual Conference, in Nashville Tennessee, specifically participating on a panel titled "Using Power Grid Open Data Initiatives". I accepted the request to go speak as part of my wider work on the Green Button iniative out of The White House, DOE, NIST, and the GSA. I was asked to provide some thoughts on how to help move the Green Button efforts forward earlier this winter, and again in the spring, and just haven't had the bandwidth to give any energy, so I saw this as a great opportunity to make some time as part of this panel. In May, The White House, 18F, some Presidential Innovation Fellows, and myself were asked to move the Green Button ball forward, resulting in a new website, and developer area that is all hosted on Github. I'm bummed I wasn't able to make time to participate, but now I have been able to go through the new site, and developer area, and gather my thoughts on where we could go next with the effort. Before we get started, lets start with the basics, what is Green Button? Nick Sinai (@NickSinai), Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States, puts it this way: Green Button is a policy idea. It's the notion that customers &ndash; residential, commercial, industrial, and yes, government customers of energy &ndash; ought to get access to their own energy data, in a standard digital format. The Administration has articulated this several times, in a number of Administration energy, climate, and smart grid policy documents. The government is a big customer of energy, and we deserve our own energy usage and price data. Green Button is also a public-private initiative, in response to a 2011 White House call to action. The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA have been collaborating with the utility and tech industries on this growing effort for a few years...[<a href="/2014/09/17/how-do-we-continue-moving-green-button-data-and-apis-forward/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>The conversation around open data and APIs in government is dominated by talk of making resources available to the public, which is a good thing, but is only 1/3 of the discussion that should be occurring amongst gov-focused techies, as well as the project owners, and data stewards who are managing these vital public resources across federal agencies. APIs are not just deployed to support public access to resources, this has just been the trend that is getting all the headlines, and there is still lot of value to be realized when putting APIs to work within an agency, opening up access to data, content, and other digital resources, increasing efficiency agency-wide using Internet technology. The best example of this in action is out of the private sector from Amazon, and the story of the important role internal APIs have played in the company's success, across internal operations, but also in the public as a commerce, and a cloud computing leader. To help you relate to the idea of an internal API, think of all the times you've had to ask IT for access to something from a database, like a list of facility locations, government programs, or maybe an employee directory. You have to find out where the source of these resources are, track down the right contact information, then put in a request to get a copy of the data or content you are looking for. Often times even once you get the data dump, it could be the wrong information, or missing what you are needing, requiring you to go back, yet again, to get what you are looking for--not very efficient, and also extremely frustrating. Access To The Resources You Need When you open up data or content via an API, despite common belief, you aren't necessarily making the information available to anyone on the open Internet, you are just using Internet technology to make it accessible.

			<p>I am working on a white paper for a big enterprise provider who is looking to deliver solutions in the API space. At their request I&rsquo;ve gone through six industries and looked for companies who have over 5k employees and are doing interesting things with APIs--a request that produced some great research for the white paper, as well as for stories here on API Evangelist. It can be hard to find large enterprise organizations who are doing full blown "API", because honestly many of them just do not get it yet. Sure I can find many that are doing web services, and dabbling with APIs, but it can be downright difficult to find examples of companies that I would showcase as a healthy API patterns. Doing this research I was looking more for examples of anything &ldquo;API&rdquo; happening, any bare-bones, positive signals that could be emulated, and try and demonstrate what huge opportunities there are in these industries, for anyone who could do it right. I got my first draft ready, and submitted for review, and jumped on a call to discuss. Everything looked great in the paper, except senior leadership said there was a lack of detail demonstrating how developers were building applications on these enterprise public APIs, They would need more hard examples of how these large company APIs were being used, how this benefited the API provider, and some hard numbers of usage, revenue, showing how business models, products and services were being developed. After smiling, I told them I could guarantee that most of these providers themselves don't have that detail, and are still working to figure this out. Your request is exactly why we do APIs, and begin to establish an external R&amp;D lab for providing answers, in realtime. Even if some of the more mature providers have this information, I can guarantee they aren't going to share it publicly. Maybe if they were a startup, this type of sharing...[<a href="/2014/09/14/can-you-show-me-the-roi-on-all-of-this-api-stuff-before-we-commit/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I used to work hard to write blog posts on API Evangelist that would have broad appeal with the Hacker News community, and at first I didn't have any luck, after trying to engage with readers on posts, I found myself blacklisted, where nothing I submitted showed up. I lived in some kind parallel universe, all because I argued with a couple influential HN users, who didn't like what I had to offer. I started a new account for API Evangelist, and began playing the game with a little different approach. I didn't engage with users, and wrote posts with titles that would bring in readers, kept things short and superficial, and had some front-page exposure, which would result in thousands of pageviews, and then would dissipate. This type of storytelling ever really turned into meaningful traffic, an engaged audience, conversations, or brought any value to my overall mission. Early last year I stopped posting to HN, only occasionally posted a story, but never really used it in the same way that I had before. I was worried my traffic would be hurt, but I went back to work, trying to write meaningful posts, that brought value to my target audience, and supported my mission. In the last year and a half, I've seen my sustained monthly traffic go from 500 page views a day to almost 2000 a day, all by just my sticking to my mission. The audience that does visit my blog, for the most part engages with me, shares posts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other channels, and I see much of what I write echoed on other blogs, and in conversations I see on social media, and in person at events.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE In 2014 we are making significant progress in deploying APIs in support of city operations, but we still have so much more work ahead of us when it comes to making public resources available. You can find a dedicated developer area full of data sets, and APIs, in most major US cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and many more, but what else can we do to really pick up the momentum and quality? Standardizing API Design Practices APIs are not that difficult to design with the right education, and experience. Developers who work on city contracts, or are employed by the city should all be taught common web API design practices, and be exposed to modern API design tooling like Swagger and Apiary. Even with this type of education, there will still be many differences between city deployments based upon needs, and tactics, but a little training could go a long way to make city operations more streamlined. Open Solutions For API DeploymentThere are a lot of common approaches to delivering city services, which means there should also a be a number of ways to provide standardized, open solutions for deploying APIs that support city operations. There should be a wealth of open source, Wordpress like solutions for deploying APIs in support of government operations. Sometimes connecting to legacy systems is just to much work, and deploying a simple, standalone solution, then syncing using data dumps or directly with backbend system might be more fruitful. Common API Management VisionI&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the standard approach to deploying city developer areas, and delivering data sets, and APIs, but in reality this is the result of the hard work of Socrata, one of the API management providers dedicated to the government space.

			<p>I saw another story about whether or not public APIs are going away, which is another story in a fairly long line of stories I&rsquo;m seeing lately from enterprise outlets about whether or not the demise of Netflix, ESPN, and now Aetna means public APIs are a bad idea, unsustainable and now will be going away&mdash;proving enterprise API architects right that an SOA is the way to go. If you are looking at the bigger API picture, the answer to this question is clearly no. Amazon, Salesforce, Twilio, and many other public APIs with straightforward business models are doing just fine. Just because a handful of companies who never quite had a business model, and never really gave their API efforts &nbsp;the resources they needed to be successful, doesn't mean that public APIs are a bad idea. Looking through my list of 2500+ APIs I track on, I can point to numerous other APIs that are about to shutter, which has nothing to do with the fact that they are public, and everything to do with not having the right business and political building blocks for their API. I&rsquo;m sorry if you are just in the game to exploit developers and get them to build things for your company, you can&rsquo;t be exploitative in this game and last, developers smell that shit a mile away--you have to give, just as much as receive. To be successful when it comes to APIs, you can't just launch an API, spend 100K on a popular API management solution, hire one guy (you know it, you hired a guy), and expect miracles within a couple months. It just doesn't work that way. APIs take a lot more grassroots building of an evangelist team, investment in a lot of projects, telling of many meaningful stories, and going to many conferences, Meetups, and events before anyone will know you exist, let alone building anything on your APIs.

			<p><em>11 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve talked about how the open source API search engine APIs.io can be deployed as an internal API search engine, as well as for public API discovery in the past. One aspect of this approach that I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, is that the search engine doesn&rsquo;t just return APIs in the search results, it can provide access to supporting building blocks as well.
The APIs.json format doesn't just provide a machine readable way to describe, and index your APIs, it also provides a way to describe the building blocks that support your APIs like code samples, SDKs, and other things API consumers will need when putting APIs to work for them.
The indexing of these API support elements really starts to benefit company operations when you also bundle tools for non-developers alongside internal APIs, like spreadsheet connectors, d3.js visualizations built on top of APIs, and other elements that any user can reverse engineer, or just put to work immediately--no configuration necessary.
Imagine if your internal staff could access any digital resources across the company, similar to what Amazon has done internally, and not just find the API driven resources they need, but also the tools they need to apply them in their jobs. This is where APIs started getting really powerful, allowing anyone at your company to put APIs to work and get their jobs done in a self-service way, with a limited amount of IT resources required.

			<p>I get a lot of folks who engage me about the API space, most of them are API providers, many are focused on API consumption, with only just a small few are looking the evangelism and analyst side of things. As far as I know I&rsquo;m the only individual out there looking at all industries, across all of these areas, working hard to understand how APIs are being applied across the board. I&rsquo;m always keeping an eye out for talent that is also working to expand their knowledge in the same way, but as the API universe expands I think this is going to be increasingly difficult, and I think we are going to start needing more analysts who focus within specific domains, and business sectors. With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching Mark Silverberg (@skram) over at SocialHealthInsights.com, and is what I&rsquo;d considered to be an API expert when it comes to the convergence of healthcare and APIs. Mark is always hacking on interesting things related to healthcare, and pushing the envelope when it comes to healthcare APIs, by not just hacking on healthcare APIs, but also developing apps for Google Glass. Mark has developed his expertise in a similar way as I do, by hacking, telling stories, and consulting--which I think is the best way to develop yourself as an API expert. Earlier this spring the FDA was preparing their new developer area, including the release of a handful of APIs like the drug labeling and adverse effects APis, and a handful of us with DC connections that were on the backchannel, providing feedback for the FDA during this beta period. Unfortunately I was too busy traveling to participate, but Mark was front and center providing some serious feedback on the API, resulting data, and the overall approach by the FDA. It has taken me four long years to develop my eye for not just the technical, but the business and political...[<a href="/2014/09/10/if-you-need-assistance-with-your-healthcare-api-strategy-i-have-the-person/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>One question I get pretty frequently from my readers, is about how they should explain APIs to their senior leaders, specifically the non-tech savvy executives. In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones, not just for a single company, but potentially an entire industry. To help support this effort, I&rsquo;m working through several stories that anyone can put to work when trying to convince their senior leaders that APIs are a thing--this week is about access to resources. APIs are all about making vital company resources available in a self-service, and secure way over the open Internet. Despite popular belief, most APIs are not publicly available, just the overview, documentation, code samples, and other building blocks are publicly available. If a developer actually wants to use an API they have to register, and be given access to API endpoints, before they can do anything with them. There are some pretty&nbsp;proven approaches to API management&nbsp;out there, which include a centrally located developer center, simple API registration form, and potentially multiple service levels, that all help manage how APIs are accessed and put to use. API resources can be anything from a company directory, to details of specific projects, or possible access to company compute, storage and other common IT resources. Anything you do on your computer at work, or have published via your website, can be made available via APIs, and easily accessed through a public or private portal, in a 24/7, self-service manner--all without needing to make a request for IT resources. This type of efficiency is what every company needs to be competitive in coming years, ensuring that every employee has access to the resources they need to get their job done. Access to corporate or organization resources via APIs doesn&rsquo;t have to be something just for programmers. It is pretty likely that you already have web services at your company, but these APIs have been designed just for...[<a href="/2014/09/10/explaining-apis-to-senior-leadership-access-to-company-resources-without-the-it-hassle/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>When I think about the concept "API mashup", It conjures up visions of clever hacks using Twitter and Google Maps from 2008 or 2009, where savvy developers would find innovative ways to mashup two or more APIs, and deliver some sort of web, and eventually mobile application on top of a couple of common APIs. In 2014 I think the concept of a mashup has evolved, and while the term has fallen out of popularity with some people, I think the topic is still extremely relevant, and is something I want to discuss more at @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of this month. To continue this discussion we've asked four leaders from the world of APIs to join me on stage for a panel discussion we are calling &ldquo;The Next Generation API Stack&rdquo;: Issac Roth (@ijroth) of&nbsp;StrongLoop Kyle Wild (@dorkitude) of&nbsp;Keen.io Antony Falco (@antonyfalco) of&nbsp;Orchestrate.io Mehdi Medjaoui (@medjawii) of&nbsp;oAuth.io Justin Karneges (@jkarneges) of Fanout.io I want to discuss the concept of &ldquo;mashup&rdquo; which I think historically has represented what we do in the world of APIs, but is a term that has significantly moved on for experienced API developers. I&rsquo;m looking to discuss this from a client side perspective, but also from the API provider, API aggregator, and analystics perspective as well. When you look at what innovators like StrongLoop, Keen.io, Orchestrate, and Webshell are doing, it is much more than just mashing up two APIs and building a web app. Today's tools allow you to quickly mashup multiple APIs into new API stacks, bringing together your own resources, as well as those of other API providers, and deliver an intelligent stack of resources that any web, mobile, or Itnernet of things developer can use to build apps. Another thing that has evolved is the number of APIs being used, based only upon my own usage, my apps have gone using 2-3 APIs in 2009, to using potentially 20-30 APIs in a single app&mdash;dramatically...[<a href="/2014/09/08/a-conversation-with-ijroth-dorkitude-antonyfalco-and-medjawii-in-the-next-generation-api-stack-panel-apistrat/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>There was a very interesting piece from venture capitalist Albert Wenger (@albertwenger) of Union Square Ventures over the labor day weekend, called Labor Day: Right to an API Key (Algorithmic Organizing),&nbsp;that I&rsquo;ve had open ever since and wanted to take a moment to add my thoughts to. First let me say, I agree 100% with Albert&rsquo;s post, but I felt that the piece left out some very critical elements, which I think Albert simply left out because he was just trying to get a short thought published over a holiday weekend, but I feel pretty strongly these points are critical to his argument, and should be put out there. You can read the full post over on Albert's blog, but I think this statement sums it up nicely: There is a simple and universal regulatory change that would dramatically shift the bargaining power: an individual right to an API Key. By this I mean a key that would give an enduser *full* read/write access to the system including every action or screen the enduser can take or see on the web site or application. Alternatively one could think of this as an individual right to be represented by an algorithm. Shortly after Albert published his post, his partner Fred Wilson (@fredwilson) chimed in with his own post, called Algorithmic Organizing,&nbsp;and again I took just single paragraph that I think sums it up: I believe that in the long run these platforms may/will be replaced by blockchain based networks of labor where there is no platform middleman and there would be no need for a legal right to an API because all the data would be public by default. I agree with what both Albert and Fred are saying, and it makes me happy to see such prominent VC firms seeing the future in this way. What I wish to add to this conversation is some critical thought around the the business and political building blocks...[<a href="/2014/09/06/api-evangelist-thoughts-on-the-right-to-an-api-key-and-algorithmic-organizing/">Read More</a>]</p>

In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones for not just a specific company, but potentially an entire industry&mdash;so I wanted to provide some material you can use in your own conversations. First APIs are just like websites, but instead of being for humans they are meant for other desktop, web, server, and mobile applications. When you go to twitter.com you get an HTML listing of tweets, and when you go to api.twitter.com you get back JSON which is meant for other application to read, where the HTML is meant to make visible for the human API--that is it, that is the difference. I use Twitter in this example, but APIs can be used to deliver any data, content, or even programmatic resource like say an image resize or convert a Word document to a PDF file. APIs act just like web or mobile applications, and let you read, update, add, or delete any of these resources that have been made available via an API. When having this conversation, make sure and remind your leadership of the years between 1995 and 2000, when we were trying to convince our leadership that we should have websites. Remember all that selling we had to do to convince leadership that our company should have a website? Is there any question about whether or not your company should have a website in 2014? NO! This is the same thing that is going on with APIs between 2010 and 2015, and by 2015 to 2020, if your company doesn't have an API you will be at a serioius disadvantage. To get started, any data or content that you have on your website should be available via an API.

			<p>In my work everyday as the API Evangelist, I get to have some very interesting conversations, with a wide variety of folks, about how they are using APIs, as well as brainstorming other ways they can approach their API strategy allowing them to be more effective. One of the things that keep me going in this space is this diversity. One day I&rsquo;m looking at Developer.Trade.Gov for the Department of Commerce, the next talking to WordPress about APIs for 60 million websites, and then I&rsquo;m talking with the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the Family Search API, which is actively gathering, preserving, and sharing genealogical records from around the world. I&rsquo;m so lucky I get to speak with all of these folks about the benefits, and perils of APIs, helping them think through their approach to opening up their valuable resources using APIs. The process is nourishing for me because I get to speak to such a diverse number of implementations, push my understanding of what is possible with APIs, while also sharpening my critical eye, understanding of where APIs can help, or where they can possibly go wrong. Personally, I find a couple of things very intriguing about the Family Search API story: Mapping the worlds genealogical history using a publicly available API &mdash; Going Big!! Potential from participation by not just big partners, but the long tail of genealogical geeks Transparency, openness, and collaboration shining through as the solution beyond just the technology The mission driven focus of the API overlapping with my obsession for API evangelism intrigues and scares me Have existing developer area, APIs, and seemingly necessary building blocks but failed to achieve a platform level I&rsquo;m open to talking with anyone about their startup, SMB, enterprise, organizational, institutional, or government API, always leaving open a 15 minute slot to hear a good story, which turned into more than an hour of discussion with the Family Search...[<a href="/2014/09/03/an-api-evangelism-strategy-to-map-the-global-family-tree/">Read More</a>]</p>

I get quite a few nice comments about my blog(s) behind the scenes. Many are from the enterprise or insttutions, where I know I could never get away with publishing publicly. As the APi space has heated up in 2014, more people are trying to make sense of this API mayhem, and ultimately they come across my blog, and find &nbsp;valuable information that really helps them in their journey.
I have been considering adding a page, listing some of the kind words I get from folks--maybe I will someday, but today I received a nice email, one I couldn't help but ask if I could repost--so here is a nice message from Saswat Anand:

Hi
I have been reading your blogs and following you on Twitter for a couple of weeks now. I am a researcher in the Stanford&nbsp;University. By following your blogs and twits, I have been trying to understand the problems and opportunities in the API space.
I just wanted to drop a quick note to thank you for being a true evangelist for API's. I find your blogs very interesting both because of valuable information and your writing style.
Thanks,
Saswat

I can't lie, the number one reason I do API Evangelist is for me, but the number two reason is to help folks like Saswat make sense of the space. I don't care whether you are a researcher in higher education, startup founder, or work at a government agency, I want you to understand APIs.
I couldn't be more stoked in my career right now, and be happier with what I'm doing. I was a little concerned if I had made the right decision to start API Evangelist back in 2010 and 2011, but in 2014, it has turned into some pretty meaningful work for me.
Thanks Saswat! Glad you find it valuable.

I never properly wrapped up my experience at API-Craft last month, where I moderated a pretty important panel discussion on hypermedia with Mike Amundsen (@mamund), Mike Kelly (@mikekelly85) Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik), Kevin Swiber (@kevinswiber), J&oslash;rn Wildt (@JornWildt), and Markus Lanthaler (@MarkusLanthaler).&nbsp;
The discussion was pretty amazing, I will let you watch for yourself. The action actually starts right at about 30:00 minute mark, so there is a lot of dead space until then.&nbsp;
  Broadcast live streaming video on Ustream
&nbsp;
Careful it is 3 hours of some pretty geeky talk, you might experience some hypermedia side effects. Seriously though, this is a pretty important video discussion about a very relevant, and often misunderstood part of API evolution. I highly recommend watching.
I'm just getting back down to this time period in my Evernote stack, so look for some more stories out of API Craft and hypermedia after rewatching this talk. Also stay tuned for upcoming stories from I Love APIs in San Francisco, #API360 Summit in Washington DC, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September.

I am making another pass through 821 companies doing interesting things with APIs, and flagging a handful of them as inactive. I will then attempt to contact each of the companies to see if anyone is home. All signs point to a handful of them being dormant projects, with silent blogs, twitter accounts, and other common streams you normally see flowing from API platforms.
If any of them are indeed shutting down, I&rsquo;m going to urge them to consider open sourcing as much of their API platform as they can, from server side, and client side code to API definitions. At the very least I would like to capture a snapshot of the API, the title, description, image, and a machine readable Swagger spec of the interface, to help record the pattern for future consideration.
I&rsquo;m sure some of these APIs will have investors they will have to consult before they can do something like open sourcing their API, and I&rsquo;m sure many of them won&rsquo;t even respond&mdash;I know how difficult it is after you have to put your startup down. Regardless I will at least flag them, make an attempt to contact, and if they don&rsquo;t respond I&rsquo;ll queue them up for profiling, and build an archive of abandoned API.
In forty years I&rsquo;ll be that old crazy guy in the neighborhood who has piles and piles of old APIs laying around his yard. ;-)  These damn things will be worth a fortune some day!!
Seriously, if you have an API that you are planning to deprecate, please reach out, I'd be happy to help archive it for the history books.

			<p>I&rsquo;m needing to quantify the work i do around APIs in higher education for a university in the U.K., so I figured I&rsquo;d craft into a story that I can share with my readers, and potentially other schools who would ask what it is that I do. I am interested in APIs in higher education because I feel strongly that our institutions are a fertile environment for ensuring that the next generation of our society possess the digital literacy they will need to navigate and find success in our increasingly digital world. When I mention that higher education institutions should be incorporating APIs into daily operations, most folks immediately think of a very technical, IT directed effort, which is one layer to the discussion that should be considered, but ultimately it is about developing an awareness, and engagement by administration, faculty, and the students with the increasingly public APIs that surround us, as well as internal institutional APIs. Our personal, and business lives are moving into the cloud. We are increasingly dependent on web-based and mobile applications in many aspects of our lives, and a growing number of these software services have APIs, and API-enabled actions that can be taken by anyone, even non-developers. My mission as the API Evangelist is to help everyone be aware that APIs exist, and that they are there to assist you in your personal and business life. Which brings me back to higher education institutions being an important place to expose students, and faculty to the benefits of APIs&mdash;in preparation for the increasingly API driven world unfolding around us. While I pay attention to over a 100 categories of APIs, let&rsquo;s take one area, photos and images, and use as a backdrop for what I do. I pay attention to over 25 photo and image APIs that provide image related services for developers, as well as direct access to the popular photo and image platforms we often depend on...[<a href="/2014/08/28/explaining-my-work-around-apis-in-higher-education-to-institutions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to APIs, the quickest way to get an API for your company, organization or government agency is to choose to only use online services that have APIs. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Github, Instagram, Flickr, and many other popular services you already use, all have APIs. As I&rsquo;m expanding on my tracking of API deployment tools, to include deploying APIs via Google Spreadsheets, and to scraping data from websites, I can&rsquo;t help but step back and consider truly what is the easiest way to deploy an API, which really is about choosing to use online services that already have an API--no connecting to your backend systems necessary! We talk about APIs in the context of developers, using APIs to build applications for end-users, and provide system integrations. What if we talked about it in context of the users, and helping individual users aggregate their APIs into a single, personal API stack? As Joe or Jane user, I could have my own personal API hub, with code samples, and other resources to understand how to access my APIs. I&rsquo;m not sure how oAuth would be triggered in this scenario (needs more thought), if a developer wanted access to my Facebook or other private data, but if I ran WordPress, and included my Flickr photos in my API stack, API access could be pretty straightforward. Thinking of this in the context of enabling personal API hubs is a pretty far out there concept, but understanding that you can have an isntant API just by using common services that have APIs, is pretty powerful. In reality, the average person will rarely ever need a personal developer hub with a stack of APIs, but if we teach people that they need an API with all the service they use, so they can use services like Zapier, and the other API-enabled tools, we might just be able to keep SaaS providers honest, ensuring they always public APIs, transparency...[<a href="/2014/08/27/you-can-have-an-api-just-by-choosing-products-and-services-that-have-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the usage of spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs for several years now. Spreadsheets are everywhere, they are the number one data management tool in the world, and whether API developers like or not, spreadsheets will continue to collide with the API space, as both API providers, and consumers try to get things done using APIs. APIs are all about getting access to the resources you need, and spreadsheets are being used by both API providers and consumers to accomplish these goals. It makes complete sense to me that business users would be looking for solutions via spreadsheets, as they are one potential doorway to hacking for the average person&mdash;writing macros, calculations, and other dynamic features people execute within the spreadsheet. I know IT would like to think their central SQL, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and other database are where the valuable data and content assets are stored at a company, but in reality the most valuable data resources are often stored in spreadsheets across an organization. When it comes time to deploying APIs, this is the first place you should look for your datasources, resulting in Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet to API solutions like we&rsquo;ve seen from API Spark. I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets used by companies to deploy APIs in some of the following ways: Microsoft Excel - Turning Microsoft Excel spreadsheets directly into APIs. by taking a spreadsheet, and generating an API is the fastest way to go from closed data resource to an API for anyone to access, even without programming experience. Google Spreadsheet - Mounting public and private Google Spreadsheets is an increasingly popular way to publish smaller datasets as APIs. Since Google Spreadsheets is web-based, it becomes very easy to use the Google Spreadsheet API to access any Spreadsheet in a Google account, then generate a web API interface that can allow for reading or writing to a spreadsheet data source via a public, or privately secured API....[<a href="/2014/08/27/using-excel-as-an-api-datasource-and-an-api-client-for-the-masses/">Read More</a>]</p>

Enterprise social API Jive Software wins for the best developer landing page. Normally I tell folks, like I did with Trade.gov last week, that your landing page should have a short, precise description of what you API does&mdash;this is some seriously valuable real estate, and you have one chance to make an impression.
I would put Jive Software into the category of more making a first impression, than providing a short description of what the API does:

I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this approach for every API provider, but if you can do it right, and make a solid first impression&mdash;run with it! As an API Evangelist, and IPA Evangelist, I can seriously get behind a message like &ldquo;brew up something awesome&rdquo;. +1
I like how they have apps, docs, APIs, and IPAs as taps, and the taps even work when you mouseover!  Seriously, all of this API shit is hard to make entertaining (trust me I know), and when you can provide this human touches while inciting innovation, they can go a long way in breaking the ice with consumers.
Right above the taps Jive Software provides the essential getting started, and register links for their APIs, which signals that beyond the fun facade, they mean business, and want to help you onboard with using their APIs. I haven&rsquo;t dug deep into the Jive Software API to see what else is going on, but after this first impression it is likely I will be looking around more, now that they made a good first impression.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>Containers are a fast growing trend when it comes to delivering compute resources online. Reflecting the world of API design, I feel containers are about deploying exactly the cloud resources you will need to complete a specific compute objective, then putting everything into a single virtualized container definition, that can be forked, clone, scaled, and evolved indpendently of any other resources. Each individual container posesses everything it will need from the operating system, file system, database, necessary libraries, and APIs to accomplish its given objective. Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I would consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are often sold B2B, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use anywhere in the API economy. My goal is to understand how APIs and containers work together, and as I do with all of my research I setup a Github repo for tracking every piece of container news I read that I feel is relevant, each company doing interesting things containers, tools for working with containers, and ultimately my analysis. Cloud computing will continue to be the lead driver of innovation in the API space, and I feel the introduction of cloud computing in 2006&ndash;2008 gave legitimacy to web APIs&mdash;you could now deploy global infrastructure using web APIs, game on. I think containerization will take API design, deployment, management and integration to the next phase, and closer the early visions of a programmable web we all started envisioning around 2005. I will be taking each of my API designs, and developing an Amazon Machine Image, Heroku App version, as well as a docker container definition.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I have been doing a lot of research into the world of financial APIs, specifically looking at some of the larger companies providing APIs that deliver market news, data, corporate profiles, and other data that make markets go round.
As I consider some of the common building blocks that are common across many financial API--real-time data frameworks, and visualization tools are two of the top items that I think will be part of every financial API stack in the future. Almost every API I looked at had some sort of real-time stream, promising data faster, as well as a way to extract meaning from these streams using template, or custom visualizations.
I&rsquo;m tracking on real-time API services and tools, and i&rsquo;ve been seeing some of these frameworks, like Firebase getting baked in by default to some API platforms. I am also tracking on visualization tools, I just don&rsquo;t have the research published as a Github repository yet, like I do with my real-time research.
I will keep tracking on API providers who are doing interesting things with real-time or visualizations, and hopefully be able to publish more examples. I can&rsquo;t help but think there are some pretty interesting opportunities for open frameworks, and white label solutions for API providers when it comes to real-time, and visualization layers on top of their existing APIs.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I was keeping an eye out for interesting API stories on ProductHunt the other day and came across an cool notification startup that lives in the Stripe API ecosystem, called Hooked.
Hooked allows users to set up notifications for any events related to a Stripe account. Hooked uses the Stripe API to disocver events, and then employs webhooks to send notifications.
As I'm writing this story, I realize this is very similar to my previous story today about real-time and visualization layers for APIs, and that notifications could easily be provided as a white label solution for API providers, giving them a ready to go notification layer to their APIs.
Right now I lump notifications in my research under real-time, but I think I will be pulling it out into its own research area. Notifications are real-time, but they are more messaging than just a real-time feature, but they are kind of more real-time than just a message too. Does that make sense?
We'll see. That is the fun of my API Evangelist research network, is that all of it is pretty liquid&mdash;allowing me to keep moving things around until they make sense in my head.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
My friend Mark Silverberg (@skram), pointed out a very cool API the other day, that geolocates zip codes, and appropriately named&nbsp;ZipLocate. What I really like about ZipLocate is that they do one thing, and they do it well. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love me some AWS and Twilio, who have industrial grade APIs, but I also have a love for simple, lightweight APIs that focus on one thing.
Another interesting thing about ZipLocate is that it is always free, and never rate limited. He says that it is relatively cheap to host the API, because bandwidth usage is light, with all API calls are heavily cached. I like this type of micro service design--I want thousands more just like it.
What I also dig about ZipLocate is that if you &ldquo;...don't trust the API to be around tomorrow? Host it yourself. Source code and data import scripts available on Github&rdquo;. This is possible because the ZipLocate API is open source, and the data comes from the Census Bureau. This approach to developing dead simple APIs on top of government data is really important, and I personally feel that all 6,482 data sets across 22 federal agencies who have published their data.json file, should have APIs just like ZipLocate.
It looks like ZipLocate is a project developed by Nathan Cahill (@nathancahill). I like his style, and think his approach is simple, elegant, yet extremely powerful, and provides a blueprint that others can follow when designing, developing and deploying APIs built on top of public data.

I have been slowly producing my own stack of APIs, which I'm putting under The API Stack brand. My goal with each of these APIs is to do one thing, and do it well, then package up the server side code, API definition, and publish as its own standalone Github repository.&nbsp;
I have an Evernote full of ideas for APIs, and I'm seeing plenty of great API designs that I could easily emulate from the rest of The API Stack. As I have time, I will deploy each of my API designs as an API Stack API, eventually looking to build a robust stack of utility APIs.
To support this I've separate out my APIs here into two separate pages, my core APIs, which will provide access to content across the API Evangelist network, and my stack APIs which will all be the modular, API Stack designs.&nbsp;
When I'm done deploying any new design, and I feel it is ready for primetime, I will list here for every to check out and play with.

I was looking around the Google Developer area as part of some regular work, and I noticed an interesting page Google has under their mapping session, that help users decide which API they need&nbsp;based upon their goals.
As the page says: "The API picker lists the most common things you may want to do on a map or with location-based data, and suggests the API that most suits your needs. For details about each API, follow the links to the related documentation."

&nbsp;
I don't think that the table layout Google uses is a particularly good one, resulting in a pretty busy looking matrix. I don't think it is a perfect solution, but I like the idea of providing developers with some sort of assistance in understand which API to use, based upon their goals.
This is something that a larger API provider would probably do, but a simple little needs calculator that could help users translate what they are looking for into what the API does, is an interesting concept to play with for some API providers.

In the beginning there was just Gluecon, Defrag, and the Business of APIs, then 3Scale and API Evangelist got together and started planning for @APIStrat, then immediately API Days happened, Nordic APIs came on the scene, API-Crafta&nbsp; grew beyond just Meetup, and before you know we have 14 separate events. I&rsquo;m going to be biased here, because @APIStrat is my baby, and I&rsquo;ve been involved in supporting API Days since day, so these two events will always have a special place in my heart. Even with this I believe in interoperability in the community and I am working to support all of the events equally, so if you are organizing make sure and reach out. You can find me at I Love APIs in a couple weeks in San Francisco, as well as at API 360 in Washington DC the same week, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September, and Nordic APIs in October. Unfortunately we messed up in planning @APIStrat, and made it at the same time as REST Fest, which seriously pissed me off&mdash;so I won&rsquo;t be attending REST Fest yet again this year. :-( This is part of the reason I'm putting together this research, so I don't make this mistake again. As with the rest of my work, I setup a Github repo, and website to give me a single place to aggregate information on API events. I will do my best keep up to date, for my own education, but I am also looking to help you understand each of the events, the organizers, sponsors, speakers, and also who is attending.

Electronic search engine APIs Octopart developed a pretty slick Microsoft Excel plugin for their API a while  back, and have now taken it to the next level, with a Google Spreadsheet connector for their API. You can find a simple video on on their site, and the code on Github.
Using the open source Google Spreadsheet API connector, you can connect to the latest electronic parts pricing and availability in your Google Docs, kept up-to-date using the Octopart API&mdash;providing a pretty interesting way to maintain a bill of materials (BOM), across multiple providers.
Octopart's approach to using both Microsoft Excel, and Google Spreadsheets as an interface for the average business person is pretty interesting, not because it is the perfect technological solution, but because it brings the value of APIs closer to the actual business problem owners.
Octopart helped increase my awareness of spreadsheets being in conjunction with APIs, but after seeing other providers like Twilio using Google Spreadsheet for storing SMS, and the increased usage of API reciprocity providers like Zapier, making me think spreadsheets have quite a future in the API space.
What innovative uses of Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets are you seeing in conjunction with common, or even unique APIs?

I am super stoked to announce that we have Andrew Nacin (@nacin), the lead developer from WordPress keynoting API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago next month. We are looking to continue the conversation around an official WordPress API, scheduled for inclusion in the WordPress 4.1 release.
While an API for WordPress may not seem like anything that big, when you think about it being baked into WordPress by default, it means that over 60 million websites will potentially get an API, and 22% of the top 10 million websites run WordPress&mdash;a pretty significant shift.
WordPress is still taking feedback on their upcoming API release, and you can visit their website and participate there, and now you can also come to Chicago the end of September, and hear Andrew talk about his work at WordPress, and participate in the convversation around the WordPress API afterwards in the halls.
Make sure and get registered soon, you only have 4 weeks left before we all come together for @APIStrat in Chicago.

			<p><em>23 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>The new Heroku Button gets us one step closer to a new age of API deployment, where anyone can deploy the APIs they need without any developer or IT resources. As I&rsquo;m working on packaging up API designs for my screen capture API, and image manipulation API, this type of approach is what I&rsquo;m envisioning for all of my APIs in the future&mdash;push button API deployment. You shouldn't have to wait to deploy the API you need. Just as we are beginning to deploy pre-packaged application stacks like Wordpress, and Drupal, we should be able to deploy common API deployments for images, blogs, videos, and much, much more, with a single click of a button. Once any new API is launched it can be configured, and connected to other systems using the API, allowing it to operate as part of larger stack, or stay as completely independent node &nbsp;that just checks in with the mother ship from time to time. While there will remain a handful of API leaders like Twilio and SendGrid who will have a big presence, many of the APIs in this next wave of API deployment will be smaller, and more transient in nature, taking advantage of current cloud trends around PaaS, and containerization. This new type of APis will possess a self contained blueprint for the OS, database, server-side code, API definition, and even configuration, integration, and automation tooling for the API. I&rsquo;m working on Docker definitions for creen capture&nbsp;andimage manipulation AP, as well as other APIs I develop in the future, but first I think any API I deisn shouldl run as a Heroku app, that anyone can deploy in their own account with a single click of a button. It won't take much work to make this happen for any API I deploy, and since 3Scale API infrastructure, which I use to secure my APIs, already runs on Heroku--making securing, and managing my Heroku deployed APis seamless.

I was trying to get a list of each of the City of Chicago Twitter accounts, and while I&rsquo;m glad there is a central social media account list, I always want an API so I can eliminate the need for data entry. After I posted my story, Oliver Seiler (@0seiler) emailed me the API endpoint for the New Zealand Government Directory API, which doesn't include the social media information that our federal government social media directory API delivers, but offers another look at what one possible pattern for government directory APIs is. This is one of the by-products of&nbsp;my profiling of federal government APIs, that I will begin to see API patterns that ALL government possess, things like a directory API. There should be a WordPress of the government directory API, a open source PHP Web API, possessing a common API definition, allowing any government agency, of any level, to be able to quickly download and deploy a directory API for their branch of government. I&rsquo;m hoping when I&rsquo;m done with my profiling of 120 federal government APIs, I'll have better suggestions of which APIs patterns government agencies should be offering by default. I will also have API definitions for all of these government API patterns, which I can probably pretty quickly crank out server side API code to support&mdash;who knows maybe Wordpress 4.1 will be available by then and I can use Wordpress as an API deployment framework. Until then I will just start tracking on all the common patterns for government API deployment, and publish as stories her on API Evangelist, and on my federal government research site.

Heroku&rsquo;s goals around APIs design are, "consistency and focusing on business logic while avoiding design bikeshedding&rdquo;.  They put out the guide to drive consistent aPI design practices at Heroku, but are also interested in sharing with the wider API community.
I think API design best practices are something every API provider should have, and publish publicly (on Github). I think it is ok to even fork, and modify existing guides like Heroku&rsquo;s or maybe from 18F out of federal government. This most important thing is that you have a guide that can guide your team, or other teams within your organization.
Now that I&rsquo;m seeing more of these, I will start flagging, and aggregating them so we can browse and continue learn the API design practices from the leading API providers out there.

			<p><em>21 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>In my monitoring of the API space, when I started seeing a large number of blog posts, tweets, companies, and other elements I track on get tagged with the same tag over and over, I take notice. My blogging, CRM, and news curation system all have their own tag cloud interface for the week, showing which tags have been applied--so if a tag gets heavy usage, I know it. Over the last couple of years, I've spun up new research into other areas within the world of APIs, beyond my core design, deployment, management, evangelism, discovery, and integration research. I created separate buckets beyond just provide and consume to track on these new areas, called trends, opportunities, and priorities. In 2014 it is beginning to seem like each of my trend research areas are getting baked directly into API platforms, ranging from real-time features with Firebase, to reciprocity by default using Zapier. API providers are learning that having a real-time layer, or a reciprocity layer baked into their platform is a good thing, and why reinvent the wheel when you have kick ass solutions like Firebase and Zapier. It makes sense that API providers would be looking externally to deliver&nbsp;aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, and even voice layers for their API platforms--this stuff is hard, and why spread yourself too thin. Intuit just bought reciprocity provider itDuzzit, and I think we will more providers integrating Zapier into their platforms by default like Nimble did. We'll also see more API platforms bring in Firebase as a real-time layer like Nest did for their Internet of Things (Iot) thermostat API platform. Overall it seems like a white label solution that any API provider could put to use when considering solutions for aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice or even data solutions including spreadsheet connectors, analysis, and visualization, would do well in the space. At the very least, any company looking to step up and provide solutions in these areas, should definitely...[<a href="/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I first wrote about openFDA back in June, showcasing the launch of their new developer area, and I'm happy to see they aren't missing a beat when it comes to launching new APIs. I recently saw that openFDA just launch a new endpoint, called the Drug Label API, which allows you to query over 60K prescriptions and over-the-counter drug labels.
It is satisfying to see such a large government agency find their API mojo. The original spark at the FDA was lit by Presidential Innovate Fellow Sean Herron (@seanherron), but most recently Sean has handed off the iniative to an internal team who will keep they platform moving forward using the same formula.

Beyond just the API, openFDA is also seriously putting the "open" in openFDA with:

Public Repo on GitHub&nbsp;
Extensive Community Q&amp;A on StackExchange
Progress Terms of Service for Government

Everything the openFDA is doing provides a great blueprint for other agencies to follow, from their creative evolution of the interactive API documentation, to encouraging other federal agencies to fork, and use the openFDA TOS in their own platforms.
The work coming out of the FDA makes me happy, because it sets a strong example that other agencies can follow, provides the rest of us with something positive that we can highlight when working to change public opinion, but also because it is such extremely vital data, and should be available in full download, and API format so that it can stimulate web and mobile app development, and system integration across the private sector.

			<p><em>21 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m adding PokitDok, a simple API for healthcare to The API Stack, and my overall APIs in healthcare research. Well I didn't exactly add them, PokitDok added themselves to my healthcare research by forking the Github repository, and adding themselves to the JSON data source&mdash;once I received the pull request, I accepted, and they were published on the site.
Usually once a week I spend time to manually adding new companies I've come across in my monitoring of the API space, but being a one man show I can&rsquo;t find everything across this massively expanding space. This is why I depend on you to help me curate the best from across the space. Not everyone knows that the entire API Evangelist network of 60+ research projects all runs on Github, which allows anyone to help write posts, curate industry news, and maintain the lists of API providers.
As soon as I accepted the pull request for PokitDok, I also tagged them as &ldquo;API Stack&rdquo;, which immediately adds PokitDok to The API Stack, listed under healthcare. No matter which doorway a company enters, I will make sure they get published to all appropriate research areas across the API Evangelist network, using my tagging system.
Thanks PokitDok for adding yourself, and I look forward to paying attention to the good things coming our of your API platform via your Blog, Twitter, and Github profiles.

			<p><em>20 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I depend on a number of cloud services to make my personal and business world go round. Even as a programmer, who can hand code just about any script to integrate, automate, and orchestrate my world, I find myself using more reciprocity services like IFTTT and Zapier. API reciprocity providers are one of the most important evolutions of the API space, because they make the whole world of APis accessible to the normals, and not just to the geek crowd. My time is valuable, and personally I'd rather being using existing tools and services, rather than re-inventing the wheel, and when it comes to orchestrating my online life, I need all the help I can, which is why I am looking IFTTT and Zapier for help. I&rsquo;ve been using both platforms in 2014, but as I do with any other software I&rsquo;ve been dating for any sustained period, I start looking at getting a little more serious. This is where I have to part ways with IFTTT, and other other platforms that don&rsquo;t have clear relief valves for their free tier, allowing me to start paying monthly or annually for my use of their service, and sensibly scale up as my needs grow. Zapier has a pretty straightforward pricing framework, giving you just enough room to get hooked, then you can pay for more usage as needed. Having a free tier for any cloud service is essential, but having a tiered business model, and clear monetization strategy, so I know that you will be around in the future, is a requirement. I will keep my IFTT account to play with, but when it comes operating my business, continuing to integrate Zapier into my workflow makes sense as they have a clear business model that fits my needs. Plus Zapier has an API. Ummmm&hellip;hello? An API for your automation and integration layer across all the services you depend on, via their APIs--how cool is that!

			<p><em>20 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The sharing economy is booming, and with the release of the Uber API, the attention on this space will only increase. Personally I&rsquo;m only  interested in the surface area of the API that Uber has released, and what it tells about the opportunity for API designers in the sharing economy.
I think the surface area of the Uber API is pretty minimal, but very significant when you look at it as a glimpse of what is to come, as the sharing economy gets a direct pipeline to the API economy, and the resulting app economy. Oh yeah, I went there&mdash;I used all the economy buzzwords in once sentence. Seriously, I think the five endpoints that Uber launched with, are very telling:

/products
/estimates/price
/estimates/time
/history
/me

These API endpoints represent the beginning of the shared economy API surface area, and while there will be many additions, augmentations, and different takes on what APIs look like in the sharing economy, I predict many other providers will often emulate Uber in their own design.
I&rsquo;m not really equipped to make a judgement on the value or importance of the Uber API. What I can do is keep an eye on Uber, and other sharing economy startup and their APIs, and look for patterns across each of the implementations. Hopefully the space can remain true to their roots, and make sure the API definitions are shareable, and reusable across the flourishing sharing app sapce.
Uber is focused specifically in the transportation portion of the sharing economy, and this makes me consider the bigger picture, and who will step up to serve the larger sharing economy, with an Uber API platform for the sharing economy. I think much like the wider API space, as the sharing API space matures out there will lots of opportunities for aggregation, real-time, automation, messaging, payments, and other API essentials that are in service of the sharing economy.

I tag a lot of interesting companies that show up during my weekly API monitoring. When I see a tag go from 1 or 2, to over 5 companies--I take a closer look to see what is going on. An increase in the number of companies focusing in a specific area could be a trend, or it could be nothing.
The tag "API Agency" ticked over to 6 today, when I added&nbsp;Aquevix, an indian company that is focusing on API development. As of August 2014 I now have six separate agency style companies that I've found who have a focus on API design and development:

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking with a very nice recruiter over at Google over the last couple weeks, and she has been so kind in keeping me updated about opportunities for evangelism at Google. This is the 3rd round of talks I've had with Google while being the API Evangelist, talks that historically go nowhere because of their programming test, which is a super silly aspect of their HR process. I was straight up with the Google recruiter a couple of weeks ago when she first emailed me, and again when we talked on the phone last week&mdash;I do not take programming tests to open up doors for employment conversations, sorry. ;-( It is a waste of my time, and yours, and doesn&rsquo;t measure shit. I understand that you have to qualify large number of folks, at your very algorithmic-centric company, but when it comes to measuring what I do, a programming test isn&rsquo;t a thing. If programming a tic-tac-toe game on a live screen share is what you need to open up a conversation with professionals around evangelizing your platform, you need to look elsewhere. Nowhere in my role as the API Evangelist do I have to code under time pressure with someone else watching, sorry. I would even say, having hacker skills, trumps programming skills in a public facing evangelism role, and speed, quality of code go out the window. This is about making connections through hacker storytelling, something that doesn't always pencil out to producing best code, and is more about helping people understand what is possible using a platform, in the most meaningful way&mdash;requiring more focus on the person and their problems, not the code or algorthm. I&rsquo;ve managed to have man very meaningful conversations with other tech giants like Intel, IBM, large institutions like UC Berkeley, BYU, and establish fruitful relationships with partners like 3Scale and API Spark, and across federal agencies like Department of Education, Energy, NASA, and the White House...[<a href="/2014/08/20/sorry-google-your-programming-test-is-not-a-valid-measurement-of-my-skills/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
If you follow Twilio blog or Twitter account you can always find a good API story from the API leader. It also makes me happy to see trends I&rsquo;m seeing from other provider re-enforced by the API heavyweight. This time is providing spreadsheet integration with common API resources, like Twilio SMS.
Twilio has a pretty slick tool they call TwilioSheet that allows you to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet, and created a pretty nice walkthrough of the entire setup. Providing this type of functionality helps, as Twilio says, "make it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet&rdquo;&mdash;emphasis on the non-developers.
Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet is the #1 database solution in the world, and provide a huge opportunity when it comes to bridging the world of APIs with the wider business landscape. This is something that API reciprocity providers like Zapier have bridging for a while now, and something that API providers like Intuit are looking to bank into their API platforms.
When you see Twilio doing something like providing providing spreadsheet integration for their API platform, you have to stop and consider whether or not it is something that might work for your own API platform. Spreadsheet integration by default with API your driven resources is a great way to expand the reach of any API, bringing these valuable resources within reach of the actual, everyday problem owners.

It can be hard to keep up with what the latest geek trends are--where all of the latest digital watering holes are&nbsp;(especially when your old), that allow you to find the latest info, conversations, and links to everything cool and hip. I depend on my network of API peeps for tips, and last week I was introduced to a new place that I wanted to pass on to you, called Product Hunt.
Product Hunt does a good job of describing what they do:
Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.
I&rsquo;ve had the site open for the last five days, scanning for cool tech creations that grab my attention, and when I opened the tab today, I noticed that APIs dominated the top of the list.

You see the Uber API (of course), and Zapier both jockeying for top slots, as well as Product Hunts API too. Product Hunt allows you to post product name, tagline, and url for any web, mobile or single page app&mdash;a format that is perfect for publishing and sharing your individual API resource creations.
I&rsquo;m going to be adding Product Hunt as an API Evangelism building block, publishing my own API creations, as well as encouraging my API readers to do the same. The platform seems like a great way to show off your API, and generate buzz (or not) around each API resource we bring to the table.

			<p>One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit. Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and reciprocity providers. I&rsquo;ve been seeing more API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs. I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers. The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers have the potential to reach beyond a core developer audience by: The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required. With their technology combined with the range of QuickBooks platform services we already offer, the breadth and depth of integrations our partners can build will grow tremendously. itDuzzit&rsquo;s sophisticated rules-based engine really set them apart from the competition, and their technology benefits the entire QuickBooks Online ecosystem: third-party developers, accountants and small businesses. The world of accounting seems like a great place to start when providing interoperability, automation, and reciprocity tools that are not just developers, but also empower end-users to use API. If you are as advanced as Zapier, even your reciprocity layer will have an API that developers&nbsp;can&nbsp;put to use when taking advantage of the cross platform API integration and automation possibilities. I will keep an eye on the Intuit partner Platform, and see what they end up doing with itDuzzit. According to the press release, "The Intuit and itDuzzit teams are already collaborating to fold the technology into the Intuit Partner Platform&rdquo;, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see some interesting API reciprocity patterns that I can highlight here on API Evangelist, and other API providers can follow when considering their own reciprocity...[<a href="/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The Bing Developer Center team has released a pretty interesting pluginthat assist developers who use Visual Studio when building web or mobile applications using APIs. In an effort to make developers lives easier, the Bing Developer Assistant now comes with integrated API code search that, &ldquo;while coding, a relevant code snippet related to your current API will be automatically displayed in the IntelliSense window which is powered by Bing Code Search". "Code snippets are short piece of code that you can easily learn and copy", and you can "copy the code, or click the source URL to view where the code snippet comes from, or click "Search More" to find more code samples related to the API". Which seems like it could easily be extended to other aspects of the API, using APIs.json url type, allowing for the discovery of videos, how-to, and other supporting API resources. The approach by the Bing Developer Center team&nbsp;reflects what I&rsquo;m seeing from Salesforce, Google, and other API IDE integrations. I&rsquo;m interested in continuing to explore what role API definitions like Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML will play when it comes to API discovery via popular IDEs like Visual Studio. I also envision APIs.json also taking a lead role when it comes to discovering new APIs, or pulling from a curated list of existing APIs, while programming within any IDE. There will also be an opportunity for IT, and development support staff to discovery API resources using API search engines like APIs.io, and then create their own internal APIs.json collection of sanctioned API resources from across public, partner and internal sources. IDE API integration isn't something that will just be for the big players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google. As more API providers publish machine readable API definitions, complete with APIs.json indexes of these resources--we&rsquo;ll begin to see more niche IDE developers who are curating meaningful stacks of API resources from a variety of sources into a single, rich...[<a href="/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">Read More</a>]</p>

I had someone ask me the other day if I had any numbers on how many APIs are used in a modern web or mobile applications--great question! I often refer to the growth in the number of APIs we use, but this is really just anecdotal, and not based on any real facts.
In August, as part of the&nbsp;lead up to&nbsp;@APIStrat&nbsp;I am spending more time reaching out to dev shops in Chicago, with the most recent talks with Bryson Pouw at Blaze Portfolio, and Dave Devitt at SYDCON. In future conversation I will make sure and ask the dev shops how many APIs they use in the average app they deliver.
If you have any data on the average number of APIs used in web or mobile apps at your agency, or know of research or stories that talk about this, please let me know.  Until now, many of the numbers being reported in the API space are coming from providers, I think we need to start gathering, tracking on, and reporting on API usage from the API consumption side of the coin.

An APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable index of APIs within a single developer hub, providing information on the API endpoints as well as any other supporting resources--there is no reason that all of this can&rsquo;t also be applied in a private setting.
APIs.json can easily be placed within a domain, subdomain, or at any network address, and be used to describe an internal collection of API resources, as well as bring in outside APIs. APIs.jsonbui excels at aggregating multiple, potentially disparate APIs, into a single coherent collection for use in development.
Using internal APIs.json files, a company, organization or governent agency can deploy an instance of an open source API search engine like APIs.io, or develop a custom API search tool that can aggregate the different APIs.json from each location, into a company wide API search and discovery destination.
An APIs.json provides a framework for referencing each APIs machine readable definition in Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML format, as well as other resources that internal developers will need to be successful, such as authentication info, SDKs, terms of service, and the multitude of other building blocks.
If you have public APIs, it will be a no brainer for you to generate machine readable API definitions for your APIs, and add them to a single, or potentially multiple APIs.json files for indexing. Even if you don&rsquo;t have public APis, you can put APIs.json to work improving your internal API discovery, while also opening up your API resources to the other benefits of having machine readable API definitions.Updated November 27, 2015: Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (READ MORE)

			<h3><a href="/2014/08/18/one-possible-reboot-of-the-api-stack/">One Possible Reboot Of The API Stack</a></h3>
			<p><em>18 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I used to publish out a list of curated stories each week, and a listing of the top 25 APIs I was paying attention to during my regular monitoring of the API space to a site I called The API Stack. When i went to Washington DC last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I suspended that weekly ritual, and never picked up after my world got back to normal.
I&rsquo;m still monitoring about 1000 companies, with over 2000 total APIs, and curating the stories--I just don&rsquo;t take the time each week to publish them to The API Stack. In an effort to try and reboot the project, provide value to the API Evangelist network, as well as to you my loayal reader, I've republished a new reflection of my work at the Github project. Right now it just lists 819 of the companies who are doing interesting things with APis in 114 categories.
Over the next couple weeks I will be reviewing each of these 819 companies APIs, and as I validate them, I will publish more detail. You can search for General Services Administration (GSA), under the Federal Stack to see an example of this work in action. I link to each of the GSA APIs, across multiple domains, and include a machine readable API definition as well as interactive documentation generated from the definition.
The API Stack will continue to be a window into my API targeting and monitoring, and I will update regularly as I have time. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that going forward, the API space needs to focus on the quality of APIs, and not just the number of APIs available, and The API Stack reflects this way of thinking, playing out in my own work.

			<p><em>18 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I recently talked with Bryson Pouw (@bpouw), Founder / CEO at&nbsp;Blaze Portfolio Systems in Chicago about how his portfolio management and trading technology company sees the world of APIs. Last week I had talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON, a web development shop, and this week I was very interested to hear Bryson&rsquo;s view on APIs, because his company is a little more niche, focusing specifically on the needs of the investment professional. Atom Align, the Blaze Portfolio Systems flagship product is looking to help investment professionals better manage their portfolios, and a big enabler of this is the Atom Align API,&nbsp;which provides programmatic access to: Information Queries &ndash; Obtain the list of portfolios, orders, brokers, and securities Trade Orders &ndash; Place, execute, cancel, and allocate trade orders Manage Trade Extracts &ndash; Create and download trade extract file The Atom Align API is only made available to trusted Blaze Portfolio partners and clients upon request, while also being used internally to drive system integrations. This approach to API design, as the core for specialty, or even widely available web and mobile applications, is the signature of a software development shop that has evolved and realized that a core API stack is essential for internal, as well as external integrations&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for public consumption when it comes to todays dev shop operations. Beyond their own internal Atom Align API, Blaze Portfolio also uses several other financial related APIs as part of their core operations. APIs are core to the Atom Align secret sauce, aggregating, refining, and making sense of markets by pulling data and content from multiple API sources, most notably financial data from Xignite. You can&rsquo;t be an investment professional in 2014 without having the right technology in your toolbox, and Blaze Portfolio has done well aggregating financial data from public API sources, into tje tool the pros are needing.

			<h3><a href="/2014/08/18/every-api-provider-should-have-a-logo-and-branding-page/">Every API Provider Should Have A Logo And Branding Page</a></h3>
			<p><em>18 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I spend a lot of time looking for good quality logos to represent the companies I track on and write stories about. I have a certain vision in my head about how I want company listings and detail pages to look across the API Evangelist network&mdash;something that takes a lot of work.
To support this vision, I spend a lot of time looking for logos. Sometimes you can find them in the header of a website, but often times they are poor quality, not configured to be standalone, or difficult to get at for any number of other reasons--making my work a lot tougher.
I published a new list of 819 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs that I call&nbsp;The API Stack. After publishing the project, Concur, one of the travel API providers&nbsp;listed, tweeted at me asking if I could replace their logo with a better quality one from their official logo page--I did so very quickly!
I sure love me a good logo and branding page for an API. It makes my life easier, by giving me a single place to go get high quality logos, without having to open up my image editor. I wish that more API platforms would have a well designed logo page like Concur.
