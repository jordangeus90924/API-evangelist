[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/imgtocss/IMG-to-API-Conversion.png" alt="" align="right" />][1]The [IMG to CSS API][1] lets you convert images to html/css using a RESTful interface, with API keys for authentication, and responses in JSON and XML.

The HTML / CSS code that is returned can be pretty bulky, but is a pixel by pixel representation of the image.

PNG images work best, but it also converts JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, and ICO formats.

The [IMG to CSS API][1] for image to HTML / CSS conversion is a perfect tool for the API stack.
