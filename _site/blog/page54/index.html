        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/16/using-the-crunchbase-api/">Using The Crunchbase API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Audrey</a> came to me last night and said she had a project that she wanted to tackle, using the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase API</a>.  She wanted to pull a list of education startups that were founded in 2010-2012, showing their investments, CEO, founders and other related company information.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, I helped Audrey download a PHP Twitter bot, reverse engineer and make it work for an objective she had around Tweeting random responses to a certain type of tweet.  I figured she was ready to see what it took to hack on an API and get the research data she needed.</p>
<p>Audrey wanted to pull a list of startups that were educated related.  We started with the /search endpoint, using the query keyword &ldquo;education&rdquo;.   The query parameter appears to search the title, tags and overview of each Crunchbase entry, pulling way more than what we needed, 5700 in total.  Each search returned 10 startups, with a handful of fields for each company, not nearly enough information.</p>
<p>To prove we could get what we needed, we took the first startup returned, grabbed the name and used it to perform a company /entity search, returning a wealth of information.  We had what we were looking for including date founded, amount raised, CEO, founders as well as description, logos, addresses and other vital company information.</p>
<p>Back to the /search endpoint.  Each search only returned 10 results, when there were actually 5,700.  I looked at the documentation and the only parameter listed, was &ldquo;query&rdquo;.  No way to control how many results returned, paginate or otherwise.  So I start guessing, appending page=, and max=, maxrows=, anything to get more results.  Eventually I was able to change the page, so I was able to write logic to loop through each page, getting at all the results required.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-search-endpoint.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>For each returned result from the /search endpoint, I would take the company name and perform a company search on the /entity endpoint.  However each call to the endpoint would yield a 301, redirecting me to another URL.  So the search for:</p>
<blockquote><em>http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/Noodle+Education.js?api_key=[key]</em></blockquote>
<p>Get a 301 returned, with the following redirect URL:</p>
<blockquote><em>http://ec2-107-21-104-179.compute-1.amazonaws.com/v/1/company/noodle-education.js</em></blockquote>
<p>So for each /entity endpoint I would have to make two separate cURL calls to get a single record for a company.  An approach that is guarantee to get CrunchBase into the API billionaires club (as chatty APIs do), or at the very least generate a nice bill with their API management provider.</p>
<p>Next, I needed to create a table to store the data in, I looped through the JSON object and spit out a list of fields, so I could generate a SQL script to create the table.  There were a few duplicate fields, but quickly got a table up and the data inserted.  The data is decent.  There are a lot of issues with absence of default values, empty objects with available images, addresses, etc.  But nothing I&rsquo;m not used to wading through, to get what I need from an API.</p>
<p>With the /search endpoint based upon a single keyword search, that spans title, overview and tags, the search returned a lot of companies that didn&rsquo;t fit our search.  As we prepared to enter each record into a database, we would apply further filters, making sure there companies founded in 2010 or greater, and met other criteria, before actually inserting.</p>
<p>Now we had a MySQL table filled with 772 education startups.  I exported as CSV, uploaded as a Google Spreadsheet, and shared it with Audrey.  Game over.  She had what she needed.  Overall it took about 3 hours start to finish, which she felt was tedious, and feeling there was a lack of clarity regarding the whole process--something she couldn&rsquo;t have done with me and my API programming skills.  This is a problem CrunchBase.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/startup-ecosystem-visualization.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audrey is your target audience</span>.  This needs to be dead simple.  She shouldn&rsquo;t have to blindly navigate the API endpoints, documentation, data structures and holes in the data.  These are things I&rsquo;m used to having to cobble together, but an analyst like herself, won&rsquo;t have the time and patience.</p>
<p>I can tell the CrunchBase API was created by someone who didn&rsquo;t give a shit about the data, let alone use the API to build anything.  I saw a job posting from CrunchBase, so I know they are looking for someone to own the API.  I hope this person can become a steward for this great set of data, and make it into a meaningful API--there is a lot of potential there.</p>
<p>Quick feedback for whoever takes the job, regarding some building blocks to focus on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong> - Establish more meaningful names for the existing endpoints, while establishing some new ones</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Get the documentation complete!!  So what if you have I/O docs, if all the fields aren&rsquo;t defined</li>
<li><strong>POST / PUT</strong> - Al</li>
low folks to add and update data either after they curate and add to it, or from their own databases
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Create a blog, that lets me know someone is home.  Its so evident nobody is. </li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Provide me with an active Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ account to interact with you on and share what I&rsquo;m doing with your data</li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong> - I need some guidance with branding of CrunchBase data, when I publish in the wild</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Holy shit, the opportunity with badges, buttons and widgets around CrunchBase data.  This data is made for crunching and sharing in stories</li>
<li><strong>JS Library</strong> - You need a plug and play dictionary, demographic JavaScript library that allows bloggers, analysts, etc to embed on pages and provide a library with a rich set of demographic references, funding links and other vital data people will cite in stories and reports around the web</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet</strong> - From the I/O docs, provide export as CSV and to Google Spreadsheet.  Build Google Spreadsheet templates that allow users to enter their key into cell and it will pre-populate a spreadsheet with the data they are looking for, with the analysis, visualizations and other tools analysts will need</li>
</ul>
<p>CrunchBase is a goldmine of data.  As it is, I can make use of the data and generate value.  But the API won&rsquo;t remain at the center of that, I will extract the value I need and not return much to the platform, because well...it sucks ass.  I can&rsquo;t write back, and I do so much work to get the value I do, I feel like its mine after I&rsquo;m done. Especially if the platform has no person or personality that I consider an owner or steward. &nbsp;I don't feel beholden to give anything back. &nbsp;Just take...not good for your business.</p>
<p>You guys have a lot of potential within the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/io-docs">CrunchBase API</a>, I hope you dedicate the resources to make it work, and find a steward for the API that will actually care about what you have, and interact with your API consumers in a meaningful way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/braintree/braintree-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Next generation payment provider <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank">Braintree</a> just launched a new JavaScript library that helps  merchants reduce their PCI scope in a flexible and testable way, which they are calling appropriately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/braintrust/braintree-js" target="_blank">Braintree.js</a>.  According to Braintree, the library:</p>
<blockquote><em>...uses asymmetric encryption to prevent raw credit card data from passing through merchants' servers. It intercepts a form submit in the browser that contains sensitive data, encrypts that data with a public key provided to merchants by Braintree and then submits the form with the encrypted data to the server. Braintree retains the private key of the key pair so that merchants are unable to decrypt the encrypted fields server-side. Any string field in Braintree's API can be encrypted and encrypted values can be transparently dropped into any API call</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what I call a <a title="embeddable API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Embeddable">healthy embeddable strategy</a>, which includes buttons, badges, widgets and other tools you can build on top of an API or to support API integration.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/languages">rise in populartiy of JavaScript</a>, and the growth of platforms like Node.js, I predict that providing your API developers with standardized JS libraries that extend the value of your API will become commonplace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add a section to my <a title="embeddable building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">embeddable building blocks</a>, for JavaScript libraries. I&rsquo;m seeing more API providers doing cool stuff in this area.  I will try and record as much of it as I can during my industry monitoring each week and provide resources for you to follow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the <a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">potential of markup APIs and scripting platforms</a>&nbsp;in the past, which I think is a related example to what Braintree is doing--in which you can build JS libraries for your API users and extend not just the reach of the value generated by your APIs, but the expertise of your team.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pusher/cisimple-plus-pusher.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.pusher.com/using-pusher-to-power-cisimples-real-time-api/">This story comes</a> from Phil Leggetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) over at <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.  Its about a client of theirs, <a href="https://www.cisimple.com/">cisimple</a>, which provides continuous delivery services for mobile developers.  <a href="http://blog.cisimple.com/2013/03/06/check-out-our-shiny-new-api-and-pusher-integration/">cisimple just released a new API</a>, which gives mobile developers more control over the build processes for their mobile applications.</p>
<p>Using the cisimple API you can kick off new builds and download artifacts from your mobile dev process.  cisimple is a very interesting API resource, that I will definitely be watching, and I&rsquo;m sure I will be writing about in the near future.  But what I really think is interesting is that cisimple is allowing clients to register for real-time updates via Pusher channels, using API tokens.</p>
<p>This means that when you use cisimple to manage your mobile development, you now have a real-time push system that will send notifications when builds start, pass, fail, etc.  This opens up a whole world of human integration with the build process via desktop and mobile notifications, but also can be used in other systems that play a role in your dev cycles.</p>
<p>The weaving of a Pusher real-time notification layer into the cisimple API is pretty innovative. Something I&rsquo;m sure will deliver huge value to their customers.   But think of the potential as a standard approach for all API owners?  You could offer developers real-time notifications about their own usage of your API, providing them with an intimate view of how their application(s) are using an API.  Addiitionally it seems like you could set up a pretty interesting system wide notification layer that would let you, as the API owner, establish notification channels regarding overall API usage, thresholds and other important signals from your platform.</p>
<p>As I continue to dive into the <a title="real-time" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/realtime.php" target="_blank">world of real-time APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m surprised at the multiple ways in which we can truly deliver real-time value using APIs.  cisimple API + Pusher is in interesting addition.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/15/pinboard-api-tax-proposal/">Pinboard API Tax Proposal</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://pinboard.in" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard_in_blue.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Maciej Ceglowskiis, the founder of popular social bookmarking platform <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>,made an <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pinboard-dev/PidYOmyBaxI/mLDKIzC6olgJ" target="_blank">interesting proposal over on the Pinboard Google Group</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I've been thinking about imposing an API tax, the proceeds of which  would go into improving API infrastructure and offsetting operating costs, structured along these lines:</em></p>
<ul class="mainlist" style="padding-left: 30px; list-style: none;">
<li> 
<ul>
<li><em>API free to use for your own Pinboard account</em></li>
<li><em>Every API client making requests on behalf of someone else must register an app identifier</em></li>
<li><em>$20/year tax if your app makes requests for over 100 Pinboard accounts</em></li>
<li><em>$100/year tax if your app makes requests for over 1000 Pinboard accounts</em></li>
<li><em>Possibly additional price levels to waive certain rate limits</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Think of it as a road tax that then pays for further construction, repair, and  people in orange vests.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that Maciej has a lot of experience to back his proposal, watching how developers use Pinboard for their own purposes, or on behalf of a user via a client.  I heavily depend on Pinboard for my curation at API Evangelist, so API access would remain free for me.  I&rsquo;m not sure how I would feel if I was building a client.</p>
<p>On the forum, there is very interesting feedback from Matt Schmidt, developer of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pindroid">PinDroid</a>, the leading Pinboard client for Android:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I'm very much against this.  Why would you tax the makers of the apps that help drive use of your product, rather than the users themselves?  To extend your road use tax analogy, this is like taxing the car companies for their customer's use of the roads.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I offer PinDroid as a free, open source app and have no interest in making money off it, but I also have no interest in losing money on it.  Why not offer api access as a premium account feature (like archiving) for an extra buck instead?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To be clear, if such a "tax" were to be implemented, I will have to stop developing and supporting PinDroid and take it off the market.</em></p>
<p>Matt provides some real life feedback, that I can&rsquo;t.  PindDroid is a vital player in the PinBoard ecosystem, that could be hurt by such a tax.  Free and open source code and clients are a vital aspect of any API ecosystem, you definitely want to understand how this layer will be affected by such a tax.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pindroid"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pinboard/pindroid.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Maciej just made this proposal today, so the conversation is fresh.  Head over to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pinboard-dev/PidYOmyBaxI/mLDKIzC6olgJ" target="_parent">Pinboard Google Group</a> to weigh in.  I&rsquo;ll post another story after the conversation dies down, providing more thoughts about API taxes.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Business-APIs-1-Kin-Lane/dp/1461113881/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304210432&amp;sr=1-5"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/business-of-apis/Business-of-APIs-Front-Cover-Cropped.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In May 2011 I released a book called the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Business-APIs-1-Kin-Lane/dp/1461113881/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304210432&amp;sr=1-5">Business of APIs</a>. The book was intended to be an introductory walkthrough for non-technical people, to the world of APIs. I wanted to educate business, organizational and governmental leaders about the space, and the important role of APIs in having a healthy digital strategy.</p>
<p>Its coming up on two years later, and I'm finally getting around to updating the Business of APIs. After a nice long walk on the strand with <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>, we have the outline for the next version:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>What are APIs used for?</li>
<li>The history of APIs</li>
<li>What goes into an API?</li>
<li>Do you need an API?</li>
<li>How do you get an API??</li>
<li>What are the common building blocks of an API?</li>
<li>What are possible business models for an API?</li>
<li>How do you evangelize and support an API?</li>
<li>Where have some APIs stumbled?</li>
<li>APIs, a new way of doing business</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the Business of APIs is the same. Help anyone, from any company, organization or the government understand what an API is, and why they are important. &nbsp;You don't have to be a developer to put APIs to use, this book is for everyone.</p>
<p>Look for an updated version of the Business of APIs by June. I'll still keep it a simple guide to the space, but provide a whole lot more information that will help you understand the Business of APIs.</p>

        <p><a href="http://punchfork.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-vertical.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I ended up at the Punfork API today for some reason. Full disclosure: "Punchfork has been acquired by Pinterest! <a href="http://punchfork.com/pinterest" target="_blank">Read the announcement</a>. Site shutdown: March 31st, 2013".  Just getting that out of the way. While at the site, I ended up at the <a href="http://punchfork.com/goodies/badges">Goodies page</a>, which I think represents a nice set of basic embeddable tools for an API.</p>
<p>First using Punchfork Badges, you can customize a badge, then copy and paste the embed code onto your blog's sidebar, or anywhere else you want it to appear:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-badges.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Then you can download a Punchfork logo (ok, its just one, but it gets point across):</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-logos.png" alt="" width="250" /></p>
<p>Last, you can enter your address and request a Punchfork sticker to be sent to you:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-stickers.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>These are all three, simple examples of a good approach to providing embeddable tools for users.  Badges are pretty straightforward, and it is sensible to provide logos and other images as part of a healthy branding strategy.  But the request for a sticker is something I haven't added to my listing of embeddable building blocks. After thinking about it, stickers are the OG embeddable tool.  Something your users can take offline, and embed anywhere.</p>
<p>At some point I will do a roundup of all the embeddable building blocks, since I've been adding some new ones like sticker request form.</p>

<p>I see a lot of new API platforms emerge, and often times you see them deploying their own solutions to problems that are actively solved by top API platforms, and are already adopted by common mobile and web app users.</p>
<p>The best example of this is with authentication.  Its growing more and more common that you don&rsquo;t build your own login, you use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google or Github oAuth.</p>
<p>It seems to me that when it comes to other common resources, the same could be applied.  So I&rsquo;m exploring what my essential stack of API driven resources might look like:</p>

<p>I could do quite a bit with this assembled as a single backend stack, if it included a regular datastore, key-value store, user management and other essentials for building apps.</p>
<p>It seems to me that new platforms shouldn&rsquo;t always create new silos, but bridge the existing ones that we depend on already.</p>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, the server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications in JavaScript, seems to be getting more attention lately from top API providers because of its event-driven, asynchronous I/O that can minimizeoverhead and maximize scalability.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/#readme">Google released an official Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs </a>that supports authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0.  Then earlier this week, Amazon Web Services announced that <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/aws-elastic-beanstalk-for-nodejs.html">AWS Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS solution now supports Node.js applications</a>.</p>
<p>While Google&rsquo;s deployment is a client, and AWS&rsquo;s is an application platform, they both have the same objective--enabling developers to build highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective applications using APIs.</p>
<p>Both Google and AWS recognize the potential for selling developers their valuable API driven resources, by providing them with Node.js solutions.  <a href="https://github.com/languages/JavaScript">JavaScript is the number one language on Github</a>, with Node dominating most starred and most forked overall categories, according to Github trends.</p>
<p>I think that AWS and Github both send a good signal to other API owners, that they need to step up the availablity of Node.js resources for their API developer communities.</p>

<p>One of the best aspects of being the API Evangelist, is I get to hang out with smart folks, doing gaming changing things across all business sectors.  Last week I was able to make it to the API Social, an event held in Berkeley by a group of API savvy faculty members.  This is my third one, and the group is up to some very interesting things.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with one UC Berkeley analyst about a problem that isn&rsquo;t just unique to a university, but they are working on an innovative solution for.</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<blockquote><em>UCB Developers are creating Web Services that provide access to sensitive data (e.g. grades, transcripts, current enrollments) but only trusted applications are typically allowed to access these Web Services to prevent misuse of the sensitive data.   Expanding access to these services, while preserving the confidentiality of the data, could provide student and third party developers with opportunities to create new applications that provide UCB students with enhanced services.</em></blockquote>
<p>The solution:</p>
<blockquote><em>Wrapping untrusted applications in a "Proxied Facade Service" framework that passes anonymous tickets through the &ldquo;untrusted&rdquo; application to underlying services that can independently extract the necessary personal information provides a secure way of allowing an application to retrieve a Web User&rsquo;s Business data (e.g. their current course enrollments) WITHOUT exposing any identifying information about the user to the untrusted application.</em></blockquote>
<p>I find their problem and solution fascinating, I also think it is something that could have huge potential.  When data leaves any school, healthcare provider, financial services or government office, the presence of sensitive data is always a concern.  More data will be leaving these trusted systems, for use in not just apps, but also for analysis and visualizations, and the need to scrub personally identifiable information will only grow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still processing everything the team at UC Berkeley is doing, but want to write about as I&rsquo;m wrapping my head around it.  If you know of any other services out there that do similar things, let me know.  I&rsquo;m curious to hear about other approaches to scrubbing personally identifiable information as it leaves systems via APIs.</p>

The are being very transparent about the process (which I like), and putting out the word looking for some new team members to help them get the job one.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks they want build an API that is simple and easy to use, but also capable of handling tens of millions of document conversations a month.  To help get the job done they are looking for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Sales Engineers</strong> - Boots on the ground to let them know what people want and to help us engage the developer community</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Engineers </strong>- Help them open source the demos we build and design our client-side libraries</li>
<li><strong>DevOps Engineers </strong>- Help them build the infrastructure we use to convert millions of documents each month</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5358861">Crocodoc posting on Hacker News</a>, but I&rsquo;m writing about because I appreciate API owner sending out signals that they are planning the next version of their API.  This type of transparancy is not just important in helping you find talent to make it happen, it sends a signal to the community that you are beginning a planning cycle and can encourage community feedback and involvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crocodoc API reworking sounds like a pretty innovative project to work on, and the <a title="Crocodoc" href="https://crocodoc.com/about/" target="_blank">Crocodoc team</a> looks like a pretty smart team to get a chance to work with.</p>

<p>Netflix has <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Changes_to_the_Public_API_Program" target="_blank">entered the final stages of shuttering its public API last week</a>.  Its been coming for a while now, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Upcoming_Changes_to_the_Netflix_API_Program" target="_blank">starting in June of 2012</a>, and now is official with the platform no longer accepting new API registrations.</p>
<p>After reading about the changes to the Netflix Public API program on their blog, and hearing much of the news in response, <a href="http://www.rethink-wireless.com/2013/03/11/netflix-public-api-program-retired.htm" target="_blank">everyone seems to file this away, along with the Twitter API</a>--just another API platform screwing over its developers.</p>
<p>As I do, I wanted to take a step back, look at the bigger picture and try understand what happened. &nbsp;On <a href="http://readwrite.com/2008/09/30/netflix_api_launches_tomorrow" target="_blank">October 1st 2008, Netflix launched their public API</a>, and they appear to have done everything right.  They had a blog, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Let_Us_Know_About_your_Libraries" target="_blank">solicited code samples from developers</a>, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/App_Gallery_Open_for_Developer_Submissions" target="_blank">accepted application submissions</a> and even <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Finding_nice_applications_via_the_Netflix_App_Gallery" target="_blank">showcased the developers apps in the gallery</a>.  Netflix would even help <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Promote_Your_App_to_Netflix_Subscribers" target="_blank">promote your app to Netflix subscribers</a> and <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Untitled_1" target="_blank">threw hackathons</a>.  The Netflix API team worked to <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/API_Performance_Improvements" target="_blank">improve API performance</a>, communicate regularly, but really nothing that amazing happened.</p>
<p>There were applications like <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/" target="_blank">InstaWatcher</a> and <a href="http://www.whichflicks.com/" target="_blank">WhichFlicks</a>&nbsp;(among others)&nbsp;developed on the API, but as Daniel Jacobson puts it, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/michaelhart2/api-strategy-evolution-at-netflix" target="_blank">a thousand flowers didn&rsquo;t bloom</a>.  In these situations its easy to blame the API provider, but developers didn&rsquo;t really step up and build anything that innovative and cool. So is this a failure of Netflix?  A failure of developers to innovate?  Or could it possibly be a third: failure of the API vision?</p>
<p>I would say the demise of the Netflix public API is equal part Netflix and the developer, and just the nature of the industry it exists in.  It didn&rsquo;t take me long to look through the Netflix API blog, so I can tell they didn&rsquo;t put alot into evangelizing the API.   But I really can&rsquo;t find any innovation that occurred by developers as part of it, so I think us devs have to share some of the responsibility as well.</p>
<p>Several of the blog posts covering the news last week, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/08/netflix-changes-its-current-api-program-by-ending-it-will-no/" target="_blank">compared this to Twitter</a> which I think for the untrained eye of the mainstream tech blogosphere, this is easy to do.  But Twitter is user generated content, via one of the newest types of content platforms, and Netflix is heavily licensed and policed content from one of the oldest content platforms.  I think expecting public API success from Netflix and / or developers was a lot to ask.</p>
<p>I love and believe in APIs, but I&rsquo;m not delusional enough to think they will work magically everywhere they are applied. However, even with the closing of the public Netflix API, I consider Netflix is an API success story.  Look what they&rsquo;ve done with their internal and partner APIs. They&rsquo;ve managed to scale not just from the data center to the cloud, but globally and across 800+ devices--while also <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">sharing this knowledge and wisdom with the public</a>&nbsp;via their blog:</p>

<p>When measuring the success or failures of API initatives, we can't use the same yardstick in all scenarios. When you look at the knowledge, wisdom and code that has come out of Netflix, there is no way you can say their API initiative is anything but a success. I don&rsquo;t see see Netflix as a case study in how to stream movies over the web via public APIs, but a deeply important experiment in how to deliver licensed content to over 800 devices, via the next generation of APIs. &nbsp;Something that probably isn't an edge case, it actually represents where we all might be headed in the near future.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get caught up in the recent deprecation of the Netflix public API. &nbsp;There is so much going on! &nbsp;Let's get studying some of the knowledge and technology coming out of Netflix. I know its my motivation for writing this post, and doing this research.</p>

<p>When it came to API focused events, the only conference there was to attend was the <a title="Business of APIs Conference" href="http://apiconference.com/">Business of APIs Conference</a>, from <a title="Mashery" href="http://mashery.com">Mashery</a>.  They have been putting on the conference(correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) since 2007.  There wasn&rsquo;t much of an "API Industry" back then, and Mashery was definitely the pioneer in the space, getting the word out and along with <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, has done a lot to define the API space.</p>
<p>Fast forward five years, and after the successful <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> in February (originally scheduled for November), there are now five API event series going on:</p>

<p>It is exciting to see the explosion of events, and I&rsquo;m hopeful regarding how much progress will occur in 2013 with this many conversations going on.  It is also promising to see the international growth, with Nordic APIs happening in Scandinavia, API Days coming from France, Business of APIs in London and API Summit spreading the conversation from United States and Australia.</p>
<p>With this amount of buzz, APIs will definitely continue its spread to the mainstream.  My only hope is that all the events make sure and represent the space well by being interoperable and sharing content, speakers and ideas openly so that the entire industry benefits.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/human-cutout.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the API movement marches forward, it continues to grind against the enterprise and its legacy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a>, which increases the frequency at which people ask me, <em>What is the difference between API and SOA?</em> This is not a technical explanation of the differences, but a philosophical one that many will argue does not apply, but in my opinion is the dark matter around the technological and business approach of SOA,  that makes API work.</p>
<p>Many say that a web API is just one component in an SOA toolbox.  This is true.  Using HTTP for an API is not that novel in itself.  That is until it jumped out of the enterprise petri dish, got a little oxygen to grow, allowing the introduction of some new aspects that the industry and technology overlords of SOA would never have introduced on their own.</p>
<p>While reading the <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/nation-building-in-the-age-of-apis/">Nation Building in the Age of APIs</a>, by Matt McLarty (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>) of <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a> today, he reminded me that:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Every paradigm shift in technology has been driven by both innovation&mdash;the new technology itself&mdash;and application&mdash;how that technology can be used.  In other words, there is a machine side and a people side to every technology change.  The technologists responsible for implementing these changes often bias towards their comfort zone&mdash;the machine side&mdash;and overlook the people side."</em></blockquote>
<p>He is right. &nbsp;APIs moves us closer to the people side of the equation, outside the technologists comfort zone, but I would also add that it moves it outside the business and industry leaderships comfort zone, introducing more balance that has the potential to make online communities, platforms and ecosystem thrive. Matt continues to say:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Ultimately, the success of a company&rsquo;s API will depend on the creation of a diverse community for that API&mdash;end users, partners, developers, and more&mdash;as well as the adoption of a business model that allows the API to contribute to the company&rsquo;s bottom line."</em></blockquote>
<p>SOA does a damn fine job of looking after the platforms (business), the developers (technology), but doesn't always provide for the best interest of the user--aka human side of the equation.  APIs have allowed for valuable resources to flow around traditional IT bottlenecks, outside the firewall and be put to use by those who are potentially closer to the human problem that is being solved.</p>
<p>API introduces newer pieces of the SOA puzzle, found within the OAuth security relationship, terms of use and privacy policies, self-service access, transparency, while also providing monetization strategies that encourage partner and developer innovation.</p>
<p>At first glance, it is easy to mistake API as just part of the SOA toolbox, but there are other nuances that bring SOA closer to the users, and solving the real problems they face, by developers who understand.  In the end I don't really think it matters whether you call it SOA or API, just make sure you include the essential ingredients that have worked with "open" APIs, whether your API is public, private or evolving your partner relationships.</p>

<p>As the API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ve made it my mission to go outside of the Silicon Valley bubble and educate the &ldquo;normals&rdquo; about the potential of APIs.  In doing this I have conversations with a wide range of folks from new startups, to the GSA in Washington DC.  One growing trend I&rsquo;m seeing is the number of VC and angel investors reaching out, to have me help them understand the API space and how it applies to their investments.</p>
<p>I have a couple VC&rsquo;s I talk to on a regular basis, but I have a growing number of new ones who are investing more and more in technology companies and need to get a grip on this API world.  As a Terry Kearns from Oxford Strategic Advisors, LLC,&nbsp;put it yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><em>"I wanna let you know I appreciate all the work you've done here. For a guy who is not a tech guy. You really help me out with a lot, your articles and information help me get my arms around this whole API world"</em></blockquote>
<p>That is my mission.  This is what I do.  Nobody pays me to educate people like this about the APIs space, but it is so critical that the folks who are investing in the next generation of healthcare, education, manufacturing and other business sectors, understand APIs, at least at a basic level.</p>
<p>APIs are part of fundamental change in how we conduct business, not just in technology sector, but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERY</span></strong> aspect of our government, business and even our personal lives.  Let me know how I can answer questions about your existing investment portfolio or regarding business sectors you are looking to invest in.</p>
<p>Make sure your companies truly understand APIs, and you are making educated investments.</p>

<p>Are you ready for more discussions about APIs?  I know I am. :) This time its from our Scandinavian friends, with four events in 2013.  <a title="Nordic APIs" href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank">Nordic APIs</a> is a series of conferences and events held across Scandinavia which provides knowledge and information about APIs.</p>
<p>API Evangelist is a supporter of Nordic APIs, and you will find me speaking at the 2 day event in Stockholm in September.  I will be speaking with Adam DuVander(<a href="https://twitter.com/@adamd">@adamd</a>) and John Musser(<a href="https://twitter.com/@johnusser">@johnusser</a>) of <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Jacob Ideskog (<a href="https://twitter.com/@jacobideskog">@jacobideskog</a>) and Travis Spencer (<a href="https://twitter.com/@travisspencer">@travisspencer</a>) of <a href="http://www.twobotechnologies.com/">Twobo Technologies</a>, as well as the notorious Andreas Krohn (<a href="https://twitter.com/@andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>).</p>
<p>I feel an awakening happening around APIs, and its not just a Silicon Valley thing.  People around the globe are becoming more aware of the potential of APIs.  I'm getting more and more requests from Europe and South America for API education, resources and tools.</p>
<p>We need to support as many of these open, vendor neutral conversations about APIs as we can.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Nordic APIs series is looking for sponsors and support</span>.  If your company is looking to break into Scandinavia, you should be supporting Nordic APIs, because its guaraneed to be a couple hundred of the smartest folks across the Scandanavian API space assembled in one building.</p>
<p>Head over to <a title="Nordic APIs" href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank">Nordic APIs site</a> and contact them directly to see how you can support the conversations that will be occurring across Scandavia, and I look forward to seeing you there.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.zypr.net/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zypr/zypr-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working through lists of APIs and API service providers who I&rsquo;ve rated pretty highly because of their work in the past, but red flags have gone up because I&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t seen a blog post, tweet or commit from them lately.  One of the service providers I&rsquo;m reviewing is <a title="Zypr" href="https://www.zypr.net/">Zypr</a>, which providers voice enabled architecture built on popular APIs.</p>
<p>Zypr fits in with my vision of where APIs are going, because Zypr is doing the same thing as aggregation, automation and other trending service providers, but the end goal is this use case is voice.  In Zyprs own words:</p>
<blockquote><em>Zypr aggregates proprietary 3rd party APIs, categorizes their functions, and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API. By aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes.</em></blockquote>
<p>That sounds exactly like what <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> is doing, but with voice as the vehicle for making valuable API resources avilable on apps running via mobile phones, tablets and in our cars and homes.  I really like the Zypr graphic.  I will have to create a similar version to articulate some the API trends I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zypr.net/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zypr/zypr-voice-enabled.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I hope Zypr is just heads down, working hard on their platform.  According to my API stack rank, there aren&rsquo;t very many positive signals coming out of the platform:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Last Blog Post - 09/28/2012</li>
<li>Last Tweet - 01/30/2013</li>
<li>Last Commit - 10 months ago</li>
</ul>
<p>What Zypr is doing is important--I hope they have enough runway to make happen. &nbsp;If they need to cut corners, they shouldn't replicate the service or client adapter portion of their platform, they could just partner with an existing <a title="API aggregator" href="/trends/aggregation.php">API aggregators</a>&nbsp;like Singly for these layers, as well as <a title="API reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers</a> like Elastic.io or Foxweave to migrate and tranform data. &nbsp;In my opinion Zypr should focus on how their engine works, and partner and generate open source to build the rest.</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to see more competition in the space of API driven voice enabled architecture.  So far I haven&rsquo;t found any other players doing it at the same level as Zypr.  Let me know if you know of something. Siri is going to need some healthy competition.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see Amazon step up in the advertising game with the beta release of the <a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank">Amazon Mobile Ads API</a> this week.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want Amazon getting into my space, when it comes to any API resource, especially advertising.  On the other hand, one can say that the space needs disruption with the dominance of Google with their multiple offerings:</p>
<p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-dollar-sign-cloud.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>

<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/creating_monetizable_applications" target="_blank">Youtube</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can expect some intense competition when it comes to advertising and specifically around mobile advertising APIs--battling for your eyeballs on smart phones and tablets in 2013.</p>
<p>Another layer that will add to the competititiveness with advertising APIs is the fact that all three social media and networking giants have their own advertising APIs now as well:</p>
<p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-people-devices.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/ads-api" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.linkedin.com/blog/linkedin-ads-unveils-new-api-program" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With Google and Amazon both having devices in the game (Android and Kindle), it will be interesting how they partner with Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin for the social layer, and where all of this leaves Apple.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget about the  me too category with <a href="http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/search-advertising/bingads-api" target="_blank">Bing Advertising APIs</a> and <a href="http://advertisingcentral.yahoo.com/api/overview" target="_blank">Yahoo Advertising Central</a>, or the potentially over <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/21/112-advertising-apis-google-adsense-google-adwords-and-feedburner/" target="_blank">100 other advertising APIs available via ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>
<p>Any way you look at it, 2013 will prove to be a very competitive landscape when it comes to web and mobile advertising, with so many heavyweight contenders with their own devices and API driven advertising platforms.  I think an advertising API roundup is in order, in the near future.</p>
<p>I just hope that we start thinking beyond advertising when it comes to APIs and the monetization of web and mobile apps in 2013.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little behind in working through my list of new APIs to review.  So I&rsquo;m spending about 3 hours each day going through my list of new APIs accumulated from <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Tweets, Bookmarks, Google Alerts and other ways I have for discovering new APIs.</p>
<p>After looking&nbsp;through a couple hundred APIs, I&nbsp;wanted to share some things that stand out, and make me feel someone really doesn't give a shit when they hit publish on their API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Your entire developer area is a PDF</li>
<li>Really long, incoherent URL for dev area</li>
<li>Dev area is just a page in your help directory</li>
<li>You put google ads on every page of your API documentation</li>
<li>No communication, support or contact information at all</li>
<li>Sign up form that pops up in my face as soon as page loads</li>
<li>Require an NDA before I register</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of things that make me give an API a C or D grade, which means you probably aren&rsquo;t on my radar. &nbsp;But then again if you don't have active blog or twitter or developers aren't talking about you, your API won't register on the radar even with a B grade.</p>
<p>With tools like <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a title="APIhub" href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> out there, it isn&rsquo;t hard to hang your API in a professional way, with minimal amount of effort and resources.</p>
<p>After looking through hundreds of APIs I leave with the same feeling:  that there tons of good ideas out there, but 80% of them are just executed very poorly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking at new and innovative ways companies are building <a href="/2013/03/04/next-generation-of-api-driven-analytics-and-visualizations/">analytics and visualizations on top of APIs</a>, and one of the new tools I&rsquo;ve come across is <a href="http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a>.  ImpactStory aggregates altmetrics:  diverse impacts from your articles, datasets, blog posts, and more.  But this post isn&rsquo;t about ImpactStory, I&rsquo;ll crunch what they do and write about in another post.</p>
<p><a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/analytics/impactstory/impactstory-beta-feedback.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This post is about their usage of feedback, helpdesk, and knowledge base management tool&nbsp;<a title="UserVoice" href="https://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, which is a service I always recommend to API owners looking to support different aspects of their API community.</p>
<p>ImpactStory simply has a &ldquo;<em>BETA - Send us Your Feedback</em>&rdquo; image in the top right corner of their site.  When you click on the logo, you are presented with a simple UserVoice form for submitting your ideas of where you think ImpactStory should take their platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/analytics/impactstory/impactstory-beta-feedback-form.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I think this is a pretty dead simple way of soliciting feedback from your community. Involving your users in your roadmap planning can go a long way in building goodwill with them, and encouraging participation and innovation in other ways.</p>
<p>After I spend more time playing with <a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank">ImpactStory</a>, I&rsquo;ll do another post on what else they are up to, but at first glance its a pretty interesting approach to developing tracking analytics, visualization and other embeddable goodness using APIs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the great coverage by Paul MIller over at Cloud Ave about whether <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/26791/is-infochimps-running-from-the-data-market-business/">Infochimps running from the Data Market business</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/25863/discussing-data-markets-in-new-york-city/">Discussing Data Markets in New York City</a>.  He&rsquo;s touched on any interesting topic around the viability of data markets as a business, and the fate of several of the most high profile players in the space.</p>
<p>In 2011, when it comes to data API marketplaces and providers I tended to showcase players like <a href="http://factual.com">Factual</a>, <a href="http://kasabi.com">Kasabi</a>, <a href="http://datamarket.com/">DataMarket</a> and <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a>.  In 2013, we&rsquo;ve watched Kasabi disappear, and the migration of InfoChimps from an open data market, to a enterprise data platform.  While Factual and Datamarket appear to be going strong.</p>
<p>I think this reflects a common, lack of imagination by Silicon Valley because they are so focused on making money, they miss the need to support critical aspects of industries, that are required to allow for the growth they want to see.</p>
<p>While I feel there is money to be made off data marketplaces, however right now I think it is critical that we invest in people standing up and exposing data, not just focusing on making money off this process at levels that VC&rsquo;s deem adequate.</p>
<p>I make the same argument with API providers, its not that there isn&rsquo;t money in standing up APIs, but we need to heavily invest in the education of potential API owners and the healthy standing up of APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be plenty of money down the road from APIs and data marketplaces, but by always looking at it through a Silicon Valley perspective, we are going to stifle the oxygen necessary for a truly healthy, vibrant space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending time looking through the API service provider space, and <a href="/2013/03/01/api-deployment-as-a-service/">last week I noticed the big gap in there being API deployment services vs. API management services</a>.  This imbalance is due to a gold rush by heavily VC funded API service providers looking to capitalize on the enterprise looking to proxy their existing infrastructure with a new breed of API services.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/data-marketplaces/data-markets.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve argueed this with execs at <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unamed&nbsp;API service provider companies</span></em>, on whether the next growth in APIs will be from new, API providers or from the enterprise.   I was told I&rsquo;m naive and it shows my inexperience that I think it will come from outside the enterprise.  While there will be money to be made off the enterprise evolving their existing infrastructure in this new way, in reality this is just a small evolution in business not anywhere near a revolution.  Where big change in business sectors and economies will occur is when companies, organizations and government who didn&rsquo;t jump on SOA bandwagon understand the value of opening up data, and making available via APIs in this new way.</p>
<p>To get here we have a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOT</span></strong> of work to do.  We need education, tools and services available to get these companies, organizations and government up to speed, publishing data and standing up APIs.  Once this occurs, there will be plenty of money to be made in mobile, tablet, devices, analysis, visualations, curation, syndication and other areas you hear Silicon Valley tooting about.  But VC&rsquo;s are focused on the end goal, not necessarily how we get there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work making sure there are open source tools and content to help any company, organization or government group &nbsp;get their data marketplaces up and running.  Let&rsquo;s not focus on making a fortune from it now, let&rsquo;s just make sure it happens.  It&rsquo;s far to important to suffocate with short term visions of making profit.</p>

<p>API driven analytics and visualizations is one of the new areas&nbsp;of API usage I'm tracking on.   There are many &ldquo;big data&rdquo; platforms emerging these days, but I&rsquo;m looking for dead simple tools and services anyone can use to generate analytics and visualizations via APIs.</p>
<p>Think of <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers like IFTT, Zapier and Elastic.io</a>.  These new API driven service providers, make it easy to migrate data between cloud services, using a simple set of source API, triggers, actions and target APIs--with a dead simple icon and wizard based UI, allowing any user to put the platform to work.</p>
<p><a title="Ducksboard" href="http://ducksboard.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-analytics/ducksboard-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I want this approach for embeddable analytics, visualizations and other widgets that are easily generated via APIs. Last week I came across a new platform called <a href="http://ducksboard.com/">Ducksboard</a>, which allows you to easily generate some pretty sophisticated analytical widgets from common API sources.  The platform even comes with a marketplace where you can find other widgets.  The only problem is that Duckboards is meant to generate dashboards, and not really open and portable widgets. &nbsp;We'll keep an eye on this platform, see where it goes.</p>
<p><a title="Keen IO" href="https://keen.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-analytics/keen-io-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Ducksboard" href="http://ducksboard.com/" target="_blank">Then last night I came across </a><a title="Keen IO" href="https://keen.io/" target="_blank">Keen IO</a>, an analytics Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that lets developers build analytics features directly into their apps, from common API services.  Keen IO provides a pretty sophisticated workbench for building embeddable charts, metrics and other analytics or visualizations that you can render anywhere, using  iOS, Android, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and Java libraries they provide.</p>
<p>At first glance, this space can feel just like earlier waves of widget building platforms of the Web 1.0 &amp; 2.0 worlds.  But I think we hadn&rsquo;t reached critical mass, in the number of available API resources, as well as an awareness of APIs in general, in order to realize the true potential of widgets. I think we are getting closer in 2013.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optistic that a new breed of API driven analytics and visualization tools will emerge making dead simple, icon based interfaces that allow anyone to generate useful widgets from valuable API resources and embed them anywhere on the open web or in private portals.</p>
<p>Are there any other similar platforms that I'm missing?</p>

<p>Hands on, interactive tools are proving to be the most useful way to learn about an API--empowering users to see it in action, and witness the value it delivers.  Many companies are doing this by providing API explorers, consoles, interactive documentation and other hands-on tools that allow you to see how any API actually functions and learn about the API in realtime.</p>
<p>One of the latest companies to do this is <a title="MMS API Provider" href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider Mogreet</a>, which has stepped into the API explorer game with their own API tester allowing anyone to visually build an API call that sends multimedia messages, as well as take advantage of the 25 other methods available via the API platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-api-tester.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The API tester is available for all users via the developer dashboard, providing a hands on way to learn about the Mogreet API, all available endpoints, understand which parameters are required or optional, experiment with alternatives and quickly make the calls and see the result, understanding the value and operations before you get to work coding around the API.</p>
<p>While I think using an <a href="http://apigee.com/docs/consoletogo/">API explorer like Apigee&rsquo;s</a> can provide value, but I also recommend rolling your own toolkits that might speak specifically to your target audience.  I think a standard API console or explorer can help developers understand the operations of an API, but I think the right GUI tool can help any user understand the potential your API offers.  Which might make the difference between an integration project getting funded or not, with decision makers properly understanding how your API can be put to use.</p>
<p>Nice work Mogreet team!</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apicultur/apicultur-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>How to structure pricing for an API is one of the top 5 questions I get from people who are currently planning their API strategy.  In my opinion, there is, and never will be a one size fits all API pricing strategy.  What you charge for your API resources should reflect their value and how they are accessed and used by your target consumers.</p>
<p>The Backend as a Service (BaaS) space is working hard to differentiate themselves in 2013 with <a title="baas pricing" href="/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">different approaches to pricing of mobile backend resources</a>.  Amazon is still shaking up the API space with new services, pricing models and the price reduction of API resources at a dizzying pace.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting the <a title="apicultur" href="https://store.apicultur.com/">Apicultur</a> team while in Paris for <a href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a>&nbsp;last October.  Apicultur is a linguistics API platform, that is pushing the boundaries of what is an API platform as well as how you price language API resources.</p>
<p>Apicultur recently shared some of the thinking behind the <a href="https://store.apicultur.com/site/pages/prices.jag" target="_blank">current version of their platform pricing</a>&nbsp;where they&nbsp;structure the price depending on three factors:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Complexity of the API</strong> - Some APIs perform a very simple task (like removing commas from a text) while others deal with more complex task (like extracting if the opinion expressed in a particular text is positive or negative)--the "bigger" the API, the pricier it gets</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> - The max speed by default is one call per second. In order to get more calls per second, Apicultur ask for a prepayment that is discounted from the final price at the end of the month (i.e., is not an extra price, is just a prepayment as a commitment). In addition, there's a discount at the end of the month for users for those who get a speed  limit feature</li>
<li><strong>Support -&nbsp;</strong>The basic support offered is the community support. For more support, special fees are offered</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apicultur/apicultur-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Apicultur feels that by keeping the everything priced at 10,000 API calls, keeps things easy to understand as well as being fair for small and large projects. &nbsp;Leaving the costs spread between the varying value of individual API endpoints, the speed at which you need API calls and for overall support.</p>
<p>Small projects can register for the free account, which gives you up 20&euro; a month in calls without requiring a credit card, allowing developers to try an API before giving personal information and committing. I find it very interesting they call it a free account, while still applying a price to the value users are getting.</p>
<p>Apicultur has put a lot of thought into how they structure their API pricing.  I think their approach can help other API providers think about the value each of their endpoints offer, as well as other areas you can monetize, delivering more of what your API consumers need, while also bringing in revenue to make sure your API initiative is successful.</p>

<p>I stumbled across the <a title="Twitter Counter API" href="http://twittercounter.com/pages/api">Twitter Counter API</a> in my monitoring for the <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> this morning.  The Twitter Counter API allows you to retrieve key metrics on any Twitter account like username, url and avatar. &nbsp;All data you can get via the Twitter API, but with Twitter Counter API you get additional information like account growth statistics and ranking, that Twitter doesn't provide at all.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that someone can build an API to augment an existing API, which is why I keep talking about it, I guess :) We are seeing a more standardized version of this with API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://adigami.com">Adigami</a>, where they not only aggregate APIs from a variety of sources, they also build entirely new APIs based the added value that is created after they are brought together.</p>
<p>Thinking about if further, it would be cool if you could submit your API to be listed in your parent API providers API area.   Think of <a title="APIHub" href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a>, but every API area would have its own 3rd API marketplace.  API providers often allow 3rd party developers to submit code libraries and samples to be listed as resources, as well as applications for listing in an application showcase. So it makes sense to potetially allow for your developers to submit APIs for validation and publishing into a designated area.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we shouldn&rsquo;t exist as islands, we should be able to invite in other API resources built on top of our APIs, or that compliment our APIs.  We should also have terms of use and pricing models that invite others to take our API resources and deploy in other ecosystem, building the next wave of <a title="BaaS Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS providers</a> that will be delivering specialized stacks of resources for developers to efficiently build mobile and web apps.</p>

        <p><a title="I Want An API" href="http://iwantanapi.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-i-want-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel we have done a good job explaining what is an API, why people need APIs, and providing services to manage APIs, but we are falling short on delivering information, tools and services for deploying APIs.</p>
<p>First I want to acknowledge that many companies have established IT resources, in the form of technology talent, and internal systems they can put to use when deploying APIs.  This post isn&rsquo;t for you.  This is about individual problem owners looking to deploy APIs, who most likely have little or no access to traditional IT resources for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>You want to deploy an API, because you havplease some data, content or other resources you need to make accessible to partners or the public, allowing for integration into other systems or be used in the development of web or mobile applications or possibly even data analysis and visualizations.</p>
<h2>Machine Readable</h2>
<p>As much as I love APIs, I suggest everyone consider your overall objective behind launching an API.  You may not need an API, you may just need to make your information machine readable and available on the open Internet.  Technically, this isn&rsquo;t an API, but publishing your data or content in a machine readable format like XML or JSON can accomplish many of the same goals of an API, without the overhead of an API.</p>
<p>Many tools you use every day like Microsoft Office, Google Apps, Salesforce provide tools for publishing data and content in machine readable formats like CSV, XML or JSON, much like publishing or printing as a PDF.  Not everyone needs an API, but everyone needs to understand the how-to, and the benefits of making machine readable a default in all business, organization, government and even individual processes.</p>
<p>PDF made data and content portable, for humans. But a PDF does very little good for other machines, websites and mobile apps.  CSV, XML and JSON make data and content portable, while also making them machine readable.  Please consider this simple evolution, while planning your API.</p>
<p>Machine readable will go far to increase efficiencies, interoperability, transparency and innovation within many existing government, organizational and business operations.  By providing data, content and other resources in CSV, XML and JSON they can be easily used across mobile, web and data implementations.  However in other situations there will be a higher need for more advanced interaction with data and content in the form of querying, filtering, transformations as well as the need to secure resources, limiting who has access and to what scale.  This is where we start moving beyond just machine readable, and into a truly needing an API.</p>
<p>When it comes to API deployment I would put users into two distinct groups:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Technical</strong> - You have skills and resources to architect, design, develop and deploy infrastructure, code to meet your API needs</li>
<li><strong>Non-Technical</strong> - You do not have the resources to assemble and execute an API strategy, making a cloud service an optimal route</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are about making critical assets and resources available to technical and non-technical groups. &nbsp;APIs are often about circumventing some of the ways technology bottlenecks can slow us down. &nbsp;It is important that there are not just a wealth of cloud services for non-technical folks to deploy APIs, but also a buffet of openly licensed, downloadable tools that anyone can put to use when deploying an API.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>You have some technical resources and the know how (or willingness to learn), and you want an API.  Ideally there would be open source tools available for you to download and implement:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>CSV to API&nbsp;</li>
<li>Database to API</li>
<li>Developer Portal&nbsp;       
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Docs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Code&nbsp;</li>
<li>Support&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Key Management&nbsp;</li>
<li>App Management</li>
<li>Billing</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools would allow you to assemble your own API strategy in the language and platform of your choice.  There should be educational materials helping you understand how to implement individually or collectively as a single platform.</p>
<h2>Non-Technical</h2>
<p>You do not have the technical resources or time to implement your own API Strategy.  You need a dead simple, software as a service implementation.  You can see examples of this with the latest breed of API service providers, <a href="http://emergentone.com">Emergent One</a>, <a title="API Spark" href="http://apispark.com/">API Spark</a>, and <a href="https://apiengine.io/">API Engine</a>.</p>
<p>We are just seeing this new breed of API service providers rise to meet the demand of not just API management, but now also API deployment.  Making API deployment accessible to anyone, not just developers or companies with necessary resources.  This will make the benefits of APIs accessible to the everyday problem owners, who often are restricted by IT bottlenecks or entire lack of IT resources.</p>
<p>Making data and content from a spreadsheet or existing database, machine readable by default or deployed as an API, allowing for more sophisticated interactions, should be as easy as deploying Wordpress for your blog.  You should be able to go to a service provider and get exactly the hosting, deployment and management options you desire, or you should be able to download and install on your own infrastructure, giving you the control you desire over storage, hosting and access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding a new project area to API Evangelist called&nbsp;<a title="I Want An API" href="http://iwantanapi.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">I Want An API</a>, where I&rsquo;ll be working to help define this space, and bring together other people to assist in developing the resources and tools we will all need to easily launch an API.</p>

<p>I really like the <a href="https://status.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku status and incident report site</a>.  The site elegantly displays the last 30 days of status for the Heroku platform--complete with real-time notifications via email, SMS, Twitter, RSS and API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/emergent-one-logo-horizontal.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are numerous companies, with existing IT infrastructure, who are looking to deploy APIs in 2013. These companies will be deploying APIs using their existing technology teams, or depending on one of the <a href="/serviceproviders/">17 API management service providers</a> available.</p>
<p>This market is ripe for the <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale's</a> of the world to provide valuable services to, but for many companies, organizations and government agencies who need to deploy APIs this year, API deployment will be about taking an existing database or multiple databases, and open them up to the public, partners, 3rd party developers or possibly just provide access to a remote department or branch of their company in the easiest way possible.</p>
<p>Not all companies will have the resources, or the need to deploy full blown API programs. &nbsp;They just need a dead simple database to API solution that will quickly expose their data over the web in a secure way.  Until recently this solution wasn&rsquo;t available in the cloud, but a new API service provider called <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a> has stepped up to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Emergent One is a cloud service that allows you to connect to your company's MySQL, PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS databases, then generate a REST API from your existing data stores.</p>
<p>Using Emergent One you can define a new API, connect to your database using an agent or direct connection, then define your API resources complete with meta data, sub-resources, in-line resources, fields and computed fields.  Pretty much all you will need to make a clean web API from a database.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/emergent-one-api-resources-from-database.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have your API resources defined, Emergent One provides you with a developer portal around these APIs, and the ability to provide developer registration, then issue keys they can use to access your data--providing the openness you desire, while keeping things secure and within your control.</p>
<p>The developer portal is complete with documentation, explorer console and code libraries for iOS, Android and in Ruby.  Emergent One allows you to bind your own DNS to your endpoints, and also provide paid plans, complete with billing management.</p>
<p>Emergent One is a perfect service for any company looking to develop and manage APIs from your local databases.   The only thing I would say is missing is support tools, to help you interact with your developers after you launch your API. &nbsp;But I'm sure its coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/17/api-management-platform-emergent-one-launches-free-tier/">happy to see the Emergent One platform has a freemium tier</a> giving you up to 5,000 API requests a month, a business tier for up to 2.5M requests a month, as well as an enterprise tier with sales support for all levels of needs. &nbsp;The freemium tier will be critical for businesses to play with, and get to know better.</p>
<p>The Emergent One admin needs a little polishing, it could use a more dashboard like feel for the home page, but overall the Emergent One team nails it!  Providing dead simple, yet robust API deployment from your MySQL, PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS databases, in a way that anyone can put to use.</p>
<p>If your company is looking to deploy and API using a database, and don&rsquo;t have the resources internally to make it happen, I definitely recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>.</p>

<p>I try to keep <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> a place where API newbies and API experts can both find what they are looking for.  To meet this demand I&rsquo;m constantly moving the site around, trying to uncover more information, in a logical way that speaks to everyone.</p>
<p>To change things up a little I moved a couple of the most important trends in APIs out of the <a title="trends" href="/trends/">trends section</a>, and put them on the right hand menu, making them accessible from any page.  There are four trends I think are important to how APIs are being used right now:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> - Merging various APIs together into not just meaningful new stacks of resources, but entirely new resources, as a result of merging</li>
<li><strong>BaaS</strong> - The promise of Backend as a Service is to bundle together resources developers need to build mobile apps more efficiently. &nbsp;Some providers are rolling their own stacks, while others are using a hybrid approach with wise use of 3rd party API resources</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity</strong> - The integration, interoperability, automation and transformation of data between cloud services, in a way that respects the relationshiop between user and platform, that uses APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime</strong> - A realtime flow of data and resources using APIs and web technologies, meeting the demand of the API economy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api-trends.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<p>I feel these areas will represent a shift in how APIs are deployed and consumed to meet the growing demand for the data and resources driving web and mobile applications.  While the API should exist on its own, these areas represent an evolution in how APIs are bundled together into more meaningful stacks, new mashups of resources and providing the integration, interoperability, automation and real-time needs of  businesses in the API economy.</p>
<p>In addition to these four trends, I&rsquo;m looking at several other ways APIs are being used in new and potentially powerful ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Voice</strong> - With the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, voice is the next generation of discovering and interacting with valuable API resources</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis</strong> - The era of "big data" is upon us, like it or not. &nbsp;APIs will provide the fuel for the analysis that occurs around the insane amounts of data coming online, but also being generated by new applications and devices</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization</strong> - One fundamental aspect of the "big data" evolution is being able to visualize and communicate meaning derived from data, and keeping visualizations transparent and interactive using APIs is essential</li>
<li><strong>Syndication</strong> - We saw the power of skyndicattion using APIs with the Facebook Like and the Tweet button. &nbsp;APIs will continue to drive syndication and encourage collaboration on the open Internet in new ways</li>
</ul>
<p>These all represent some very important ways in which APIs are being applied across all business sectors.  All these trending areas are using APIs to deliver value to government, businesses and individuals, and if we are not careful we can focus only on the end value and forget about some of the important benefits of keeping open, accessible APIs that deliver the valuable resources needed. &nbsp;The open pipes will prove to be just as important as the end value in my opinion.</p>
<p>We will need to make sure the backends to the mobile phones and tablets our families are using stay open and transparent, delivering the value while respecting our privacy and security.  There needs to be transparency and open access around all analysis and visualizations used in &ldquo;big data&rdquo; decisions in the coming years.  Infographics and industry reports without open and transparent APIs behind them offer little value in the API economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing which of these trends continue to grow in 2013, and which ones go away, or even morph into entirely new trends.  This is what I love about the API space, the unlimited opportunity for change and evolution.  Which is why I keep the conversation going.</p>

<p>APIs are all the rage, anyone should be able launch an API from CSV, Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheet or the common databases such as MySQL, PostGres, Amazon RDS, Microsoft SQL Server.  Right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching <a href="/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a> evolve for the last three years, helping companies be successful in managing their APIs.  But when you actually going through the list of service providers, looking for someone to help you deploy an API, there are very few options out of the box.</p>
<p>The list of API Players coming from the enterprise:</p>

<p>These enterprise players assume you will have existing infrastructure to publish web services, files and other message systems that they can connect with,  to deploy your new APIs that you will manage.</p>

<p>Are pretty much the same.  While they may provide how to <a href="/2013/02/03/deploy-and-manage-api-on-amazon-web-services-aws/">guides for deploying APIs on AWS</a>, like 3Scale, the deployment of API endpoint is still your responsiblity.  You need to have existing infrastructure that will do it, or find the REST framework of your choice--both requiring you have the appropriate talent and resources.</p>
<p>Next up you can, deploy one of the open source API solutions, to proxy and manage your APIs:</p>

<p>But again, you need the resources and know how to implement, and they are generally management tools, so you still need to &ldquo;launch&rdquo; your own API endpoint.</p>
<p>When you start looking at the next generation of API service providers like <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>, you can really maximize the design, planning, documentation and deployment cycle, but you still need to code up your actual API.</p>
<p>After Apiary.io we start to get to the service providers who can deliver on my vision of APIs for the masses:</p>

<p>It seems like we are getting closer, albeit its not as easy as I think it should be. We need a variety of service providers and open source solutions in this space, so there are numerous, dead simple cloud options for API deployment.</p>
<p>Emergent One definitely was a pleasant surprise in my quest.  Their tool needs a little polish, but for deploying an API from a database like MySQL, Postgres or Amazon RDS, those guys nailed it.  It is the tool that I will be recommending when people ask me how to launch an API from their database. (story to come)</p>
<p>I'd like to see the Emergent One approach to a dead simple cloud service for going from Microsoft Excel, CSV and Google Spreadsheet.  Maybe there is, and I&rsquo;m missing it.  Something like CKAN as a Service.  I think there is some more research to be done on this.  Of the 3 data API providers I used to showcase:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 30px;" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

<td align="center"><a href="http://kasabi.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Kasabi-Logo.png" alt="" width="130" align="right" /></a></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Only <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> is still deliving in this space, bringing open data to municipal, state, and federal government.  Kasabi closed down and InfoChimps is focusing on the enterprise big data.   I don&rsquo;t think there is big VC money in the data API space, but it seems like there is still opportunity.</p>
<p>It seems backwards to me, but it seems from 2005-2010 we needed to define and prove there was API opportunity, and in 2011 and 2012 we defined the API management space, so in 2013 are we needing to better define the API deployment portion of our industry?</p>
<p>I will use Emergent One, APISpark, API Engine and Apify more, and do individual stories on them.  Then circle back around and see how I feel.</p>

<p>I spent time this week looking at 20, of what I&rsquo;m calling <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">API reciprocity providers</a>, who are providing a new generation of what is historically known as ETL in the enterprise, to connect, transfer, transform and push data and content between the cloud services we are increasingly growing dependent on.</p>
<p>With more and more of our lives existing in the cloud and via mobile devices, the need to migrate data and content between services will only grow more urgent.  While ETL has all the necessary tools to accomplish the job, the cloud democratized IT resources, and the same will occur to ETL, making these tools accessible by the masses.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ETL solutions, but I feel there are 3 solutions that are starting to make a migration towards an easier to understand and implement vision of ETL:</p>
<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>These providers are more robust, and provide much of the classic ETL tools the enterprise is used to, but also have the new emphasis on API driven services.  But there are 10 new service providers I&rsquo;m calling reciprocity platforms, that demonstrate the potential with offering very simple tasks, triggers and actions that can provide interaction between two or more API services:</p>

<p>I consider reciprocity an evolution of ETL, because of three significant approaches:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Simple, meaningful connections with transfer and tranformations that are meaningful to end users, not just a wide array of ETL building blocks an IT architect has to implement</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - Reciprocity platforms expose meaningful connections users have the cloud services they depend on.  While you can still migrate from databases or file locations as with classic ETL, reciprocity platforms focus on APIs, while maintaining the value for end-users as well as the originating or target platforms</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong> - Reciprocity focus on not just transmitting data and content, but identifying the value of the payload itself and the relationships, and emotions in play between users and the platforms they depend on</li>
</ul>
<p>This new generation of ETL providers began the migration online with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Yahoo Pipes" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a></span>.  Which resonated with the alpha developers looking to harvest, migrate, merge, mashup and push data from RSS, XML, JSON and other popular API sources--except Yahoo lacked the simplicity necessary for wider audience appeal.</p>
<p>While I feel the 10 reciprocity providers isted above represent this new wave, there are six others incumbents trying to solve the same problem:</p>

<p>While studying the approach of these 20 reciprocity providers, it can be tough to identify a set of common identifiers to refer to the value created. &nbsp;Each provider has their own approach and potentially identifying terminology.  For my understanding, I wanted to try and establish a common way to describe how reciprocity providers are redefining ETL. &nbsp;While imperfect, it will give me a common language to use, while also being a constant work in progress.</p>
<p>For most reciprocity providers, it starts with some ecompassing wrapper in the form of an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assembly</span> which describes the overall recipe, formula or wrapper that contains all the moving ETL parts.</p>
<p>Within this assembly, you can execute on workflows, usually in a single flow, but with some of the providers you can daisy chain together multiple (or endless) workflows to create a complex series of processes.</p>
<p>Each workflow has a defining trigger which determines the criteria that will start the workflow such as new RSS post or new tweet, and with each trigger comes a resulting action which is the target of the workflow, publishing the RSS post to a syndicated blog or adds the tweet to a Google Spreadsheet or Evernote, or any other combination of trigger and action a user desires.</p>
<p>Triggers and actions represent the emotional connections that are the underpinnings of ETL&rsquo;s evolution into a more meaningful, reciprocation of value that is emerging in the clouds.  These new providers are connecting to the classic lineup of ETL interfaces to get things done:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Files</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Web Service</li>
</ul>
<p>While also providing the opportunity for development of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open connectors</span> to connect to any custom database, file, messages and web services.  But these connectors are not described in boring IT terms, they are wrapped in the emotion and meaning derived from the cloud service--which could have different meanings for different users. This is where one part of the promise of reciprocity comes into play, by empowering average problem owners and every day users to define and execute against these types of API driven agreements.</p>
<p>All of these actions, tasks, formulas, jobs or other types of process require the ability to plan, execute and audit the processes, with providers offering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Scheduling</li>
<li>History / Logging</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>With data being the lifeblood of much of these efforts, of course we will see &ldquo;big data&rdquo; specific tools as well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Synchronization </li>
<li>Data Quality</li>
<li>Big Data</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>While many reciprocity providers are offering interoperability between two specific services, moving data and resource from point a to b, others are bringing in classic ETL transformations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Reformat</li>
<li>Aggregate</li>
<li>Sort</li>
<li>Dedupe</li>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Partition</li>
<li>Merge</li>
<li>Join</li>
<li>Split</li>
<li>Convert</li>
</ul>
<p>After the trigger and before the action, there is also an opportunity for other things to happen, with providers offering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Push</li>
<li>Events</li>
</ul>
<p>During trigger, action or transformation there are plenty of opportunities for custom scripting and transofrmations, with several approaches to custom programming:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Custom Scripts</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Command Line</li>
<li>API</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases the reciprocity provider also provides a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">key value store</span> allowing the storage of user specified data extracted from trigger or action connections or during the transformation process.  Introducing a kind of memory store during the reciprocal cycle.</p>
<p>With the migration of critical resources, many of the leading providers are offering tools for testing the process before live execution:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Test</li>
<li>Debugger</li>
<li>Sandbox</li>
<li>Production</li>
</ul>
<p>With any number of tasks or jobs in motion, users will need to understand whether the whole apparatus is working, with platforms offering tools for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are a couple providers offering completely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open source</span> solutions, there are also several providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OEM</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">white label solutions</span>, which allow you to deploy a reciprocity platform for your partners, clients or other situations that would require it to branded in a custom way.</p>
<p>One area that will continue to push ETL into this new category of reciprocity providers is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">security</span>.  Connectors will often use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OAuth</span>, respecting a users already established relationship with platform either on the trigger or action sides, ensureing their existing relationship is upheld.  Beyond this providers are offering <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SSL</span> to provide secure transmissions, but in the near future we will see other layers emerge to keep agreements in tact, private and maintain the value of not just the payload but the relationships between platforms, users and reciprocity providers.</p>
<p>Even though reciprocity providers focus on the migration of resources in this new API driven, cloud-based world, several of them still offer dual solutions for deploying solutions in both environments:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Cloud </li>
<li>On-Premise</li>
</ul>
<p>There is not one approach either in the cloud, or on premise that will work for everyone and all their needs.  Some data will be perfectly find moving around the cloud, while others will require a more sensitive on-premise approach.  It will be up to problem owners to decide.</p>
<p>Many of this new breed of providers are in beta and pricing &nbsp;isn&rsquo;t available.  A handful have begun to apply cloud based pricing models, but most are still trying to understand the value of this new service and what market will bear.  So far I&rsquo;m seeing pricing based upon:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Seat</li>
<li>Assembly</li>
<li>Tasks</li>
<li>Connections</li>
<li>Extension</li>
<li>Sync</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Training</li>
</ul>
<p>Much like IaaS, PaaS SaaS and now BaaS, reciprocity providers will have a lot of education and communication with end users before they&rsquo;ll fully understand what they can charge for their services--forcing them to continue to define and differentiate themselves in 2013.</p>
<p>One of the most important evolutionary areas, I&rsquo;m only seeing with one or two providers, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">marketplace</span> where reciprocity platform users can browse and search for assemblies, connectors and tasks that are created by 3rd party providers for specific reciprocity approaches.  A marketplace will prove to be how reciprocity platforms serve the long tail and niches that will exist within the next generation of ETL.  Marketplaces will provide a way for developers to build solutions that meet specific needs, allowing them to monetize their skills and domain expertise, while also bringing in revenue to platform owners.</p>
<p>I understand this is all a lot of information.  If you are still ready this, you most likely either already understand this space, or like me, feel it is an important area to understand and help educate people about.   Just like with API service providers and BaaS, I will continue to write about my research here, while providing more refined materials as Github repos for each research area.</p>
<p>Let me know anything I'm missing or your opinions on the concept of API reciprocity.</p>

<p>Making onboarding with an API as frictionless as possible is one thing I like to study and educate my readers about. While I was studying what I call the <a title="API reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">API reciprocity</a> space currently, which is an evolution of what is known in the enterprise as ETL, I came across a company called FoxWeave.</p>
<p><a title="FoxWeave" href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank">FoxWeave</a> is a service that can migrate and synchronize data across all your cloud and on-premise apps and databases.  When I went to &ldquo;try it now&rdquo; at FoxWeave, I was told &ldquo;no signup needed&rdquo;.  But I didnt&rsquo; think much about it until I saw the temporary guest account popup.</p>

<p>What a powerful concept.  Evolving the freemium concept into the world of anonymity, allowing me to play with and understand your service before having to commit in any way.  One less piece of friction when I&rsquo;m trying to understad a new tool or service.</p>
<p>Nice work <a title="FoxWeave" href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank">FoxWeave</a>.  Way to make interoperability and automation using APIs as frictionless as possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/respect-my-authority.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a great post by Lorinda Brandon (<a href="https://twitter.com/lindybrandon">@lindybrandon</a>) of <a title="SmartBear" href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> on ProgrammableWeb today called&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2013/02/27/governance-vs-innovation-do-they-have-to-be-enemies/">Governance vs Innovation: Do They Have to be Enemies?</a>. &nbsp;She continues a conversation, from <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> around the word "governance", and how in the API space, this is often considered a bad word. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was moderating the questions for <span>Alistair Farquharson (</span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://twitter.com/afarqu">@</a></span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://twitter.com/afarqu">afarqu</a>)</span><span>&nbsp;CTO of&nbsp;</span><a title="SOA Software" href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software</a>, when&nbsp;<span>Irakli Nadareishvili (</span><a href="http://twitter.com/inadarei/" target="_blank">@inadarei</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> actually agreed that it is a bad word and asked if we need to evolve beyond it and not embrace it. &nbsp;I totally agree with Lorinda's approach to walking the line between governance and innovation, and look forward to more discussion around how to analyze API vs SOA principles within the enterprise--striking a balance that works for each individual approach.</p>
<p>To help stimulate this conversation I wanted to break down the word, governance. &nbsp;In the context of IT, governance is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>a concept used for activities related to exercising control over services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The definitions of SOA governance agree in its purpose of exercising control, but differ in the responsibilities it should have. Some narrow definitions focus on imposing policies and monitoring services, while other definitions use a broader business-oriented perspective</em></p>
<p>With general definitions being:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>the persons who make up a body for the purpose of administering something</li>
<li>the act of governing; exercising authority</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the illness around the word, when it is applied to APIs becomes clear when you start looking at the synonyms:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Governance</strong> - administration, authority, bureaucracy, command, control, direction, domination, dominion, empire, execution, executive, guidance, influence, jurisdiction, law, ministry, patronage, political practice, politics, polity, power, powers-that-be, predominanc</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - administration, care, charge, command, conduct, control, direction, governance , government, guidance, handling, intendance, manipulation, operation, oversight, rule, superintendence, superintendency, supervision</li>
<li><strong>Regulation</strong> - adjustment, administration, arrangement, classification, codification, control, coordination, direction, governance , governing, government, guidance, handling, management, moderation, modulation, reconciliation, regimentation, reorganization, settlement, standardization, superintendence, supervision, systematization, tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's separate the potentially bad synonyms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/governance-bad.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>administration</li>
<li>authority</li>
<li>bureaucracy</li>
<li>command</li>
<li>control</li>
<li>domination</li>
<li>dominion</li>
<li>empire</li>
<li>power</li>
<li>politics</li>
<li>control</li>
<li>government</li>
<li>manipulation</li>
<li>oversight</li>
<li>standardization</li>
</ul>
<p>And the good synonyms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/governance-good.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>direction</li>
<li>execution</li>
<li>guidance</li>
<li>influence</li>
<li>care</li>
<li>operation</li>
<li>arrangement</li>
<li>coordination</li>
<li>standardization</li>
<li>tuning</li>
<li>modulation</li>
<li>power</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel both power and standardization could be both good or evil, so I put in both categories. &nbsp;But overall you can begin to understand how governance is viewed in negative light in the API approach. &nbsp;People see it more about power and control, rather than the healthy aspects introduced API innovation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, this word reflects on why API works in more scenarios than strict SOA. &nbsp;Too much control can stifle innovation, and if you are controlling for all the wrong reasons, it can be even worse. &nbsp;APIs require a certain amount of oxygen to grow and evolve before it can achieve a level of innovation, which is an aspect some business leaders have trouble grasping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irakli and I both agreed that we need a new word, something that reflects the bottom up of API, not the top down control of SOA. &nbsp;Any ideas for a word that can keep be applied in a healthy way, but can institute many of the positive aspects of governance, without the potential innovation killing power and control?</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-trends.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m wading through dictionaries and thesauruses in an effort to find a <a href="/2013/02/27/what-is-better-word-for-governance-when-it-comes-to-apis/">more appropriate term &ldquo;governance&rdquo;, when looking at SOA governance through the API lense</a>--I figured I&rsquo;d flush out another area I&rsquo;m working to define a term that appropriately describes automation and interoperability using APIs.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took a look at <a href="/2013/02/26/75-features-from-across-31-baas-providers/">31 backend as a service (BaaS) providers</a>, in hopes of understanding more about what value they provide.  Today I'm diving into the automation section of my new <a href="/trends/">API trends area</a>. While reviewing, I noticed the exact same companies that were under automation were also in interoperability.  So I set out to find a new word to apply to this next generation of ETL providers that are building bridges between cloud platforms using APIs, as well as legacy data connections.</p>
<p>I have settled on the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reciprocity</span>.  The dictionary defines reciprocity as:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>the quality or state of being reciprocal : mutual dependence, action, or influence</li>
<li>a mutual exchange of privileges; specifically : a recognition by one of two countries or institutions of the validity of licenses or privileges granted by the other</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/social-reciprocity.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When you look in the thesaurus, reciprocity has a definition of "interchange" with synonyms of cooperation, exchange, mutuality and reciprocation.  Reciprocity is also a synonym of connection with a definition of &ldquo;person who aids another in achieving goal&rdquo;. With synonyms being acquaintance, agent, ally, associate, association, contact, friend, go-between, intermediary, kin, kindred, kinship, mentor, messenger, network, reciprocity, relation, relative and sponsor. &nbsp;(i love that "kin" is a synonym too)</p>
<p>All of these terms apply to what I&rsquo;m seeing unfold with this new generation of ETL providers.  ETL is moving into the clouds, and out from behind the firewall, using the open web, cloud platforms and APIs, and now we have to <a href="/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">rethink ETL, and make it accessible to the masses</a>. Put it within reach of the everday problem owners.</p>
<p>What I really like about reciprocity is it describes the mutual relationship between users and the platforms where their data and information resides.  Reciprocity describes the connection that has to occur between these valuable API platforms, and their users, in ways the ETL misses.  ETL stands for extract, transform and load, very technical and programmatic responses to moving my valuable resources, assets and personal information between the cloud platform I depend on daily.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-2.jpeg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the physical world we have reciprocity agreements between countries to ensure free trade and a healthy balance in world markets.  This next generation of reciprocity platform providers will not just be extracting, transforming and loading data--reciprocity platforms will be the nervous system of the global API economy, moving valuable resources around the world while respecting relationships between users, developers and the platforms in a way that preserves maximum value for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Now under the <a href="/trends/">trends section</a> you will just see one section for <a title="reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity</a>, that will house all 19 of this new breed of API service providers.  We&rsquo;ll see how things change, but for now I think reciprocity describes the value created by this new space, in a way that helps me communicate it to others.</p>

<p>We closed up the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistrat&amp;src=typd">#APIstrat</a>) last friday with a panel called APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem, where I moderated a healthy discussion with Tyler Stalder (<a href="https://twitter.com/tylerstalder">@tylerstalder</a>)&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>,&nbsp;Seth Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFreeze">@AntiFreeze</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="YourTrove" href="https://www.yourtrove.com/">YourTrove</a>,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (<a href="https://twitter.com/asifrahman">@asifrahman</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="NewsCred" href="http://newscred.com/">Newscred</a>, Orian Marx (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/orian">@orian</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (<a href="https://twitter.com/traviswallis" target="_blank">@traviswallis</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://peoplebrowsr.com/" target="_blank">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;around the very broad spectrum of APIs, platforms and the concept of ecosystems.</p>
<p>One of the questions I asked the group was, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which of the three OAuth Legs is the most important?</span> &nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide a quick primer for the portion of my audience that aren&rsquo;t OAuth geeks:</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth is an open standard for authorization that provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner</a></em></blockquote>
<p>Ok, what does that mean?  Think Twitter.  Twitter is server.  You are the owner of your tweet resources.  When you authenticate anywhere using your Twitter ID, that website or app uses OAuth to get access to your tweets, via the Twitter platform.  If you login to your Twitter account, click on settings and select apps from the left menu--these are apps and sites that have requested OAuth access <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> Twitter resources.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oauth/OAuth2.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p>OAuth is a relationship between you, your platform provider and various sites and apps that want to access your data via the API.  Sometimes these apps and your platform provider are one and the same, but the beauty of OAuth&nbsp;is that anyone can request access from you--access that you can revoke when you choose.</p>
<p>Back to the panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice.  Every panelist, except for Asif Rahman of Newscred said that the most important leg of oAuth is the end user. This made me happy because it shows that, at least at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistrat&amp;src=typd">#APIstrat</a>, people are concerned with the interest of the end user.  This is healthy.</p>
<p>In reality, I worry that when platform discussions do occur, the conversation leans too much in favor of platform, then the developer, with very little to no involvement of the end user.  Think of the Twitter ecosystem discussions since March of 2010.  Rarely do you hear discussion about API access and ecosystem viability in the context of the end-users.  Platforms and especially developers are very good at being very loud in these conversations.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oauth/oauth-twitter-3-legs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my opinion all three legs of OAuth are equally important, with an emphasis on the end-user.  It is their resource right?  Or is it?  The only thing standing between healthy OAuth conversations and relationships is the platforms terms of use and privacy policies.</p>
<p>The entire panel at #APIStrat agreed that we need more education for end-users about OAuth.  Now that we have OAuth 2.0 settled (in some minds), we need to get down to business <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">educating all three legs</span></em>&nbsp;around the process of OAuth and its best practices, empowering all three parties to be aware, and participate in ongoing conversations about how we are producing, storing, sharing, selling, licensing and consuming resources via APIs.</p>
<p>We need to make sure API platform conversations have all three legs represented.  The success of any platform will depend on a healthy balance between a platform, developers and the end-users--with oAuth 2.0 being the best model we have to make this happen to date.</p>
<p>Lets get to work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of the freemium model when it comes to APIs.  Nothing is as it seems when you are deploying managing or consuming APIs.  You have to have room to innovate and iterate without signing contracts or paying too much, before you find exactly the right integration or deployment that works.</p>
<p>This freemium approach to APIs is one of the biggest reasons I&rsquo;ve been supporting <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> since early days of API Evangelist.  3Scale was the original API service provider to offer a truly freemium tier for anyone wanting to deploy an API, and remains passionate about this to this day.</p>
<p>During the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC</a> last week, I had the pleasure of meeting the <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> team, who share a similar perspective of the space, resulting in them launching a new suite of free tools that will help you develop, test and monitor while building API driven software.</p>
<p>SmartBear has published four new free tools for testing and development:</p>

<p>The goal of the new freeware initiative is to put robust tools for quality software development into the hands of developers and testers immediately while allowing them to upgrade to the feature-rich paid versions when it makes practical sense.  I sat down with Lorinda Brandon, Director of Strategy, SmartBear Software while at #apistrat, where she said:</p>
<blockquote><em>The burgeoning API industry is a reflection of a new phase of innovation and collaboration in the software industry as a whole. Businesses and organizations are now sharing their data and functionality via APIs like never before, often for free. In fact, businesses are even inviting the developer community to come together in hackathons to build apps and mashups using their APIs. While we applaud the energy and pace, we also want to keep the focus on building high quality products. In 2013, SmartBear wants to empower this collaborative global community of developers to create high-quality, low-cost (or free) offerings of their own by making even more of our tools available for free through our Freeware Initiative.</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree 100%.  Freemium can be a critical marketing vehicle in the API industry, one that will bring attention to your tools and services, while also providing room for your customers to put tools to use in a meaningful way, that will truly add value to their world--without overcommitting.  Once a tool proves itself in someone&rsquo;s world, they can choose to upgrade and evolve to more premium offerings.</p>
<p>All six tools from SmartBear will be added to my <a href="/apitools/">tools section</a>, which is meant to provide a toolbox of free and downloaded software for API owners and developers to take advantage of.  SmartBear says this is just the beginning and they will be adding more tools in the future.  As they become available I will publish and keep track of via <a href="/apitools/">API Evangelist tools</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="/serviceproviders/quickblox.php" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mbaas-providers/quickblox-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service</a> (BaaS) provider <a href="/serviceproviders/quickblox.php" target="_blank">QuickBlox</a> announced new <a href="http://quickblox.com/plans/">pricing plans</a>, which includes a free tier up to 10GB in traffic and storage, with unlimited API calls and push notifications.</p>
<p>The BaaS space is heating up with lots of discussion about whether you should charge developers by active user, features, storage or API call--with each provider being pretty vocal about where they stand.  Quickblox is approach similar to <a title="Stackmob" href="/serviceproviders/stackmob.php">StackMob</a>, who refuses to charge based upon API call, atributing it to a sucess tax. But Quickblox is somewhat different, as they still charge for hard costs like bandwidth and storage--Stackmob only charges by feature.</p>
<p>I'm trying to understand all the approaches to BaaS pricing, which was also a <a title="panel discussion last week at API Strategy &amp; Practice between Parse, Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii, Cloudmine and Firebas" href="/2013/02/25/the-baas-reality-tv-show-panel-at-apistrat/">panel discussion last week at API Strategy &amp; Practice between Parse, Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii, Cloudmine and Firebase</a>.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/26/api-transparency-report-as-essential-building-block/">API Transparency Report as Essential Building Block</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-transparency-report.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>After reading about <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html">Google&rsquo;s release of their transparency report last month</a>, I decided I would be <a href="http://apivoice.com/2013/01/23/making-transparency-reports-standard-operating-procedure/">addding API transparency reports to my list of essential building blocks</a> for API owners. Since I wrote that, I&rsquo;ve had a great post from EFF also <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/its-time-transparency-reports-become-new-normal">stating that its time for transparency reports to become the new normal</a>. &nbsp;Where the EFF outlines the illness in our current approach:</p>
<blockquote><em>When you use the Internet, you entrust your thoughts, experiences, photos, and location data to intermediaries &mdash; companies like AT&amp;T, Google, and Facebook. But when the government requests that data, users are usually left in the dark.</em></blockquote>
<p>In the United States, companies are not required by law to alert their users when they receive a government request for their data, and in some circumstances, they are explicitly prohibited from doing so.   So it is up to us, the users to join organizations like the EFF and let all online service providers understand the importance of transparency reports becoming default operating procedure.</p>
<p>Currently, we are only seeing transparency reports from providers like Google, DropBox, LinkedIn, Twitter and a handful of other service providers.  While I feel that all companies that run on users data should provide transparency reports, I&rsquo;m going to focus on making sure it is standard operating procedures with companies that deliver APIs.</p>
<p>As a starting point for my API transparency report building block, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="http://www.skypeopenletter.com/">letter that was drafted by concerned privacy advocates who are calling for Microsoft to issue a transparency report on Skype</a>, which it purchased in 2011 for $8.5 billion.</p>
<p>This letter states that:</p>
<blockquote><em> Skype is a voice, video and chat communications platform with over 600 million users worldwide, effectively making it one of the world&rsquo;s largest telecommunications companies.   Many of its users rely on Skype for secure communications&mdash;whether they are activists operating in countries governed by authoritarian regimes, journalists communicating with sensitive sources, or users who wish to talk privately in confidence with business associates, family, or friends. </em></blockquote>
<p>The Skype effort provides a beginning list of items all transparency reports should provide:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/electronic-frontier-foundation-logo.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Quantitative data regarding the release of user information to third parties, disaggregated by the country of origin of the request, including the number of requests made by governments, the type of data requested, the proportion of requests with which it complied &mdash; and the basis for rejecting those requests it does not comply with.</li>
<li>Specific details of all user data a company currently collects, and retention policies.</li>
<li>The companies best understanding of what user data third-parties, including network providers or potential malicious attackers, may be able to intercept or retain.</li>
<li>Documentation regarding the current operational relationship between the company with and other third-party licensed users of company technology, including the companies understanding of the surveillance and censorship capabilities that users may be subject to as a result of using these alternatives.</li>
<li>A company&rsquo;s interpretation of its responsibilities under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), its policies related to the disclosure of call metadata in response to subpoenas and National Security Letters (NSLs), and more generally, the policies and guidelines for employees followed when a company receives and responds to requests for user data from law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States and elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your company is going to provide a service that users depend on, one that retains their personal data in any way--you should have a transparency report that educates users about how and what any government is accessing and using information about them.</p>
<p>This applies to any data collected or transmitted via APIs from a platform via 3rd party platforms and services.  APIs owe it to end users to provide insight into how their data is being used by 3rd party application developers via oAuth, the same insight should be provided regarding how government organizations is accessing and using data as well.</p>

<p>My goal is to better understand what features are offered across these 31 BaaS providers.  To accomplish this, I spent no more than an hour per provider looking through their sites and playing with their products to get at least a basic understanding of their offerings.</p>
<p>When looking for features I tried to standardize the best I could, but it is difficult when there are different approaches to the deployment of resources on each platform.  I found about 75 distinct features being offered across the 31 BaaS providers.  I&rsquo;m sure there are other features, and vital details missing, but I wanted to start somewhere.  Here is what I found, organized as best I could:</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/backend-as-a-service/">view all 75 features at the BaaS Github Repository</a> I setup.  Let me know any that you feel are missing, and I&rsquo;ll consider adding.</p>
<p>Next up, I will add the features into my BaaS tracking database and publish a breakdown of providers, with the features they offer.  Letting people search and filter, and also open up to each BaaS provider to comment and submit additional features they offer.</p>

<p>One of the lively discussions at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC</a> last week was the backend as a service (BaaS) panel I moderated towards the end of the first day.</p>
<p>We brought together <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> to talk about the fast growing BaaS space.</p>
<p>I kicked things off with some pretty standard stuff, by having each person introduce themselves and explain what they do.   Next I asked them to explain what differentiates themselves from the other folks on the couch.</p>
<p>After that, things started heating up when I brought up a discussion about BaaS pricing, from an <a href="/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">earlier online discussion about the mertits of user, feature or pricing base upon number of API calls</a>.  The common approach is user or api based pricing, with Stackmob focused on feature based BaaS pricing.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The conversation was definitely lead by Ty Amell of StackMob, with pointed rebuttals from Ilya Sukhar of Parse, with Miko Matasumura of Kii in between, being very diplomatic while also throwing some jabs of his own. Morgan Bickle of Kinvey, Marc Weil of Cloudmine and James Tamplin of Firebase held their own, but it things were definitely overshadowed by the discussion by Ty and Ilya.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;">

<p>Next the panel moved the discussion to the future of Baas, with direct questions about what potential exit strategies are for each of the platforms.</p>
<p>At times the panel seemed like a reality show from the BaaS world or a daytime talk show featuring the leaders in the BaaS space.</p>
<p>The Backend as a Service panel really showed the personalities behind the leading companies in the space.  I was so engaged in the conversation, thinking about the next questions I can't recall everything that was said. &nbsp;I remember some pretty sharp comments from both Ty and Ilya. &nbsp;I look forward to watching again when the video is ready from #APIStrat.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/university/uc-berkeley/berkeley-api-central.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I see a lot of dead simple, yet meaningful uses of APIs come across my desk (I don&rsquo;t have a desk, why do I keep saying this?) each day.  One I saw today is something every school, whether K-12, college or university should have.</p>
<p>Using the UC Berkeley API, you can get a list of all departments:</p>
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/department?departmentCode=a&amp;app_id=309fe68e&amp;app_key=51b9d67dc4f0501eed763822a641b17b"_</em></blockquote>
<p>Then with the proper department code you can pull a list of classes:</p>
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/classoffering?departmentCode=ARCH&amp;app_id=your-id&amp;app_key=your-key"_</em></blockquote>
<p>With the proper keys, anyone can easily pull relevant UC Berkeley department and class data to use in website or app, or even populate a Google Spreadsheet for other purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/university/uc-berkeley/uc-berkeley-get-classes.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a title="UC Berkeley API Management" href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley API Management Portal</a> is brand new, I&rsquo;m still working on separate story regarding their approach, but I wanted to talk about how good it is to see such straightforward, valuable uses of an API at a leading university.</p>
<p>This simple example is something you should be able to do by default at all schools across the country.</p>
<p>The best part is that the API team is actively communicating these uses of the API on Google+, which is how I came across the story.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/exactly-the-api-strategy-practice-conference-i-envisioned/">Exactly the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference I Envisioned</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-practice-steve-kin-open.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>Its the Monday morning after the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>.  The conference went off without a hitch, and was exactly the conference I envisioned when 3Scale first contacted me seven months ago about the idea of putting on the event. &nbsp;In July of 2012 Steve Willmott the CEO and founder of 3Scale sent me an email stating:</p>
<blockquote><em>..we're thinking of finally getting round to organizing an API focused event (conference) which tries to help spread knowledge about API, promote good practice and broaden the API tent beyond what it is today. The aim would be an event which combined both "business and practice" - meaning one element which tackles critical topics such as business models, strategy, success stories etc. and another which is about "what can be done with APIs" and "how to make it happen technically".</em></blockquote>
<p>Closing with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The final important thing is we'd like it to be a very open event - with a range of supporters, speakers and attendees and - while vendors might sponsor - it wouldn't be a "vendor" event.</em></blockquote>
<p>To which I responded with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Sounds like a great idea to me.  I'm in, and willing to help in any way I can.</em></blockquote>
<p>Of course I would be in.  I&rsquo;ve wanted this type of conference to occur for a while now, and what better way to make sure it happens right, than doing it yourself!  It was an amazing opportunity for me--there was no ignoring it.</p>
<p>As many of you know the original conference was scheduled for November 1st and 2nd in New York, City.  But due to hurricane Sandy, we had to postpone the conference and we ended up rescheduling it for last Thursday and Friday, February 21st and 22nd at the same venue--the Westin Grand Central in NYC.</p>
<p>In the end, the conference ended up with about 350 registered (<strong>SOLD OUT</strong>),with about what appears to be about 275-325 floating around each day, coming and going listening to <a title="talks from over 70 companies in the API space" href="/2013/02/12/companies-that-are-speaking-at-api-strategy-practice/">talks from over 70 companies in the API space</a>.  It was exactly the mix of folks I had hoped to see--ranging from marketing, advertising, business and developers who were new to APIs, to the moderately skilled players who were looking to polish their skills as well as being a who&rsquo;s who of API experts across the industry.</p>
<p>I did not get to attend as many of the sessions as I wished, and due to event coordination I wasn&rsquo;t always present main stage to hear complete talks. But on Monday morning here is what&rsquo;s fresh in my mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Laura Merling</strong> - Its great to see Laura&rsquo;s approach to helping organize AT&amp;T&rsquo;s API strategy.  I look forward to closely following not just her strategy, but understand her tactical considerations for helping the telco giant successful navigate the API space.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Lawson</strong> - Jeff never fails to deliver.  He always has informative talks that are entertaining, but also deliver vital overviews of the space. &nbsp;This time its all about software people!</li>
<li><strong>Payments Session</strong> - I heard from several folks this session was a very lively discussion between Paypal and the newer generation of payment providers like Stripe, Braintree and Dwolla.</li>
<li><strong>Security Session</strong> - Like the payment one I was not present, but I heard from several folks there was a pretty interesting exchange.  I look forward to the video.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Klabnik </strong>- Everyone needs to be exposed to Steve&rsquo;s extremely clear perspective of not just open APIs, but open software development.  His talks are never about product or companies, they are more a philosophical vision that is rooted in a healthy understanding of developers, development communities and how it dovetails into society, business and politics.</li>
<a href="http://3scale.net" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<li><strong>Backend as a Service Panel </strong>- I had so much fun on this panel.  I cannot wait to see the video.  The banter back and forth between <span>lya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> was priceless.  At times, it felt like reality TV show. There will definitely be more discussion about this panel.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Meisel </strong>- I&rsquo;m captivated by the potential of National Instrument&rsquo;s Labview Tools API program.   His talk walked us through the potential from a platform that can provide any physically engineered object with an API.  Jeff&rsquo;s talk left my mind spinning with visions around the future of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>John Musser</strong> - John always delivers an education for anyone in the space, whether your novice, intermediate or expert.  And his 20 API Business Models in 20 Minutes continued this trend.  As someone who is immersed in the space as I am, I immediately recognize the amount of work and perspective that is needed to gather, organize and distill down a topic like this into a meaningful presentation.  Extremely valuable work.</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Jacobson </strong>- I thoroughly enjoy watching the evolution of not just Daniel&rsquo;s talks, but evolution of his and the Netflix perspective on APIs.  He talks about Netflix evolving beyond REST, and leaves it for you to decide if Netflix is just an edge case or signs what is to come in our every growing device driven, internet of things world.  I think we need to watch what Daniel and Netflix is doing very closely, and learn. </li>
<li><strong>John Sheehan</strong> - Dammit, I was running around during yours. I needed to watch this one--will wait for video.</li>
<li><strong>Albert Wenger</strong> - I&rsquo;m extremely fascinated with the VC perspective of all things API.  Especially one that is focused on the &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; like USV is.  I&rsquo;ve talked with USV and a couple of other groups in the last couple months regarding their portfolios and the overall APIs space, and I will definitely be talking to other firms in the coming months and writing more stories on this topic.  Extremely critical perspective of the space that I don&rsquo;t think is getting enough public discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Gray Brooks</strong> - APIs and the Federal Government is a piece of the API pie I&rsquo;m uber passionate about.  I thoroughly enjoy my regular discussions with the Senior API Strategist and the GSA and his talk delivered the mandate I feel is needed right now, not just for city, county, state and federal government to get on board with APIs, but also that us citizens become accountable for making this work as well!</li>
<li><strong>APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem </strong>- We closed up the conference with a panel made up of Tyler Stalder (<a href="https://twitter.com/tylerstalder">@tylerstalder</a>)&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>,&nbsp;Seth Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFreeze">@AntiFreeze</a>) of<a title="YourTrove" href="https://www.yourtrove.com/">YourTrove</a>,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (<a href="https://twitter.com/asifrahman">@asifrahman</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="NewsCred" href="http://newscred.com/">Newscred</a>, Orian Marx (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/orian">@orian</a>) of<a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (<a href="https://twitter.com/traviswallis" target="_blank">@traviswallis</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://peoplebrowsr.com/" target="_blank">PeopleBrowsr</a>.  This panel closed up the event, leaving exactly the right tone with the audience I wanted.  Focusing at the heart of what makes APIs work, the relationship between platform, developers and users and what it takes to make it work in this new API driven world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list doesn&rsquo;t even begin to sum up what happened at API Strategy &amp; Practice.  I will have to wait for the video to be produced from all keynotes, panels and sessions(which we will make sure and let you know when ready), to fully understand what happened across all four rooms of the amazing event.</p>
<p>Beyond the keynotes, panels and sessions and moving into the networking opportunity that was #APIStrat.  I met so many people that I know online, but have never met in person, my head is still swimming.   Every couple hours I had to walk outside and get some air, so I could keep up with the conversations.  It makes me remember how important these events are to re-enforcing our existing relationships.  Online will never fully replace offline relationships, just augment them in new ways...or maybe offline augments online? &nbsp;Who knows!</p>
<p>Next, I have to throw in a comment about the beer during the drinks reception.  Did you notice the IPA amongst the beer choices?  Nice work <a title="Ping Identity" href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> and the 3Scale team.  It is the little things that make these events successful.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/augusto-marietta-mashape-apistrat.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ok. I know there was more, but I will be writing stories from now until the next API Strategy &amp; Practice in October or November (more to come), and this post is pretty long as it is.</p>
<p>Anyways, I want to thank all the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">sponsors of API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> for making the conversation possible, and make sure the 3Scale team knows how thankful I am for what they did.  They took all the risk, while putting up with me and my shit, to make exactly the event I envisioned when we started all of this. &nbsp;It wouldn't have been possible without <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to leave you with wise words from <span>Augusto Marietti&nbsp;(</span><a href="https://twitter.com/sinzone">@sinzone)</a><span>&nbsp;the CEO of&nbsp;</span><a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com/">Mashape</a>. &nbsp;I snapped this picture exactly at the moment Augusto said:<strong>&nbsp;DON'T FUCK THIS UP!!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with Augusto. It is way too important. &nbsp;Let's make sure and keep these conversations going, so we do it right! &nbsp;</p>

<p>The payment API provider Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment">released a jQuery payment tool</a>, a general purpose library for building credit card forms, validating input, and formatting numbers. The library was developed to support <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-checkout">Checkout</a>, Stripe's embeddable checkout widget.</p>
<p>Simple, but extremely useful libraries like this can go a long way to introduce developers to your APIs and put valuable tools into their toolbox, that will help them be successful. &nbsp;Something that can go a long way in establishing a loyalty between you and your developer community.</p>
<p>You can find a <a href="http://stripe.github.com/jquery.payment/example/">live demo</a> of the library, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment">source on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Salesforce has a pretty cool <a title="code share" href="http://developer.force.com/codeshare/apex/resultspage?l=mru&amp;title=All%20Projects">Code Share</a>&nbsp;area within the DeveloperForce ecosystem, which allows developers to share code snippets with the rest of the community.</p>
<p>Its a pretty cool way for anyone to share their techniques as code samples in a variety of languages, then letting the community vet the code, fork larger projects, and collaborate to improve the code for the greater good.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that they don't have the internal resources to fully support the process, <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/bringing-code-and-community-together.html">Salesforce has halted code samples submission, announcing plans to migrate the Code Sharing program to Github</a>.</p>
<p>Github is already the largest code sharing platform, providing social tools that developers are used to.  Salesforce's publiclackowledgement that they don't have the internal resources to operate, the fact they identify the importance of such a program, and the decision to migrate to Github are all very savvy moves by the <a title="API Pioneer" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Github%20101">Github is one of the most important platforms you can use to support your API</a>.  Using Github to host all your API code samples and SDKs, whether they are generated internally or by your developers community is becoming more than a novelty, but an essential part of API operations.</p>

<p>Google is using the <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/02/udacity-html5-game-development-course.html">online learning platform Udacity to teach developers about game development</a>.  The new <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255">HTML Game Development course</a> (CS255), is the online classroom for the programming class, coupled with a series of study groups hosted at Google's San Francisco office and a contest providing developers an incentive to complete the class.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/live/">Google is kicking off the course with a live session</a>, with Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun on Thursday, February 14th at 10:30 AM and the class<span>&nbsp;will be taught by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Colt McAnlis</a><span>&nbsp;(Developer Advocate, Chrome Developer Relations),&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Peter Lubbers</a><span>(Program Manager, Chrome Developer Relations), and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105495497383489174073/posts">Sean Bennett</a><span>&nbsp;(Architect, Udacity).</span></p>
<p>The HTML Game Development course from Google is an interesting approach to developer education by providing an online course bundled with in-person or streamed workshops and study groups, bundled with a contest to help motivate students.</p>
<p>I may create a blueprint for other API providers to follow, when launching their own courses in a similar way to Google.</p>

<p>I was checking out the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/three-new-aws-reference-architectures-for-e-commerce.html">updates to the AWS Reference Architecture</a>, where they provide blueprints for how you can use AWS. In this version AWS provides an e-commerce architecture reference--providing a system overview, a detailed architectural diagram, and a list of the AWS services used in the architectural approach.</p>
<p>The AWS e-commerce architecture reference provides three separate areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web Frontend </strong>- This is a reference architecture for the web frontend of an e-commerce site. It makes use of Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, ElastiCache, DynamoDB and CloudSearch</li>
<li><strong>Checkout Pipeline </strong>- This is a reference architecture for a secure and highly available checkout pipeline service for an e-commerce site. It uses the Virtual Private Cloud, the Simple Workflow Service, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, and the Simple Email Service</li>
<li><strong>Marketing &amp; Recommendations Service</strong> - This is a reference architecture for a marketing and recommendation service for an e-commerce site. It uses Elastic MapReduce, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, and the Simple Email Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond providing the <a href="http://media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_ecommerce_webfrontend_14.pdf">detailed reference card</a>, AWS provides more information on a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/aws-training/architect/">three-day course in AWS Architecture Training</a> that will be held in numerous U.S. cities this spring.</p>
<p>I will add API architecture references as a <a href="/">building block for API owners</a> to consider when planning and managing an API.  If you can provide clear blueprints for developers to follow, you can increase the chances developers will be successful with integration of an API into their application or systems.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> is happening next week in NYC. I have had so much fun pulling together the schedule of keynotes, panels, sessions and the talks on the 429 - Too Many Requests stage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of requests we've received for sponsoring, speaking and attending has been overhelming. &nbsp;Resulting in a sold out conference, and an amazing lineup of speakers. &nbsp;I was spending some time tidying up the speakers page and sponsor page today, and was so impressed with the companies involved, I had to share.</p>
<p>There are 72 companies represented at API Strategy &amp; Practice:</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm pretty blown away by the list of companies that will be attendance. &nbsp;I'm stoked we were able to pull together such an awesome lineup. &nbsp;I wish I could publish a list of companies who are attending, because that list would equally blow your mind. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's exciting to see the buzz around APIs in 2013, and I look forward to seeing you at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/dashboards/8031/library/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/city/city-of-palo-alto-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Palo Alto has opened up city data, including <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/dashboards/8031/library/" target="_blank">operational data about the Palo Alto City Library</a>.  Using the Palo Alto City open data portal you can access machine-readable data sets about various aspects of library operations including visitor count, checkouts by type of materia, information and circulation services, programs attendance, website visitors count and how library funds are spent.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto open data portal provides widgets with data grids and charts derived from data.  But you can also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/it/open_data/suggest_a_dataset.asp">request data sets</a> and access data via the <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/developers/">City of Palo Alto's API</a>.</p>
<p>The city hopes that it will increase community engagement by making data open and machine readable by default. The city is looking to throw hackathons that will develop solutions, and increase public engagement in city government, and ultimately save money and enhance city services.</p>
<p>The City of Palo Alto open data portal is provided by cloud-based <a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar Open Data Platform</a>.</p>
