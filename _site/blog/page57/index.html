        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/13/heading-to-washington-dc-to-talk-apis-with-innovation-fellows/">Heading to Washington DC to Talk APIs with Innovation Fellows</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/federal-government/innovation-fellows/PresidentialInnovationFellows.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was honored this month to receive an invitation from Todd Park (<a title="Todd Park" href="https://twitter.com/todd_park">@todd_park</a>), the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, on behalf of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows Program</a>, to come out to Washington DC and spend an afternoon coaching and working with some of the Presidential Innovation Fellows on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/opendata">Open Data Initiatives</a> project.</p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows program brings together top innovators from the private&nbsp;sector, nonprofits, and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate on solutions that aim to deliver significant results in six months, while being supported by a broader community of interested citizens throughout the country.</p>
<p>The objective of the OpenData Initiatives are centered around:</p>
<blockquote><em>Stimulating a rising tide of innovation and entrepreneurship that utilizes government data to create tools that help Americans in numerous ways</em></blockquote>
<p>Working with the Innovation Fellows is just one areas I&rsquo;m <a title="working to change the way our government works using APIs" href="/federal_government.php">working to change the way our government works using APIs</a>.  I strongly feel that opening up our government, and evolving how it operates using web APIs is fundamental in bringing democracy into the 21st century.</p>
<p>While speaking with the Innovation Fellows I will cover the usual material I have published here on API Evangelist:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of APIs" href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">History of APIs</a></strong> - Brief overview of the modern web API movement</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API Building Blocks</a> </strong>- The essential building blocks to a successful API</li>
<li><strong><a title="Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">API Service Providers</a></strong> - Roundup of the service providers who can help deploy APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Tools" href="/apitools/">API Tools</a></strong> - Pull together list of tools that can be used to design, deploy and manage APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">Industries</a></strong> - Some of the top industries putting APIs to use</li>
<li><strong><a title="Hackathons" href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hackathons</a></strong> - How hackathons are being used to drive innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>My intentions are to help share everything I know with the fellows to make sure they are well equipped to execute as part of the OpenData Initiatives.  APIs will be the underlying technology that stimulates innovation and the interface that allows Americans to develop tools that utilizes government data.</p>
<p>APIs won&rsquo;t just be the underlying technology that drives this, the philosophies and methodologies that have fueled the current web API movement will be essential in changing culture in washington.  APIs have the potential to allow federal agencies to take inventory of the rich data and content they posses, and open up government, making their day to day operations much more public, and a truly participatory process.</p>
<p>This process won&rsquo;t be giving the folks who run our government another thing to learn or do, it will allow them share much of heavy lifting associated with day to day operations with the public, corporations and nonprofits--leaving them much more nimble to accomplish their core mission.  APIs aren&rsquo;t just about technology change, they are about cultural change, and have the potential to be the change we want to see in washington.</p>
<p>As I prepare my thoughts to go out to DC I wanted to put it out to my readers and see what you feel I should share with the Innovation Fellows about the API space.  What do they need to know to make their six month iniatives as impactful as possible?  How can I best distill down everything we&rsquo;ve learned in the public space about openness, transparency and developer ecosystems, so they get the true essence of this movement?</p>

Lots of big news coming out of <a title="Apple's World Wide Developer Conference" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple's World Wide Developer Conference</a> (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.<p></p>
<span>We saw major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new <a title="iCloud" href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.</span><p></p>
<span>iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.</span><p></p>
<span>This means documents you've written, presentations you've prepared are available on any IOS device. You can view and edit the same document, in its latest state, on all your devices. And since iCloud automatically updates any changes you make, you don't even have to remember to save your work. </span><p></p>
<span>iCloud will also have a full set of APIs for developers to take advantage of, allowing them to implement iCloud storage, sync, and backup for documents into any application.</span><p></p>
<span>Apple's iCloud represents a continued evolution of the file system from being local to existing on the Internet and available on any device. This means that all design, collaboration, publishing and printing will move off the desktop as well. </span><p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/12/the-api-evangelist-mission/">The API Evangelist Mission</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-logo-400.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Many folks who encounter <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> think I'm working to evangelize a single API. &nbsp;I field so many questions about this I thought I would address by publishing an API Evangelist mission statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mission of API Evangelist is to educate business, nonprofit and government leaders about the value of APIs to their organizations.</p>
<p>API Evangelist is made up of four properties:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Evangelist </strong>(<a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>) - Business of APIs</li>
<li><strong>API Voice</strong> (<a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>) - Politics of APIs</li>
<li><strong>API Stack</strong> (<a href="http://theapistack.com">theapistack.com</a>) - API discovery and ranking </li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends</strong> (<a href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>) - Hackathon news and calendar</li>
</ul>
<p>With API Evangelist I strive to be the independent voice for the industry, providing the public with information about API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">Building Blocks</a></li>
<li><a title="API Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">Service Providers</a></li>
<li><a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">Industries</a></li>
<li><a title="API Tools" href="/apitools/">Tools</a></li>
<li><a title="API News" href="/news/">News</a></li>
<li><a title="API Analysis" href="/blog/">Analysis</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to provide a wealth of resources for those looking to design, develop and deploy APIs without bias towards a specific platform--allowing them to make an educated choice about what path they should take.</p>
<p>To stay independent and operate API Evangelist, I need to bring in revenue, and keep things moving forward.  I strive to do this in as healthy of a way as possible, without giving away control over my attention and focus, and contribute as much as possible to resources I provide to the public.</p>
<p>Areas I currently offer consulting services in are:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Evangelism</strong> - Design and oversight of companies API evangelism efforts</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Strategy</strong> - Design and oversight of a companies API monetization, business model and incubation approaches</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Targeting, planning and execution of hackathons</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Industry</strong> - Analysis of specific industries, API providers within and the opportunities available</li>
<li><strong>Markets</strong> - Identifying and deeper understanding of evangelism opportunities within specific cities and countries</li>
<li><strong>Developer Profiling</strong> - Targeting and profiling of developers within industries, markets and of specific, existing APIs</li>
<li><strong>Providers</strong> - Providing a deeper understanding of how specific APIs operate their API operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Speaking</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Webinars</strong> - Participating in webinars with companies and individuals</li>
<li><strong>Conferences</strong> - Speaking and presenting at technology conferences</li>
<li><strong>Meetups</strong> - Speaking and participating at local meetups</li>
<li><strong>Workshops</strong> - Design and execution of workshops at existing events</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these consulting areas are design to provide as much value to the client, while amplifying the signal and content via the four API Evangelist properties, and other syndication opportunities, under a <a title="Creative Commons License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">creative commons license</a>--enabling the public to consume and provide the greatest possible good for the API industry.</p>
<p>I feel strongly that a wealth of open resources will help ensure a fast growing and healthy industry by educating non-developers, non-technical business leaders about the benefits of APIs and healthy developer and partner ecosystem.</p>
<p>Please let me know how you can help support me in what I do, providing the industry with the information it needs to be successful, while also giving you what you need to successfully provide the services you offer.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://kinlane.com/mission.php">mission statement is a permanent fixture on my central kinlane.com site</a>, it''s not just the API Evangelist mission, it is my mission.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/10/npr-adds-content-permission-control-to-their-api/">NPR Adds Content Permission Control to their API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/npr/npr-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>NPR is defining new models for content distribution. One that other media providers can follow, when designing their API driven content delivery platforms.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dev.npr.org/">NPR Story API</a> provides digital access to NPR content and to other station content--allowing both NPR and stations to contribute and consume local and national news stories.</p>
<p>In an effort to provide NPR stations with more control over the content they contribute to the platform for distribution, <a href="http://digitalservices.npr.org/post/npr-api-content-permissions-control">NPR Digital Services has introduced content permissions control via the NPR story API</a>.</p>
<p>Currently content stored on the  Story API&rsquo;s platform can be retrieved by anyone with an API key--allowing content pushed across the network to be consumedd in 3 ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Create Once, Publish Everywhere</strong> - Stations and npr.org push content into the API and then pull the content onto other platforms, such as other station-owned web properties and mobile apps</li>
<li><strong>Station Networks</strong> - Content is shared between multiple stations in a content network, both on web sites and mobile apps</li>
<li><strong>National</strong> - Station content is featured on npr.org and NPR mobile apps with links back to station digital properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the new content permissions, stations can now control who is allowed to pull their content from the API.  The permissions work by allowing stations pushing content to specify whether the content should be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Public to all</li>
<li>Public to the NPR station network</li>
<li>Public to a group of stations listed in a whitelist </li>
<li>Public to everyone except for stations on a blacklist</li>
</ul>
<p>The new changes allow stations to set these permissions at the individual story level, as well as create permission groups to add multiple stories to.</p>
<p>NPR's approach is a great model for how APIs can facilitate content exchange across a large network of providers, allowing for the widest distribution possible-while also allowing content owners control over who has access to their valuable content in a very granular way.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/npr/NPR-Digital-Services.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>APIs are all about providing access to valuable content and resources, but should also be designed to give the proper amount of access, so your content doesn&rsquo;t end up being consumed, distributed in ways you don&rsquo;t find appropriate.</p>
        <ul class="actions" style="text-align: center;">

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/08/developers-resist-api-evangelism/">Developers Resist API Evangelism</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist-site/developers-will-resist.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Marketing to developers is no straightforward task, and with the growth in the number of APIs, platforms, tools and active evangelists and advocates, it is only going to get harder.</p>
<p>Developers just don&rsquo;t want to be sold anything.  We just want to do what we do, and just be left alone--until we need help and reach out.  Then we need you to be there.</p>
<p>With <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I&rsquo;m evangelizing the importance of APIs to a wider audience beyond developers, while also helping companies understand how they can market their services to developers.</p>
<p>Helping non-developers understand about APIs is getting easier each month, while helping API owners market to developers is getting harder.</p>
<p>Many companies are even opting to not use the term advocate or evangelist, as these names are beginning to have a negative impression with developers.</p>
<p>Developers are bombarded by one or many evangelists, everywhere they go, and many of these evangelists are more sales and marketing than developer support--giving everyone a bad name.</p>
<p>If you are looking to evangelize your API in the near future, deeply consider your approach.  Your objective is not to sell developers on your API, but to help them be successful in what they are doing--something that may or may not involve your companies API.</p>
<p>Your only option for evangelism is to be as authentic as possible and truly solve the problems developers face, otherwise developers will look elsewhere--and with the increased competition, developers have a growing number of options when it comes to APIs and platforms to get the job done.</p>

<p>I will be doing a webinar with Chris Haddad (<a href="https://twitter.com/cobiacomm">@cobiacomm</a>) of <a title="WSO2" href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a> on October 9th, where we discuss <a title="API management best practices for digital business ecosystem" href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value/">API management best practices for digital business ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>WSO2 is one of my partner API server providers.  I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what they do because they were the first open source API service provider to emerge out of the <a title="20 API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">20 API service providers</a> in the space.</p>
<p>Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems</li>
<li>How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API</li>
<li>When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value</li>
<li>Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris.    The webinar titled "<a title="WSO2 Case Study &ndash; API Management Building Blocks and Business Value" href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value">WSO2 Case Study &ndash; API Management Building Blocks and Business Value</a>", will be on Tuesday, October 9, at 9:00 a.m. &ndash; 10:00 a.m. PDT.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo-transparent.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a lot of news about social networks in the last couple of weeks, with <a href="http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-10-04-facebook-grows-to-1-billion-users-creates-video-to-show-global-reach/">Facebook reaching 1B users</a>, a <a href="http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/myspace_gets_new_look_stays_true_to_its_roots">brand new look for MySpace</a> giving people hope for the struggling social network, the <a title="great twitter migration to app.net" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/10/04/has-the-great-twitter-migration-to-app.net-begun/">great Twitter migration to App.net</a> and what a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/technology/dick-costolo-of-twitter-an-improv-master-writing-its-script.html">master of improv Dick Costolo is, writing Twitters script</a>.</p>
<p>All of these news items are in some way trying to convince us of what the future of social networking will look like, declaring Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and App.net as a contender.  While all of these social networks aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, I think there is one social network that represents the future of all social networks--<a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what Github is, you probably aren&rsquo;t a programmer.  Github is a social network built around the software version control software <a title="Git" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>. &nbsp;Using Github, programmers can collaborate around repositories of code, which allows them to download, fork and commit back code in any format--making software development a social endeavor amongst potentially thousands of developers.</p>
<p>While Github is primarily a social network of programmers, repositories don&rsquo;t have to be just code.  Github repositories can contain HTML, text files and many other formats that can be edited by anybody--allowing the power of version control and collaboration to occur between anyone, in any business sector.</p>
<p>I just finished watching <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html">Clay Shirky&rsquo;s talk on how the Internet will (one day) transform government</a>, using the platform to deal with a flood of new, often times divergent, ideas.  As always, Clay masterfully uses history to lay the groundwork for his argument, that social collaboration and version control with Github is in alignment with how democracy should work.</p>
<p>While Twitter and Facebook have proven to evoke profound social change, I think Github holds amazing potential for change as well. And whether it is allowing developers to build open source software, government to make the legal process truly inclusive of its citizens or <a title="empowering teachers to collaborate on curriculum with Github" href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/16/github-for-education-revisited/">empowering our teachers to collaborate on classroom curriculum</a>--Github holds an amazing amount of untapped potential.</p>
<p>Github opens up unlimited possibilities for much more constructive and meaningful social interactions than we&rsquo;ve seen with Twitter and Facebook. &nbsp;Social interactions that will allow anyone to benefit from the successful aspects of open source software development--unleasing a new era of social networking and collaboration.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/gears-grey.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Hackathons are a popular way for developers to come together and hack on mobile and web apps, in hopes of winning prizes and getting noticed for their innovation.  Silicon Valley has done a great job of keeping hackathons about building apps, but there are many other ways to apply the hackathon model.</p>
<p>One hackathon model that I&rsquo;ve seen a couple times now, is more about hacking a process, rather than hacking an app.  A hackathon where any company, organization or individual can come, with their existing process, and walk participants through what they are looking to accomplish--with the goal of making it better.</p>
<p>The process could be anything they already do on a regular basis and are looking to optimize, or a new process they would like to develop. In our ever-increasing digital world, where Software as a Service (SaaS) and APIs are becoming commonplace in our daily lives, there is an need for constantly identifying, refining and establishing new processes.</p>
<p>APIs open up huge opportunities for more efficient ways of getting things done, and a hackathon is a great way to pitch a process to a bunch of new users, form teams and spend some time hacking together a more efficient way to get it done.  The objective of this form of the hackathon is to refine a process and help make it better, using technology to better solve the problems we deal with every day.</p>
<p>While building apps is a great focus of a hackathon, they might be better used to help people gain efficiencies at their companies and organizations--allowing them to get access to creative new approaches, and knowledge about other potential tools and platforms they can put to use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I predict hackathons will continue to grow in popularity, and hopefully we can continue to evolve them to reach the widest possible audience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Tumblr engineering team has been hard at work on a new Github page, showcasing the <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#code">open source projects they've released</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tumblr has also added a <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#coming-soon">coming soon section,</a> highlighting open source projects they are planning on releasing in the near future.</p>
<p>What's interesting is they have also included <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#presentations">select presentations from conferences and events Tumblr has presented at</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/">Github implementation by Tumblr</a> is pretty unique, and to go even further, Tumblr has also&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.github.com">open sourced their whole approach to deploying it on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Tumblr's use of Github is worth showcasing. &nbsp;I think it's an innovative approach that other API owners could follow to showcase the open source project they are working on, as well as valuable event presentations.</p>
<p>I'm really impressed with the number of innovative uses of <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> I'm seeing lately.</p>

<p>When it comes to any business, you want to showcase your team, and the value they bring to the table. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things I do here at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, is showcase great examples of technology across the API industry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind I wanted to showcase the <a title="Singly Team Page" href="https://singly.com/about">Singly team page.</a> &nbsp;When you visit singly.com and click on team in the footer, you get immediately see a team member photo carousel:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Team-Carousel.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Which isn't very unique, but next you get 3 things that are unique:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Average number of hours each Singly team member slept this week</li>
<li>Number of Github commits in the last 7 days</li>
<li>Distance walked by Singly team members</li>
</ul>

<p>Singly team members provide this data using Quantified Self (QS) data from products like <a title="Fithbit" href="https://singly.com/docs/fitbit">Fitbit</a> and <a title="Runkeeper" href="https://singly.com/docs/runkeeper">Runkeeper</a>, and social programming networks like <a title="Github" href="https://singly.com/docs/github">Github</a>--driven by APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next Singly shows a map of their neighborhood in the San Francisco mission district:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Neighborhood.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Then they wrap up with <a title="Instagram" href="https://singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> photos from team members:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Team-Instagram.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>The Singly team page is the best company team page I have ever seen. &nbsp;It shows extremely personal data from their Fitbit and Rukneeper devices, as well as the day to day business of code pushes via their Github accounts. The team page also shows you where the team is located and some Instagram photos to help you get the vibe of the team.</p>

<p>When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to. To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!</p>
<p>When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences. <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a> is usually in the spring and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.</p>

<p>API Strategy &amp; Conference is psyched to be partnering with Defrag in our first year.  If you <a title="Register for API strategy" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for API Strategy &amp; Conference</a>, you will get 10% off of your registration for Defrag.</p>
<p>The event combination will make November a great time to immerse yourself in the API industry, with API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, then two weeks later, go further with Internet technology discussions at Defrag.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you at both <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> in November!&nbsp;</p>

        <p><a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for SDK repositories, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to help manage your API platform.</p>
<p>One great use of Github is as an <a title="API issue management" href="/buildingblocks/ticket_system.php">API issue management</a> tool. &nbsp;The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories.</p>

<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management. &nbsp;Think of it as repository for your API itself.</p>
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentialy be part of the API product development cycle.</p>
<p>Along with API Issue Management with Github, you can link issues with the milestones portion of Github, providing deeper roadmap integration, but I will cover that in a separate post.</p>

<p>Back in May, when the <span>White House CIO has released a strategy, entitled "</span><a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a><span>", which directs all federal agencies to publish HTML, JSON and XML versions of their digital strategy, I wrote a PHP script to monitor the progress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To date, 25 federal agencies have successfully published their digital strategy, and I have been updating my script regularly to keep up. And while a few of the agencies still have querks with their HTTP Codes and with JSON formatting, the code is starting to stabilize. &nbsp;So I decided to start <a title="Publishing to Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane/digital-strategy">sharing it on Github</a>, allowing others to put it to use.</p>
<p>The first sample script I'm publishing is a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/digital-strategy/blob/master/pull-agency.php">basic example of how to pull the JSON version of a single agencies digital strategy</a>. &nbsp;Once it pulls the JSON, it then loops through each item and field on the strategy, and renders to screen. &nbsp;It doesn't make any assumptions on what you wish to do with data.</p>
<p>Next I will publish a more sophisticated version that stores values in a database. &nbsp;Here is the pull federal agency digital strategy PHP script:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently processing several discussion I&rsquo;ve had with folks about APIs and the future of search when it comes to voice enabled apps, like <a title="Apples Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Apple&rsquo;s Siri.</a></p>
<p>It started with a discussion with the <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a> folks about their blog post, <a title="Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case" href="http://api500.com/post/27440326130/webservices-supply-chain-management-the-siri-case">Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case</a>.  Next I was reading a presentation from Pat Cappelaere(<a href="https://twitter.com/cappelaere">@cappelaere</a>) CEO of <a title="Vightel Corporation" href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/companies/vightel-corporation/">Vightel Corporation</a>. called <a title="Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API" href="http://www.slideshare.net/cappelaere/building-tomorrows-web-services">Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API</a>.</p>
<p>Pat has an interesting image in his deck, showing who the next generation consumer of your API will be:</p>

<p>These conversations reflect a whole new area of consideration for the future of web APIs.  Will voice be the dominant way to search via our mobile devices?  If so, how do we expose our companies resources, in a way that makes them easily consumed by voice enabled apps?</p>
<p>At the simplest, we need to discuss where REST fails us in this scenario, and at the most complex we need to discuss what &ldquo;activities&rdquo; will be consumed by voice apps and what types of &ldquo;supply chain management&rdquo; processes or framework will we need to manage all of this.</p>
<p>All of this will feed into to whether or not your company, its products and services will be found in a Siri-like search, when voice enabled apps become the default.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charts-graphs-1.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you have an API, you track two things:  1)  Number of Developer Registrations and 2)  Number of API requests.  This is how we determine a successful API, right?</p>
<p>You should track those two things, but those metrics alone do not define a successful API.  You should go much further.  Each API owner will have their own definition of success, thus their own set of metrics to measure success.</p>
<p>With this in mind, there is no single framework for measuring your API, but here is one suggestion for a basic framework to think about when tracking your API developers.</p>
<p>First establish some buckets to put users in:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>New</strong> - Brand new developer</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong> - Developer actively using API (come up with number)</li>
<li><strong>Inactive</strong> - Developers who go below the "active" number threshold for X number of days</li>
<li><strong>Billable</strong> - Developer who is paying you $$</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - A developer who are working closer with than rest of developers</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Your staff or contractors who actively use your API, even for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Then make sure and flag each user with a timestmap when they change status:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>5/2/2012 - New</li>
<li>5/2/2012 - Active</li>
<li>7/9/2012 - Billable</li>
<li>8/15/2012 - Inactive</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charts-graphs-2.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I like to generate daily, weekly and monthly counts for each bucket, plus see numbers on the churn between buckets.</p>
<p>Looking at developers in buckets, and tracking on their transitions between buckets allows you to start seeing the big picture, when large groups of users are migrating between status, or the individual picture, like why a single developer just went inactive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much to learn from just watching new registrations and number of API calls, but by creating meaningful buckets to place developers in, then understanding their evolution between these buckets, I think you can learn a lot with a pretty simple set of metrics.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wordnik/wordnik-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>We all have our own approaches to API design and development, many of which will never see the light of day.  In the API space we hear a lot about API management and API success stories, but not much about the process of designing, developing and initial deployment of APIs.  I just had a little taste of how the <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a> team approaches it, using <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>.</p>
<p>Often when you hear about Swagger in the industry, you hear about the UI portion.  You know the sexy <a title="interactive documentation" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/interactive_documentation.php">interactive documentation</a> that is fast becoming a standard with APIs, but it&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg--there is a whole lot more power to Swagger, than just interactive docs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;The heart of Swagger is the specification, and from that, cool shit can get done!&rdquo;,  say Tony Tam Wordnik CEO and technical co-founder.</em></p>
<p>To demonstrate, Tony walked me through Wordnik&rsquo;s approach to designing, developming and deploying a new API driven iPad app, using a team of 3:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>One person driving an editor writing JSON files, which are the Swagger spec for the needed API</li>
<li>The all three discussed the operations, parameters, while adding them to the JSON, and re-running the swagger spec validator after each meaningful change</li>
<li>When they were happy with the specs, they loaded the JSON files into the UI through  apache installed on a local machine</li>
<li>After they inspected each API and operation again, they wrote the models in the spec files, and reviewed again to make sure everything was good</li>
<li>Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated a Scalatra (Scala) server from the spec files</li>
<li>Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated an Objective-C client from the spec files</li>
<li>The server developer went off and wired the server to the business logic</li>
<li>The front-end guy went and wired the UI to the objective-c library</li>
</ul>
<p>The process took 2.5 hours in total, from API to interface--a technique they call interface-driven development, which focuses on modeling the perfect interface for the problem they are trying to solve using an API.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wordnik/Swagger-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To solve this particular problem, they needed a scala server for the back-end.  they could have just as easily generated a Node.JS server, a Rails Sinatra server or any other based upon simple <a title="mustache templates" href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache templates</a>. Additionally they could generate JavaScript, Scala, PHP or Python clients, but for this project they only needed Objective-C.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a> approach to API design and development using <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Swagger</a> is interesting.  For me, it demonstrates that a clean API spec should not be an afterthought, and a means by which you generate interactive API documentation, or when API discovery becomes an issue.  Your entire design, development and management process should center around a meaningful API spec, which will then allow you to deploy your API server, interactive documentation, client code, while also providing API discovery.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/youtube/Youtube-Stack-Overflow.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>YouTube has decided to <a href="http://apiblog.youtube.com/2012/09/the-youtube-api-on-stack-overflow.html">cease support for Youtube API QA via dedicated Google Group, and exclusively use Stack Overflow</a> for developer QA support.</p>
<p>Every developer knows that <a title="Stack Overflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is where you go to get the best answers for your programming issues, and API providers are taking notice too.</p>
<p>Stack Overflow has always been something I recommend paying attention to for any API evangelist, but more API providers are considering it be the place where all API developer QA should exist.</p>
<p><a title="Facebook" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/545/">Facebook</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/support">Foursquare</a>, and <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/08/now-in-public-beta-the-salesforce-stackexchange-qa-site.html">Salesforce</a> have all moved their API developer QA to Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>These API providers are still maintaining other API <a title="api support building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">support building blocks</a> like <a title="bug ticket systems" href="/buildingblocks/ticket_system.php">bug ticket systems</a>, email and <a title="Twitter" href="/buildingblocks/twitter.php">Twitter</a> accounts, but when it comes to public developer forums they feel that Stack Overflow is enough.</p>
<p>While I think having a active presence on <a title="Stack Overflow" href="/buildingblocks/stack_exchange.php">Stack Overflow</a>&nbsp;is a critical part of any API evangelism strategy, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure eliminating a dedicated forum is the right way to go.  I worry you will push developer community completely out on the open Internet, reducing interactions that happen under your brand.</p>
<p>With the size of their developer community, larger APIs often have canyon that exists between them and their developers, and it&rsquo;s easy to widen this canyon by moving general QA exclusively into an open Internet forum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that much more work to monitor and respond to your community forum as well as Stack Overflow, and even add in Quora, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Google Alerts, and other ways of monitoring the API and developer landscape.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/quantified-self/quantified-self.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m immersing myself into the fascinating new world of the <a title="Quantified Self" href="http://quantifiedself.com/about/">Quantified Self</a> (QS).  If you are not familiar with what QS is, according to Wikipedia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, arousal, blood oxygen levels), and performance (mental and physical).</em></p>
<p>As I do with other areas, I start my research by doing a roundup of companies who offer QS products and services--which helps me define the space. Within an hour I easily found 50+ QS device manufacturers, some of which were complete with API driven integration platforms-- way too many to list in a single roundup, but here are a couple of better known companies:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a></strong> - Fitbit is a health and fitness tracking device</li>
<li><strong><a title="Runkeeper" href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a></strong> - Runkeeper is a device for tracking<span>, measuring, and improving your fitness</span></li>
<li><strong><a title="Withings" href="http://www.withings.com/">Withings</a></strong> - Withings provides connected body scales, blood pressure and baby monitors</li>
<li><strong><a title="Zeo" href="http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/">Zeo</a></strong> - Zeo has sleep tracking and management devices and apps</li>
</ul>
<p>These QS platforms represent a whole new opportunity for the API industry, one that will drive the next generation of healthcare innovation.  Self-quantification starts with data collection, followed by visualization, then cross-referencing and the discovery of correlations--all three opportunites for APIs.</p>
<p>Devices can use APIs via cell and wifi to transmit data for collection and storage, while also allowing app developers to use the same APIs to help end-users manage and visualize their data. Then, when appropriate, use the same APIs providing access to other systems and providers who can then cross-reference and discover correlations within individual or groups of users.</p>
<p>It is exciting to think about the possibilities around QS.  New ways to gather data about our health and the environment around us in real-time, but also be able to understand this data in the most meaningful way possible, in a way that impacts the most important thing to us--our health!</p>
<p><strong>Devices + APIs + Cloud = Exciting Opportunities!</strong></p>

I just added him to the homepage and <a title="API Speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker line-up</a>.</p>
<p>Steve is a highly respected Ruby developer, software craftsman, and an aspiring digital humanities scholar. He spends most of his time contributing to Open Source projects, and maintains both <a title="Hackety Hack" href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack</a> and <a title="Shoes" href="http://shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a>, while also teaching and helping develop curriculum for&nbsp;<a title="JumpStart Labs" href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Steve has has written book on <a title="Designing Hypermedia APIs" href="http://designinghypermediaapis.com/">Designing Hypermedia APIs</a>. Well it&rsquo;s better than a book.  I&rsquo;d call it a "living digital book". One where you can constantly come back and get fresh content and interact with the books community and author.  Much better than  the old-school programming book, which you buy once and it sits on your shelf.</p>
<p>What intrigues me about Steve, is that his perspective is very technical, but in his own words, &ldquo;<em>I've found a place between the sciences and the humanities.</em>&rdquo;  Which is a point of view we need to give a platform to, and everyone in Silicon Valley needs to listen.</p>
<p>Steve is exactly the fresh perspective we want to get at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>.

<p>Albert combines over 10 years of entrepreneurial experience with an in-depth technology background. As an entrepreneur, he has founded or co-founded five companies, including a management consulting firm (in Germany), a hosted data analytics company, a technology subsidiary for Telebanc (now E*Tradebank), an early stage investment firm, and most recently (with his wife), DailyLit, a service for reading books by email or RSS.</p>
<p>Albert also served as the president of del.icio.us through the company's sale to Yahoo. His technology background goes back to winning the German national computer science competition at age 18. Albert graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in economics and computer science and holds a Ph.D. in Information Technology from MIT. He has managed technology projects for organizations as diverse as Tacoda (startup) and Telebanc (leading Internet bank).</p>
<p>USV invests in companies that have large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience and defensible by network effects, so USV has a vested interest in understanding developer communities, how APIs will evolve, what types of businesses are best suited to an API driven strategy.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Practice &amp; Strategy conference</a> fireside chat with Albert Wenger will reflect the tone of the conference, which is a blend of both the technical and business of APIs--providing what is essential for companies to be successful with their API driven strategies.</p>

<p>For example, when a user authenticates via <a href="https://github.com/">Github Using Singly</a>, I get the following meta data and endpoints:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Github-Meta-Endpoints.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Singly gives me 6 endpoints with data from the user&rsquo;s activity in these areas.  I&rsquo;m looking to create an algorithm that will provide me with some quick ranking score based upon the number of repositories, followers and following a user has.</p>
<p>Right now I'm just going to add these up, take average across all my users that have logged in via Github.  I&rsquo;m sure I will evolve the design of the algorithm as I progress, but it should work for now.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide a little more insight into what type of user is signing up for my service, API or otherwise and possibly take different courses of action based upon their overall activity levels on Github.  I mean, if they are Github superstar I want to know it, and also know if they aren&rsquo;t very active at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explore the same algorithm for <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> authentication, but probably take different values into consideration for those social networks.</p>

<p>API automation is allowing API providers to reach entirely new audiences, acting as a sort of icon-based interface allowing anyone put their APIs to work for them.</p>
<p>Up until now, if you wanted to integrate Sendgrid&rsquo;s email functionality into your workflow you would need to get a programmer, now any user can integrate email into their every day workflow--using the wide array of cloud services and APIs that <a title="automation platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">automation platforms</a> are supporting.</p>

<p>SOA Cloud 2012 is happening September 24,25, 2012 in London, UK at the Imperial College London.  The first day kicks off with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li> <strong><a title="The Era of Intelligent Service Technology" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote1">The Era of Intelligent Service Technology</a></strong> -  Thomas Erl's well-known, visionary tour of relationships between and combinations of service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, and semantic Web technologies. </li>

<p>The first day keynotes have not one space agency talking APIs, but two.  With<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote2"> Vicente Navarro of the European Space Agency</a>, and <a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote3">Hook Hua of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology</a> (NASA Center).</p>
<p>Second day keynotes are pretty impressive too, with opening keynote by Dennis Wisnosky, US Department of Defense &ndash; "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote6">Heading, Altitude &amp; Airspeed: Service Orientation, Cloud &amp; Semantics &ndash; All or Nothing!</a>".

<p>These are just a few of the keynotes, sessions and panel that caught my attention,  I&rsquo;m going to spend some time researching a couple of the speakers and companies and then I might have some more recommendations.  It looks like a lot of API goodness packed into 2 days, and would make a fun trip to London this month.</p>

<p>Today I noticed that NASA, in addition to publishing their digital strategy in <a title="NASA HTML Digital Strategy" href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html">HTML</a>, <a title="XML" href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.xml">XML</a> and <a title="NASA JSON Digital Strategy" href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.json">JSON</a>, added a "recent commits" Github widget on their digital strategy homepage.</p>

<p>I was spending time thinking about API discovery methodologies this afternoon (I know...I have issues), but with <a title="ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs</a>, its a very real problem.</p>
<p>Currently, as an application developer, when I have an idea, I start by sketching what I want to build and set out to find all of the resources I will need to make it a reality.  I pick my platform of choice and then set out to find other API resources I will need to bring my app to life.</p>
<p>I will need a database, user management and some analytics for my back-end, selecting a <a title="Backend as a Service" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">Backend as a Service</a>&nbsp;(BaaS)&nbsp;provider like <a title="CloudMine" href="https://cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> or <a title="Kinvey" href="http://www.kinvey.com/">Kinvey</a>.  Next I need authentication and social integration with <a title="Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly</a>.  After this I will have to piece together my application from a variety of individual APIs like <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, <a title="Urban Airship" href="http://urbanairship.com/">Urban Airship</a>, <a title="Iron.io" href="http://Iron.io">Iron.io</a> and many other APIs.</p>
<p>What if we flipped this on its head and reversed the process?  As an application developer, I could publish a list of resources I need for my web or mobile app, and APIs could find me.  I could just publish my need for image storage, facial recognition, location and other resources and API providers could find me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a brain exercise to see if I&rsquo;m missing anything.  Maybe the problem we need to solve isn&rsquo;t API discovery, it&rsquo;s application discovery? &nbsp;Enable APIs to find developers, in addition to developers finding APIs.</p>

        <p>I was directed to an API question today, that needs to be asked constantly in the space:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 50px;">

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>This is such a relevant topic I wanted to continue the conversation by listing the top 10 things that drive me crazy when integrating with a new API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Incomplete or Cumbersome Documentation</strong> - Definitely something that will keep you from a achieving a successful integration and make you walk away from an API</li>
<li><strong>Lacking Code Samples &amp; Libraries</strong> - The programming language i&rsquo;m using could vary from project to project, and the code samples and libraries can make or break my successful integration</li>
<li><strong>Senseless Rate Limiting</strong> - Rate limits are an essential part of API management, but placing of rate limits unecessarily and without pressure release options, doesn&rsquo;t make sense</li>
<li><strong>No Self-Service Registration</strong> - As a developer, I need instant gratification.  I need to know if an API will work for me, and getting started immediately will make the difference between using and walking away</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> - I&rsquo;m depending on an API, if its not reliable, I can&rsquo;t depend on for my application.  There are many aspects of API management that goes into reliability--spend the time to understand what it takes</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use </strong>- Nothing stops a great application idea more than restrict terms of use.  Make the legaleze as developer friendly as you can</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Regular communication with developers goes a long ways.  Whether blog posts, tweets or working with developers in person at hackathons, communication is an essential for me to adopt an API</li>
<li><strong>Usage Analytics </strong>- As a developer I need to understand how I&rsquo;m using an API.  As an API owner, you should be tracking every aspect of API operations, make sure and share some of this insight with developers</li>
<li><strong>Business Model </strong>- A business model for both API provider and consumer is essential for a healthy API experience.  If the API provider isn&rsquo;t making money or delivering value, it&rsquo;s not sustainable--if the developer can&rsquo;t pay the bills, their integrations will not survive</li>
<li><strong>Clear Pricing</strong> - If I don't know what it will cost for me to accomplish what I need with an API, there is very little chance I will integrate it into my application. I've become very accustomed to knowing my AWS bill, with the clear pricing they provide</li>
</ul>
<p>All nine of these items go into establishing trust between API provider and consumer.  There are some APIs I just trust and others I don&rsquo;t.  Delivery in these nine areas, all feed into whether I trust an API for my business or not</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
</ul>
<p><a title="I depend on 21 separate APIs for my business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">I depend on 21 separate APIs for my business</a>.  I&rsquo;m working to add more to this stack, and as a developer I can identify if an API has value within seconds, and hopefully have it integrated with in minutes or at the most a couple of hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As an API provider, make sure and find out what drives your developers crazy while integrating, and see what you can do to reduce friction in these nine areas. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bizdev.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>At first glance, APIs seem like something very technical, and the REST pundits do a good job of maintaining this perspective. Even though at the core of what we currently know as a &ldquo;web API&rdquo; there is plenty of tech, web APIs can be much more business than tech--a notion first introduced by&nbsp;<a title="Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake when she coined the term BizDev 2.0" href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake when she coined the term BizDev 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>APIs in practice, are a new approach to business development, using a partner or public facing API that allows consumers to sign up, start accessing valueable business assets in a self-service way--allowing a company to scale business development opportunities with fewer human resources.</p>
<p>Developers can start building applications and businesses around a companies assets, utilizing exposed API resources and self-service tools to establish a business relationship on their own. If an API has the necessary technical and business building blocks, and API consumers have a good enough application, there is a an opportunity for finding success without the need for engagement of traditional business development resources.</p>
<p>This process is BizDev 2.0. &nbsp;However, even with this evolution in establishing new business relationships, your company may not be ready for the flood of new relationships and ideas that will flow in through this new API driven environment. If you handle all the aspects of your API correctly, developers build applications, establish successful businesses and get traction on their ideas, they will need additional resources, attention and potentially, incubation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been the face of this process several times, only to bring in good ideas, get traction and identify potential value, but when I present these implementations internally...I get well, nothing. Companies often don&rsquo;t have the infrastructure and resources to handle this flow of new business opportunities, even a formal process for saying, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a great idea, we see the value, but we don't have the resources to deal with that right now&rdquo;, aka no!</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Biz-20-Workflow.png" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Biz-20-Workflow.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>If your going to open up a public or private API, you need to make sure you have a proper BizDev 2.0 process for handling new relationships that get traction via your API. This isn&rsquo;t saying you have to take in every relationship that comes in the door, but you need to have an efficient framework for receiving, evaluating and either accepting as a new relationship or formally declining and providing secondary options for the relationship--one of which can be putting the project back out to the ecosystem, for a crowd-sourced implementation.</p>
<p>Having a formal process, especially one that is transparent will go a long ways in building trust with your developer community. Think of how much different the current Twitter conversation would have been if they had a formal process for handling various business relationships early on? They are just now putting some of this in place, which is good, but much harder to do further down the road.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how perfect your technical implementation is, if you don&rsquo;t have a decent framework for handling the relationships that come in through your API community, developers will lose trust and look elsewhere to build their applicaitons and businesses. Make sure you have thought through the business development 2.0 process for your API, during the initial planning phase.</p>

<p>APIs are everywhere.  The number of public APIs available on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> are growing at a dizzying pace, with current count being at 7,207.  The number of <a title="API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">API service providers</a> and tools supporting the new demand for simple, web APIs that mobile and web developers can use has seen the same pace of growth.

<p>The pace of API consumption is growing as well, and up until recently, we only communicate in single words using APIs--we checkin, post, share, get, friend, like. &nbsp;Now that we have learned the basic words, we need a way to form more "<strong>meaningful&nbsp;phrases and sentences to communicate using APIs</strong>".</p>
<p>In the past month I&rsquo;ve explored a couple different areas where I&rsquo;m seeing APIs evolve from single uses into more aggregate, flowing forms of communication using APIs:</p>

<li><strong><a title="Backend as a Service (BaaS)" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">Backend as a Service(BaaS)</a></strong> - Building in the resources developers need most when building mobile or web apps into a single stack, bringing together the back-end and middleware to make developers more successful.</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Automation" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">API Automation</a></strong> - Providing iconographic tools for any users, even non-developers to string together actions between multiple APIs.  Bundling them into reusable recipes, and automating our personal and business lives in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mobile Builder Platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/04/mobile-application-builder-platforms/">Mobile Builder Platforms</a> </strong>- Platforms that provide hosted tools for developers and non-developers to rapidly build cross-platform mobile applications using content from RSS and APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Language Libraries" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/06/the-next-generation-of-api-programming-using-temboo-and-webshell/">API Language Libraries</a></strong> - Development of language libraries allowing developers to program against APIs with single lines of code, abstracting away common friction with authentication and inconsistencies between APis.</li>
<li><a title="Aggregate API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/18/a-unified-interface-for-social-apis-with-singly/"><strong>Aggregate APIs</strong>&nbsp;</a>- Building of unified or aggregate APIs like <a href="https://www.singly.com">Singly</a> does with personal data, providing a single authentication, endpoint and object framework that makes speaking with multiple APIs a reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the five fastest growing areas where I see API usage being taken to the next level, potentially allowing developers and even non-developers to better communicate using APIs, in ways that are more sophisticated than just single word uses.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/communicate-in-new-ways.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ironically there is a sixth area where APIs takes communicating with APIs to a new level, using speech and voice applications like Apple&rsquo;s Siri. This is one area that we&rsquo;ll continue to see an explosion of APIs to support.  If your business resources aren&rsquo;t exposed via an API, they won&rsquo;t be found by mobile users taking advantage of Siri-like speech applications.</p>
<p>All six of these areas will fuel the demand for APIs, while also adding entirely new ways of communicating.  These API resources will drive new meaning behind existing phrases like take a picture or search for restaurant, while creating entirely new words and phrases--much like we saw in the last ten years with the introduction of API driven concepts such as &ldquo;like&rdquo;, &ldquo;share&rdquo; and the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Sep 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m exploring the <a title="future of web APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a>, and have come to what I feel is what of the most fascinating areas of evolution in the usage of web APIs. &nbsp;An approach that is very developer centric, which is something you don't always see in the current API service landscape.</p>
<p><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/temboo/Temboo-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are two companies working hard on developing new libraries for popular programming languages that abstract away much of the authentication and other complexities developers face when using APIs.</p>
<p><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com">Temboo</a> and <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> are two pioneers that are taking API development to a new level.  Temboo is building libraries in Java, PHP, Python, or Ruby and Webshell is building libraries in JS, PHP, Ruby as well as providing a command line interface for programming against APIs.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just programming directly against a single API.  These are libraries that allow you to make calls against APIs using sometimes as little as 2 or 3 lines of code, opening new possibilities of efficiently programming against not just one API, but fluently across multiple APIs.</p>
<p><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to simplifying calls made against APIs, both platforms work to abstract away the complexities of API authentication, one of the biggest pain points for developers.</p>
<p>Platforms like Temboo and Webshell absorb the complexity, inconsistencies and difficult aspects of programming using APIs, providing libraries that developers can use in their native programming languages--making developers lives easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to classify what <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com">Temboo</a> and <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> are doing.  I don&rsquo;t have a term or phrase to describe them--one that does them justice.  Everything I say sounds like everything you are already doing with individual APIs.  But this is more.  Temboo and Webshell are defining new ways of speaking using APIs, allowing us to more efficiently speak using the vast amount of valuable resources being exposed via web APIs today.</p>
<p>Temboo and Webshell both have their own approach to solving this problem, which I will dive into separately, in future posts. &nbsp;Right now I just want to identify what they are doing to move forward the API landscape.</p>

<p>The API industry has come of age in 2012.  <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> has rolled over 7000 public APIs available, <a title="President Obama has mandated that all federal departments and agencies deploy APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">President Obama has mandated that all federal departments and agencies deploy APIs</a>, and there are now two major, enterprise quality open-source API management solutions available.</p>
<p>The industry is ready for its own, vendor neutral event where all API service providers and API owners can come together and discuss both the business and technical side of API design, deployment and management.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;d like to announce the <strong><a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a></strong>, in New York City, on November 1st and 2nd 2012.</p>
<p>Whether you already have API or are looking to better understand the strategy and best practices around API management, this is an event for you.</p>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Practice (<a title="#apistrat" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23apistrat">#apistrat</a>)  is featuring talks from John Musser of ProgrammableWeb, Daniel Jacobson of Netflix, Laura Merling of Alcatel-Lucent, John Sheehan of IFTT with more speakers to come.</p>

<p>To keep it simple I&rsquo;m offering a login using a <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> account.  Every developer has a Github account right?   Well if they don&rsquo;t, they should.  The easiest way there is to enable your API with a Github login is Singly.</p>
<p>Using <a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Singly</a>, I sign in with my Github account (this is where I got this idea), then I <a href="https://singly.com/apps/new">add a new application</a>, giving it the root URL and callback URL of my API developer area.</p>
<p><a href="https://singly.com/apps/new" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Application-Github.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Next I need to link up my Github account to my Singly account, by <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications">adding an application to my Github account</a>.  I give it a name, URL and when adding the callback, I add a Singly specific callback--Singly will handle the rest.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Github-App-Settings.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Now I just add a login with Github button to my developer area with the following URL:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><em>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/github?access_token=my_token</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When one of my API developers click on the Github login, it will route them to Github for OAuth, back to Singly and to my API callback URL where I can grab the authorization code for the user.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3646162.js?file=github-login-using-singly.php"></script>
<p>Now I can reference my API developer using their Github account, using their profile image, name as well as having some stats about the user like how many repositories they have, number of followers and who they follow--which provides me a pretty good baseline metric for distinguishing active developers vs. in-active developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kinlane"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kinlane-github.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Github login should be default for all API providers. It reduces developer on-boarding friction with an API, and uses the social network that makes the most sense for API developers.</p>

<p>In my quest to understand the possible <a title="future of web APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of Web APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m trying to understand the opportunities available for APIs when it comes to latest wave of mobile app builder platforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the most familiar with two leading platforms, <a title="CabanaApps" href="http://www.cabanaapp.com/">Cabana</a>&nbsp;and <a title="Tiggzi" href="http://www.tiggzi.com">Tiggzi</a>, but wanted to take a look at what else is out there.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m classifying as a mobile app builder platform, is a web-based platform (not something you have to download), that lets you build a mobile application and usually (but not always) without any development experienced.</p>
<p>There are a lot of sites that claim the ability to build mobile apps in minutes, but many of them clearly are spammy crap.  I tried to sort through as many as I could to come up with this short list of mobile app builder platforms:</p>

</table>
<p>Not all of these mobile app building platforms provide support for external APIs, the ones who do are clearly leaders in the space. &nbsp;Tiggzi and Cabana both provide powerful API support, while others offer modules, connectors that are canned API integration, without much customization from users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of these mobile builder platforms look pretty basic and are trying to capitalize on the needs of the masses wanting to deploy mobile applications. &nbsp;The mobile builder platforms that continue to add in API connectivity, especially with <a title="social and personal data APIs" href="http://www.singly.com">social and personal data APIs</a> will keep up.</p>
<p>I predict in 6 months, I'll come back to this post and 1/3 will be out of business, because they didn't build in API integration.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><em>This is a case study sent to me from National Instruments. &nbsp;I just had to post it as is, because it just shows the serious potential of APIs. &nbsp;If cloud computing and mobile hasn't convinced you that APIs are here to stay, take a look at what National Instruments is doing.</em></p>
<p>Over the past five years, <a title="National Instruments" href="http://www.ni.com/">National Instruments</a> (NI) has been using an API strategy to enable a developer ecosystem, based on their <a title="LabView" href="http://www.ni.com/labview/">LabVIEW software platform</a>. &nbsp;NI equips engineers and scientists with tools that accelerate productivity, innovation, and discovery &ndash; and a strong ecosystem is core to their philosophy. &nbsp;This case study takes a look at one approach, and the business role that APIs play in expanding into new markets. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />As background, NI LabVIEW is a productivity tool and graphical programming language used in all kinds of scientific applications. &nbsp;The breadth of users range from &ldquo;aspiring engineers&rdquo; who use a specialized version to program the Lego Mindstorms NXT software, to some of the world&rsquo;s top researchers who use LabVIEW to design complex systems including software for the CERN hadron collider and the SpaceX control center. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-1.png" alt="" width="576px;" height="267px;" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: &nbsp;LabVIEW is used from K through Rocket Science.</p>
<p>To understand why an API strategy was needed, first consider the standard use-case for LabVIEW. &nbsp;Most companies use LabVIEW as a productivity tool/IDE to develop applications using the default software stack provided by NI, and combining that software with measurement hardware. &nbsp;&nbsp;A common application is production testing of a consumer device, such as the <a href="http://sine.ni.com/cs/app/doc/p/id/cs-662">Xbox 360 controller from Microsoft</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW allows complete customization of an engineering application, just as is possible with any other programming language. &nbsp;The difference between a text-based language, and LabVIEW&rsquo;s graphical approach, that that the graphical approach is familiar to engineers who grow up drawing block diagrams of systems, and it makes connecting to real-world I/O very efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW also supports parallelism (multithreading), memory management, built-in analysis, control algorithms, and measurement routines which helps engineering firms build sophisticated applications more quickly. <br /><br />NI&rsquo;s core business model is to serve end-users directly, but the ability to scale through an open platform allows &ldquo;repeatability&rdquo;. &nbsp;In otherwords, through an API strategy, Company A in one specialized domain, can extend the NI platform or build a vertical product on top of it, such that Company B can leverage that. &nbsp;The software stack for 3rd party developers looks very similar to the stack for end-users, with the addition of APIs that enable product development. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-2.png" alt="" width="386px;" height="288px;" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: &nbsp;API Framework for LabVIEW</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been some very compelling use-cases that have arisen from the LabVIEW ecosystem, and over 100 certified products in total. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of three examples:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Robotics</strong> - ImagingLab GmbH, is a German company that has created LabVIEW toolkits to allow engineers to control industrial robots from leading manufacturers including DENSO, KUKA, Epson, Yaskawa, Mitsubishi, and more. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Big Data</strong> - Neural ID, a venture backed firm in the San Francisco bay area, has created a pattern recognition engine called CURE, to analyze unstructured data. &nbsp;This product sits on top of LabVIEW, and can recognize any kind of waveform and provide analytic capabilities to allow organizations to make better decisions about their data. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s used by companies like ecoATM and NASA. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing </strong>- Maintainable Software has developed a software-as-a-service product for use in electronics manufacturing test, for cloud-based data management.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their software is used by customers such as Coulomb Technologies, a leader in electric vehicle chargers.&nbsp; In addition, &nbsp;Maintainable Software has deep expertise in tools used to develop cloud infrastructure, and have published a technical book on the subject.&nbsp; Their product works on the latest tablet devices such as Apple iPads.</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>The companies listed above offer their respective products through NI&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ni.com/labviewtools/">LabVIEW Tools Network</a>, which is an appstore dedicated to engineers and scientists. <br /><br />In summary, an API strategy can enable 3rd party developers and tech companies to innovate on a mature software platform and expand it into new markets. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an approach that&rsquo;s not just limited to companies in the mobile or web space&ndash; it is equally as powerful in the B2B space in industries like test &amp; measurement, and embedded control. &nbsp;&nbsp;For a product like LabVIEW with a 25+ year history, an API strategy is one of the best ways to compliment in-house R&amp;D efforts with an ecosystem approach, and drive innovation in emerging areas like Robotics, Big Data, and Cloud.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/facebook/Facebook+Download+Your+Archive.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was just downloading all of my Facebook data.  You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download">go under your account settings and there is a little link</a> that lets you download everything. &nbsp;It takes some time to generate a full archive, but once my archive is ready, they&rsquo;ll email me and I can get at my data and see what the download format looks like.</p>
<p>While waiting, I wanted to see what Google had to offer.  Google has an amazing <a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard">acount management dashboard</a> which provides you access to your settings, some of the data, but Google is also working on their <a title="takeout service" href="https://www.google.com/takeout/">takeout service</a> which gives you downloads for individual services and across multiple services.</p>
<p>That is a pretty good start.  Two of my biggest networks allow me to download data. I wasn't so lucky with the next four:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter - No</li>
<li>Instagram - No</li>
<li>Foursquare - No</li>
<li>LinkedIn - Some (just your connections)</li>
</ul>
<p>I use all six of these services daily.  It bums me out that I can&rsquo;t get out my own data.  Of course all of these services have an API, which allows developers to get at my data, but even <a title="Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/IFTTT-My-Recipes.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I want access to a data store of all my <a title="Facebook" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a title="Google" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/gcontacts">Google</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a title="Instagram" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a> and <a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> data in a single location.  There are software available trying to solve this problem such as <a title="ThinkUp" href="http://thinkupapp.com/">ThinkUp</a> or <a title="The Locker Project" href="http://lockerproject.org/">The Locker Project</a>.  As with APIs, these solutions require you to be a developer. (I see ThinkUp has a cloud solution now)</p>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;m thinking about how to build an application using <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com">Singly</a>, one that allows me to pull posts, tweets, photos, friends and other vital personal data into a single store. &nbsp;I need to think it through.</p>
<p>Then I really start questioning the storage of all of my social data.  Do I really even want it all in one location?  Do I just want it in another location, a sort of plan B.  It really depends on the data.  I guess I have to think about each service and how I want the data replicated, moved, syndicated or otherwise. This is beginning to sound a lot like <a title="API Automation" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">API automation</a> to me and not just data liberation.</p>
<p>I hate ending a post, without wrapping up an idea properly. &nbsp;I'll just have to work out in another post, but then again that is why this is on my personal blog and not API Evangelist or API Voice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service/developer-rights.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>API terms of service (TOS) is one of the most critical, yet one of the most silent links for developers who are building apps and business on top of APIs.  Terms of service determine what you can or cannot do with an API, and often times developers do not understand these terms, leaving them vulnerable to some very negative outcomes.</p>
<p>Following in the footprints of a larger project, called &ldquo;<a title="Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="http://tos-dr.info/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a>&rdquo;, a group of us have gotten together,  and created &ldquo;<a title="API Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="http://api-tos-dr.info/">API Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>&rdquo;, which aims at creating a transparent and peer-reviewed process to rate and analyze API Terms of Service, to establishing a rating classification that all developers can understand.</p>
<p>To seed the process, we went out and reviewed a number of the popular API terms of service and identified seven categories that really affect developers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

<p>The goal is to rank each API using a classification ranging from A (good) to E (bad) in these seven areas, so developers can quickly understand where an API stands in the areas that are most important to them.</p>
<p>API Terms of Service Didn't Read, also known as API-ToS;DR, is a crowd-sourced effort and requires community involvement to be successful.  To get involved you can visit the <a href="http://api-tos-dr.info/">API-ToS;DR website</a>, join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-tosdr">working Google Group</a> or help by <a href="https://github.com/tiborvass/ToS-DR">pushing code in the Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>As APIs grow in popularity this problem is only going to get worse.  Terms of service is something I see several groups working to actively understand such as <a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Singly</a> with their personal data <a title="terminator project" href="https://github.com/quartzjer/Singly/tree/master/Terminator">terminator project</a>, and EFF with their <a title="TOSBack Project" href="http://www.tosback.org/timeline.php">TOSBack project</a>.</p>
<p>Over the coming months I&rsquo;d like to help focus all this energy into <a title="API Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/84544713/apitos/index.html">API Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>, providing a plain english rating system that all developers can use when navigating the often treacherous landscape of API development.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get excited about the potential here.  With almost 20 departments and agencies on board, and 166 APIs planned--there is a lot of potential for the other 226 departments and agencies to see the potential and get on board.</p>
<p>This list of systems are generated programmatically using each department or agencies machine readable digital strategy.  I didn't have to compile this by hand, which shows the potential of the digital strategy to become a federal API discovery platform. &nbsp;You can view the <a title="real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy" href="/federal_government_digital_strategy_systems.php">real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy</a>, which gets updated every night when I run my monitoring script.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/08/29/efficient-social-api-development-with-singly/">Efficient Social API Development with Singly</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Personal-Data-Explorer.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Last week I announced that <a title="API Evangelist and Singly Were Partnering" href="/2012/08/20/api-evangelist-partners-up-with-singly-to-evolve-the-social-and-personal-api-space/">API Evangelist and Singly were partnering</a>, and while I&rsquo;m helping Singly with their API Evangelism strategy and they are providing me with some vital data on some of the most important APIs in the industry and how developers are using them--I&rsquo;m fascinated by the Singly unified API model and how it can simplify developing apps that use social and personal data.</p>
<p>As I do with any API, I sign up for an account, come up with an idea for a prototype, start hacking, then get to work telling the story of the process.  To get started using Singly, I wanted to build a simply social data explorer that would help me understand how the platform works, but also give me a simple example for explaining to other developers.</p>
<p>Before diving in, let me start with the basics.  What is <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com" target="_blank">Singly</a>?</p>
<blockquote>Singly is a <a title="unified API interface for accessing social and personal data" href="https://singly.com">unified API interface for accessing social and personal data</a> from the top API platforms. Singly has built an API on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other API platforms.  Simplified the authentication, objects and API endpoints into a unified API, allowing you to access multiple APIs through a single, simpler API interface, drastically improving the time you have to spend developing social features in your web and mobile apps.</blockquote>
<p>For this project I focused on the top social network APIs: <a title="Facebook" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a>, <a title="Github" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/github">Github</a>, <a title="Instagram" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="Twitter" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>.  Ok, for many Github isn&rsquo;t a social network.  It&rsquo;s something just  geeks use, but to us, it is a social network.  Anyways, let&rsquo;s start building my social data exploration prototype.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="120" align="right" /></p>
<p>First, I <a title="signed up for Singly which was instant using my Github login" href="/2012/07/18/let-developers-register-for-your-api-with-their-github-profile/">signed up for Singly using my Github login</a>.  Once signed up, I added my first Singly application, which allows me to generate application specific Singly keys, which features I will use, and provides a single interface to store and manage that access for each social network that I will be using.  When adding a new app, it takes some time to setup, and create an app definition in all 6 social networks and add keys to my Singly app, but once you are all done, all you have to worry about is a single Singly key--Singly takes care of the rest.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-App-Management.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Now I have a single API for accessing all six social APIs.  Singly provides consistent endpoints across these services:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/facebook</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/foursquare</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/github</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/instagram</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/linkedin</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the objects you can work with across all of them aren&rsquo;t the same, as they can be very different services, but the patterns are consistent and Singly standardizes the authentication and objects as much as possible across all APIs.</p>
<p>The first authentication and code library for Facebook took me about 10 minutes.  Then after that I was able to reuse my code and had all five other services up and running in another 10 minutes.</p>
<p>How you use social data in your web and mobile applications will vary, but the unified API approach offered by Singly is taking API development to a new level.  Using Singly I don&rsquo;t think of terms of single APIs and how I have to approach each integration--I can now think of building social features into my applications across multiple APIs in a very seamless and efficient way.</p>
<p>I will be exploring this same approach, using the other blogging, productivity and quantified self services Singly offers.  I just wanted to get started with the social APIs, and begin wrapping my head around more efficient API development using a unified API like Singly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/mobile-backend-as-a-service/Mobile+Backend+as+a+Service.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I did a <a title="roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers" href="/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers</a> last week, which brought in a couple recommendations of other companies I should include, and some interesting feedback on how APIs can be integrated with MBaaS platforms.</p>
<p>A very interesting comment left on the post was about MBaaS vendor lock-in:</p>
<blockquote><em>The big problem, IMHO, using a BaaS provider is the so called "vendor lock in". What if my backend provider changes the pricing models, or dismisses the service and go out of the business? </em></blockquote>
<p>To address this issue, the commenter said they are building an open source MBaaS platform, which anyone will be able to download and install on the server or cloud platform of their choice.</p>
<p>Just like with the recent addition of an <a title="open source api management platform" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/19/the-100-open-source-api-platform-i-was-looking-for/">open source API management platform</a>, I think an open source Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) would benefit the space tremendously.</p>
<p>The new open source MBaaS is called BaaSBox, and is in early development.  I found a <a href="https://twitter.com/baasbox">Twitter account</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/BaasBox">Facebook page</a>, which I'll pay attention to for updates.</p>
<p>While many of the MBaaS providers are catering to the most common needs of mobile application developers, I can envision an open source MBaaS platform opening up entirely new niche offerings that could provide developers with ready to go platforms for developing, deploying and managing very specialized mobile applications, without "vendor lock-in". &nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to hear your thoughts on MBaaS vendor lock-in and whether an open source version is necessary.</p>

</table>
<p>This number of providers really shows a fast growing market of back-end tools to help developers rapidly build mobile applications.  Most of these service providers focus on common use cases like data storage, push notifications and social integration.  As these platforms mature it makes sense that will need to start offering more specialized resources.</p>
<p>While developers can go straight to API service providers on their own, since MBaaS providers are in the business of simplifying development for mobile application builders, it makes a lot of sense for them to start bundling common resources available via social, photo, productivity APIs and location data APIs.</p>

<p>I always start by establishing potential 10K foot target areas that I will focusing on in my research.  While these may vary from industry to industry, my starting list is:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Individuals</strong> - Who are the key individual influencers in your target landscape</li>
<li><strong>Competitors</strong> - Know your competitors, you can learn a lot from what they do right or they do wrong</li>
<li><strong>Platforms</strong> - There are an endless amount of platforms that may benefit your company, such as Drupal, Wordpress and Salesforce</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Who are the relevant media and blogs you should be following and engaging with</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong> - Existing partners who you should be in tune with on the landscape</li>
</ul>
<p>After tackling these areas and identifying who the players are, you will identify other areas that are unique to your API evangelism efforts, so don't stress over whether you have the right areas in the first week.  While researching these areas of my landscape I try to identify specific channels for getting plugged in with landscape targets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Website URL</strong> - What is the targets root URL for their website</li>
<li><strong>Blog URL</strong> - What is the blog for a target</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS</strong> - Secondary to the blog, what is the RSS feed so I can programmatically monitor</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - What is a companies or individuals Twitter handle</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Identify and sometimes connect with a target&rsquo;s LinkedIn account</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Identify and sometimes connect with a target&rsquo;s Facebook account</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Identify, follow and engage with a companies Github profile and appropriate repositories</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-bird-blue-on-white.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>After getting the primary channels for each target on my landscape identified, I will go deeper sometimes and actually identify key individuals associated with target companies, either the founders and / or key employees. I look for Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Github for individuals as well, and sometimes even personal blogs when available.</p>
<p>While landscape analysis is an initial project in the first couple weeks of designing your API evangelism strategy, it will be ongoing iniative, in monitoring all target channels in real-time, but also identifying new target groups, companies and individuals or even specific channels not listed above like Tumblr or Google+ each week.</p>
<p>Each industry will be different when identifying the landscape for your API evangelism efforts, but this is a good first round blueprint and has worked well for me on multiple projects.  Let me know if there are any landscape analysis and monitoring tricks you use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing lots of research into the <a title="future of web APIs" href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a> lately, and one area that is definitely gaining more traction is the ability to automate tasks, by defining triggers and actions on top of web APIs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve heard about API automation, it&rsquo;s probably due to the attention <a title="If This Then That" href="http://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> and <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> have been getting.  While these are two of the most popular platforms currently, I wanted to dive in and understand the entire landscape.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;ve found 8 API automation platforms:</p>

<p>API automation platforms provide a new way for developers and non-developers to put API resources to use for business or personal tasks.  These automation platforms provide a new opportunity for companies looking to deploy APIs, providing additional channels for distribution and user acquisition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been running a monitoring script every night, so that I could tell when any of the federal department and agency have launched their digital strategy pages, per <a title="Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API</a>, and the White House CIO's strategy, entitled "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>"</p>
<p>I noticed that many of the departments and agencies aren&rsquo;t properly using HTTP response codes, and when I pulled pages, I often get 302 redirects to 404 pages, so I tended to treat 301, 302, 500 as 404&rsquo;s.  Today, I noticed that some of them actually were redirecting to their digital strategies, published at alternate locations, other than directed by the White House strategy, which was [domain]/digitalstrategy.</p>
<p>Recognizing this I put in some logic to handle redirects and check if it was a valid strategy page, and after re-running the script I found 11 more digital strategies published, bringing the total to 14 to date:</p>

<p>With 246 federal departments and agencies, we have a long way to go, but I&rsquo;m optimistic that we&rsquo;ll see enough publish their strategies, identify enough high value data-sets to deploy as APIs, so that the developer community can get to work building some important web and mobile apps or data visualizations.</p>
<p>Once the other departments and agencies see what is possible, hopefully we can get more of them on board, creating somewhat of a domino effect for API deployment, getting us closer to a reality where machine readable data is as common as the PDF in Washington DC.</p>

<p>The world around us is being redefined and a new currency is taking shape.  Tweets on <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, wall posts to <a title="Facebook" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, pictures on <a title="Instagram" href="http://instagram.com">Instagram</a>, files on <a title="Dropbox" href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and health data via <a href="http://fitbit.com">Fitbit</a> are emblematic of the emerging API-driven economy.</p>
<p>This data isn&rsquo;t just social, nor just a currency. It is vital personal data that contains details from intimate aspects of our daily lives.  Platform players like Facebook and Twitter have shown through their APIs the possibilities that emerge when developers can build, unfettered with their own creativity on top of this data -- enriching people&rsquo;s lives in a richer, more connected way.</p>
<p>With the number of social and personal data APIs available today, it is getting increasingly difficult for developers to keep up to speed on which platforms are most important to their end users, the technical differences between each platform&rsquo;s APIs and where to keep up with the changes from each platform as they are rolled out.</p>
<p>Even with all this confusion, there is help:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a></strong> delivers news about the business of APIs and best practices for API owners, politics around API management and developers rights, in hopes of providing insight into which APIs are delivering the most value for the API space and application developers</li>
<li><strong><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com">Singly</a></strong> provides a single API with which developers can build against multiple social and personal data API platforms using a single authentication model, standardized endpoints, a common object model and a whole host of solutions for challenging infrastructure issues that data intensive applications face</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe the industry needs more leadership and content and we have partnered up to deliver:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Real-time news, changes and updates about top social and personal data platforms Information about the business of APIs and best practices from direct experience with top social and personal data APIs</li>
<li>Technical details from daily monitoring and integration with top social and personal APIs Politics and legal issues around personal and social data, how this impacts end users, API owners and developers</li>
<li>Data about how developers access and use social and personal data in their applications A larger voice for developers in a space, where currently API owners dominate the conversation Education, access and greater awareness to end users of their personal and social data Assistance for API owners to better reach and leverage the API developer community</li>
</ul>
<p>In spending time with Jason Cavnar (<a title="@jasoncavnar" href="https://twitter.com/jasoncavnar">@jasoncavnar</a>), Jeremie Miller (<a title="@jeremie" href="https://twitter.com/jeremie">@jeremie</a>) and the Singly team, it&rsquo;s clear they have a very valuable and unique perspective when it comes to API consumption and the future of personal data -- not only for consumers and developers but also that will benefit the platforms themselves. Every day they are monitoring and consuming the personal and social data flowing through the most important APIs in the space and I can&rsquo;t wait to tell the stories of their journey and share their insights along the way. Keep an eye out for these stories in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>It will be <a title="3 months since the White House CiO Steven VanRoekel released a federal API strategy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">3 months since the White House CiO Steven VanRoekel released a federal API strategy</a>, entitled "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>", part of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a>, directing all federal departments and agencies to make open data, content and web APIs the new default.</p>
<p>This Thursday, August 23rd 2012 will be the first major milestone for departments and agencies, where they should have met two goals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>2.1 - </strong>Engage with customers to identify at least two existing major customer-facing services that contain high-value data or content as first-move candidates to make compliant with new open data, content, and web API policy</li>
<li><strong>7.1 - </strong>Engage with customers to identify at least two existing priority customer-facing services to optimize for mobile use</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a title="monitoring 246 departments and agencies" href="/federal_government.php">monitoring 246 departments and agencies</a> and so far three have released drafts of their strategy:</p>

<p>While the Department of Commerce and Department of Education have only published paragraphs discussing how they are engaging with users, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has identified three datasets for the web API portion and two optimized for mobile use.  All three have published their digital strategy in HTML, XML and JSON formats, meeting the requirements of "machine readable by default".</p>
<p>I anticipate we&rsquo;ll see many more agencies releasing their digital strategies this week, but there is no way to tell how many agencies will be able to get on board with the CIO&rsquo;s strategy in time.  No matter what, the next 3 months will be critical time for APIs in Washington DC, not just because of the presidential election, but the end of November will be the next milestone where agencies are expected to have established an agency-wide governance structure for developing  and delivering digital services via web APIs.</p>
