<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">I wrote a post the other day laying out what I'd consider a minimum viable footprint for API operations</a>. My vision of just exactly what an API is, has gone beyond just the technical, ever since I started API Evangelist back in July of 2010. Early on I saw this was more than just about the API endpoints, and documentation, code samples, and many other building blocks were essential to the success (or failure) of any API platform, area, or ecosystem.</p>
<p>This recent post was an attempt, here in 2015, to quantify what I would consider to be a minimum definition for API operation. After writing it I wanted to take another stab at actually creating a portal, that would stand up to the API rhetoric that I regularly produce. What better place to start,<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/"> than my own personal master API stack</a>, where I am&nbsp;working to get control over my own infrastructure. Once I got a version 1.0 definition, I forked it, and setup a default API portal that I am calling my <a href="http://api-portal.apievangelist.com">demo APIs.json driven portal.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane/master">I have published to Github</a>, a version of my minimum API footprint, which I'm <a href="http://apisjson.org/">using APIs.json an engine</a>. After looking at 10,000K+ APIs, I have a pretty good idea of what I like to see. <a href="http://api-portal.apievangelist.com/">This is my interpretation of all that monitoring of the space--a distillation of what I've seen while reviewing APIs</a>. It isn't perfect, but neither is the space that we have, and my portal is just an attempt at quantifying what I'm seeing.</p>
<p>I'm going to create a minimum viable Internet of Things (IoT) version of this portal as well, and use APIs.json to deploy different interpretations of what constitutes a minimum viable API presence. If you have anything you'd like to see in my base template, let me know. If you want to fork and add to, then submit a pull request, even better. I'm just playing around, but also looking to establish a suite of APIs.json driven tools, that help me(and you), better understand the API space.</p>
<p>To help on-board you with my vision, I also added a walk-through for when you land on the site. Something I will be adding to when I have time.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/carvoyant/carvoyant-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm very fortunate to be the API Evangelist, as I get to spend my days discussing, some very lofty ideas, with extremely smart and entrepreneurial folks from across many different business sectors. An ongoing conversation I have going on with Bret Tobey (<a href="https://twitter.com/batobey">@batobey</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/">Carvoyant</a>, is around the big data generated around the Internet of Things. Many companies that I engage with are very closed about their big data operations, where Carvoyant is the opposite, they want to openly discuss, and figure it out as a community, out in the open--something I fully support.</p>
<p>In reality, the Internet of Things (IoT) is less about devices, than it is about the data that is produced. If someone is exclusively focusing on the device as part of their pitch, it is mostly likely they are trying to distract you from the data being generated, because they are looking to monetize the IoT data exhaust for themselves. Carvoyant is keen on discussing the realities of IoT data exhaust, and not just from Internet connected automobile perspective, but also the wider world of Internet connected devices. If you want to join in the discussion, of course you can comment on this blog, and via Twitter, but <a href="http://gluecon.com/announcing-the-apistrat-un-workshops/">you can also come to Gluecon in May, where 3Scale, API Evangelist, and Carvoyant will be conducting an IoT big data workshop</a>, on this topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carvoyant.com">If you aren't familiar with Carvoyant, they are an API-driven device that you can connect to your vehicle, if it was manufactured after 1996, and access the volumes of data being produced each day</a>. Carvoyant's tag line says "Your Car, Your Data, Your API" -- I like that. This is why I enjoy talking through their strategy, because they see the world of APIs, connected devices, and big data the way I do. Sure there is lots of opportunity for platforms, and developers to make money in all of this, but if there is user generated content and data involved, the end-users should also have a stake in the action--I do not care how good your business idea is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carvoyant does a great job of acknowledging that the car is center to our existence, and the data generated around our vehicles is potentially very valuable, but it is also a very personal thing, even when anonymized. Here is how they put it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Connected car data tells the repair industry when a vehicle needs service &ndash; the moment it happens. &nbsp;Connected car data tells an insurer how a driver actually drives and if they are eligible for a better priced policy. &nbsp;Connected car data tells gas stations if a vehicle is low on gas. &nbsp;If a vehicle has not been to the grocery store for a while, than it may be time to make an offer.</em></p>
<p>The difference in this conversation, is Carvoyant isn't just making this pitch to investors, the automobile industry, and developers, they are making it to the automobile owners as well. They are working to establish best practices for gathering, accessing, storing, and making sense of Internet of Things data exhaust, in a way that keeps the end-users interests in mind. Every platform should think this way. There is too much exploitation going on around user-generated data, and Carvoyants vision is important.</p>
<p><strong>Monetization Via Classic Affiliate Program</strong><br />When it comes to figuring out a healthy monetization strategy for the Carvoyant platform, and resulting data, the company is starting with a familiar concept, the affiliate program. Establishing potential referral networks, where end-consumers, and developers of apps can refer potential customers to businesses, and when there is a successful sale, an affiliate commisison is paid out. This is a great place to start, because it is a concept that businesses, developers, and consumers will understand and be able to operate within, without changing much on the ground behavior.</p>
<p>If you identify a customer in need of vehicle servicing, and successfully refer them to a local service center, you can be paid money for making the connection, something that when done right could also be applied to the end-user in form of credits, discounts, and other loyalty opportunities. An affiliate approach to the monetization of data via the Carvoyant API makes for an easy sell, but one that can be applied to a myriad of business sectors ranging from automobile services to food, shopping, travel, and much, much more. While an affiliate base is being established, Carvoyant can also begin to look towards the future, and shifting behavior.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-highway-open.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Monetization Beyond Affiliate</strong><br />While I'm fine with Carvoyant kicking off their monetization strategy with a calssic affiliate program, I feel pretty strongly there are many other opportunities for monetization, something that Bret agrees too. When you think about the central role cars play in our lives, the opportunities for inciting meaningful experiences, are endless. While the real money is probably around the mundane realities of the average car owner, the chances for serendipity, beyond these known areas is the exciting aspect. How do you not just help users find the best time to get their oil changed, but also take that side street, instead of freeway that might involve a chance experience that could range from dinner, to concert, or just find that right sunset location.</p>
<p>There is a pretty clear conversion event involved with the affiliate model. A user clicks on just the right deal, a sale is made, and revenue is kicked back from the business to the platform, developer, and is something that hopefully reaches the end-user in meaningful way. What other types of "conversion events" (man I hate that phrase) can we identify in car culture. How do we encourage people to take public transit, share vehicles, or how do we make large fleets operate more in harmony? With the right platform, I think we can quickly go beyond the traditional affiliate transaction, and develop a new wave of monetization around IoT data, that goes beyond just eyeballs, and links, and is more about engagement and true experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Experience Credits Not Just Sales&nbsp;<br /></strong>Just like moving beyond the affiliate conversion event, I think we can go beyond the transaction also being currency or sale based. How do we create a more experience based currency or credit system that can be used equally to help businesses generate sales, and establish loyalty with customers, but also allow developers and end-consumers to exchange units of value, attached to valuable automobile data? If a $20.00 deal on a $30.00 oil change, results in a $2.00 affiliate revenue share, what would the value of pulling off the freeway, taking the side road and catching just the right sunset picture be worth? How do we incentivize experiences, not just sales? If we are continuing to weave data generated from our physical worlds, it cannot always be about money, there has to be other value generated, that will keep end-users engaged in valuable, yet meaningful ways.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Economy</strong><br />As our worlds continue to change, partially because of technology, but also because of other environmental and societal pressures, what value, sales, and experiences can be generated from the data exhaust produced as part of the sharing economy? If its our car, our data, and our API--does this apply when it involves our ZipCar usage, rental car, or possibly Uber? How does the sharing economy impact data generated via connected cars. When the end-user is the center of the conversations, these alternate use cases have to be included, and make sure privacy is protected, but also opportunities around that data to be securely shared with users. This isn't just a shared automobile data conversation, it is potentially applicable to any other objects we rent and share like tools, equipment, supplies, and anything else we may use as part of our business and personal lives.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Fleets<br /></strong>Just like the data exhaust from personally owned vehicles, or automobiles used as part of the sharing economy, the opportunities, and patterns available for commercial fleets will look very different. How do we incentivize efficiency, cost savings, and safety in fleet operations? What do the affiliate deals, and experiences look like for fleet vehicle drives, and the companies that own and manage them. Think of the implications of big data exhaust from vehicles in heavily regulated industries, and public service entities like police, and fire. We will also have to think very differently about how revenue is generated and shared, as well as look at privacy and security very differently. This doesn't reduce the opportunity in the area of fleet management, it just needs a significantly different conversation about what we need for this class of automobile.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Common Blueprints&nbsp;<br /></strong>Beyond the individual conversion events for individual drives, or the wider opportunities for sharing economy companies, and commercial fleet operators, where are the opportunities around identifying common patterns of vehicle usage at scale? How does the vehicle usage of the LAPD differ from NYPD? What does the average residential vehicle owner in San Diego look like, versus the rental car tourist for San Diego? Using connected vehicle technology like Carvoyant opens up a huge opportunity for better understanding car culture at a macro level, beyond what the auto industry, or maybe Department of Transportation sees. How do we begin having honest conversations about our vehicle usage, and allow drivers to be educated about larger studies, allowing them as a company or individual to opt in, and share data, to participate in larger studies? We have to make sure and consider the bigger opportunities for understanding beyond any single endpoint on the connected car network, and look at entire cities, states, countries, and other meaningful demographics.</p>

<p><strong>Lots More To Discuss, Something That Needs Transparency<br /></strong>This is just the beginning of these types of discussions. I have a handful of companies, like https://www.carvoyant.com, who have access to huge volumes of extremely valuable user-generated data, who are trying to figure out how to developer useful tech, make money, all while doing it in a healthy way that protects end-users privacy and security. I am not opposed to companies making money off their API platforms, and user generated data, I just insist that APIs always be used to make it more transparent, and technology such as oAuth employed to give end-users more control, and a vote in how their data is collected, stored, shared.</p>
<p>This post is about me working through my last conversation with Bret, and hopefully will result in several more stories here on the blog. <a href="http://gluecon.com/announcing-the-apistrat-un-workshops/">I also want to prime the pump for the APIStrat IoT Big Data Workshop at Gluecon in May, and make sure my readers are aware the workshop will be happening, and if you want to join in the conversation</a>. This is just one of many posts you'll see from me discussing the big data exhaust generated from Internet connected devices, but also the potential for transparency and healthier platform operations when APIs and oAuth are employed. These types conversations are only going to become more critical as more of our physical worlds are connected to the Internet.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hurdles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading&nbsp;<a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2015/04/15/obama-administration-agrees-with-sunlight-agencies-should-disclose-what-data-they-keep-private/">Obama administration agrees with Sunlight: Agencies should disclose what data they keep private</a>, which is a topic I follow closely, as I'm passionate about government opening up their data inventory, but also because worked as a Presidential Innovation Fellow on helping agencies open up their data. I completely agree that agencies should have to disclose lists of even their private enterprise data repository, to help establish a clear picture of just exactly what is public or private government data.</p>
<p>While reading the post, I noticed the statement that, <em>"most agencies seem to have accepted and understood the need for this change, but some concerns have been voiced"</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Commerce, which holds a very sizable amount of data, has cited &ldquo;certain technological issues that are creating major barriers to creating the PDL as described [in OMB&rsquo;s guidance].&rdquo; This is a concern, but Commerce appears to be working through these issues with relevant officials in the General Services Administration and OMB.</li>
<li>NASA has expressed significant concerns with the new process, specifically citing pushback and time constraints from its FOIA office and legal team. They claim that &ldquo;identifying and indexing our open data is our priority,&rdquo; and indexing its non-public data will take valuable capacity away. Fortunately, NASA has bought into the public process and are engaged in meaningful conversation about the agency's concerns on the Project Open Data Github.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting that agencies cite the technology challenges in complying with open data mandates. In my experience working on opening up government data, right after the education of the average government employee, challenges imposed by the technology they use is one of the biggest hurdles. To make my point, you can't find "Export Spreadsheet to JSON" as a Microsoft Excel option. Most systems encourage the output of PDFs from core systems, which when it is combined with lack of open data export capabilities, makes opening up of inventories extra work.</p>
<p>We need to continue the hard work to educate the average government employee about open data principles, and the little things they can do in their daily work, to help collectively move their agency towards being more open, and machine readable by default. However, we also need to push harder on software vendors, who are providing technological solutions to make sure the imports and exports of data in open, machine readable formats is a default feature. There also needs to be more mandatory API language in procurement contracts, requring APIs to be baked in by default in all government systems--should never be an afterthought.</p>
<p>There is only so much responsibility that we can place on the average government employee, trying to get their job done on a daily basis. All of the companies who are profiting off selling the government software solutions, also need to share in the responsibility, and help make sure our government is equipped with the proper tools. Government being open and machine readable by default shouldn't create extra work for agencies, it should help reduce their workload.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://withknown.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/known/known-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I see a lot of software come and go. I adopt applications, tools, and online services for a variety of reasons, with some of these tools remaining a regular part my operations, with others coming and going with time. I'm currently abandoning Evernote, in favor of my own home brew note tool, while I'm also adopting a handful of new <a href="https://luckymarmot.com/paw">HTTP Client tools like Paw</a>. There are a number of reasons these tools go away, sometimes the reason I needed them shifts, other times they evolve to a point where they are no longer useful to me, and other times they go away after an acquisition, or running out of money, and not being able to keep the lights on. In the end, when i find tools I believe in, and deeply integrate them into my life, and want to better understand how I can help ensure they will be successful.</p>
<p>One tool that I am using as part of my daily operations is <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a>. If you are unfamiliar,&nbsp;Known it is a simple, social publishing platform for your blog or website. I'm am personally invested in helping the Known founders find the customers they need to be successful, and as part of this effort I wanted to practice explaining Known to my readers, while I also expand my own understanding of the role Known can play in my own operations.</p>
<p><strong>Reclaim Your Domain</strong><br />For me, Known is about reclaiming my domain. Rather than posting tweets to Twitter, I post to Known, and using the Twitter API, Known publishes a copy of the Tweet to Twitter. I maintain the original copy of my Tweet. When I write a wall post I can publish to LinkedIn, as well as Facebook, with the original content staying in Known. <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">This is all about POSSE for me, which is&nbsp;Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</a>. As a professional who operates in online world, it is extremely important to me to retain ownership over my content, and intellectual exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>Managing My Life Bits</strong><br />Known allows me to manage a significant portion of my life bits, which include simple status updates, posts, photos, bookmarks, and audio, then provides me with a handful of connected services like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and SoundCloud which I can then syndicate these life bits to. The important piece of this for me, is thinking about my life bits, independent of the services I use to publish and manage or publish these life bits. Employing a POSSE approach allows me to decouple these valuable life bits, and manage them in a central location, which helps me achieve my goal of keeping control my digital exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>Syndication Channels</strong><br />The cloud version of Known offers a handful of common channels for me to syndicate my life bits to, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Foursquare, and SoundCloud. I'm not a big Foursquare user anymore, but I'm still active on all the other channels, and Known provides me a simple interface for managing syndication to these channels. &nbsp;The cloud version of Known is a great start for any individual, or organization looking to get a handle on their basic</p>
<p><strong>Public or Private Page</strong><br />Beyond the whole syndication aspect, Known provides an important aggregation, and centralization feature for me, by providing a single public, or private page (if I decide), where I can find all of my syndicated Known content. Since most of my presence is public, <a href="https://kinlane.withknown.com/">I keep it open as a single, public place where you can find all of the content I syndicate across Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn</a>. With a simple keyword search available, the platform provides a valuable resource that I am increasingly using to re-discover content across my network.</p>
<p><strong>Plugins and Webhooks</strong><br />Where Known really starts to get exciting for me, is when it comes to the extensibility via plugins and webhooks. First I can create simple webhooks for syndicating out my life bits to custom channels of my choosing. It is easy for me to setup custom webhooks, that can handle various syndication scenarios for me. After that I can create plugins, something I haven't done yet, so I can't speak intelligently about. I am working to carve out time to setup my own custom Known installation, and craft my first API driven plugin. I envision this as the gateway to not just syndicating to other public channels, but also to custom, private channels that I define.</p>
<p><strong>API Driven Known Targets</strong><br />The default syndication channels that Known provides, coupled with the opportunities the plugins and webhooks introduce, open up an endless amount of POSSE scenarios for me. I envision an entire API stack deployed to support various types of Known installations. I'd like to see API driven docker containers that can auto deploy with a push of a button to provide additional syndication channels for Known. Once you have a POSSE approach established with Known, defining new API driven channels that you can take advantage of, brokering further sydnication, transformation, and storage of all of my personal and business life bits, become much easier envision.</p>

<p><strong>Who Could Put Known To Work?</strong><br />This is where I need to work through some of my initial thoughts about Known, and push things to new levels. Known makes sense to me when it comes to reclaiming control over my content, while also giving me a single doorway to create additional channels for syndication and publishing, beyond the Twitter, and Facebook I am already working with. However when it comes to other folks who aren't familiar with reclaim, or POSSE principles, it becomes challenging to explain how it can be put to work.</p>
<p>First, I want to disconnect Known being a tool for individuals. Known can bring together any online channels used by an individual, organization, business, event, or any other entity you can think of, that would possibly have an online presence. What are some of the possibilities for putting Known to work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Businesses</strong> - To manage a centralized social media, blogging, and other online presence for a small to large business.</li>
<li><strong>Churches</strong> - Provide a central place for church groups to manage their online presence, from an interface everyone can use.</li>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong> - Give the local library a single way to control messaging online, and engage with constituents via a single&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Museums</strong> - Perfect for museum collections to manage the communication and messaging around exhibits that have online presence.</li>
<li><strong>Schools</strong> - Known has already made inroads into schools, perfect for overall institutions, as well as departments, classes, or individual projects.</li>
<li><strong>Public Space -</strong> Parks, dog parks, open space, and other public space often have a social media, and messaging presence, where Known can be put to work.</li>
<li><strong>Farmers Market -</strong> A farmers market needs an active presence to stay engage with constituents, and known can be used to control, and centralize messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Neighborhoods</strong> - Bringing it down to the hyper-local level, allowing people to work together and manage the messaging and communication within a neighborhood.</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong> - Providing a common platform for government agencies to work together on projects, as well as manage digital strategies for any size of agency.</li>
<li><strong>Group Projects </strong>- I can think of a number of other project scenarios that have an online presence ranging from open source projects, to public / private sector partnerships that could use Known.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a start, when it comes to the potential uses of Known. I'll keep working on them, and post individual stories that help people see the ways they can put Known to work. I see the platform providing a free, low cost, asw well as a privately hosted solution that individuals and organizations can use to get a handle on their content and digital presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the toughest part of the Known proposition, is quantifying the endless scenarios of where it can be applied. In my opinion this is the potential, while also a significant challenge for the platform.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Explain What Known Is?</strong><br />One of the biggest problems with concepts like Reclaim Your Domain, and POSSE is the average Joe or Jane citizen could often care less about these concepts, that is until you find a relevant context, tha is important for them--which is why I'm writing this post. If you are a photographer, you are going to care about your photos more, and think more critically about where and how you publish. If you are a writer, or creative professional, keeping track of your work, ideas, and intellectual exhaust should be important, but for many other people, businesses, and organizations, this is just not relevant or prominent in their existence.</p>
<p>Known is not a social media management tool, even thought it possesses many of the same characteristics. It is more about staying in control of content across all of your digital channels, in an easily extensible way. The trick is to help people see the potential, encourage enough developer to develop plugins, and craft valuable webhooks, so that individuals, businesses, organizations, institutions, and government agencies find it immediately useful. In a regular start-up, the focus would be on the most lucrative targets, like within the enterprise, but I'd like to see Known find an audience within some lucrative circles, as well as in the long tail of use, serving those who can't afford costly solutions, but could be providing a valuable community service.</p>
<p>The trick is going to be helping everyone understand the wide, API driven of potential, to the point where they will pay for a pro service, and help keep the platform thriving. Not everyone is moved by the important reclaim and POSSE concepts, but could really benefit from the easy of use, centralization, and management of their presence across the increasing number of platforms we are publishing to across any number of industries.</p>
<p><strong>Where Would I Pay For Known?</strong><br />I have upgraded my Known account to the pro version. It is important to me that I support them, and I use the tool every day so it is worth me paying for the service. Beyond that I'd be into paying for premium services, the ability to publish links, stories, and other items to specialty channels. Think event or blog syndication, or possibly tapping interesting transformation services that I can apply to my audio notes, podcasts, or other life bits. (translation, transcription, etc)</p>
<p>I also imagine in the future there being premium plugins that I can discover, and add to my Known projects with a push of a button. I'd be happy to pay developers a premium for these bells and whistles, something that Known could definitely take a cut of. Once I get more comfortable with plugin development, and the potential for API driven channels, I'm sure I'll have more ideas about areas I'd cough up cash for, within the Known ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>POSSE In Addition To Reciprocity</strong><br />I am increasingly using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, as what I call a reciprocity service. I use it to move valuable information between the cloud service I depend on. Countries establish reciprocity agreements for trade, Zapier gives me tools for managing trade between the digital spaces I operate between. Known adds a POSSE layer to my digital operations, where Zapier allows me to move things around, Known allows me to publish once, an syndicate wherever I need to. While I could hand code all of this myself, these services allow me to do it in a simple, extensible way, that saves me a lot of time and resources.</p>
<p><strong>An Open Source Solution</strong><br />In 2015, it is getting increasingly rare for me to adopt a new tool or service, if there isn't an open source aspect to it. Most of the time I end up depending on cloud services instead of the open source edition, but having the option to migrate my own platform, or help deploy customized solutions using open source version is important. In my opinion open source, software as a service, and APIs all work together in creating a winning business model, something Known is taking full advantage of.</p>
<p><strong>The Known Team</strong><br />Another important factor in all of this for me, is the Known team. I believe in&nbsp;Ben Werdmuller and Erin Jo Richey, the Known founders. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/07/22/reclaim-your-domain-hackathon/">I've spent enough time with both of them at the Reclaim Your Domain events we have organized to get to know them</a>&nbsp;well. They don't just have the skills, they have the vision, and a healthy view of how the Internet should work.&nbsp;Ben believes that technology is an empowering force that makes the world better by leveling playing fields, informing citizens, and connecting us all, and with a background in cognitive science, Erin loves creating engaging, human-centric software within the context of sustainable businesses. #win #win</p>
<p><strong>The Known Mission</strong><br />Known is a start-up, but it has a larger mission, to help empower people through simple, standards-based, open source software, which also has free, and low cost cloud services for those without the resources to deploy all of it on their own. This type of approach to software is the future in my opinion. It is not just the open source software, in conjunction with a free and paid cloud model, it is also the embracing of APis as a distribution channel--this API-centric focus is why I believe in Known.</p>
<p><strong>Making Sure We can Have Simple, Powerful API Driven Tools Like Known</strong><br />I am writing this post, first to help me better understand, and articulate the potential of Known. I've been using for over a month now, and it is proving to be very useful in managing the daily syndication of content across my primary channels. I'm working to better understand the potential for webhooks and plugins, and extend it to better meet my own operational needs. Along the way I want to better understand how to on-board other people with the concept, whether they are into the reclaim or POSSE concepts, or just looking to get a better handle on the their social media.</p>
<p>Along the way I am going to tell stories about how I am using Known, in hopes of helping people learn how they can put it to work as well. Services like Known, are good for the API industry, and I want to see it succeed, so in addition to helping the platform find new users, I also want to help encourage the development of API driven plugins, and webhooks that can be employed via Known. I can see Known becoming an essential building block like I've identified Zapier as, I think it could become that important for API providers to consider offering a plugin for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also important for me to help Known find success using its simple, pro business model, and potentially find future revenue opportunities, that help keep the lights on, but also don't change the platform in ways that take it down the wrong path. I trust Ben and Erin to make the right technological, and business decisions, what worries me is that people won't see the potential, and the importance of API, standards driven tools like Known, that help us take control of our digital personas. It often seems in this crazy tech driven world that the best products don't always win, and intend to ensure this doesn't happen to Known.</p>
<p>We need more tools like known that help empower everyone to own the valuable exhaust that they produce online daily, not ceding control to the endless waves of exploitative platforms and applications that seem to step up and try to own people's valuable life bits. Look for more stories about Known from me, as I continue to extend its functionality to help me maintain my POSSE stance when it comes to my digital presence.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a number of folks contacting me about their API ideas, and email or call me, looking to schedule a meeting or briefing to discuss the API ideas. This is something I always reply with a request for existing links to the portal, blog, Twitter, and Github accounts of those involved. Even when companies are doing something interesting, I prefer to approach it like any random Joe or Jane would, from the public portal, with very little information up-front. Your overall approach to API, the value it delivers, and ease of integration should speak for itself, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I am sure there are plenty of companies still who would prefer a briefing, meeting, call, or other personal touch, sales or pitch like engagement, but increasingly in an API driven world, a self-service, pull approach is preferred. A well done API shouldn't have to rely only on traditional marketing. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have these mechanims in place, but by pushing this approach on media, developers, and other potential consumers, you are doing yourself a disservice in many situations--going backwards, not forwards.</p>
<p>There is also another group of people who contact me, who really don't have a thing yet. They are just looking for validation, and potentially stimulate discussions that will get them more attention from would be investors. As with the previous group, I think the "just do it" approach works best. You are going to stimulate much more meaningful discussions amongst investors if you are actually doing something, and generating real buzz amongst developers. Additionally you never know, you may be able to bootstrap and make it happen, without attracting major investment.</p>
<p>I know many of you traditional busines folks are used to a push approach to getting your business out there, but when you are looking to make inroads in the API economy, your majority investment should be about creating a platform that people can visit, and pull the value you generate into their worlds, via a self-service model. Right behind the portal, you should have robust marketing, sales, and other outreach mechanisms, but your primary outreach approach should be just about doing what you preach, not scheduling calls to discuss and convince someone of what you do.</p>
<p>For me when someone insists on jumping on a call to discuss their API, is an immediate filter of bad ideas. If someone is just talking, and not showing, more often than not, there isn't anything really there. If you have to defend or hide your idea, it probably shouldn't be out there anyways.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2015</span>

<p>I have been slowly <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">adding Postman Collections to many of the APIs indexes</a>&nbsp;for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">new master stack</a>. I index each API using an APIs.json file, as well as provide a master APIs.json which brings together all of the APIs, into the single portal I've published to Github. Within some of the APIs, you will see a Postman icon, allowing you to easily import the API definition into postman, directly from each APIs landing page.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">I first published that I was publishing these Postman collections on my Alpha API Evangelist blog</a>, someone from the <a href="https://api.justgiving.com/docs">donation API platform Just Giving</a> said they also <a href="https://github.com/JustGiving/JustGiving.Api.Tools.Postman">prepare Postman collections for their developers, and publish them to Github</a> for their API consumers:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At JustGiving we give our API consumers a set of collections to import to make their jobs even easier, we also use the "Environments" feature to substitute different values depending on whether you're using our Sandbox or Production environment - it's a real time saver and also helps when supporting our API consumers.</em></p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/postman-collections-as-unit-of-measurement-for-transactions-in-the-api-economy/">Postman is a measurable unit for transactions in the API economy</a>, and I feel it goes a long way in helping API consumers onboard with each new API. As a developer, if I can import a Postman Collections into my client, within just a couple clicks, and be up and running with an API--I am going to be a much happier camper, and be that much closer to integration.</p>
<p>I'm considering adding Postman collections as a building block under API on-boarding, and encourage API providers to follow JustGivings lead. Postman Collections is kind of the new API explorer, allowing developers to quickly test drive an API they are going to integrate with. With my own platform, I'm also going to play with publishing Postman Collections, complete with API keys that I refresh regularly, allowing immediate, but limited access my APIs, for anyone who stumble across them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Swagger, Postman is increasingly a machine readable definition that API proviers should be producing, alongside Swagger and API Blueprint for the entire API surface area, and APIs.json for indexing of all API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have had Steve Willmotts of 3Scale's response to the announcement that Twitter was cutting off firehose access for over a week now, and bringing the higher level access completely in house via their Gnip acquisition. You can read the response from Gnip via their blog post&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.gnip.com/twitter-data-ecosystem/">Working Directly With the Twitter Data Ecosystem</a>, and from DataSift in their&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.datasift.com/2015/04/13/twitter-datasift-gap/">The Twitter/Gnip Gap: Data Licensing vs Data Processing</a>. Steve and I are in agreement with the points made via his <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/04/losing-innovation-twitters-firehose-mistake/">How Not to be a Platform: Twitter&rsquo;s Firehose Mistake</a> post. Where I really struggled with over the last week, in producing a official response, was after responding <a href="https://medium.com/politics-of-apis/how-to-be-a-platform-making-tough-partnership-choices-b9cd473821de">How To Be A Platform: Making Tough Partnership Choices</a>, from my friend Tyler Singletary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, I agree with everything Tyler pointed as well. He's right. Twitter has probably made the right decision for Twitter, and based upon their goals and understanding of the Twitter API ecosystem, did exactly what should be prescribed. I have lots of opinions around the Twitter ecosystem, and how&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter Continues to Restrict Access to Our Tweets</a>. However, when I step back, and put on my API operations hat, everything Tyler points out, is valid in my opinion. Twitter gets to decide who has access, and in respect to their goals, chooseing the Gnip offering over the DataSift offering makes sense. It's all about the winning solution, and where the ROI is when it comes platform operations? Life is good when you are on the winning team. However #winning != #good, and #winning != best outcome. I also guess, that #open != good, and #open != best outcome either. There are no absolutes in API land--sorry.</p>
<p>Where Tyler stance really begin to lose its shine for me, is when you zoom out. You see Tyler, you are on the winning team. You have access to the firehose, and you operate squarely within in the #winning conversation (I know you don't have direct firehose, and rely on Gnip). Those of who aren't, the conversation looks very different. Let's take a look at the Gnip vs. Datasift product comparison you provide, but from my stance.</p>
<p>After two phone calls with Gnip sales team, they realized I didn't have the requisite $45K to move forward, not worthy of continuing to talk to this one. All I'm left with is Twitter REST and Streaming API, and DataSift. Gnip isn't even on the menu, isn't even an option in my world. So only the players who can afford to be at the table, get to play--kind of sounds like a familiar story to me. Where have I heard this before? Oh in every industry, throughout history. This isn't the API promise I've been hearing! ;-)</p>
<p>I remember in 2007 and 2008 when Twitter was built on these same principles. Only people with the big money could step up and play on the platform. Oh wait no! It was the other way, the people with money didn't give shit about Twitter, and only us small fish were playing on the platform. We were building widgets, Wordpress plugins, developing meaningful analytics, mobile apps, and Twitter encouraged it all. Prove what you are building on the public API, and when you are ready, we'll get rid of any rate limits, or even give you the firehose-just ask us, we'll give you the access you need--the firehose rhetoric was much different 5 years ago:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2010/enabling-rush-innovation">Full investment in this ecosystem of innovation, means all our partners should have access to the same volume of data, regardless of company size. More than fifty thousand interesting applications are currently using our freely available, rate-limited platform offerings. With access to the full Firehose of data, it is possible to move far beyond the Twitter experiences we know today. In fact, we&rsquo;re pretty sure that some amazing innovation is possible.</a>&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The rush of innovation did happen, but does anyone have access to the same volume of data regarless of company size in 2015? Does the argument that Tyler lays out today, apply in a 2007 or 2010 Twitter ecosystem? How does this line of thinging impact the new startups who are trying to get API developers to come out to use their ecosystems, now, when the big money players don't care about them? Sure things have changed, things have evolved, but I just don't buy the argument that the better product (Gnip) won out over the other product (DataSift). In the neatly package and positioned arguement sure, it makes sense, but if you zoom out, it just doesn't hold weight, now or then. Things have changed for Twitter, but things haven't changed for new startups who are building platforms--they are still depending on early adopters to build on their platform and turn them into a success story, and attact VCS and users.</p>
<p>This is what leaves many of us so disgruntled, its not Twitter making the hard decisions around platform operations. It is their abrasive stance towards those of us who are not in the club, and their lack of communication about the ecosystem, and their sharecropping, and poaching of the best of ideas along along the way, and changing the tune slowly over time. Honestly, I feel like they've done a good job in correcting much earlier bad behavior recently, with their overall partner program, API operations, and evangelism, but their whole firehose position is lacking the bigger ecosystem vision--it is just self centered. Twitter exploited the community when they could, they hand picked a group of partners (<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/12/the-twitter-firehose/">Gnip, DataSift, DataMinr, Mass Relevance, and many more</a>) to serve this need when they didn't have time or resources to do it on their own, and now that they see that there more dumbass enteprise peopleare willing to pay Gnip prices for our data, over people building on the long tail, I respect the whole thing even less--to the point where I almost have stopped giving a shit, and begun moving on.</p>
<p>Steve is right, Tyler is right, and sure Twitter is right. You might even be able to build an argument that Twitter doesn't owe the long tail of ecosystem developer anything for helping make Twitter what is, which would be a tough argument in my opinion, but you can't argue that Twitter doesn't owes a certain amount of responsibility to end-users to keep platform operations real. This means not making firehose access something only the IBM, Intel's, Oracle's, and other big $$ companies of the world can afford to build (at scale) on Twitter. Sure the rest of us can still build on the public REST and streaming API, but what then? Why would we build on the platform if we reach the 100K token limit, we have no guarantees for the future--that is unless we are in the good ol boy club, and don't have anything to worry about.</p>
<p>I guess in the end, this is all about access (pun intended). Like with many other areas of the world, if you are lucky enough to have a priveleged position, which I'm not just pointing out the Klout / Twitter releationship. I'm also talking about the other cozy VC relationships I've witnessed companies enjoy with Twitter, versus the companies who I've seen that do not enjoy such priveleged access. The conversation cannot just be about he merits of Twitters decision, and the performance of Gnip and DataSift, without including the bigger ecosystem picture. Making the hard API ecosystem decision argument is only valid, if they take into consideration all of the macro issues that truly impact a platform, not just those of the platform owners and its most cherished partners and investors have. While I think Twitter and its investors feel like they own Twitter, us developers, and power users who have been on the platform since early days, also feel like we have a certain amount of ownership too--an ownership Twitter has shown they don't respect.</p>
<p>Twitter definitely holds the cards at the moment, but eventually as more of us power user realize we are just fine without a Twitter presence, Twitter will face becoming the NBC of social media--still relevant, but are you still truly relevant? Not forever.</p>

<p>The most important stories told across the API space, the ones that have the biggest impact on API providers, and ultimately API consumers, are the stories that come out of the trenches of the API operations at the leading public API providers. This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist started APIStrat, and what the audiences over the last 3 years of operating APIDays and APIStrat have consistently requested--more stories from the trenches.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've asked S&eacute;bastien Cevey (<a href="https://twitter.com/theefer">@theefer</a>) of The Guardian to come to <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, and share a story from API operations at the worlds leading media API provider. S&eacute;bastien wanted to share their view of what Hypermedia APIs are, by comparing them to a classical RPC architecture and ad-hoc "JSON APIs". He will also cover key benefits of using Hypermedia APIs (cacheability, discoverability, evolveability/extensibility, simplicity, interactive nature), presented in the context of real-world examples and the different constraints of REST (HTTP, URIs, verbs, hypermedia controls like links and forms).</p>

<p>What I like about S&eacute;bastien viepoint, is 1) he works at one of the most progressive media outlets in the world, where he is actually putting APIs to work, and 2) his pragmatic approach. S&eacute;bastien will talk about what hypermedia APIs are, anchoring his lessons in real-world examples from Guardian operations, but he will also discuss the caveats of this API style, acknowledging the realities of API operations. There are no perfect solutions, but technologists like S&eacute;bastien&nbsp;are pushing the discipline of API design forward, while also balancing with the real-world reality that exists in their workplaces.</p>
<p>The keynote from S&eacute;bastien Cevey (@theefer) of The Guardian, <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">will kick off the first day of @APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, so <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/#tile_registration">make sure you are registered today</a>, so you don't get locked out when we sell out (which we are very close). If you are looking to learn more about hypermedia APIs, I recommend starting with S&eacute;bastien's keynote, but also make sure and join us Saturday morning for the entire hypermedia API session, where you can learn more about this fast growing API design consideration, from those pushing the conversation forward, and putting hypermedia APIs to work in the real world.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you all in Berlin, next week!</p>

<p>The most important stories told across the API space, the ones that have the biggest impact on API providers, and ultimately API consumers, are the stories that come out of the trenches of the API operations at the leading public API providers. This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist started APIStrat, and what the audiences over the last 3 years of operating APIDays and APIStrat have consistently requested--more stories from the trenches.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've asked S&eacute;bastien Cevey (<a href="https://twitter.com/theefer">@theefer</a>) of The Guardian to come to <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, and share a story from API operations at the worlds leading media API provider. S&eacute;bastien wanted to share their view of what Hypermedia APIs are, by comparing them to a classical RPC architecture and ad-hoc "JSON APIs". He will also cover key benefits of using Hypermedia APIs (cacheability, discoverability, evolveability/extensibility, simplicity, interactive nature), presented in the context of real-world examples and the different constraints of REST (HTTP, URIs, verbs, hypermedia controls like links and forms).</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API  space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter  version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought  was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week.  I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts  for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help  me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>If you know of something I missed, feel free to email or tweet at me,  and make sure I know about your company, and have a link to your blog  RSS. If you don't tell the story and share, the world will never know it  happened.</p>
<p>It is a good time to be tracking on the API space--lots going on!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/on-apis-and-microservices/">On APIs and Microservices</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-idea-struggle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been monitoring an emerging slice of the API, that has been dubbed "microservices" for some time now, and you've even heard me explore its use, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/25/aspiring-to-be-a-network-of-loosely-coupled-gitnodes-over-being-an-organization-of-github-repos/">when describing my architectural approach to redesigning more core API stack for my internal systems</a>. I&rsquo;m slowly redesigning my internal API stack, keeping them as small as possible, throughout all aspects of operations, deploying each endpoint in a single dockerized container, that contains the OS, database, web server and all server side API code. I'm also using Github, in conjunction with <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/what-is-missing-on-my-microservices-using-apisjson/">APIs.json to assist me in my orchestration</a>, throughout every aspect of these APIs lifecycle from design to testing&mdash;all a new approach for me when managing my APIs.</p>
<p>Is defining my APIs in this way, so that the definition is much more than just the actual API endpoints, but also include the entire backend, and lifecycle workflow Microservices? Fuck if I know. One thing I do know, is I've had enough conversations with folks who are doing microservices, resulting in me saying&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">several times that the micro services definition is something very personal</a>. Something which the first 10 times I said , sounded very positive, but after experiencing multiple people telling me what I'm doing isn't microservices, I can tell the term definitely will continue to be very personal&mdash;very much in the same way conversations around REST or Hypermedia has gotten personal on forums, and HN threads.</p>
<p>You know what this tells me about microservices? Is it is more about power, control and influence, everything from enterprise architects stating their endorsement of the concept, down to the individual architects, who love to make sure you know that the way you are doing it, is WRONG! I don't think there is a single definition of "microservice", and much like REST, I think we'll hear plenty of &ldquo;right&rdquo; definitions, by the enterprise justifying what they are doing, and those who are selling something to the enterprise. Is there anything wrong with this? Nope. Just not my style, not my game, and has shown me over the couple months how the concept is not a fit for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stick in the realm of API. It is a completely bullshit term, that means everything, but you know what? Somehow it escaped the IT, architect, and vendor ownership that SOA and now microservices possesses. For me APIs have long been more than just the tech, it is also about the business and politics of any platform implementation, so why can&rsquo;t it contain my architecture styles as well? So from here forward I will be closely paying attention to microservices conversations, but you won&rsquo;t hear me use the word, as I&rsquo;m more comfortable in API land, and what it has come to mean to the wider public&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t give a shit about what the enterprise adopts, or doesn't.</p>
<p>Microservices will reflect the power and control of the entities behind them, unlike APIs, which also possesses that characteristic, but also quickly shifts the conversation to be more about the innovation and opportunity that developers bring to the table, and the end-users who put that to use. Let&rsquo;s make sure as we do not get caught up in the architectural discussions behind the technical curtain, and that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">we remember why all of this API stuff is working</a>. Let's not get caught up in all the value being just about our architectural styles, and re-live a classic IT tale, ignoring that the real value is what people actually do with our services.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">My Minimum Viable API Footprint Definition</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-footprint.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is something I talk about often, but it has been a while since I&rsquo;ve done a story dedicated to it, so I wanted to make sure and take a fresh look at what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable footprint for any API&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care if it is public or not. This definition has grown out of five years of monitoring the approach taken by leading API providers, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">is also baked into what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable APIs.json definition</a>&mdash;which provides an important index for API operations.</p>
<p>What do I want to see when I visit a developer area? More importantly, what does your average developer, or API consumer need when they land on your API portal? Let&rsquo;s look at the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal -</strong> A clean, easily accessible, prominently place portal landing page. This shouldn&rsquo;t be buried with your help section, it should be located at developer.[yourdomain].com. '</li>
<li><strong>Description -</strong> As soon as developers land, they need a simple, concise explanation of what an API does. Actually describe what the API does, not just that it provides programmatic access to your products and services. </li>
<li><strong>Getting Started -</strong> Give everyone, even non-developers as place to start, helping us understand what is needed to get started with API integration, from signing up for an account to where do I find support.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation -</strong> Deliver, simple, clean, and up to date documentation, preferably of the interactive kind with a Swagger or API Blueprint behind.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication -</strong> Help developers understand authentication. There are a handful of common approaches from BasicAuth, and API keys, to oAuth--provide a simple overview of how authentication is handled.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration -</strong> How do I sign up? Give me a link to a self-service account signup, and make it as easy for me to create my new account, and go from idea to live integration as fast as possible&mdash;don&rsquo;t make me wait for initial approval, that can come later.</li>
<li><strong>Code -</strong> Provide consumers with code, whether they are samples, libraries, or full blown Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Platform Development Kits (PDK). Make sure as many possible languages are provided, not just the languages you use.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Support -</strong> Give API consumers a way to reach you via email, ticketing system, chat, or good ol fashioned phone.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Support -</strong> Provide self service support options via FAQ, Knowledgbases, Forums and other proven ways developers can find the answers they need, when they need.</li>
<li><strong>Communication -</strong> Setup the proper communication channels like a blog and PR section, as well as a healthy social presence on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, or other places your audience already exists.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing -</strong> Even if an API is free, provide an overview of how the platform makes it money, and generates value &mdash; enough to keep it up and running, so I know, as an API consumer I can depend on. Let me know all pricing levels, and provide insight into other partner opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong> Provide a clear overview of how the platform is rate limited, even if they are to protect service availability, let consumers know what to expect.</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap -</strong> Give consumers a look at what is coming in the future, keeping it as a simple, forecast of the short and long term future of an API.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log -</strong> Provide us consumers with a list of all changes that have been made to platform operations, don&rsquo;t limit to just API changes, and include significant roadmap milestones that have been reached.</li>
<li><strong>Status - </strong>Offer a real-time status dashboard of the platform, with a history view of platform status, that consumers can use as a decision making tool, as well as get current platform status.</li>
<li><strong>Github -</strong> Use Github for all aspects of your API platform operations from hosting code, to providing support via issues, to actually hosting your entire developer portal on Github Pages. </li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> Provide, easy to find, and understand terms of service for platform operations, helping API consumers understand what they are in for.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json - </strong>A machine readable index of any API driven platform, providing a single place to find not just the API endpoints, but also all of the essential building blocks of API operations listed above.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my shortlist, of common building blocks that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every API platform should have</span>. Part of the reason I&rsquo;m publishing this, is to provide a fresh look at what I&rsquo;d consider to be the minimum viable footprint, but <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I&rsquo;m also working to get my own API portal for my new master API stack up to snuff</a>, meeting my own criteria. Without a checklist, I forget what some of the essential building blocks are&mdash;you know the cobbler's kids have the worst shoes and all.</p>
<p>After I&rsquo;m done making sure my own API portal meets this criteria, something I can programmatically measure when done, via the APIs.json file, I will provide a self-service evaluation tool that anyone can use to measure whether or not their own portal meets my minimum viable API footprint definition.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/how-not-to-onboard-with-your-api-fiber-locator-api/">How Not To Onboard With Your API: Fiber Locator API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.fiberlocator.com/fiberlocator-api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiberlocator-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Somewhere during my weekly monitoring I found the <a href="http://www.fiberlocator.com/fiberlocator-api/">Fiber Locator API</a>, which like all APIs, especially the ones that ask me to &ldquo;request access&rdquo;, I signed up for the service.  Understanding where telecommunications companies have laid fiber optic cable, for me, equals a potentially valuable API resource&mdash;sure I would consider integrating these resources into my applications, and systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never a big fan of APIs, who make you request access vs self-service registration, but if the API has value, I jump through hoops, so I can can better understand what an API does, which according to the Fiber Locator site:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>FiberLocator offers an application programming interface that gives you access to our database of over 265+ carriers, over 272,000 carrier lit buildings locations and 3,000+ data centers. We created our API services so that client companies can augment their own systems and analyses with our unique data sets.</em></p>
<p>I filled out the form, providing my name, email, phone and company name, the provided the additional details:<em> I am the API Evangelist, and I&rsquo;d like to write a story about the Fiber Locator API</em>. Something I do a lot. Within 24 hours I received:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiber-api-2.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Then I got this:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiber-api-1.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Both of these emails I replied with the same additional details I included with my request for API access. I received a third solicitation, but felt it didn't add any value to the conversation. From what I can tell, the Fiber Locator API is simply a lead generation form, which routes to sales people&mdash;I see no evidence of an API.</p>
<p>Maybe there is something really there, if there is, this is not how you on-board people. I may just be writing a story about the API, which you should probably encourage, but that is just me, but if you really want developers to integrate fiber location into their applications and internal systems, you should probably let us kick the tires, see what the service is all about.</p>
<p>Modern APIs are not a lead generation tool, and API evangelism does not equal sales. If I cannot understand what your API platform offers, sign up to get at least a taste of that value, I&rsquo;m moving on. I&rsquo;ll keep the Fiber Locator API in my database, but I will not be tuning into what they are up to, because by my definition, they don&rsquo;t fit the model of a modern API platform.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/bridging-our-virtual-and-physical-worlds-with-the-link-creation-studio/">Bridging Our Virtual and Physical Worlds With The Link Creation Studio</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p>APIs are very much a virtual concept, something that is very abstract, often difficult to explain, and is something that very much lives in the online world. Spending much of my daily life in this world, I&rsquo;m always excited to come across APIs that bridge this digital world, with our existing physical worlds.</p>
<p>At first read, you might think I&rsquo;m talking about the recent growth of Internet of Things APIs, that are connecting physical devices like our thermostats and smoke alarms, to our mobile devices, using APIs. This is part of it, but for this post I&rsquo;m referencing APIs that don&rsquo;t just connect to objects in our physical world, but they actually bind to existing experiences, processes, and other aspects of our personal and professional worlds.</p>
<p>The Link Creation Studio from HP, is this. Using the web interface, or the API, you can create QR codes, and images with digital watermarks, which can be printed, then any user with a mobile device can snap a picture, which then triggers an action, that then takes the user to a specific location online--providing a bridge from a printed object in our physical world, to an online extension of that object.</p>
<p>This bridge comes with the ability to manage the action that is embedded in print, and the resulting online link destination. You can print the QR code, and digital watermarks, and over time see analytics for each user that traverses the bridge, from print to web page. Link Creation Studio users can also manage this experience, and change it over time to get the resulting experience, that both the publisher, and users desire.</p>
<p>The Link Creation Studio is a simple, but very powerful tool for building bridges between our physical and online worlds. The fact that it has an API is extremely significant, allowing these bridges to be built in real-time, from any system, whether that is a classic business print situation like business cards and product brochures, or something more ad-hoc like a individual person printing flyers, and hanging on telephone poles in their neighborhood, for a party that weekend.</p>
<p>This type of API implementation is more significant to me than just an API that connects, a single device to my mobile phone. This type of API can be used in a million different business, and personal scenarios, resulting in some potentially very interesting, and impactful implementations. These are the APIs that fascinate me, and hold the most potential for making big change in my opinion.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure: </strong>This story came out of a paid review I did of the HP Link Creation Studio, but as anyone who has paid me to do a review knows, a paid review does not equal a good review, let alone extra stories. These were actual thoughts I had while conducting the review, that I wanted to share once done.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-section-508.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve had an increasing number of conversation with folks about in the last couple months, and a friend of mine Tweeted in response to today, resulting in this lovely rant. This is about two very separate problems, in which the solutions are what I'd consider significantly overlapped. I&rsquo;m talking about the need to make sure the valuable metadata, as well as underlying resources made available via an API is accessible to search engines, while also making sure the it is all <a href="http://www.section508.gov/section508-laws">Section 508 compliant</a>, providing critical access to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>In response to my recent post, on "Why The New API Blueprint Sharing Button From Apiary Is So Important&rdquo;, said:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>I'm heavy user of <a href="https://twitter.com/apiaryio">@apiaryio</a> but disappointed with discoverability features of the product. Google just ignores them. <a href="https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd">https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd</a></p>
&mdash; Kristopher Kleva (@klevland) <a href="https://twitter.com/klevland/status/586289568632168449">April 9, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>First, this is another reason why the API Blueprint being more open is important, anyone can now come along and not just build an SEO API documentation solution, they can get access to Apiary.io users who desire such a solution. Ok, that might seem bad for Apiary, but in situations that Apiary is not concerned with, this allows the community to step up and serve the long tail, and if it is something that concerns Apiary, it lights the fire under their ass to consider adding to the road map (sorry Jakub &amp; Z, I know I"m a pain ;-).</p>
<p>Second, it allows the community to step up and serve what I'd consider the critical long tail&mdash;like Section 508. In our rush to deliver the latest in technological innovations, we often forget about significant portions of our society who, well, aren&rsquo;t like us. How many leading apps and platforms that you use are Section 508 compliant? I guarantee almost all API tooling is not&mdash;something we need to address now, and is a&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/us-government-apis/508/us-government-apis/dX34Bn5dcWQ/-Avg7rEbaNkJ">topic where discussion is currently happening the federal government circles</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Swagger UI, and Apiary, and what they have done for API design, deployment, management, discovery, and evangelism, but we need to keep working on the next generation of UI, and UX that is easily indexed, and works well with assistive technologies. Ok, at this point the hypermedia folks want to kick my ass--bring it! ;-) Kidding. What I am talking about should happen in conjunction with well designed, hypermedia fueled clients, not instead--both camps should be addressing making sure all clients or SEO and 508 friendly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a note on the opportunity here. There is huge potential to develop an open source API UI component that can use Swagger and API Blueprint as the core definition, implementing a more SEO and 508 compatible experience, something akin to <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate from Trippit</a>. I&rsquo;m thinking rather than a pull technology like Swagger UI does with its JS interface pulled from a Swagger definition, and I&rsquo;m guessing Apiary does a similar pull from API Blueprint docs?? A more of an HTML, CSS push or publish of functional, static API documentation, that uses JavaScript and APIs to operate&mdash;just some raw thoughts on how to take next steps, its now up to you.</p>
<p>I guarantee if you made an open source set of tools to support this, you'd get the attention of government at all levels, around the world, something that would open up significant other opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was just doing on of my regular check-ins with Pratap Ranade (<a href="https://twitter.com/pratapranade">@pratapranade</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono</a>. We try to make time to catchup on what each other are up to, and find where we can work together to incite API evolution. Pratap sees the space like I do, that APIs are more than tech, possessing huge potential when it comes to empowering folks to make change within their companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and the wider industries and countries they exist in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t go into too much detail about the projects we are working on until they are ready, but I just spend over an hour talking through some pretty interesting use cases that have occurred via Kimono Labs, in which Kimono users are scraping data and content from existing websites, and crafting some pretty interesting APIs. I&rsquo;m not just talking about the fun things like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/marchmadness/explorer">March Madness</a> or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer">World Cup</a> going on over at Kimono, I&rsquo;m talking about influencing elections, addressing disaster recovery issues, and providing timely data that can influence how financial markets are working (or not).</p>
<p>The best part about these stories, is the work is being done, in many cases by people who don't have traditional programming skills, they are more hackers who have identified a problem, and <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">used Kimono to scrape the data, and generate simple APIs</a>, that help provide a new way of delivering API-driven solutions to the problem being targeted. Pratap said they are quickly becoming a big data company as well as a structured data API solution, because of the number of folks stepping up to address the long tail of data.</p>
<p>I just wanted to provide a taste of what we are working on. I&rsquo;m always left pumped up about potential of APIs, after hearing what Kimono is up to. If you want a taste of some of the stories I'm talking about, check out the <a href="http://blog.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono blog</a>.</p>

<p>This is another story that came to mind while listening to the last episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>. As John and Steve were talking about the API definition format Swagger switching from Reverb to SmartBear (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">thanks for shout-out about my Swagger post</a>), they were discussing how Microsoft is using Swagger as part of platform operations, and made sure and reminded us listeners that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all this has been done before</span></strong>. Bringing up a never-ending theme &nbsp;in the world of APIs, that we just can't seem to shake loose.</p>
<p>When people bring this up, what do they mean? Yes, modern API definitions like Swagger, are very much like earlier incarnations of WSDL and WADL. Ok. What now?</p>
<ul>
<li>We shouldn&rsquo;t do it? It won&rsquo;t work? Don&rsquo;t even bother with Swagger?</li>
<li>We should learn from history, and earlier efforts, and make sure we don't same mistakes?</li>
<li>We should be scared of Swagger, and run for the hills, hide in a bunker?</li>
<li>We should all switch back to SOAP and use WSDL?</li>
<li>You just like to tell me I'm wrong, and has nothing to do with technology?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why I bring this up, is because more often than not, most of these conversation lean towards the first response &mdash; don&rsquo;t even bother, except you don&rsquo;t really know because people who state &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve already done this&rdquo;, often leave it open ended, offering no constructive criticism. Some even close it with, this is nothing new! Ok, so what then? How does that impact my decision making, now.</p>
<p>I guess, for me, I step back at look at how this applies to the rest of my world. Do we do this with all other trends in our lives? We already did short skirts, why do we gotta do them again? I heard on NPR the other day that open office plan was invented by the Germans in the 1950s, and proven in-effective by the 1970s, and here in this decade we are doing again. Don&rsquo;t you know we&rsquo;ve already done that?  C&rsquo;mon. Sheesh. Aren't there endless things we've already done in the past that didn't work, and we try them again in a different context, with potentially different results?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, the argument holds no weight for me. So what if we&rsquo;ve already done this, or it is nothing new. I had a shitload of WSDLs laying around in 2003, and now in 2015 I have a butt-load of Swagger laying around--in the end I'm optimistic for more meaningful tooling to emerge. Tell me some practical tip that was applied back in the good ol SOA days that I can use today, don&rsquo;t tear down what I do today. If Swagger isn&rsquo;t for you, cool, tell me what is. Tell me how you are solving defining your APIs, mocking servers, collaborating and iterating around the API designs in your world, how you generate server side code, or client side code, and setup your testing, monitoring, and QA, or maybe providing a discovery service, visualization, and IDE tools &mdash; the fact that we&rsquo;ve already done this, means nothing. We&rsquo;ve already done a lot of things.</p>
<p><em>P.S. I really wish I could import my shitload of Swagger 2.0 specs I having laying around in Runscope, but I have to generate Swagger 1.2, import into Postman, generate post man collections, and then import into my Runscope account. Sheesh! ;-)</em></p>

<p>Yay! Another story generated by listening to <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>&nbsp;(blame John and Steve). I do enjoy sharing my random thoughts while listening to those two. This one is around the SDK discussion during the latest episode, but as they noted, they&rsquo;ve talked about SDKs a lot in the past. This particular reference was again, during the their discussion about Microsoft using Swagger to generate code&mdash;a topic which brought up the usual grumbles from John about SDKs. He loves to hate on SDKs, obviously suffering from severe SDK PTSD.</p>
<p>I agree with his feelings about SDKs, they are well founded, but auto-generating code from Swagger doesn&rsquo;t always involve with the generation of full-blown SDKs. I save a huge amount of time, auto-generating different types of code and scripts from Swagger, which I further clean up and make work for my specific needs. My experience with generating code from Swagger, is more about saving time, than it is about producing production ready SDKs.</p>
<p>Maybe my development world is unique, but I find I still have to get my hands dirty, even when I generate server or client side code using Swagger, requiring me to still play with HTTP and understand response / request details. I get what John is saying, and he is right. I'm increasingly frustrated by companies producing platforms that are more SDK than API, something IoT engineers excel at.</p>
<p>I just wanted to point out there are many layers to the discussion, and that there are no perfect solutions when auto-generating code from API definitions, but it can sure save time in both API deployment, as well as API consumption, and unlike SDKs I still understand the inner working of my apps, integrations, and the APIs they are depending on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-skull-crossbones.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had one of my followers ask me if there as a &ldquo;gold standard for API deprecation policies&rdquo; out there. I&rsquo;d say that deprecation policies are a little different than some of the other legal building blocks of an API, where the legal is a small portion of it, with the majority really being all about communication.</p>
<p>To answer the question, I recommended Google. Not cause their deprecation policy itself is all the great, it is just because their overall approach to API deprecation is pretty robust&mdash;something I&rsquo;m sure is derived from their experience so far. (wink wink)</p>
<p>API deprecation at Google starts with some pretty clearly stated policies, but goes much further with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/terms">Deprecation Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-publishers/docs/deprecation">Deprecation Schedule</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v2/data-deprecation">Data Deprecation Details</a></li>
<li><a href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/12/announcing-deprecation-of-google-earth.html">Blog Communication</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the building blocks that Google employs as part of their approach to API documentation. This post is just result of a 15 minutes of Googling around, to respond to the question. Now that I have written this post, and put the topic of API deprecation back on my radar, the next step is to dive deeper and develop a complete picture of how Google approaches API deprecation, as well as other leading players in the space.</p>
<p>At first take, it appears to me that the legal details of API deprecation that are present in terms of use, or as standalone documents is only the start. The winning examples of API deprecation involve making sure deprecation details are always readily available, regularly communicated, and are comprehensive enough to cover the API, data, and other things that matter to developers and end-users.</p>

<p>If I find a new company during my research, it takes me about a minimum of 15 minutes to lightly profile what they are up, and add to my system, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/">if I do a full profile</a>, it can take several hours. All of this adds up to a lot of work, time that would be better spent on actually writing stories, hacking on the APIs, and publishing of the longer form research papers on what I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, <a href="http://apisjson.org/">each of these APIs would have an APIs.json in the root of their domain</a>, with details about the company and people responsible for API operations, and as much information about each API as possible. With a single click, I could import the entire profile of a company, and its valuable API resources into my monitoring system, ready for publishing to relevant areas of the API Evangelist network, as well as some of my partner sites like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>--the beauty is, so could anyone else. ;-)</p>
<p>If API providers used <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, I could be connected to their Blog via RSS, their platform Twitter account via the Twitter API, and their Github profile or organization using the Github API. Not only would I have relevant metadata about a company like their name, description, logo, and details about APIs, I would also be connected to a real-time heartbeat of API operations via the platform blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. This is just the start--there are numerous other building blocks you could wire up with an APIs.json file, to keep potential consumers up to speed.</p>
<p>I know it can be hard to se the potential for APIs.json, because there is limiting tooling available currently, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">beyond the open source search engine APIs.io</a>, Even before the next wave of tooling like the internal enterprise search engine, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">visualizations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/apispots">browser plugins</a>, and other tooling are available, you can realize the benefit of being listed on <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and make sure you are fully plugged into my regular monitoring of the API space, which means the chances are much, much higher that I will write a story about what you, and your developers are up to. ;-)</p>

<p>This story is derived from listening to the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">API podcast, Traffic and Weather</a>. One of the things John Sheehan (<a href="/admin/blog/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), and Steve Marx (<a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>) discussed during the recent show, was a post Steve wrote as part of his role as product manager, called "<a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2015/04/how-many-http-status-codes-should-your-api-use/">How many HTTP status codes should your API use</a>"? I think the story is extremely useful to read, helping us all think through how we use HTTP status codes in our own platform, but personally I think the real story, is Dropbox talking out loud about their strategy.</p>
<p>John and Steve pointed out on the podcast that someone had tweeted that the story was not in sync with the way Dropbox actually did their HTTP status codes. To which Steve replied, that is why he wrote the story, to talk it out, and solicit feedback. This is how you should be thinking through your API road map, out loud, on your platform blog. When I mention to API providers that the blog is the most important tool in their toolbox, this is what I mean. Your blog isn&rsquo;t just for broadcasting your platform message, it is also about you thinking through thoughts, sharing those thoughts with your API consumers, and potentially getting feedback, which you can consider as part of the overall decision making process.</p>
<p>I am addicted to thinking through my ideas publicly on my blog. For me, a thought isn&rsquo;t fully formed, until its published. I also depend heavily on the feedback from my audience to my stories, in their public comments on Disqus, and Twitter, as well as privately via email and DMs. Talking things through, publicly on your blog, teaches you to think outside the box, let the sunlight in on your thoughts, and forces you to (potentially) properly form your ideas (not always), at least enough to share with the public--even if you don&rsquo;t end up getting feedback, that process alone, is highly valuable.</p>
<p>The best part of this, is after you&rsquo;ve thought through your stories, received feedback from your API consumers, the story also has the potential to live on as a marketing vehicle, which is what I feel most people think of when I mention a blog for API operation. All of this creates a potentially virtuous cycle, that is essential to API evangelism and the overall road map. If you do this type of storytelling regularly, thoroughly thinking through your ideas, and opening them up to public comment before you finalize your road map, eventually you will find that you have momentum in some very positive directions, and are generating some extremely valuable exhaust from your efforts that also brings in new API consumers, and helps keep the existing API consumers engaged.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/home-2014/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-drone.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As my Internet of Things (IoT) research continues, I&rsquo;m applying much of my API thinking from the mainstream API space to the world of IoT. A couple weeks ago I stumbled across the <a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/">3D Robotics Drone API</a>, which to my surprise, was documented using a Swagger specification, providing a machine readable definition of the API, which helped me quickly get up to speed on what the Drone API delivers.</p>
<p>I haven't put much thought into the detail for any drone APIs, something that has been adjacent to my mainstream research for over a year now, but I did have some basic opinions about what a drone API could have. So, when it comes to potential resources, I have to say the  3D Robotics Drone API delivers in all earlier areas I had been considering--with five main endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Vehicle API </strong>- Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of vehicle, and retrieving single vehicle, including airspeed, ground speed, and battery.</li>
<li><strong>The Mission API -&nbsp;</strong>Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of mission, and retrieving single mission.</li>
<li><strong>The Administrator API </strong>- Access to administrative resources including debugging, logging, and flight simulation.</li>
<li><strong>The User API - </strong>Access operations for browsing and searching lists of user, and retrieving single user.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication </strong>- Session operations for logging in and out, and identifying user.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vehicle stuff I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the resources around logging, and specifically the mission API. When it comes to transparency, and accountability around drone activity, I feel pretty strongly that these types of resources will be essential, and eventually will be mandated by government entities. I&rsquo;m glad that 3D Robotics is ahead of the game, in providing API driven resources that deliver in this way.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect, when I stumbled across the user and mission management APIs, was the social, online layer. As part of the 3D Robotics Drone API platform, the company offers <a href="http://www.droneshare.com">DroneShare</a>, where you can publish your user profile, and your <a href="http://www.droneshare.com/mission">missions</a>. I was coming at this from the angle of a potential industry regulation tool, or possible drone pilot resource management&mdash;I didn't think it would be done as social, and potential entertainment platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.droneshare.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/Droneshare-Screnshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the description from the site:</p>
<blockquote><em>"This is the beta release of Droneshare. Droneshare is a mission viewing and sharing application that works with ground control applications to let you share your mission data. This project is open source, if you would like to improve it, it is probably best to start at our github repo."</em></blockquote>
<p>This is why I thoroughly enjoy doing my research, because it expands my understanding of specific business sectors that APIs are touching. While I was discovering DroneShare, I also learned about the existence of the "<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/drone/no-fly/">Don&rsquo;t Fly Drones Here</a>&rdquo; project, from Mapbox, which provides a database resource of restricted zones, where you can&rsquo;t fly drones. Which brought me back to my original thoughts, regarding what resource we will need to keep the drone industry sane, rather than just focusing on social and entertainment.</p>
<p>Ultimately I see a lot of patterns here, that reflect several possible drone futures we are potentially crafting. I see social networks, where drone pilots compete for the best jobs, based upon their missions, and equipment usage. I also see potential for entertainment--think about the networks that have arisen for watching people play videogames, and competitive gaming platforms, but apply that to the world of drones. I also see potential elements of government regulation, where the FAA and other agencies, require drone pilots to log their equipment, and activity, logging all drone flights, and potentially sharing publicly via drone social networks to increase accountability.</p>
<p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/home-2014/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m thinking that the <a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/">3D Robotics Drone API</a> provides  a potential blueprint that could be used by other drone manufacturers, and cloud platforms that serve the drone industry. The 3D Robotics Drone API pattern could be held up as an open specification, that the government could weigh in on, making sure the proper regulatory resources are available, and that drone activity can be accessed, and audited via a secure API, available via the Internet.</p>
<p>The world of drones is fascinating to me. On one hand, the security and privacy considerations scare the shit out of me. On the other hand, they are endlessly fascinating to me, and ultimately I&rsquo;m going to be purchasing a drone, so I can play with more, and understand better&mdash;its a business expense you know!</p>
<p>Man, I have a great career. I'm so privileged to be doing what I do&mdash;even if our world is under a threat of attack by drones!</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://api.myfox.me/dev/introduction"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/myfox/myfox-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was dedicating some time to researching APIs in the Internet of things (IoT) space, and stumbled across the <a href="https://api.myfox.me/">Myfox API</a>, serving the <a href="https://www.getmyfox.com/us_en/">Myfox home security products</a>. While the developer portal for the Myfox API doesn't have everything I'd like to see in an IoT developer portal, it is one of the better one's I've seen.</p>
<p>If you think web or mobile app developers suck at providing a simple, and a coherent developer portal and experience, device platform providers are even worse. The Myfox API, has the essential building building blocks, with a simple overview, authentication info, simple Swagger driven API documentation, application management tools, and a clear terms of service for the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a clear link between the primary Myfox website, the developer portal, and a <a href="https://myfox.me/">myfox.me user portal</a>, for device consumers and would-be developers to easily on-board with everything. I haven't fully profiled that Myfox platform, but at first glance it is clean, well laid out, and most importantly the link between the website, API, and user accounts is clear, and easy to navigate.</p>
<p>As I think this through, and after recently finishing a white paper called <a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/building-an-api-driven-ecosystem-for-the-internet-of-things/">Building an API-driven Ecosystem for the Internet of Things</a>, for the now defunct GigaOm, I can't help but think the IoT space is going to need to agree on some sort of standard approach for not just managing how they design, deploy, and manage APIs, but also how they deliver developer and user portals. To help you visualize what I mean, consider the number of Internet connected devices any single household will own, all with their own portal, and on-boarding process. #FUN</p>
<p>In short, developers, and end-users will get IoT account fatigue pretty quick. I don't think that we are going to standardize everything across the space, I am not delusional, but I can't help but think that the sharing of some common blueprints, could go a long ways in reducing friction for developers, and device consumers. I'll take my research from the GigaOm white paper and produce a blueprint, that IoT device makers can use, to to hopefully be more successful in deploying their developer portals, platform accounts, and maybe help influence a tiny bit of consistency in how IoT platforms function.</p>

<p>API design service provider Apiary, <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2015/03/26/ApiBlueprint-button/">quietly launch a new sharing button for API Blueprints, in their interactive API documentation</a>, the other week. They added a setting in their account area, which allows users to be more open with their API designs:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Start sharing your API blueprint with other API enthusiasts, by enabling this feature within your API settings. Simply toggle the &lsquo;Public Blueprint&rsquo; setting on and you&rsquo;re ready to start sharing your API blueprint.&rdquo; also stating that, &ldquo;this is just the beginning of being able to socialize and learn from other public API blueprints."</em></blockquote>
<p>Now we you are visiting the Apiary driven API documentation for common platforms like:</p>

<p>The machine readable API Blueprint definition, driving the documentation now has the potential to be accessible. This may not seem like much, but it is actually fundamental to the health, and growth of the overall API industry. Developers cannot learn from other developers, and from leading API platforms, and share best practices for API design across the space without it&mdash;we need this to grow, and evolve.</p>
<p><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-blueprint/apiblueprint-logo-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This is one of the reasons <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">Swagger has seen such wide adoption</a>, because it isn&rsquo;t just an open format, it is also because the API definitions that these public platforms generate are also available to share, and learn from. You can still lock down the valuable resources made available via an API, but the interface patterns we apply to our APIs should be shared as widely as possible, for everyone to see. This is why I&rsquo;ve been fighting so hard <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-computer-scientists-scotus">to push back against Oracle in their API copyright case against Google</a>&mdash;API designs do not need to be locked up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to find API Blueprints on the open web, and on Github for some time now, but this opens up the playing field to be able easily discovery, and engage with existing Apiary, and API Blueprint driven APIs at a new level. Much of what I&rsquo;ve learned about Swagger and API design has come from being able to click on the raw link on Swagger UI, and reverse engineer the Swagger definition behind the curtain. I&rsquo;ve never been able to do this with API Blueprint, or Mashery I/O docs. I have been able to get at the WADL behind the Apigee Explorer, but it is a pain in the ass, and the definitions are usually out of date by the time I get to it.</p>
<p>The effects of Apiary&rsquo;s move won&rsquo;t be some immediate thing, it will take time, but the more API Blueprints that are shared, the more users will learn about the powerful API definition format driving many public APIs&mdash;this is good for Apiary, good for API providers, and good for API consumers. Thanks Apiary for doing this, it makes me happy. It also gives me a head start on making sure <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a> is API Blueprint fluent, and that more API Blueprint driven APIs are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">present in my research</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my travel in 2015, and focus on some important research, coding, and writing. I apologize to all the events I&rsquo;ve said no to over the last couple months, but I hit a wall last year with speaking, and trying hard to make 2015 a much more healthier, and balanced year.</p>
<p>With that said, here is where you can find me this spring. I have three places you can find me in April and May:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>&nbsp;- You can find me in Berlin, putting on <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDays / @APIStrat, April 24th &amp; 25th</a></li>
<li><strong>Barcelona, Catalonia</strong> - I will be speaking at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th, in Barcelona</a></li>
<li><strong>Broomfield, CO</strong> 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apistrat.com/2nd-annual-api-strategy-practice-tech-un-workshops-gluecon-2015/">@APIStrat Tech Un-Workshops @ Gluecon May 19th</a> (1:00-5:00 PM)</li>
<li>Leading the Swagger conversation at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Swagger-API/events/221572540/">Swagger API Meetup @ Gluecon May 19th</a> (7:00-9:00 PM)</li>
<li>Gluecon - I will be at <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon 2015, May 20th, and 21st, speaking</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is all the speaking I&rsquo;m doing this spring, with one tentative date early in June at BYU. I won&rsquo;t be traveling again until the fall, when we do @APIStrat again, and of course @DefragCon!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be in Berlin and Barcelona, two of my favorite European cities, and of course Broomfield, CO (specifically the Taproom). I am also excited to not be traveling as much, and able to focus on my wider research, coding, and writing. #thanks</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-portal-developer-github.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the developer portals of API providers. I see a lot of things, both the good and bad, while navigating these  portals, and while some of the bad stuff I see are way too big for me to doing anything, there are many little things I see that I could help do something about. Sometimes it is just spelling mistakes, sometimes broken links, and other times I want to rewrite API descriptions, and add to the resources that are available for an API.</p>
<p>During these travels, I got to thinking...what if API providers published their developer portals to Github? Just like I do with my API Evangelist sites. Then I could fork their portal, and submit pull requests with rewrites of the description of what your API does, adding little tweaks, here and there, helping polish the portal--potentially making things easier for developers. I&rsquo;m sure this thought scares the hell out of some companies, who can&rsquo;t imagine, allowing outside input like this, but if you sit down and think about it for a while, it just might make sense.</p>
<p>When I was in Washington D.C., <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/dev-hub/">I created a default portal template that runs on Github</a>. I might upgrade this, and make it available for API providers to use as a forkable template, to seed any API developer portal. Doing this makes it easy to provide a base set of building blocks that every API provider should start with, allowing them to delete the elements that they don&rsquo;t want. I am also considering making a default one, that can be used as a starter developer portal for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the pull requests that I get for spelling and grammar mistakes I made on API Evangelist, from some of my favorite grammar trolls. Running all of my websites on Github Pages has changed the way I tell stories, and interact with my audience. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">I&rsquo;ve always encouraged API providers to use Github for an increasing number of API management tasks</a>, but actually running your entire portal as a Github repo, would this to a new level. This approach could be used for larger, or smaller developer platforms, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/11/16/public-frontend-and-private-backend-for-my-sites-on-github/">I even use Github pages as a front-end for private API developer portals</a>--ask me how.</p>
<p>It is just a suggestion for you API providers, and soon to be API providers. Github provides a very low cost, scalable way to launch your portal, and you never know, people like me who spend a lot of time in your developer portal, might actually help make it a better place. I wish more API providers would publish their portal as a Github repository, as well as graphic designers in the space help craft template portals, that providers can put to work. My portal definitions will always reflect best practices that I see across the API landscape, but they won&rsquo;t always be the slickest looking when it comes to graphic design&mdash;just not my core competency.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/alchemy/alchemy-api-ibm-version.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was doing my regular monitoring, and found myself on the <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">AlchemyAPI</a> site. Not exactly sure how I got there, but I stumbled across their <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/htmlc.html">HTMLGetCombinedData</a>&nbsp;API, which can be used for analysis on HTML content, and is one of 3 separate APIs, AlchemyAPI is calling "combined calls".</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with AlchemyAPI, the company has a number of valuable APIs, which you can use to make sense of content and data from on, or offline source. I use AlchemyAPI for API Evangelist, to pull keywords, and the content out of blog posts, helping me shed the overall look of a site, and any advertisements--getting down to the raw content. What I thought was particularly interesting about this API, was their approach combined calls, and specifically their approach to monetizing these aggregated API calls.</p>
<p>There are three specific APIs they are considering "combined calls":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/urls.html">URLGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on a publicly-accessible Internet web pages.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/htmlc.html">HTMLGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on uploaded HTML content.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/textc.html">TextGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on uploaded text content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three APIs are only available in the AlchemyAPI&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/pricing">pro and enterprise packages</a>, which for me makes see this aa a potentially new approach to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>. I don&rsquo;t see it as something that works for all API providers, but when you have numerous decoupled APIs, which developers may also be implemented several of them at a time, or daisy chaining them together&mdash;a combined API call, might save some developers valuable time.</p>
<p>Combined API calls also seem like a potential opportunity for API platform developers themselves. If an API platform, provides tools for developers to aggregate, and stitch together multiple APIs, and publish their recipes, it is something that could produce some interesting patterns, that may better deliver solutions to the problems developers actually face during integration. At the very least, allowing developers to publish SDKs that accomplish the same thing, might achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>I am just looking to share my thoughts on AlchemyAPIs approach to aggregating their API calls, and specifically the focus on monetization, adding the concept to my research. Maybe it is something others can for their API platforms, or maybe API developers, could provide aggregated API recipes, for specific API platforms, or across multiple platforms.</p>

<p>I'm calling these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API Aggregation</strong></span>, but they are kind of a new take on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/urls.html">AlchemyAPI Web Combined Call</a> - I thought this was an interesting approach to monetizing APIs, by saving developers time. In a world where you have a bunch of microservices that do one thing, and do it well, I think aggregate or combined API calls ike this as premium service will be more common.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/alchemyapi-text-combined-call">AlchemyAPI Text Combined Call</a> - Seems to be something they are doing across the board. Will keep an eye out for others doing this too.</li>

        <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The one thing I've learned in five years as the API Evangelist is that us technologists and developers don't always see the world like everyone else. We focus on the perfection of the technology, our own desires for the future, and often miss the mark on what end-users actually need. This is one of the hallmark success of APIs over SOA, is that by accident, APIs jumped out of the SOA petri dish (thanks Daniel Jacobson - <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), and was use solve everyday problems that end-users face, using the technology that is readily available (aka HTTP).</p>
<p>While I think us API folks have done a great job of delivering valuable resources to mobile applications, and a decent enough job at delivering the same resources to web applications, and I guess we are figuring out the whole device thing? maybe? maybe not? Regardless, one area we have failed to serve a major aspect of the business world, is delivering valuable API resources to the number #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>We have done a decent job of providing resources to data stewards, <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">helping them deploy APIs using spreadsheets using services like API Spark</a>, but other than a handful of innovative implementations from companies like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">Octoparts</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio</a>, there are no solid API consumption resources that target the spreadsheet environment. Meaning there is no easy way for mainstream spreadsheet users to put common API driven resources to work for them within the spreadsheets that they live in daily--that is until today, with the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://api.blockspring.com/blog/blockspring-for-google-sheets">Blockspring launched their Google Spreadsheets Add-On</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah I know, making APIs work in spreadsheets has been done for a while, via Google Spreadsheets and Excel Spreadsheets, but nobody has standardized it like Blockspring just did. So let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the implementation. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockspring/aihldeahgcpbpmimkdpkafaedhbmfhoh">I went to the Google Chrome App Store, and downloaded the add-on</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then using a new spreadsheet, I click on add-ons &gt; Blockspring, and logged into my account. After giving Blockspring access to the Google Spreadsheet via my Google Account oAuth, I was given an API console in the right hand sidebar of my spreadsheet interface. The API options I&rsquo;m given aren't the usual geek buffet, they are everyday use scenarios that would attract the average spreadsheet users.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-console.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I select the IMDB movie search, which once chosen, I&rsquo;m given the option to populate my spreadsheet with results, providing me with API driven resources, right in my worksheets. The best part is it is complete with one cell as a search term, allowing me to customize my IMDB search.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-imdb.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Using Blockspring, I&rsquo;m given easy to use, API driven resources, that anyone can implement, like visualizing the recent news:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-tools.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Or possibly evaluate stock volatility clustering, using stock market data APIs (cause you know we all do a lot of this):</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-tools-2.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p><br />Blockspring gives me over 1000 API driven functions that I can use in my Google Spreadsheet&mdash;kicking everyone&rsquo;s asses when it comes to potential API client delivery. While us technologists are arguing over whether or not we can automatically generated Swagger driven SDKs, and the importance of hypermedia APIs when deploying the next generation clients, someone like Blockspring comes along and pipes in APIs to the #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet. #winning</p>
<p>Now the game will be about getting the attention of Google Spreadsheet users, and developing comparable Microsoft Spreadsheet tooling, and getting mainstream Excel users attention as well. The rest of you will have to get the attention of Blockspring, and make sure your API resources have simple, meaningful endpoints that can be piped in as Blockspring Google Spreadsheet functions. Spreadsheet driven business units should not have to learn about APIs and go look for them, at each individual API portal&mdash;APIs providers should find and education business users about their resources, via one of the most ubiquitous tools in business.</p>
<p>Nice work Blockspring, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/going-beyond-excel-as-a-data-source-for-api-deployment-and-focusing-on-it-as-an-api-client/">helping ensure the space move beyond excel as a data source for API deployment, and focusing on it as an API client</a>, delivering vital API resources to the business users who can potentially benefit the most, and are willing and able to pay for API access in my opinion.</p>
<p>P.S. As soon as I finished this I remembered this story from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/">last weeks API.Report&nbsp;</a>-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/25/the-api-briefing-free-federal-energy-and-economic-information-delivered-straight-to-your-spreadsheet/">Free Federal Energy and Economic Information Delivered Straight to Your Spreadsheet</a> - not an standardized approach, but definitely an important implementation to showcase.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/streamdata-io-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was introduced to <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> the other day, by Gabriel Dillon (<a href="https://twitter.com/gjdillon">@gjdillon</a>) of <a href="http://readme.io/">Readme.io</a>. StreamData.io provides a caching, and push layer for apps to take advantage of, that can be deploy on top of existing APIs. I haven&rsquo;t implemented StreamData.io yet, I am still evaluating it, and at first glance it looks like an interesting new real-time layer, that you can use on top of APIs, to improve application performance and user experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add StreamData.io to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a> right now, however once I start playing with I may add as an API deployment resource as well. I have some verification to do, but I&rsquo;d love to test out the potential for StreamData.io to deliver cache and sync layer for common APIs, doing for APIs, what StreamData.io is doing for apps&mdash;delivering on one of my ongoing ideas for caching high use APIs.</p>
<p>When I was working in Washington DC, I had the pleasure of working during the federal government shutdown, where I wrote a piece <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/01/can-we-depend-on-federal-government-apis/">asking if we can depend on our federal government APIs</a>, and talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/12/caching-apis-with-cloudformations-or-openshift-/">caching APIs with AWS cloud formations, or Open Shift</a>. My objective is to ensure there redundant sources for APIs coming out of government, providing developers with a more stable solution, they can depend on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/multiple-types-of-apisjson-for-discovery/">I even added this thinking into the early APIs.json design, allowing you to define cached indexes of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a>, and I&rsquo;ll get in there and play with more, as I have the time. Then I&rsquo;ll get a better understanding of what you can do with the API caching and syncing, seeing if it is possible to deliver this layer for my APIs as well as my apps&mdash;something that is even more appealing in this age of Docker containers. #FoodForThought</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key-skeleton.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.bizcoder.com/are-you-or-your-customers-leaking-your-api-keys">Are You Or Your Customers Leaking Your API Keys?</a> from Daryl Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) the other day, which spurred me to float up a story in my Evernote, from a couple months back. My thoughts are only related to Daryll&rsquo;s because it is about API keys, and their accessibility&mdash;the similarities stop there. Daryl is talking about a very different layer of key management, which we should all be thinking deeply about.</p>
<p>API key management is an API provider issue, as much as it is an API consumer issue. As an API provider I need to have an easy way to manage all the keys I provide to developers. As an API consumer, I need to have an easy to manage all the API keys I get across the API providers that I depend on. In short, key management isn&rsquo;t easy, and there are no clear solutions that serve both ends of the key management coin.</p>
<p>As an API provider, I use <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure to manage my API keys</a>. Using my API portal, developers can sign up for their own accounts, manage their apps, and the keys that are issued. 3Scale does all the heavy lifting for me, all I have to do is manage my API service composition, and keep an eye on dev usage, as well as keep an eye on my own app usage. I use all my own APIs for my apps too! Sometimes my apps are the bad actors, it not always the developers who abuse API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an API consumer, I&rsquo;m working hard to pull my API key world together, using a <a href="http://api-keys.apievangelist.com/">home brew format I&rsquo;m calling simple api-keys</a>. I&rsquo;m am using Github for all of my API and microservice related projects, so I&rsquo;m beginning to centralize how I store keys, and how I manage them across all my apps. With a central storage, and management process, I&rsquo;m hoping to get a better handle on which APIs I use, and introduce more regular cycles of key management, where I refresh API keys on a strict schedule.</p>
<p>With the work I&rsquo;m doing on the API consumption front, and reading Daryll&rsquo;s post got me thinking about keys. If our API management house is in order, and we can manage different groups of API keys, monitor their usage, and revoke them at will, why can&rsquo;t we just have a pool of API keys that we can just leave laying around? I&rsquo;ve seen many APIs provider default keys, embedded in URLs available in API documentation, allowing you to make sample calls, why can&rsquo;t we apply this a little bit wider? It seems like we could have a rolling pool of API keys, that we leave laying around in code snippets, how-to guides, and stories, which allow instant access to APIs&mdash;which we monitor, and if we see abuse we can revoke, and refresh with new set--easily done if you use Github Gists for storytelling (snippet centralization).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through my entire API stack, and generating Postman Collections, and I&rsquo;m considering generating some API keys that are designed for use in specific stories, 101 resources, and other public and private evangelism efforts. It is just a thought at this point, that I wanted to put out there for discussion. Seems to me, if we really want to reduce any friction in on-boarding, we could start using &ldquo;some&rdquo; API keys in conjunction with SEO, SMM, and other existing evangelism metrics and analysis tools that are in our toolbox.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">Quantifying The Community Around The Swagger API Specification</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2015</span>
        <p>This post is extracted from a deep dive I've been doing into the Swagger ecosystem, as part of regular conversations I have been having with Tony Tam (@fehguy), trying to understand how we can better tell stories about Swagger. I've been tuned into things for a while now around the Swagger community, and there is a lot going on, but from the outside, some of this can be hard to see. Seeking a better understand what is the Swagger community, I wanted to take a walk through the sites, forum, and Github repositories.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s start with the basics, what is Swagger? Merriam Webster defines Swaggers as: : to walk in a very confident way : to walk with a swagger. ;-) Seriously though, Swagger is a machine readable format (either JSON or YAML), for describing an API, providing a description of API operations, in a way that other applications can read, and understand. Even though Swagger is machine readable, and designed for other applications, it has also become a language for humans to describe and collaborate, around a shared, quantifiable, vision of what an API can do, throughout all stages of the API life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn about Swagger yourself, you can tune into these channels to learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/">Website</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SwaggerApi">Twitter</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api">Github</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swagger-swaggersocket">Google Group</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal with this post is evolve my understanding and awareness of what Swagger is, and hopefully along the way I can help increase yours as well. In my experience, many people have a very distorted, and limited understanding of what Swagger is, and I&rsquo;d like to take some time to evolve that. When I started this research, my objective was to help Tony deliver a new website, and on-boarding materials for Swagger, assisting people of all skill levels in finding all things Swagger. I am just taking this moment to walk through what at I have so far, and craft a more robust version 1.0 narrative about what Swagger is, something that blogging helps me work through.</p>
<p>One of the biggest misconceptions I find when I talk with folks about Swagger, is that it is interactive documentation, when that is actually Swagger UI--when it comes to Swagger all roads start with the Swagger specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec)">Swagger-Spec</a> </strong>- The goal of Swagger is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md">You can find version 2.0 of the spec here</a>, which is the current active version in use. The Swagger spec lets you describe all the essential aspects of API operations, with information about the operator, the host and basePath for the API, details about what type of content it produces or consumes, like JSON or XML. Most importantly it lets you describe each of the paths for an API, with details on parameters, responses, and other details of each specific API path. Swagger also provides you with the ability to describe the underlying data model definitions, describing the valuable resources being served up via APIs.</p>
<p>To grasp the last paragraph, you have to have a pretty solid understanding of the moving parts of an API, but in short the Swagger spec gives us a language to potentially map out all of the common parts of an API. It also allows me to describe the security for each API, and tag to organize APIs into specific buckets. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">I use Swagger to describe the almost 20 APIs my business uses daily, with varying amount of detail about each resource, and the information it serves up</a>. All the 20 of the Swagger definitions provide me with a machine readable map of my own IT infrastructure&mdash;as well as a common language that almost any other developer, or potentially not developer can learn to read, and work with.</p>
<p>With Swagger we now have a common way to communication around the APIs we develop, and also map out the public APIs we also depend on like Twilio, SendGrid, or even Twitter. Now what? Why do we do this? <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">There are an increasing number of incentives emerging for why you generate machine readable API definitions like Swagger</a>, which is part of the reason I&rsquo;m looking to further quantify the Swagger community, so I can add to the master list.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what I&rsquo;d consider to be the primary building blocks of Swagger, developed by the Swagger team, as part of the core offering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">swagger-ui </a>- </strong>Generation of interactive API documentation, which Swagger is often known for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger-codegen</a> -</strong> Generation of client code in a variety of languages using a Swagger definition.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js">swagger-js</a> -</strong> A JavaScript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or Node.js.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-socket">swagger-socket </a>- </strong>A REST over WebSocket tool for creating real-time integrations with Swagger.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node-express">swagger-node-express</a> -</strong> Swagger module for Node.js w/express module</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-scala-module">swagger-scala-module</a> -</strong>&nbsp;Swagger support for Scala.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor">swagger-editor</a> -&nbsp;</strong>A visual editor for Swagger.      
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those six repositories represent the core tooling that the Swagger team has evolved around the specification, providing what I&rsquo;d consider to be three stops along the API life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Server Code</li>
<li>Client Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Swagger is often known for its interactive API documentation (aka Swagger UI), but there has also been a lot of work done on the codegen platform, and editor, taking things well beyond just API documentation. This is just the beginning of what is possible with Swagger. In an effort to find out what else is being done with Swagger, and what is being built with the specification, I wanted to see what the community is up to, which platforms they are integrating it into, and what other standalone tooling is being built using Swagger.</p>
<p>I want a better understanding of the core group of companies who have embraced the Swagger specification, and baked it into their own platform. I know there are hundreds of them out there, but finding them can be easier said than done, especially when I'm looking some sort of public announcement, blog post, press release, service description, to use as my reference. So far I have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">49 companies</span></strong> that I&rsquo;m tracking on, who have pulled the Swagger spec, and incorporated into their own platform and infrastructure.</p>

<p>This list represents a pretty interesting mix of folks who understand the potential of Swagger, and have invested in the community by making it a core part of their operations. I know there are more of these out there (a lot more), but they haven&rsquo;t talked publicly about what they are up to. This is just what I&rsquo;ve aggregated from going through the Swagger site, group, and Github repositories, and from what I already know of the API space, from my monitoring.<br /><br />After looking at the platforms who have pulled the Swagger specification into their operations, I wanted to see if I could also begin to quantify the community of APIs who have deployed Swagger UI, providing interactive API documentation for their own API platform. Since this is what Swagger is known for, I knew I would find quite a few to showcase. So far I have found 62:<br /><br /></p>

</table><p>Finding websites that have implemented Swagger UI is harder than you think. There are only three search engines I could find that let you search the source code of websites for JavaScript files and code. Ultimately I ended up mostly depending on my own ability to find new APIs, and manually uncover whether or not Swagger was actually in use. I&rsquo;m working on a stack of Swagger and API Blueprint discovery search engines, but they aren&rsquo;t quite ready for this dive.<br /><br />Next I wanted to look through some of the tooling that has evolved as part of the Swagger community, which Github is definitely the place to begin this journey. <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=swagger">When you search Github for the word Swagger, you get almost 1000 repositories</a>. I was going to programmatically explore these results, but found that manually browsing through them was the best path to take, allowing me to make a decision on what each developer was up to.<br /><br />The one thing I learned doing through this process&mdash;Swagger means many different things, to many different people. Most refer to Swagger, and mean Swagger UI, while others refer to it as generating server side code, or maybe client side code. Moving forward, there needs to be a lot of work done helped educate people about first, what Swagger is, a specification, and what are&nbsp; each of the areas of tooling that are built on top of the Swagger specification.<br /><br />Even after looking through the almost 1000 Swagger related Github projects, things are still very hazy for me, but I did learn a lot along the way, about what languages, frameworks and platforms developers are using Swagger, and the types of tools and integrations they are developing.</p>
<p>The best way to look at all of these projects is by language&mdash;here is the Github breakdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>411 JavaScript</li>
<li>135 Java</li>
<li>61 Ruby</li>
<li>41 Python</li>
<li>32 PHP</li>
<li>31 Scala</li>
<li>22 C#</li>
<li>17 Shell</li>
<li>13 Clojure</li>
<li>8 Groovy</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t accurate, because many of the JavaScript repositories are actually other languages. I forget to make sure Github knows what language a repo is sometimes too. Regardless, it gives you an idea of which programming languages developers are using to work with Swagger&mdash;one layer to look consider.<br /><br />Beyond the programming languages I want to know which platforms and frameworks developers are applying Swagger. Here are 36 frameworks and platforms I&rsquo;ve identified so far.</p>

<p>Beyond the programming languages, frameworks, and platform integrations I&rsquo;m looking to also understand the types of tools developers are actually building, and take Swagger beyond what the core development team, and working group could do. It is hard to understand the objectives of each of the developer projects I came across, but here are the X areas I&rsquo;ve identified so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converter</li>
<li>Generator</li>
<li>Parser</li>
<li>Schema</li>
<li>Validator</li>
<li>Server</li>
<li>Command-Line</li>
<li>Powershell</li>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Proxy Generator</li>
<li>Aggregator</li>
<li>Tester</li>
</ul>
<p>This added a couple stops along the API life cycle for me, that Swagger is serving. I hadn&rsquo;t envisioned a Swagger powered CLI or Powershell tool. I&rsquo;ve only lightly thought about proxies, and aggregators driven by Swagger. When you bundle this with the platforms above who have integrated Swagger into their products and services, it starts to paint an even bigger picture of what is possible with Swagger.<br /><br />I think I&rsquo;m going to wrap up this dive into the Swagger ecosystem here. I still have all of the contributors, watchers, and people who have forked the core Swagger products, and well as many of the people involved in Swagger discussions via the Swagger Google Group and Twitter account to consider. Plus I think this article will flush out some other projects that are out there, being executed by my readers. Storytelling along the way is the best way to flush out hidden details in my opinion, and is one of the main reasons I&rsquo;m so transparent--I depend on people emailing and tweeting at me about stuff.<br /><br />This exercise has given me a new perspective on the Swagger community, and introduced me to some new companies, and tools. If you are doing anything cool with Swagger, please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll add it <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">to my research</a>. Remember, if you don&rsquo;t tell the story about what your are doing with APIs, nobody knows, including me&mdash;API evangelism 101. This is just my first attempt to better quantify the Swagger community, and I&rsquo;m happy to include what you are up to in future updates.</p>

<p>I've been tracking on the potential for voice APIs since Siri was first announced, a topic that often meant telephony like from Twilio, or audio transcription from Popup Archive and Clarify. When I close my eyes and think about the the future of APIs and voice enablement, it is more akin to the Siri example, where the digital world is (supposedly) just a voice command away.</p>
<p>Imagine making all your employee directory, company calendar, or product catalog available via voice commands. How do you do this? You do it with APIs, and a voice enablement platform in-between the application developers, and the available API resources. Much like all other voice enablement, I think we have a huge amount of work to get anywhere close to the pictures we all have in our head, when if comes to voice enablement.</p>
<p>It is my mission to find these signs across the API landscape, and keep an eye on what they are doing. One platform that is now open for beta is <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK">Amazon Echo</a>. Amazon says, <em>"Echo is designed around your voice. It's always on&mdash;just ask for information, music, news, weather, and more.&rdquo; </em>APIs are how we will deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of this equation. The difference between Apple Siri, and Amazon Echo at this point, is Amazon will let you (API providers) help deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of Amazon Echo discovery equation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK">signing up for the beta</a>, and if I get access, I will share more stories. I encourage you to sign up as well, and if you have any work your doing with Amazon Echo, or know of other API driven voice-enablement platforms I should be paying attention to, let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-micro-definition.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am evolving <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">my own personal microservices definition</a>, something that is constantly changing, as I work on my infrastructure, read other people&rsquo;s own definitions (no shortage these lately), and continuing having conversations with smart folks across the space. I had the pleasure of having Mike Amundsen over the other night for dinner, and after having some interesting discussions about community, and potential micro services design, I&rsquo;m adding a couple of elements to my microservice definition list.</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">last post</a>&nbsp;on this, I listed seven criteria I congress as part of my micro services definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to add two elements to my list, considering some of the other elements I&rsquo;ve noticed at play when it comes to API bloat:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal ownership</li>
<li>minimal dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimal owners is a pretty easy one for me, as I&rsquo;m the owner of all my microservices&mdash;the buck always stops with me. However, It is a good reminder to make sure all of my services have a vCard applied to their <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son file index</a>. It is important to easily known who is responsible for any public or private API, and with APIs.son and Swagger, this is easy to do.</p>
<p>When it comes to minimal dependencies, this gets a little tougher for me. My world isn&rsquo;t too bad, because my systems are small, and I&rsquo;ve been the only developer.  The down side is I&rsquo;ve been the only developer, and I&rsquo;ve bee lazy about how many dependencies an API might have, and also been fairly sloppy about how I integrate with 3rd party APIs. Adding this item to my list will help me keep an eye on how I establish dependencies between services, keeping them minimal, and well documented.</p>
<p>That is it, I just wanted to add ownership and dependencies to my list of considerations&mdash;I just like making a production out of everything.</p>

<p>There are many areas I track on as part of my research. Things that do not show up on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/23/weekly-apireport-for-march-23rd-2015/">weekly API.Reports</a>, or in my analysis on API Evangelist. One of these is the area of drones. I&rsquo;m fascinated by this potential area in the area of Internet of Things, but until now it was more of a side note, or one possible path for APIs and the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>Amongst the numerous drone stories I curate, I'm seeing more shift in the space towards a developer focus. It isn't just about the drone itself, its about customizing, developing and using the drone as a platform. One recent story I noticed was <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/26/drone-maker-3d-robotics-debuts-open-source-development-platform-to-advance-public-app-innovation/">3D Robotics (3DR), one of North America's largest consumer drone manufacturer, announcing the release of a new DroneKit, which includes an API for drone app development</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dronekit.io/">DroneKit</a> has a <a href="https://developer.3drobotics.com/docs">web API defined using Swagger</a>, which is the first Drone API I have actually added to my system. I am sure there are more out there, and now that I&rsquo;m tracking on closer, I'm sure I'll find them. The number of drone related stories that flow through my feeds is getting pretty out of control, and I'm thinking the space needs some standard approaches to APIs identified, to help develop better drone solutions, but also potentially inject some transparency into this growing layer of IoT.</p>
<p><a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/"> </a></p>
<p><a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/"></a><a href="http://3drobotics.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/drone-kit-air-ground-cloud.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>Now that I have an API blueprint for a drone API, in Swagger too! ;-) I will be able to start thinking about what some of the API patterns for drones might look like, and what some of the common building blocks might be for managing the technical, but also business, and political side of drone operation. I&rsquo;m thinking that when it comes to drone operations, APIs might not just be a nice to have, they might be something that becomes mandatory in trying to bring this fast growing, not well defined space, under some control.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whatsapp/whatsapp-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There was a quick post from Mashable the other day about a conversation with <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> cofounder Brian Acton, called WhatsApp cofounder: <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/25/whatsapp-developers-api/">Sorry developers, no API for you</a>. Its pretty common argument you hear from business leaders, regarding why they won&rsquo;t open up APIs. It has been a while since I railed on this line of thinking, so I am taking the opportunity to share why this is such an un-informed, short-sighted view of APIs.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t at the conference, so I a completely dependent on Mashable for this, but apparently someone in the audience asked:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have done a lot of transactional messaging using traditional email and SMS, and we've recently moved into the international market," the engineer explained to the audience, who clapped and hollered. "We're desperate to communicate with our members where WhatsApp would be a wonderful platform. We're good developers."</em></blockquote>
<p>Acton stated that they had no current plans to, adding:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't want to inundate users with messages they don't want," Acton explained of the choice. "I am very empathetic to your cause. I receive emails on a regular basis from people who want to run their business or want to run something using WhatsApp as the backbone for communication, but we're balancing that with the user experience."</em></blockquote>
<p>Before I point out how narrow this thinking, let&rsquo;s focused on why I use the word un-informed to describe this perspective. Let&rsquo;s say the motivation for not opening up an API at WhatsApp is purely about UX, let&rsquo;s explore some of the options on the table, for API providers to strike the balance they are looking for in this area.</p>
<p><strong>API Management Service Composition</strong> <br />With modern API management services, you have a critical concept called "service composition", where you the API provider, can carve up different levels of access to valuable API resources, deciding exactly who has access to what. API do not equal firehose to the public, where anyone can build whatever they want. If you still see APIs in this way, spend some time playing with the more successful APIs out there like Twilio, SendGrid, and expand your definition of just exactly what an API is, and the role service composition plays.</p>
<p><strong>oAuth For Platform Access &amp; End User Control </strong><br />oAuth is a pretty proven way for managing who is accessing API resources, in a way that the end-user has a say in operations. An API does not automatically open access to all users, when a developers signs up for API access. In the beginning, you have access to your own account as a developer, that is it. It is up to end-users to find these applications, and using oAuth, give (or revoke) access to whatever application they choose. As a platform owner you should consider giving end-users oversight, via oAuth, into how you the platform provider is accessing their data, and require <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> partners to follow this path. If you need example of this in action go look at your Google Account profile, you&rsquo;ll see Google Apps in the oAuth list.</p>
<p><strong>Branding And Design Guidelines</strong><br />What are the official internal branding and design guidelines you use to direct your own WhatsAp development teams&mdash;you have them right? So share these with developers, and give them a chance to share in your master UX vision of how the WhatsApp UX vision, is the one to rule them all. You should be able to articulate the platform UX vision as a set of professionally crafted, publicly shared, design guides, that everyone can see, and use to understand the vision--you never know maybe here would be someone out there in the world that could iterate on them in a meaningful way, that even you might even agree with.</p>
<p><strong>Starter Kits and UX Frameworks<br /></strong>Additionally, go beyond just design guides, and provide developers with HTML, CSS, Images, and JavaScript goodies that will demonstrate how visionary the WhatsApp UX vision is. Think <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.  I&rsquo;m not saying that Twitter nailed it on this front. They did well, but their overall timing and execution left a lot to be desired. As a platform provider who possesses a UX vision that works, open up the platform, provide developers with the proper starter kit, or UX framework that they need to succeed. As a developer, I fail to deliver on your UX vision, it is more a failure of your platform to provide me with proper tooling, than it is my fault as a dev.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Sandbox &amp; Simulation Environments </strong><br />A common approach to managing developer on-boarding, and overall quality control through an API and resulting app lifecycle, is done by providing developers with a sandbox. When nothing is live, and developers do not have any access to actual end-users, what harm is done? What harm to the overall UX experience is there, when developers are only building in sandbox and simulation environments? Until they prove themselves, no developer should move to a production environment, until their solutions is proven to meet WhatsApp strict UX guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Application &amp; Developer Certification</strong><br />Now let&rsquo;s talk about how WhatsApp could certify developers, giving them access to more resources, or possibly investment from the WhatsApp platform. Many leading platforms require developers to get certified, and / or their applications certified before they get full access to production environments, and end-users. How you craft your developer and application certification is a reflection of your overall UX requirements, and platform goals.</p>
<p><strong>Application Showcase</strong> <br />When you have proper branding and design guidelines, starter kits and supporting UI / UX frameworks, proper developer environments, and official application and developer certification, you should end up with a handful of apps worth showcasing. Maybe its not just a single, competing application, it could be integration with an existing platform (SalesForce, ZendDesk, etc.), or just providing access to valuable messages and conversations. With proper API ecosystem management, an application showcase provides an incentive for developers to build applications that work properly, and reflect the well defined UX vision of WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Program </strong><br />With a robust ecosystem of certified developers, and applications that meet the strict UX guidelines of WhatsApp, surely there will be the cream on top of what is developed on the APIs. Which apps, and platform integrations are the best designed, and provide the most value to WhatsApp end-users? These are the ones that WhatsApp should be investing in, bringing them closer to internal operations, and providing them with additional access to resources, investment when it makes sense. What does the WhatsApp partner program look like currently? I'm sure there is one, just not a formal approach, which includes any transparency, or public involvement.</p>
<p><strong>Zooming Back Out </strong><br />That represents just a handful of the common API management building blocks that are commonly put to work by API providers to help manage their API ecosystems. It doesn&rsquo;t just take technology to make APIs work, it takes a healthy business, and political approach to make sure any API actually works as an ecosystem. I could go on for days about how proper support, communication, and other proven elements, could also be used by WhatsApp to strike the API developer balance system they are looking for, and even possibly create a positive feedback loop with the community, that could be applied to the roadmap.</p>
<p>Now that we are paused, and zoomed out a little bit, let&rsquo;s talk about the narrow perception demonstrated by WhatsApp current stance on APIs. If you open up APIs, developers will just come and mess with your UX version. Nothing else will happen? This is where we shift from being educated about common building blocks, to the limited perceptions that results from this lack of awareness&mdash;you just don't know, what you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><strong>You Have APIs, You Just Aren&rsquo;t Open </strong><br />WhatsApp uses APIs. This is how the mobile app works. The company just does not want to share these resources with developers, because they fear losing control over the UX experience. I guarantee that WhatsApp is sharing data and resources with 3rd party provider, they are just very picky about who these are, and they don't have a formal process for doing so, so they keep their cards very close to their chest&mdash;aka, not open.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore the darker side of the WhatsApp API conversation. I&rsquo;m not alluding that WhatsApp has less than honorable intentions, my goal is to shine a line into the dark areas that exist, regardless of WhatsApp lack of education of modern API practices, and missing the wider picture of how APIs are actually put to work. This moves into the area of responsibility I feel that platforms assume, when they step up and invite end-users to sign up, depend on, and stay engage with any online, public, API driven web, mobile, or device based application.</p>
<p><strong>Data Access &amp; Portability </strong><br />WhatsApp end-user deserve access to their accounts, and their messages. APIs are not just about developers building the cool app that will compete with WhatsApp, or mess up the WhatsApp UX vision. APIs provide basic data access and portability to the information end-users generate via the WhatsApp platform. Platforms that do not empower end-user data portability, do not operate in the best interest of their own customers, removing from the overall user experience. Something you don't see, because your UX vision is so narrowly aligned with your business goals, not widely aligned with your end-users needs.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Reciprocity </strong><br />Using services like IFTTT and Zapier, API driven platforms are enabling users to to migrate their information between the services they depend on, and add to their own user experience on each platform they depend on, and most importantly between them. APIs, and oAuth enable the flow of information between cloud platforms in a way that protects the interests of users, as well as that of the platforms. APIs aren't just about developers building apps, they are also about users enhancing their own overall experience, on their terms&mdash;moving beyond the platform owners single UX vision.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity &amp; Platform Balance</strong> <br />I just can't imagine any single company, in 2015, thinking they have single UX vision, and nobody could possibly contribute to that, from an outside perspective. As a product owner, I would love to get as much input from my community regarding the next generation UX, because in the end, it is ultimately up to me what I incorporate into the roadmap, what are best practices in the API community, and ultimately which apps get certified, showcased in the application gallery, and pushed to end-users. When you operate a global platform like WhatsApp you can't address the diverse needs of end-users over time, around the globe, without the help of users augmenting and evolving exactly what is the WhatsApp UX vision. When you are a white dude in the U.S., you just aren't going to understand the UX for women of color in Africa, I don't care how much vision you think you have.</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion, Just Shy of Innovation </strong><br />I&rsquo;m going to end this there. I&rsquo;m not even going to pull out the innovation card and talk about all the potential for new ideas, a WhatsApp API could generate. I&rsquo;ll stick with talking about a handful of common building blocks used across the space to mitigate the UX concerns that API driven platform providers have, and pointing out how narrow the UX concerns are. There are plenty of other reasons for having an API, beyond just developers building apps, that will mess with your UX vision.</p>
<p>Users should have a choice to use their preferred messaging channel (WhatsApp) in any platform they depend on, and be able to manage their experience using 3rd party services of their choice. With an informed&nbsp;approach to API management, you can do all of this, giving end-users more, without compromising the overall WhatsApp UX&mdash;you can carefully craft and evolve it, with the help of your community. As it stands, WhatsApp has an API, it is what the mobile app uses, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that WhatsApp does provide access to 3rd party partners of their choice, they just don't open that up to public knowledge&mdash;they are already doing what they say they don't do, they just aren't open and transparent about the process.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much to launch a proper developer portal, with the essential building blocks like documentation, code samples, and self-service registration. You don&rsquo;t have to give production access to every new developers&mdash;make them build something cool, and prove themselves first. That way you only deliver only the best to WhatsApp users. People are already building unsanctioned apps on WhatsApp (just Google WhatsApp API), not having an API isn&rsquo;t stopping these potentially bad seeds from entering the UX paradigm, there is just no sanctioned place for users to go, when they are looking to extend, augment, or make their WhatsApp work with other services they use, or assume control over their own account and data.</p>
<p>Alright, I'll stop ranting there. I know I&rsquo;m biased, but if you have a popular public mobile application in 2015, there is no reason you shouldn't have at least a public face of your developer program, to answer these question. In the end you are just hurting your own operations, as well as the overall experience for your users. Additionally, I just can't see how the leading position of any mobile is defensible for very long without an API. Things are just too volatile, and end-users are just too picky, someone will always come along and disrupt you, unless you can shift to deliver the UX consumers are demanding.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/27/politics-of-apis-talk-of-api-driven-regulation-is-increasing/">Politics of APIs: Talk Of API Driven Regulation Is Increasing</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist, I was all about the Business of APIs, something I still focus on, but increasingly over the last couple years I am focusing more on what I call the politics of APIs. In my opinion, the politics of APIs can be anything from terms of service and privacy policies, to rate limits, pricing, and security, all the way up to court cases, <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com">patents</a>, and government regulation.</p>
<p>Today I want to focus on the very top of that spectrum&mdash;government regulation. The government isn't just getting into the API game, by deploying their own APIs, they are going to also increasingly be getting more involved with private sector APIs. In my weekly monitoring I'm seeing more chatter across several industries, like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382327/44695_Accessible.pdf">the UK treasury getting involved in banking API standards</a>, and <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/03/25/the-final-stage-of-meaningful-use-rules-will-ehrs-finally-pay-off/">a push in the healthcare industry for more interoperability via APIs</a>--just to highlight two recent stories.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t anything new, governments been defining API standards and pitching them to industries for a while now. I personally have been involved in healthcare and energy related standards, as part of Blue Button and Green Button data services. In coming years, what is going to increase, is the number of industries that the government is helping define standard, as well as beginning to get a little more heavy handed about mandating APIs as part of the regulatory process..</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of government regulation, something I feel gets abused on both sides of the tracks, but I understand it is a necessary actor when it comes to balance in markets. To help address some of the abuse that occurs, I think APIs could significantly help bring much needed transparency, and self-service access to the process, for both the public and private sector. I feel the conversation in coming years will move beyond the government just defining industry API standards, but also pushing for real-time interoperability, and execution by companies who operate in heavily regulated industries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to keep track of the patterns I see emerging when it comes to API driven regulation, and try to stay informed regarding what is coming down the pipes across business sectors. At various points along the way, I&rsquo;ll do roundups of regulator related news, analysis, and API definitions, or platforms that focus on industry regulation. When it comes to API driven regulation, there will be no black or white, just high a high frequency blur, which will need transparency, and a machine readable interface to make any sense of.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/24/reflecting-on-api-management-and-the-apigee-ipo/">reflecting on API management and the Apigee IPO</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking deeper on how the API space has come to be a &ldquo;thing". To kick off this story, you have to start with the API itself, something very abstract, hard to see, let alone convey to the average person. A single API is difficult to quantify, let alone an entire sector, or the companies rising up to service this perceived sector&mdash;think of the argument from early API management service providers like Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee had to make to their VCs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the API space has always been a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to me, but along the road from 2010-2015, there has been plenty times, where I question the way things are. I have to give it to Mashery, they saw it early on, then 3Scale and Apigee joined in, and in 2015 we have a real industry, with <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">35 API management service providers</a>, in addition to the expanding number of service providers catering to API design, deployment, management, discovery, integration, and other evolving layers of the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>In 2015, I feel like the API sector is a real thing. Not because 3Scale is still growing, Mashery was acquired by Intel, Apigee is IPOing, or that there is over 35 API management service providers, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">including a number of open source solutions</a>. The API sector is a real thing because there are many other companies, in many supporting area who have emerged, and the overall awareness around the potential of API, by business leaders has grown significantly. How did this happen? It happened because people were telling the story of APIs, whether it was marketing for their products services, or stories on ProgrammableWeb and API Evangelist&mdash;working in concert to create an industry (something).</p>
<p>Within the same thought, I try to grasp how it was that I created API Evangelist. There sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t any strategy to do it. Early on I had a vision in my mind, but five years later, that vision is radically different. I did what I had to do, when the time came, and told the stories that mattered (at least I tried). I am not trying to connect API Evangelist to the overall existence of the API management space, I&rsquo;m trying to work through the details how you define something to a wide audience, in this very abstract world of APIs. I think this applies at the highest levels of industry like API management, to the lowest levels, at the microservice level (soon to be nanoservice, trust me it will be something ;-)&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t something, until it is something, and people believe.</p>
<p>I know. All of this sounds like bullshit. If you think about it though, it begins to make sense (hopefully). Web APIs weren&rsquo;t a thing until John Musser aggregated them together into a directory in 2005. API management wasn&rsquo;t a thing until Mashery, 3Scale, and APigee made it into something. API evangelism wasn&rsquo;t a thing until API providers like Twilio and Sendgrid started sending out armies of evangelists to hackathons. API design wasn&rsquo;t a thing until Tony Tam gave us Swagger to help us visualize our APIs, and Jakub Nesetril of <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a> allowed us to design, mock, and collaborate around an API Blueprint. None of these things were things, until people stepped up and worked really hard to convince others, that they were a thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand this in action across the API space. The Apigee IPO, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/26/swagger-shifts-hands-from-reverb-to-smartbear/">Swagger changing hands</a>, and other shifts in the landscape are making me think a little deeper about how we got where we are at.  How did we all build momentum in API management, design, or now apply to world of API discovery? How do you make government APIs a thing? How do we ensure hypermedia becomes / is a thing? I mean, not just one possible design constraint, but well understood by all developers, and when it makes most sense to put to use. How has Swagger evolved? What is next for Swagger?  These are all things that make me curious for what the future holds, and how I can help get us there safely, with as few scratches as possible.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/26/swagger-shifts-hands-from-reverb-to-smartbear/">Swagger Shifts Hands From Reverb to SmartBear</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-highway-open.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><!--,p--></p>
<p>The news came out yesterday that <a href="http://smartbear.com">SmartBear</a> was taking over ownership of <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, from Reverb. Swagger has been outgrowing its home at  Reverb for some time now, becoming much more than I think even Tony originally imagined. You can find the <a href="http://smartbear.com/news/news-releases/">official announcement from SmartBear on their site</a>, and <a href="http://blog.helloreverb.com/swagger-smartbear/">Tony&rsquo;s thoughts over on the Reverb blog</a>. No need for me to recap, but I did want to provide some of my personal thoughts on the shift in this very important project.</p>
<p>I feel like we are embarking on the next stage in the evolution of Swagger. Over the last couple of years, the Swagger community has see growth, adoption, and investment at an unprecedented pace, culminating in version 2.0 of the spec and now its transfer SmartBear. The scope and passion of the Swagger community and the investment that Tony Tam specifically and also the API community have made -- these have all brought us to this moment.</p>
<p>I've known the SmartBear team for years, and after speaking with them about this transition of the Swagger specification, I believe SmartBear is the right steward for Swagger, during its next stage of its evolution. SmartBear understands the gravity of what they are now taking charge of: the Swagger specification representing a central truth throughout the entire API lifecycle.</p>
<p>SmartBear fully understands too that it was organic growth that made Swagger the force that it has become, and SmartBear is aware that a unique balance of leadership, open governance, and a strong community pull will be just as essential during the next stage of growth. I look forward to working with the Swagger community and SmartBear team to ensure Swagger continues playing a vital role across the API space, meeting the demands of the fast-growing API economy.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I see Swagger as a central truth in the API economy, something I&rsquo;m invested in beyond just my own IT infrastructure, as Swagger is also the cornerstone of the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a>, that Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I created to assist in the next generation of API discovery. I am behind Swagger because I believe in Tony&rsquo;s vision, and I also believe that the Swagger community will make this transition more about shifting gears for the Swagger spec and tooling, than it is about who is in charge of the project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tuned into the Swagger community since its inception, and the community support, contributions, and chatter has become pretty loud over the last year. I trust that SmartBear has experienced this scope as well, and understands the importance of Swagger having an open governance model, which would make this current transition all about shifting Swagger into 2nd gear,  and setting up of open governance representing about shifting into 3rd gear, putting the ability to shift into 4th and 5th gear up to the Swagger community itself.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to what SmartBear and the Swagger community can achieve out on the open API highway!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/24/reflecting-on-api-management-and-the-apigee-ipo/">Reflecting On API Management And The Apigee IPO</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apigee-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It has been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/12/23/api-management-service-provider-roundup-for-2011/">a little over three years since I published my first roundup of API management providers</a>. I&rsquo;ve been tracking on this new breed of companies long before I started API Evangelist, but in 2011 I started formalizing how I monitored what these companies were up to. In 2015, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I now track on over 35 API management service providers</a>, offering everything from simple proxies, to the full API management infrastructure stack you get from 3Scale.</p>
<p>I have met most of the API management providers, and after 5 years of covering them, it is no secret I have my favorites (you know who you are ;-). The business side of being an API management service provider has never really excited me, so I tend to stay away from the investment and acquisition stories, or speculating to much on who is winning the cash game. With that said, <a href="http://apigee.com/about/press-release/apigee-files-registration-statement-proposed-initial-public-offering">I think the Apigee IPO is a pretty significant milestone for the industry</a>, something I have to give pause to, and reflect on how far we&rsquo;ve come, and evaluate how an IPO compares to the acquisitions we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, or the other significant industry milestones.</p>
<p>The acquisitions of Mashery, Layer7, Vordel, and Apiphany showed the space was really maturing, and the recent name change by SOA Software to Akana, shows the space has evolved over the last ten years. I think the Apigee IPO shows the overall space is actually growing up. I don&rsquo;t think Apigee had many other alternatives, with a gagillion dollars in funding, but I still think still it shows the space is moving out of its juvenile phase. I guess the actual IPO will be the true test of how grown up we all actually are eh?</p>
<p>For me, another thing to note is where 3Scale is at. You see, I consider Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee to be the OG three of API management service providers. Yeah, I know you have been around longer--SOA, Vordel, and other gateway solutions, but those three are the "OG API management&rdquo;. 3Scale has been plugging along slow and steady, taking on only the funding it needs, while Mashery was acquired, and now while Apigee is IPOing. I know I&rsquo;m biased when it comes to 3Scale, but I think their longevity, and success is as notable as any IPO, or acquisition milestones--its been a long haul.</p>
<p>Another thing to think about is the amount of open source tooling that is available in 2015--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">I was pleased by the amount of new players when I did my last roundup</a>. I was also happy to work with WSO2 early on to understand what the space needed with its open source API management solution, and also the API Umbrella platform as part of the federal government work I&rsquo;ve done. The amount of open source tooling that is available is a clear sign for me, that the API management is truly growing up, and API management is really a thing (was a little shaky there for a while, couldn&rsquo;t tell if I was dreaming, or awake ;-).</p>
<p>I would like to end this reflection, on the most important sign for me that the API space will continue its growth, and reach new heights in coming years. The fact that the conversation has moved way beyond just API management, with companies, services, and tooling emerging throughout the API life-cycle, stimulating design, deployment, discovery, integration, and management conversations that are generating the growth I speak of. Things were only about API management for a while, something that really worried me, but in 2015 the conversation goes much wider and deeper, pushing into even more exciting territory like visualizations, containerization, and objects.</p>
<p>In closing, congrats to Apigee, wishing you best of luck in your IPO--Its been a fun ride, and I&rsquo;m looking froward to it not ending anytime soon.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale, and WSO2 are API Evangelist partners.</em></p>

<p>Ok, it seems like Monday is going to be the regular posting day for my weekly API.Report. No matter how hard I try to get done over the weekend, something always seems to get in the way. Regardless, I'm still going to do, as the process is more than worth it.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>A couple of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3D printing</strong></span> footnotes for the week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://3dprint.com/51988/3d-printed-twitter-mood-lamp/">3D Printed Twitter Mood Lamp Assesses the Emotional State of Denver Residents</a> - Not sure this is a realistic implementation, but I think the combo of 3D printing and social APIs, is an interesting crossover.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/03/18/adding-recycling-codes-to-3d-prints/">Adding Recycling Codes To 3D Prints</a> - Another potential interesting cross section of APIs and 3D printing. Seems like you could really go to down making 3D printed items that have a barcode, that is linked to online resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span> is a critical aspect of the API space that needs more discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/16/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/">Accessibility APIs: A Key To Web Accessibility</a> - This is an important aspect of the API conversation that isn't discussed, let alone APIs delivering a solution. I'm going to break this down, and try to incorporate accessibly into my research more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>acquisitions</strong></span> I wanted to showcase this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/16/linkedin-acquires-hr-startup-careerify/">LinkedIn acquires HR startup Careerify</a> - Just keeping tabs on who buys who when it comes to API providers.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dataplumbing.com/blog/example-of-architecture-for-aaas-analytics-as-a-service">Example of architecture for AaaS (Analytics as a Service)</a> - I thought the title was a joke at first, but actually provides an interesting blueprint to use for API driven analytics. I'd ditch the acronym though. ;-)</li>

We've seen this market stabilize with the world of social, but with the number of APIs out there, the Dataminr, Datasift, and other models will become relevant in other areas of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be tracking on more <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>annotation</strong></span> related discussions in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/16/youtube-introduces-interactive-cards-to-complement-annotations-and-they-work-on-mobile-too/">YouTube introduces interactive cards to complement annotations &ndash; and they work on mobile too</a> - I think normally I'd consider this an embeddable story, I'm going to be looking for annotation specific elements that are API driven. I am working on thoughts for an annotation layer for the API discovery layer, so I am beginning gather my thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API aggregation</strong></span> action, mostly from Google:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ProgrammableWeb/~3/EHwhV4mHNoQ/18">Peach Payments Launches Smart Payments Platform</a> - Aggregation happens in the most mature spaces, and payment is definitely one of the older space web APIs have been influencing.&nbsp;</li>

        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://trafficandweather.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/traffic-and-weather/Traffic-and-Weather.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/posts/2015/3/19/episode-28-everybody-likes-to-listen-to-people-searching-for-things-on-twitter">listening to too infrequent Traffic and Weather API podcast today</a>, and one of the topics John and Steve covered was an interesting approach to API consumption, and getting past API rate limits, with <a href="https://github.com/singingwolfboy/webhookdb">WebhookDB</a>. I agree with John, that WebhookDB is pretty clever, and represents what I'd consider classic API developer ingenuity, when it comes to getting access to the resources they need. I&rsquo;d have to give this one to my friend and API adversary Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>), when he says rate limits stimulate developer creativity. +1 Tyler.</p>
<p>So, what does WebhookDB do?</p>
<blockquote><em>...allows you to replicate Github's database over HTTP using webhooks. It's useful if you want to treat Github's APIs as a database, querying over pull requests and issues. Github doesn't like that, and you'll quickly hit the API's rate limits -- but if you use WebhookDB, you don't have to worry about it! Just populate the initial data into the database, set up the webhook replication to keep it in sync, and query your local database however you'd like...</em></blockquote>
<p>There is more back-story over at the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201412/rest_api_gotcha_and_webhookdb.html">REST API gotcha, and webhookdb story</a> that Traffic and Weather linked to. I agree with John&rsquo;s thoughts, that this is an opportunity for a service provider to step up and deliver on. I envision a pretty simple, open source, containerized version, as well as a cloud-based version that people could tap into, and pay for more premium services on top of each index.</p>
<p>John is right, there will be significant overhead in defining the schema of each API you would support. Let me know, I can help with some of the targeting, alongside what I&rsquo;m doing for my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>. Each API would need some special attention, but with containers, you could easily build out a pretty slick deployment solution that runs in cloud, or in infrastructure of choice for end-users. With some heavy lifting up front, it would be a pretty viable solution for API consumers, but I also think provide an interesting cache opportunity for API providers--think <a href="http://datasift.com/">Datasift</a>.</p>
<p>I also see a higher, more analyst level view here, in helping establish a common definition of web hook patterns across the space, and identify common patterns, then bring much needed education and potential consistency to the API space when it comes to webhook execution. Kind of like what I work to do for API design, deployment, management, integration, and other key areas of the API space. People are hungry for this type of information, and I&rsquo;m happy to aggregate the work of anyone who steps up and delivers in this way.</p>
<p>I would also take this one step further, and charge someone with stepping up into more of a web hook advocacy role, where you could push back on some API providers to offer webhooks (many don&rsquo;t), and improve existing web hook designs, again helping establish consistency in the space. In my experience many API providers want to understand the bigger picture, but don&rsquo;t often have the time or awareness, and with a little education, and guidance, you could make a significant impact.</p>
<p>I look at webhooks as the important second lane, making APIs a two-way street, shifting API operations to be just as much push, as it is pull. Web hooks play a different role in potentially each APIs operations and ecosystems, but for many platforms, they will continue to play an important role in giving developers more control over API resources, while also eliminating much of the burden upon API providers.</p>
<p>Great idea John and Steve, thanks for sharing. One more reason to tune into <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>&mdash;startup ideas!!</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-bright.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">slowly migrating my own infrastructure, towards a microservice first approach</a>, something you can follow the details of on my <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha.apievangelist.com blog</a>. I've been running on my own custom brew content management system (CMS) since I started API Evangelist in 2010. There are many APIs in use across my system, both external publicly available APIs like Twitter and Crunchbase, and a wide variety of internal APIs I've developed myself.</p>
<p>As I work to replicate each aspect of my CMS, carving off each potential micro service, I'm reminded of how much of what I do lives in the shadows. Little scripts I've written here, and there, jobs I haven't run in months, and just general code exhaust from years of operation. I&rsquo;m a little different than most shops, as I'm a one person operation, who codes all my own stuff, but based upon my experience in other shops, the same behavior exists in almost any organization.</p>
<p>Throughout this migration I&rsquo;m reminded of what I'd consider to be one of the biggest security lapses in my world, which is just about things being known. As I build out new features, jobs, bells, and whistles, are they all cataloged, mapped out, and consistently used, or deprecated. Anything that is unknown, unaccounted for, lives in the shadows of my operations, and potentially provides a security risk. Often times the culprit in any security lapse, is an unknown workstation, server, application, or single script.</p>
<p>Having a single doorway (micro service), with a single approach to authentication (<a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure</a>), and a map of my entire surface area, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> + <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, I&rsquo;m getting a much better handle on things. It will take a while to clean up all my legacy stuff, and map everything out, but once I do, I can easily audit, monitor, deprecate, and ultimately secure the entire surface area of my infrastructure, because it is all done with an API first approach. Then I&rsquo;ll continue to address other aspects of my security like SSL, app management, and other critical areas, but for now, I feel like being able to map out my infrastructure, is doing wonders for bringing my infrastructure out of the shadows.</p>

<p>I am putting a lot of thought into the value of an API request and response lately. I've talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/postman-collections-as-unit-of-measurement-for-transactions-in-the-api-economy/">the potential of a Postman collection as a unit of measurement, for the API economy</a>. I&rsquo;m also spending time breaking down the monetization strategies of <a href="http://theapistack.com/">the 700+ companies I track on</a>, but I&rsquo;m really looking to get beyond just the API pricing, and actually measure any evidence of real value that I can.</p>
<p>This particular post is born out of a conversation with John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1rgh3wM">Runscope</a>, while we were in Sydney Australia last month for <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days Sydney</a>. John had mentioned that when people asked him which are the best APIs out there, he replies &ldquo;none of them, until they are used&rdquo;. Which when you think about it, it really is the truth--APIs do not offer ay value, until they are actually put to use in an app, or system integration.</p>
<p>It is easy to place the value in the actual API definition, or in the request, or response from the API. There is also a lot of talk about much of the value being in the documentation, or possibly the SDK. You can event point to the value being that it is a public API, with easy on-boarding, that you can rely on, and scale as you need. All of this may contribute units to the overall value, but at this point any API still doesn't have value to anyone.</p>
<p>As John says, the point at which an API has value, is when it is used. Until that point, an API isn&rsquo;t a thing. I&rsquo;m not saying the API call as a metric, is the single metric to rule them all, but it is at this point when I feel you can really begin to measure the value an API delivers, and capture the exhaust from it. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what I mean by all of this, it really is just an exercise for me to break down the moving parts of each API, so that I can better understand how APIs will potentially fuel the API economy--think what Runscope does, but for the monetization portion of each API transaction.</p>

<p>I'm working with multiple partners to define what I&rsquo;d consider to be the firsts stops along the API lifecycle, when you use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as the scaffolding for your API operations. APIs.json is a machine readable format for indexing APIs, that exist under a specific website domain, or are part of a aggregate collection designed for a specific project or objective.</p>
<p>To help me, and the folks I&rsquo;m working with to better see the API lifecycle that APIs.json is enabling, I wanted to take a stroll through each of the stops along the API lifecycle, and think through the potential for additional formats, services, and tooling throughout the entire journey. I want to explore the possibilities for individual API providers, API consumers, as well as API service providers, and the aggregate level, where companies and individuals are delivering valuable tools and services to the overall space.</p>
<p>First, lets start with what I envision APIs.json enabling at the direct one to one, API provider and consumer levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Metadata - </strong>Quick access to the most important info about any API, its title, description, image, endpoint, url and tags.</li>
<li><strong>API Surface Area - (The Truth) -</strong> Using Swagger and API Blueprint, any developer can quickly quantify the surface area of an API or microservice.</li>
<li><strong>Execute API -</strong> Include Postman Collections, allowing each API to be execute ready, allowing consumers to load in Postman and deliver the value behind any API.</li>
<li><strong>On-Board API -</strong> One click reference to where an API consumer can onboard with an API.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Server-Side Code - </strong>Locating of existing server-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Generate Server-Side Code -</strong> Locating of services for generating of server-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting Container Images - </strong>Where Docker, and other container images reside, providing instant deployment opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Client Side Code - </strong>Locating of existing client-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-generate Client Side Code - </strong>Locating of services for generating of client-side code in multiple language.</li>
<li><strong>API Pricing -</strong> Understand pricing, access tiers, and partnership opportunities around API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Services - </strong>Access, and make sense of terms of services that apply to API usage.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing - </strong>Understand the licensing of an API, data, content, and code related with an API.</li>
<li><strong>General Questions -</strong> Be able to ask, and get answers to common questions about any API.</li>
<li><strong>API Conversations - </strong>Understand where to engage in conversations, and experience streams from common sources like Github and forums.</li>
<li><strong>Augment APIs - </strong>Add endpoints, verbs, and parameters to existing endpoints, augmenting what any single API provider can deliver.</li>
<li><strong>API Presets -</strong> Establish preset value for API entries, allowing the single, or bulk publishing of data, content and other values to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Mapping and Domain Specific Language (DSL) - </strong>Bridging API definitions, and APIs, providing much needed aggregation and reciprocity for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Sandboxes -</strong> Establish API sandboxes, based upon existing API designs, allowing developers to develop against alternative API than a production environment.</li>
<li><strong>API Simulations - </strong>Beyond just a sandbox, actually establish alternative APIs that provide specific simulations of production scenarios that an API would serve.</li>
<li><strong>API Cookbooks - </strong>Assemble API cookbooks that help onboard API consumers using wizards, blueprints, and other established orchestration patterns.</li>
<li><strong>API Testing -</strong> Initiate API testing tools and services, covering surface area of each API.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring - </strong>Initiate API monitoring tools and services, covering surface area of each API.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Security - </strong>Audit surface area of any API that is indexed using APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>API Adjacent Monitoring - </strong>Initiate monitoring of other API adjacent resources like documentation, terms of services, and other essential building blocks of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize API Surface Area -</strong> Simple, embeddable visualizations that help us see the surface area an API provides.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize API Resources - </strong>Simple, embeddable visualizations that help us interact with the resources APIs deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze API Surface Area - </strong>Simple, plug and plug tooling and services for analyzing the surface area of any API.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze API Resources -</strong> Simple, plug and play tooling and services for analyzing the resources APIs deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Load API Response In Spreadsheet - </strong>Resource for loading, and importing API resources into an Excel or Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong>Craft experiences -</strong> Weave together experiences made up of multiple API resources, and the resources that are available to support them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list represents my master vision for stops along the API lifecycle, that could be served via APIs.json, providing value directly to API providers, and their consumers. Each of these areas would benefit both sides of the API coin, but as you can see will add value to the APIs.json engine, in a way that goes well beyond just API discovery--which APIs.json is known for.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to articulate, and map out the opportunities that will be available when APIs.json is fully realized. Our goal is to push the number of APIs.json files available to a critical point, where this full lifecycle vision is a reality. Once this occurs, I see another plane of existence emerging, one that can be applied across hundreds, or thousands or public or private APIs and micro services.</p>
<p>Once a critical mass with the number of APIs.json files is achieved, the wider opportunities for expansion, growth, and monetization will span three main areas in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions - </strong>Additional API definitions like Swagger, API Blueprint, and API Commons, providing machine readable access to vital components of API operations, that can be baked into the overall API lifecycle. 
<ul>
<li><strong>API Pricing -</strong> A machine readable format for breaking down pricing, access tiers, and partnership opportunities around APis indexed with APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>API Questions - </strong>A machine readable format for aggregating questions around API operations, including terms of service, privacy policy, and other elements that impact API integration.</li>
<li><strong>API Conversations - </strong>A machine readable for for aggregating conversations that occur around API operations, that occur on multiple channels like Github, Stack Overflow, Twitter and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>API Services -</strong>&nbsp;The opportunity for new API services to be developed on top of the APIs.json lifecycle.   
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing -</strong> Introduction of testing related services to known, and custom APIs definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring -</strong> One time and schedule monitoring services, triggered via APIs.json indexing.</li>
<li><strong>Security -</strong> Scanning of entire API surface area defined by an APIs.json definition.</li>
<li><strong>Broker - </strong>Use of APIs.json in API broker related activity, crafting custom API backends and stacks.</li>
<li><strong>Analyst - </strong>Delivery of vital industry and area data and content, using APis.json format, connecting analysis directly to sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>API Tooling&nbsp;<strong>-</strong></strong>&nbsp;The opportunity for new API tooling to be developed on top of the APIs.json lifecycle.  
<ul>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> Continued growth in the number of API search engines like APIs.io, providing options, and competition.</li>
<li><strong>Collections -</strong> Establishment of common tooling for doing API roundups, collections, stacks, or any other grouping that is defined.</li>
<li><strong>Notebook -</strong> Deployment of tools for saving, organizing, and remixing using APIs.json formats, either publicly or privately.</li>
<li><strong>Spots / Hubs - </strong>Deployment of API spots and hubs that allow aggregation of API definitions, supporting building blocks, and API consumers in a wide variety of API areas.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards -</strong> Deployment of dynamic, APIs.json driven dashboards that generate visualizations, listings, and other detail via machine readable API definition formats.</li>

</ul>
<p>That is just a sampling of the definition, services, and tooling opportunities that are already, and will eventually emerge around an APIs.json driven lifecycle. The objective of this post was to flush out my ideas around the one to one, and the wider API economy opportunities using in APIs.json driven API lifecycle, for my own purposes, but also to communicate my thoughts to a handful of partners who are executing definitions, services, and tooling already.</p>
<p>If you are curious about what this all means, and get more clarification about how your company, its services and tooling fit into this, feel free to reach out, and I&rsquo;ll do what I can to help you understand where you fit. Some of the stops along this API driven supply chain, I&rsquo;m depending on existing efforts like Swagger and API Blueprint to execute, some of the areas I&rsquo;m pushing forward myself like API Commons, API Pricing, API Questions, and API Conversations, while other areas I&rsquo;m depending on 3rd party individuals and companies to step up and own. If you think you might be interested in delivering an API definition, service, or tooling somewhere in the areas I&rsquo;ve defined, feel free to reach out.</p>
<p>This post is a product of several conversations I&rsquo;m having with folks, and the regular conversations that Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of 3Scale, and I are having around the APIs.json format. Additionally we are currently working on the roadmap for APIs.io with Nicolas Grenie (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), which is the first of many tools that are being built on the APIs.json format. <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">You can influence the roadmap for APIs.json via the Github repo</a>, and the individual communities of each of the sub APIs.json API definitions formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, on their own working sites and repos.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for listening! ;-)</p>

<p>I was just talking with my friend Oliver Seiler (@0seiler) in New Zealand via email. Oliver is great at keeping me in tune with API related stories out of New Zealand. I was making sure he knew how much I appreciate people like him sending me regular updates, and that it is what makes API Evangelist go around&mdash;to which he replied, reminding of how important the work we are doing here in the US API space.</p>
<p>Oliver told me what I hear a lot, <em>"We still need to sell our story every single day and you wouldn't believe how much anything that comes from particularly you and 18F, but also ProgrammableWeb and GDS in the UK matters to our work."</em> This isn't an isolated case, I hear this a lot from people I talk to in government, enterprises, and other institutions around then globe--the stories we tell are used to make change in how they think and potentially operate. Our stories from the trenches, become the stories they use to sell APis to their bosses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These reminders are what keeps me going after almost five years of evangelizing. The stories we are sharing about API best practices, and the challenges we face across API design, deployment, management, monetization, evangelism, discovery, and integration, are important to not just the health of the overall API space, but to each public and private sectors that APIs are touching in 2015.</p>
<p>The message for me here, is that we all need to keep pushing forward, but also making sure we tell the stories publicly, sharing our knowledge in real-time, because people are watching, and depending on us to help influence how things work in their businesses, institutions, and government agencies around the world. #NoPressure</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sam-api-gov.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Running the perfect API operation is pretty much a delusional dream. Even leaders &nbsp;like Twilio and AWS have platform, and ecosystem produced problems on a regular basis. In my opinion, API are all about the journey, and we may never get our strategy 100% perfect, we can communicate, and evolve along the way&mdash;this is what I consider the API journey.</p>
<p>To help demonstrate this in action, here a p<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/yBlLdvG2lmk">ost from the GSA, about the SAM API, on the US Government API Forum</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We've, rightfully, heard complaints about the SAM API languishing and the documentation not being as functional as it needs to be. We want to make sure users of the API feel comfortable using it to build real applications off of. We've adjusted how we're staffing the API as well as raised the priority the API in the eyes of our developers.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To you, this means this:</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>1) At a minimum, we're sweeping through new GitHub issues weekly, but we will do everything to go through those issues more rapidly.<br /></em><em>2) We're going to increase our transparency by making sure that anything in our backlog that's API-related is in a GitHub issue - if it's prioritized with a date, that'll be made clear, too. We want to make sure you know what's coming and on what days - and the docs will be updated to reflect what's currently implemented and what's coming.<br /></em><em>3) We're going to publish our version management plan to the SAM API site so it's more clear what's going to cause a version change. One of the things about the SAM data is that regulations may change our data, so we should be treating some of it (like reps and certs) as variable-length instead of fixed to keep systems from breaking, so we absolutely document that.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>We've already added some updates that include reference data that wasn't available before and a few minor cleanups. Expect the more as we ramp up our people at this to be worked through by the end of next week. We appreciate being held to task on this - IAE's larger strategy relies on usable, exciting APIs and we can't do that if we aren't serving you.</em></p>
<p>This is why I prescribe APIs, not because APIs are a technological wonder that magically fixes everything (they do, oh they do). I prescribe APis because of the API journey, and if done right, the API provider can change, evolve, and learn to better serve their consumers, and in this case constituents.</p>
<p>APIs are born out of breaking down legacy walls built up between IT and business operations, but they have also become about breaking down walls built up between inside the firewall, and outside the firewall. In the end I do not think APIs are the thing that will change government or companies, it is the process of doing them, learning to open up and communicate, that will move the needle forward.</p>
<p>Something that will not happen at your agency, organization, institution, or business if you do not start on the API journey yourself.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">More Pondering On My Own Microservice Definition</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-micro-definition.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Like API, the term microservice has emerged as a force, along with a meaning that is very precise, or very broad, depending on who you are. The only thing I&rsquo;m sure of at this point, is the term microservice is very personal, and means very different things to different people, depending on where you stand in the industry.</p>
<p>Regardless I can't help but consider the implications of the term, internalize it, and see what value I can derive from its meaning in my own world. This exercise leaves me asking, what is a microservice? Over and over, acknowledging I may never fully know the meaning, and like API it will be more of a journey, then it never will be a destination.</p>
<p>First and foremost in my world a microservice means simple, and small. Simple and small. Simple and small. Say it until you can feel it, all Buddhist colliding with API Evangelist. Simple and small, penetrates all layer of meaning for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal ui</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I want all of this, coupled with the ability to achieve maximum scale, with minimum effort. I want to do one thing, as well as I possibly can, with as minimal resources necessary, but delivering the maximum value at any scale&mdash;with value benefiting myself, my API consumers, and the end-users being served, equally.</p>
<p>None of this is set in stone for me. I acknowledge this is my own perception, and that others will see microservices as something entirely different. Even so, I share my definition publicly, as also I enjoy reading others definition. I kind of think that is part of the whole microservices thing, sharing your own personal definition. In reality microservices do not change my API mission, but it does allow the conversation to be distilled down, for a new generation of business leaders working to make sense of all of this.</p>

<p>Phew!! This week was hard. I just couldn't find the mojo to plow through, but I did it. A little late on Monday evening, but still so worth doing--putting the week into perspective.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to assess the best balance with what I post as individual news stories on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>. I think more of this could be pulled out as actual news stories, but will have to see if I have the time. Overall I am happy with how the weekly API.Report is evolving, but there is so much more I could do.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>I track on a lot of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3D Printing</span></strong>, but few of them are directly API related, finallky one that moves the conversation forward:</p>

</ul>
<p>An interesting take on how educated about API <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>versions</strong></span>:</p>

<p>The API for Wikipedia sucked me in this week, and worthy of showcasing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>wiki</strong></span> API tech behind it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rest.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/v1/?doc">RESTBase docs</a> - I idid not know about RESTBase. I'm looking into adding it to my API deployment and management research. I just need to understand it better.</li>
</ul>
<p>A handful of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Women in Tech</strong></span> stories in my feed this week:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>As I did last week, I'm walking away with a better awareness of what is happening across the space. It isn't enough for me to read all of this API news in isolation, it helps to see it side by side with other news, allowing me to see and understand patterns that I may have missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. ;-)</p>
