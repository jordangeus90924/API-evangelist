{% include JB/setup %}<p>Mashape, the upcoming, self-service marketplace for APIs, which provides a platform to distribute, consume and manage cloud based APIs, has just closed $1.5M in seed funding.The round was led by NEA, with Index Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Ignition Partners participating, and on the angel side of things, Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, as well as Erik Rannala, Russell Siegelman and Rick Webb jumped in.Mashape is one of the most recent additions to the API management space, providing an end to end solution allowing you to deploy, manage and market your API from within the Mashape platform.   Mashape provides API management tools that can be found with other providers like Mashery, Apigee and 3Scale, but where they stand out is they also provide you with a library to deploy your API, auto-generate the code developers will need to integrate with your API, and a social API marketplace to generate attention and drive adoption around your API.</p>
