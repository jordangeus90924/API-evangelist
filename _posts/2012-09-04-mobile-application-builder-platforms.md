In my quest to understand the possible [future of Web APIs][1], I’m trying to understand the opportunities available for APIs when it comes to latest wave of mobile app builder platforms.

I’m the most familiar with two leading platforms, [Cabana][2] and [Tiggzi][3], but wanted to take a look at what else is out there.

What I’m classifying as a mobile app builder platform, is a web-based platform (not something you have to download), that lets you build a mobile application and usually (but not always) without any development experienced.

There are a lot of sites that claim the ability to build mobile apps in minutes, but many of them clearly are spammy crap. I tried to sort through as many as I could to come up with this short list of mobile app builder platforms:

**[The App Builder][23]** \- Mobile app building platform supporting iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows and HTML5 with no clear API support.

[Tiggzi][24] \- Cloud based mobile app building platform supporting HTMl5, iPhone, iPad **using** HTML5, JQuery Mobile and Phonegap with tools for building API connectors.

Not all of these mobile app building platforms provide support for external APIs, the ones who do are clearly leaders in the space.  Tiggzi and Cabana both provide powerful API support, while others offer modules, connectors that are canned API integration, without much customization from users.  

Many of these mobile builder platforms look pretty basic and are trying to capitalize on the needs of the masses wanting to deploy mobile applications.  The mobile builder platforms that continue to add in API connectivity, especially with [social and personal data APIs][25] will keep up.

I predict in 6 months, I'll come back to this post and 1/3 will be out of business, because they didn't build in API integration.
