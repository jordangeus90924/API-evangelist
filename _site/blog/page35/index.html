			<p><em>01 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I had a discussion yesterday with Audrey Wattersabout the infamous junk drawer(s) that exists in every house. That end of the counter drawer that seems to accumulate everything from around our house that we think we may some day use. Junk drawers possess those small items that hold our lives together. Nuts, bolts, fasteners, knobs, hinges and handles as well as the tools we use to assemble the futon, bikes, shelves and other household appliances. We keep all these items because we don't want to throw them away. We will use them some day right? We all live with this delusion. I have no hard data on what we actually use from the junk drawer, but we all have them, and I'm sure many of us have just taken that entire drawer to the Goodwill, sold at a yard sale, or worse.....thrown away. Instead of having a junk drawer, what if we could take a picture of each object with our mobile devices. The mobile app would use image recognition or some sort of image scanning to identify the object. The mobile application would scan potentially millions of parts and pieces to identify this little piece of treasure in our lives. Once identified it would pull all meta data related to it, identifying it as a screw, faster for a futon or drawer handle from IKEA. We could create a virtual junk drawer of all these items. Once cataloged in our virtual junk drawer, we could properly dispose of in a recycling bin, Goodwill donation bag, or items in garage for the big yard sale that will make us rich. No more physical junk drawer. We could access our virtual junk drawer at any time, in an online environment. When that magical time comes, and we actually need the exact same screw, knob, fastener or obscure alan wrench we could search in our virtual junk drawer and pull up the item. Then we could either...[<a href="/2011/08/01/my-3d-printed-junk-drawer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>I just finished reading two great posts about battles within API ecosystems.Convoluted TOS and "Open" APIs Will Be the Death of Us by Shion Deysarkar and Topify to Go Dark as Twitter Claims Another Dev Victim by Louis Gray. I recommend you read, and form your own opinion. I'm totally behind Shion in, ..arguing that the breaching parties (i.e. the developers holding the API key) should not be held in contempt of court, as it were. When it comes to terms of service disagreements, there needs to be more discussion. I also feel Topify's pain in their decision to, ..shut down the service, rather than chasing after Twitter's continued meandering API road-map. This makes it very difficult to build a business on Twitters API. I am the biggest advocate for the developer when it comes to these ecosystems battles. API developers often deliver on the promise of an API, but seldom see the reward. However I also feel the pain of API owners. How are you supposed to have an API that delivers true value, is sustainable, makes all your developers happy, and have terms of service and a roadmap that is all knowing and sees into the future, and promises never to step on your developers toes. I see both sides of the argument, however I feel much of the trouble Twitter and other API owners run into, is the result of not properly sharing its roadmap with developers. If Twitter shared its road-map earlier, and more consistently with its developers, and also allowed feedback periods before launching, I think there would a lot less backlash--even if the community didn't always win 100% in the resulting decision. How "open" an API owner is with their road-map obviously is entirely up to them. They have trade secrets to protect, and many other considerations when managing a roadmap. However you should identify a consistent time frame in which to give the developer community a heads up...[<a href="/2011/08/01/how-open-should-we-be-with-our-api-roadmaps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Aug 2011</em></p>
			<p>One of my Google Alerts picked up on something interesting today. A PHP code library for the Github Gist API, for sale on the code marketplace CodeCanyon for $2.00.
I almost just closed the window, but then thought a little more about it. I think its the first time I've seen a code libraries for sale like this. I've seen more robust integrations and API clients for sale, but never a simple library for working with an API.
The Github Gist API is well documented and there is a PHP library for the Github API available for free on the site. It doesn't look like it has Gist API support yet, but is well written, and shows you how to exend the PHP class.
Seems like there is a narrow window where you could build an API code library and make money off selling it before a free library is available, or is it also possible to sell them even when there are other free libraries available?
I will keep watching for other API code libraries for sell on CodeCanyon and elsewhere, see if this is a growing trend. I prefer to just open source mine on Github, for the entire community to put to use.

			<p><em>31 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>I was reviewing the image recognition API from Moodstocks, for a story on ProgrammableWeb today, and discovered another API management story I feel should be told. Its a story about bootstrapping your API management using existing free and low cost services.
Before users adopt your API, it can be hard to justify costs around using paid API management services to support your developer ecosystem (because at that stage the ecosystem often doesn't exist). Moodstocks approach to its API community was a great example of bootstrapping API management until you can afford more.
For managing its documentation, code libraries, articles and FAQs, Moodstocks turned to Github for help. Github provides these tools for free, and are great for delivering these API management essentials.
For developer support, Moodstocks uses Vanilla Forums for its forum, and Campfire for chat support. Moodstocks uses a nicely skinned copy of Wordpress for its blog, and has a solid social media approach using Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube.
With this bootstrapped approach, it was up to Moodstocks to deliver its own API processes: rate limiting, security and other reporting features. But when it came to management the startup chose a nice selection of free and low cost services to delivery services to its API community.

			<h3><a href="/2011/07/28/new-oauth-toolkit-from-layer-7-technologies/">New OAuth Toolkit from Layer 7 Technologies</a></h3>
			<p><em>28 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Layer 7 Technologies introduced a new OAuth Toolkit, ageneralized framework for handling a broad range of OAuth scenarios across cloud, web and mobile applications.
OAuth is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data, and is a popular method to allow secure API authorization, enabling websites to provide a more streamlined user login experience with the additional benefits of enhanced privacy and security.
The Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit is the first solution of its kind that enables enterprises to control policy and identity aspects of many different OAuth token operations, a capability that is particularly important as enterprises increasingly use OAuth to authorize access to APIs in cloud settings, said Phil Walston, vice president of products at Layer 7 Technologies. By allowing enterprises to seamlessly manage their OAuth implementations as the standard evolves, the toolkit simplifies operations while providing rigorous security and control.
Features of the Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit are:

	Policy and identity controls to handle HMAC-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signature methods, SAML and OAuth WRAP
	Mix and match implementations of OAuth with SAML
	Ability to drop in new signature and credential methods without changing APIs

Layer 7's new OAuth Toolkit supports a variety of standards, including OAuth 1a, OAuth 2.0, SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, WS-Trust, REST and JSON.
Layer 7 will be demonstrating its OAuth Toolkit at the Layer 7 Hospitality Suite at Gartner's Catalyst Conference at the San Diego Hilton Bayfront, Aqua Room 311, from 6:00 - 9:00 p.m., July 26-29.

			<p><em>25 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>INRIX�, an international provider of traffic information, and driving services, announced a commitment of $37 million in funding led by Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers' (KPCB) Green Growth Fund and August Capital. The investment will be used as part of a continued global expansion and R&amp;D efforts focused on the company's in-car, location based services (LBS) and mobile applications businesses. With over 150 industry-leading customers across 8 different distribution channels, a profitable business, and nearly 90 percent compound annual revenue growth over the past 3 years, INRIX did not need to raise capital, said Bryan Mistele, president and CEO of INRIX. However, given new market opportunities including the rapid adoption of our premium traffic services, increasing demand from automakers for global solutions and the explosion of LBS on mobile devices, we're accelerating several investments designed to firmly cement our global leadership position. The investment by KPCB Green Growth Fund and August Capital show the growth of the LBS data market, and resulting APIs that gather and deliver this data to mobile applications. Traffic congestion costs the U.S. economy upwards of $155 billion dollars annually. Last year alone, US drivers wasted 3.9 billion gallons of fuel sitting idle in traffic, and the US is a small part of a much larger and growing global traffic problem, commented Michael Linse, partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers. We believe that INRIX is uniquely positioned to help improve the efficiency of our cars in ways that reduce fuel consumption and improve sustainability for all. We are experiencing a convergence of automotive and mobile efforts that leverage the latest smart devices, data analytics and connectivity technologies that improve how the world's one billion drivers travel from place to place. The use of crowd-sourced traffic information from mobile devices, vehicles, and sensors on the road can provide continuous real-time speed, congestion, accident data that can provide a unique understanding of traffic events from school schedules, concerts, sporting events and everyday...[<a href="/2011/07/25/inrix-raises-37-million-to-deliver-traffic-data/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>In the summer of 2010 I was looking to reinvent my career. I was looking for a new direction. Somewhere I could apply all my strengths, and stay relevant and at the forefront of a fast changing tech landscape. As part of this effort, I spent some time considering what areas dominated the past 5 years of my career. Looking at my resume, social media and cloud computing were the two major themes. Then I put some thought into what technology is dominating right now, and will continue growing in the next couple years. The answer was mobile technology. Looking to apply what I know, but also be relevant and competitive in the future, I wanted to find a common thread. What did all of these areas have in common? It was clearly application programming interfaces, or more specifically, web APIs. APIs drove the social media revolution from Flickr to Twitter, reinvented IT with cloud computing, and is a driving force behind mobile applications. I found an area to focus my energy, but do I have the skills needed to work with APIs. What is needed to be successful with an API? I set off to study all the top APIs out there and answer this question. After much research, success with an API seemed to boil down to equal parts technical, business, and marketing. It sounded like a fit for my skills. Successful APIs like Amazon, Twilio and Google all had one thing in common. They had developer advocates or technical evangelists. This is what I wanted to do. What skills are required to be an API developer advocate or evangelist? Hacker - You have to have a love of hacking. You have to be able to write code samples, prototypes and be able to know what programmers experience hacking on an API. You should also be able to push the boundaries on what can be done with APIs.

			<p>The file open dialog box is an important tool that we use every day, but we very rarely notice it or think much about it. On the Windows platform, using the file open dialog box, we see our desktop, my documents or whatever was the last hell hole of a folder we were working in. On the Mac, using the file open dialog box, it seems like I eternally live in my downloads folder with the occasional venture do my documents or desktop folders. Maybe that's just me? More and more I find myself living in my Amazon S3, which I still access via my Firefox S3Fox extension versus the Amazon Console. Old habits die hard. Regardless, more of my world is living in the clouds. The file open dialog box just doesn't have the same meaning in the clouds. Its a desktop, localized tool. When we open it, we see that local desktop mess we've created and maintained (well sort of). When we open a web dialog, we don't see much. It seems to be something made up, nothing near the meaning of when we open it locally. Or we are forced to paste the URL of a single file or page into a textbox. Google is making a move to re-invent the file open dialog box, in context of the web, and the context of your Google workspace. With the Google Picker API, any developer can build a web-based file open dialog box. In Google's opinion, a web-based file open dialog box should provide a user with a more modern experence: Familiar � A look-and-feel that users will recognize. Graphical � A dialog experience, with many views showing previews or thumbnails. Streamlined � An inline, modal window, so users never leave the main application. I would add that users need to see, and have access to the content they use most. In this day and age, this means on and offline content.

			<p><em>22 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>API business models are still in its infancy. Many API owners are in experimental mode when it comes to how they make money with their API. Beyond the fuzzy plans for how API owners intend to make money, even more API owners don't have a clear vision of how they will reward their developers, and share revenue with its API ecosystem. There are examples of leadership from API owners. Qwerly gives discounts on API costs for high volume API users and YellowAPI pay developers for high volumes of traffic originating from their applications as well as sharing advertising revenue with developers. The Bluevia API is another innovator in the space with its straightforward business models provided for its development community. Bluevia lays out four business models developers can choose from: Downloads - Earn 70% of downloaded apps that developers publish to Movistar and O2 App Stores Subscriptions - Earn 70% of recurring revenue stream fees of ongoing subscription of apps that developers publish to Movistar and O2 App Stores Mobile Advertising - Earn 50% of advertising revenue when developers integrate Telefonica's ad network Messaging Sending and Receiving - Earn 10% of SMS and MMS that are sent from a developer app Bluevia provides a step-by-step process for walking developers through obtaining an API key, certifying an application and API key, publishing to the store, and collecting revenue from one or all of the available developer business models. This type of straightforward approach represents the future of how API owners can clearly communicate how a platform intends to generate revenue, and share revenue with the developer community so that they too can be successful in building businesses around an API platform. It sets clear expectations with the developer community, allowing developers to understand the risks and benefits with building a business around an API. Bluevia's approach to revenue earned from selling apps in a marketplace is nothing new.

			<p><em>20 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>A lot of innovation occurs at hackathons. Seems like every hackathon I attend, there are discussion about how to better harness the talent available at these events, and develop a way to track what gets generated.
The last hackathon I attended one of the ideas pitched was actually a web application that tracks what gets produced at hackathons. It would track the participants, and provide repositories for any code created. The application would provide access to ideas and projects from any participating event.
It's a pretty good idea. I think a lot of good ideas and code goes to waste from contests and hackathons. Evening winning ideas may never go anywhere.
Today I came across a Google project called Melange. Melange is an open-source web application that Google uses to track the Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in programs.
The goal of the project is to create a framework for tracking open-source contribution programs. Google is able to manage Google Summer of Code programs, and other similar programs with the web application.
Melange is part content management system, part issue tracking system, and part customer relationship manager. It is written in Python and runs on Google App Engine.
At first glance it looks like Melange is setup to track all the users, ideas, projects and code for a hackathon environment. It might take a little customization, but Melange may work as a platform for tracking hackathons and contests.
It would be great to have access and visibility to projects and code that gets generated from event to event, and information about the smart people were involved.

			<p><em>20 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>It is hard for me to imagine why someone would launch a web application these days, without immediately launching an API, or at least having plans for an API shortly after release.
There always is some data that can be liberated, and make it available in a JSON format. Simple data APIs can easily drive widgets and other embeddable tools, providing viral marketing tools that drive awareness and SEO.
So when I am playing with new web applications, if there is no clear API strategy, it always gets me thinking about the possibilities. This happened when I was playing the new infographic builder and marketplace Visual.ly today.
There is no evidence of an API at Visual.ly. I see an RSS feed of infographics, but no API. So I started thinking about a simple API and embeddable strategy for them.
I would start with infographic and designer services providing JSON responses for searches on the infographic marketplace and graphic designers.
Visual.ly only provides tools for sharing infographics. You can't actually embed them, I believe this is how they plan to monetize. So you wouldn't have full copies of infographics via the API. You'd provide smaller representations of parts and pieces, or other relevant visualizations.
For every infographic, a designer would create a handful of small images, and the API could serve up these images and all the meta data for each entry in the marketplace.
This would open up possibilities for embeddable buttons, widgets and gadgets that anyone could copy and paste, and virally promoteinfographics without actually giving away everything.
The Visual.ly API wouldn't be complex to begin with, just allow basic access to infographics and designers, and provide an assortment of embeddable tools for users to syndicate content. A more advanced API, providing more complete access to infographics and the builder, can come later.

			<h3><a href="/2011/07/19/partial-response-and-updates-with-google-apis/">Partial Response and Updates with Google APIs</a></h3>
			<p><em>19 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Last year google launched support for partial response and updates to a couple of the Google APIs. The goals was to significantly reduce network, memory, and CPU resources needed to work with Google APIs.
Now Google is adding support for partial response, and an improved version of partial update, called patch, to a number of newer APIs including:

	Google Buzz API
	Google URL Shortener API
	Google Tasks API

All APIs available in the Google APIs Discovery Service and the APIs Explorer supporting partial response and updates.
The partial response algorithm works by supplying a fields query parameter to any API call that returns data, you can request specific fields.
Here is an example request that returns only titles and timestamps of a user's public Buzz activities: https://www.googleapis.com/buzz/v1/activities/[email&#160;protected]/@public?alt=json&amp;pp=1&amp;fields=items(title,updated)
A full response for Buzz activity would be around 53KB and the partial response is 3KB, a reduction of almost 95%!
You can try out both partial response and patch algorithms in the Google APIs Explorer. In partial responses, the fields parameter is available for most methods. You can easily tell which are partial update methods by the .patch in the method name. Both the fields parameter and the patch method on the tasklist resource in the APIs explorer.
Partial response and updates are a great way to make APIs more efficient for devices with limited connectivity, as well as making API platforms operate as efficiently as they can by delivering only what information is needed.
Google is in a unique position with the number of APIs they offer, volume of API calls they manage, and wide audience they deliver to. We can all learn a lot from watching them organize their APIs, and apply elements of their approach to our own API ecosystems.

			<p><em>19 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>As I'm reviewing APIs, I spend a lot of time considering the viability and business use cases for an API.
While considering this, I keep having thoughts about the perfect API stack. In my opinion, these are APIs that do one thing and do it well, makes a developers life easier, and have clear business value.
The first one that comes to mind is Twilio. When I think of Twilio, I think of two clear use cases: voice and SMS.
Voice and SMS are two critical tools to have in your developer toolbox. These are services that have clear value, that would take a lot of effort to duplicate yourself, making it a no brainer to pay for as a service.
In an effort to define the perfect API stack, I'm going to start blogging about APIs that fall into this category as I find them. They will be short posts that introduce you to these services, and when I get enough I will launch a landing page showcasing the perfect API stack.

WebServius provides users with the ability to integrate and store data, and enable access to the data via a REST API with XML and JSON responses. There is support for planning, development, implementation and ongoing management of APIs generated from data sources. WebServius offers two service levels: Self-Service - Tier for technical people who can handle the setupthemselves, using the WebServius self-service interface. The self-service plan is free up to 50 API subscribers, with up to 10,000 total API calls per day and 5 calls per second at peak times. If you go over any of the limits of the self-service plan, it costs $1 for every 30,000 API calls. Full-Service - Pricing level if you are planning to create a commercial-grade data API. Service is custom fit to exact needs, starting from data integration, to API download page, to user management. Pricing varies based upon needs. There is also a 20% charge of all revenue made through an API whether it is on the self-service or full-service pricing structure. Using WebServius you can proxy an existing REST API or connect directly to a data service provider, including Amazon SimpleDB. Once data is integrated, WebServius allows you to create custom details, plans, promotions, policies and pricing for the data API you wish to publish. Each published API on WebServius is given a detail page for subscribers to access. There are also options for custom site integration and private label deployment solutions.

			<p><em>17 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>One of the new features that Twitter rolled out with the new Twitter developer area was an enhanced search tool powered by Apache Solr. The new unified search provides an engine for searching across all areas of the new developer area, including the mailing list historical archives.
Many of us API owners have to cobble together our developer areas from several tools like Wordpress, Google Groups, and other tools we can leverage to quickly provide communication and support for our APIs. There is nothing wrong with this approach, however one side effect is that we end up with information available in separate silos, making information harder for developers to find.
Providing a single search interface, that allows developers to search across all systems, delivering comprehensive and relevant search results can make a significant difference in whether or not a developer finds the details they need to successfully integrate.
Apache Solr is one indexing tool you can deploy as part of your API area, but there are also lower impact solutions such as Google Custom Search that can be deployed as an external service, without investing in costly equipment or software.
Don't underestimate the power of having a single search interface that developers can use to find the information they are looking for when integrating with your API.

			<p>I spend a lot of time looking through various APIs. One common problem I see, are with, what on the surface appear to be public APIs, but once I start looking to get access as a developer, I get walls thrown up. Often times, information about the API is public. I can browse the documentation, code samples and more, but when I want to play with the API I have to ask for access and wait for approval. This is different than a private API, where you just want to give API access to a private audience. I can tell these API owners have a good idea, want to open it up to the public, but they are very concerned about who has access to their API. These businesses are concerned about what people will do with their data and resources. They have concerns for their brand, and legal issues to wrestle with. What will developers do? How will it affect customers? Will it damage the companies reputation? There are a lot of unanswered questions when launching an API. None of us have all the answers, and can predict what the future holds, and managing public developers can be a lot of work. What you need is a quality API management platform, with tools for providing visibility into how developers are using your API. If you can't build the tools you need yourself, make sure and check out the API service providers like 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery, Layer7 or Atmosphere. Next you need an agile process and attitude for evaluating API usage and feedback, then be able to quickly evolve your API to satisfy your business objectives, adding the most value to your brand, while also building a healthy and vibrant developer ecosystem.

			<p><em>16 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>According to Reuters, Twitter is preparing to launch an Advertising API, targeting larger advertisers, allowing them to tailor, automate, and publish ads in bulk directly into Twitter users' streams. Access to the Twitter Adverting API, which Twitter plans to begin in the fourth quarter, will initially be rolled out as a test involving a limited number of partners, according to Reuters. The Advertising API is a sign that Twitter is pulling together its business model and looking to further monetize its network in the same way as Google does with its Adwords and Adsense, and Facebook with its Ad Network. Right now you have to submit a form, and talk with a sales person to run ads on Twitter, the new API would create an automated advertising marketplace on top of the Twitter ecosystem. According to Reuters, Twitter's advertising API will initially let advertisers automatically deliver ads in two formats: Promoted Tweets - Allowing an advertiser to sponsor any 140 character messages via Twitter Promoted Accounts - Enabling advertisers to promote its own Twitter account to other users A marketing research firm eMarketer, estimates that Twitter is expected to generate about $150 million in ad revenue through its ad network in 2011. Evolving the Twitter advertising network to a self-service system, and adding an API for programmatic integration, will significantly increase the volume of advertising that runs through the network, putting it on par with Google and Facebook's offering. This kind of system is well-suited for larger advertisers that need to buy ads in bulk and run large-scale online advertising campaigns that involve thousands of different versions of an ad. "They can just flood the system with ad types and almost in real time they can figure out which ads are working, which are most successful, which are getting the clicks at the right price," says Debra Aho Williamson, analyst at eMarketer.

			<h3><a href="/2011/07/16/tumblr-releases-api-v2/">"Tumblr Releases API v2"</a></h3>
			<p><em>16 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Tumblr just released version 2.0 of the popular blogging platform API, in an effort to make developers lives a little easier when integrating with the Tumblr platform.
The previous version of the API made distinctions between read and write operations and pushed different activity to two separate domains, the www.tumblr.com and the blog subdomain.
The new API version consolidates all API access to api.tumblr.com and exposes two major resources in the URI: /blog and /user. Consolidation under one domain will allow Tumblr to effectively measure and balance traffic using DNS.
The new URLs will follow a pattern, making them intuitive, allowing developers to easily discover and experiment with the API without having to rely exclusively on documentation.
Instead of adhering to strict RESTful practices, Tumblr is looking to create simple URLs that enable manipulation by the average human.
For example, to pull the avatar of my tumblr blog I use the following URL: http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar
The API returns the default avatar image, and if I want a larger size, I just append the size to the URL: http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar/512
In the first version of the Tumblr API, all data was available in XML, with JSON support added largely as an afterthought. Now Tumblr has just decide to eliminate XML, and focused on dialing in their JSON implementation. A common approach for API owners.
The new API implements OAuth 1.0a for authentication and they are looking at upgrading to OAuth 2.0 in the neear future.
I like how Tumblr has consolidated under a single domain, and I favor their approach to intuitive URL's over a strict RESTful implemntation.
The Tumblr API v2 is definitely an improvement, I will see how it sizes up against the new Posterous API launched last month.

			<p><em>16 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Many Facebook developers have been confused about what it means to submit to the Facebook App Directory, and frustrated by the length of time it took to get their applications approved.
Facebook has stated that the Facebook App Directory actually drives less than 0.5% of all application installations, with the highest number of installations actually coming from Facebook search.
And until now, to be visible in search, you had to submit your app to the App Directory.
In light of this data Facebook is removing the App Directory and depending on search for application discovery on the Facebook platform.
For an app to show up in search, developers now need to go to the application detail page, and click the Submit to Search link in the left sidebar while editing the application.
When submitted, applications are automatically available in search and there is no longer an approval process to go through. When any changes are made to application settings, it will automatically be updated in the listing.
Obviously this approach doesn't apply to all API application directories, but some interesting data to consider from one of the larger development platforms, when deploying your own API application directory.

			<p>Foursquare launched a new Merchant API that will allow developers and merchants to create specials using any technology.
The new Merchant API comes right after their announcement of a national partnership with American Express, and the new API will make it even easier for other merchant partners to create deals using foursquare.
It looks like foursquare is depending on its 10,000-strong developer community to take on Facebook and Groupon in the deal-making space.

			<p><em>11 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Twitter just launch an updated version of the Twitter Developer Site. The new developer area focuses on enhancing developer communication channels and providing improved reference material and documentation.
The new dev.twitter.com is built using the Drupal platform and focuses on providing core building blocks for its developer community:

     
          Forum - Retiring of the old mailing list with a new dicussion forum that includes hot topics, email category subscriptions, and Dev Teatime, a section to focus on the social side of the Twitter developer community.
     
     
          Blog - A new blog to learn about important API announcements, events, tips and how-tos, case studies, product insights, and featuring content from different teams at Twitter, as well guest blog posts from community members.
     
     
          Documentation - The new Twitter docs have better structure and searchability, so they are easier to update, and easier to find the most up to date information about the API.
     
     
          Enhanced Search - The new developer area search is powered by Apache Solr, providing a unified search engine with filters and more relevant search results including from the group mailing list historical archives.
     
Twitter focuses on the most important aspects of a developer area, while also providing many other important API building blocks:

     Getting Started
     
     Application Management
     
     Embeddable Tools
     
     API Status
     
     Authentication Overview
     
     Developers for Hire
     
     Videos
     
     Terms of Use
     
     Branding Guidelines
     
     API Explorer (Apigee)
     
The new API developers area looks very complete and provides a unified front for the Twitter developer ecosystem, right down to the comprehensive search.
Its obvious they are working to turn over a new leaf in developer relations by providing improved resources, and most importantly develop communication tools. The new discussion forum features an Introduce Yourself and gives developers the ability create threads as well as reply to threads, which will definitely initiate discussion within the community. The forum is already filling up with introductions and comments.

			<p><em>09 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Foursquare is sunsetting their APIv1, and recently spent some time sharing the lessons they learned during APIv1 and the decisions that went into APIv2. Here are some excerpts: JSON - This was a no brainer. Its flexible and understood by everybody. OAuth2 and HTTPS-Only - OAuth2 is straightforward to implement on the server and client, and offloading encryption to HTTPS makes it easy to get it right. REST Lite - It makes sense to use resourceful URLs for certain key objects, like users/USER_ID or venues/VENUE_ID, with actions and connections hanging off of them. Also avoiding deeply nested URLs like users/USER_ID/tips/TIP_ID, instead using tips/TIP_ID, leads to much simpler URLs. Finally, they avoided using the extended set of HTTP verbs beyond POST and GET, putting the action into the endpoint name, such as tips/add. Documentation - Quality documentation combined with an API explorer is a win. Also theimplementationof a simple documentation generation system, made it easy for Foursquare engineers to keep API documentation up to date. Timestamps as Seconds Since Epoch - Renders timestamps not readable by humans, but extremely easy to parse. Versioning - The hardest part of designing an API is that you're stuck with a bunch of decisions you can't take back. But in some cases they needed to take them back anyway, so they came up with the idea of clients sending back a version like 20110708 and promising to be compatible with all changes up to the date. Object Level detail - It's always hard to decide how much detail to include in an object, and Foursquare lets the clients dictate what to include where. In APIv2, they introduced compact and full JSON representations of resources. Envelope - The decision to wrap all responses in { meta: { � }, response: {...} } was well received, along with the error details included in the meta block. They provide a lot more wisdom in their blog post,APIv2: Woulda, coulda, shoulda. Some of the...[<a href="/2011/07/09/wisdom-shared-from-the-foursquare-api-team/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>Mashapereleased a few enhancements to their API management platform.

     
          Inbox - Mashape redesigned their inbox and messaging system. Developers can contact you from your API detail page, and the inbox provides interface for managing developers and your conversations.
     
     
          API Wizard - The API setup and management wizard is no longer a step by step wizard. It now gives you five options in a left hand navigation, leaving the room for more options to be added in the future.
     
     
          Private APIs - You can now deploy a private API with Mashape, only inviting the developers you want to have access.
     
Some small changes, but prettyimportantchanges for API owners and developers who use Mashape.
I would say the ability to deploy a private API is the most significant, as more people realize the value of APIs, and deploy them for partners, not the general public.

			<p><em>05 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>I made some more changes to my network over the holidays. I'm working to better tie together my blog(s) and my social network profiles using the rel="" property.
The process is a three part process, meant to link the various places I write with my author brand, that is represented in my social network profiles, most importantly Google +.
I write on several blogs and I want the authorship of my work to be linked back to my Google + profile.
I'm very Google centric, so in my network this is the most important profile in my network. This also feeds into my overall SEO strategy which is another story.
I started by created two separate author pages on my two blogs. Kin Lane and API Evangelist.
Then I updated all of my blog posts within those domains to link my author name to those respective about pages, and include the rel='author' link.  This attributes each post to me, the author.
Then on those about me pages I listed my social network profiles, most importantly Google +, and included the link rel='me'. This attributes each of these social network profiles as my profile pages.
The final link is on my Google + Profile page I make sure and add link to both my blogs, and include the option "This page is specifically about me", which automatically includes the rel='me' property for each of the links.
All of this completes a circle showing that I am the author of my blog posts, and associating these blog posts with my Google Profile. Google will now recongize that these profile pages and blog posts are associated with my Google Profile.
This all results in improving my author brand in eyes of Google, and since Google dominates the web, the eyes of the Internet.

			<p><em>04 Jul 2011</em></p>
			<p>I updated the sharing tools on blog.apievangelist.com today.  Previously it had eight buttons, representing the top social network channels that drive traffic to the blog.
I'm changing it, putting emphasis on:

	Google +1
	Twitter
	LinkedIn

These are the top places that people share posts on API Evangelist that drives traffic to the blog.
I started by adding individual buttons from all the major providers:

	Facebook
	StumbleUpon
	Digg
	Reddit

At first I used AddThis for the whole share toolbar, but I couldn't get it to layout the way I wanted.   So I used individual buttons from the Google +1, Twitter and LinkedIn, then I used AddThis for the other top providers:

	Instapaper
	Hacker News
	DZone
	Posterous
	Tumblr
	Reddit

I will be making some major updates to kinlane.com and using the same share strategy for the blog and web site.  I'll keep adjusting to keep in line with top channels that drive traffic to my blogs.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/30/what-does-online-sales-tax-battle-mean-for-apis/">"What Does Online Sales Tax Battle Mean for APIs"</a></h3>
			<p><em>30 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Amazon sent me an email about the recent signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown, which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores. As a result of this, contracts with all California residents participating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated effective, June 29, 2011. As I was writing up the story of this on kinlane.com, ad it got me thinking about the impact of this on API affiliate programs. I'm tracking on various monetization strategies for APIs, and affiliate sales is one of them. California has broadened their definition regarding who has to pay sales tax, to include theaffiliatesof online retailers. But from what I can read it all still goes back to the sale of "tangible personal property". The tax code defines what type of merchandise is subject to use tax as: Generally, the same types of items that are subject to sales tax are subject to use tax. Sales and use tax applies to the sale or use of tangible personal property in California. Section 6016 of the Revenue and Taxation Code defines tangible personal property as "personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses." I'm no lawyer, but my interpretation of the assembly bill 28, is that if your API is not faciliting the sale of tangible goods, you are safe. If your selling access to bits and bytes, and you want to share revenue with developers and / or affiliates who drive traffic and sales to your API, you are not subject to any online sales tax for California. I haven't read New York, Illinois or other states bills. I will some night when I need help going to sleep, and update in the future.

			<p>The Mashape API Proxy is an open-source version of the same proxy that allows APIs to integrate with the Mashape Platform andhandles authorizing users, billing, rate limiting and other features.
Version 1.1 is whats available for download on Github, and Mashape is testing the private version 1.2 of the proxy with a small set of API providers, and they will push it to Github after its been tested.
The new version dramatically improves the performance and the security of the proxy, while reducing latency.
The API Proxy version 1.1 is an extremely early version and Mashape recommends waiting for version 1.2 before deploying.
The open-source Mashape API Proxy is written in JavaScript and runs on the latest version of node.js
This is the first open-source API proxy that I know of, and in my opinion, opens up a lot of possibilities for the API industry.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/30/new-pricing-for-genability-energy-api/">"New Pricing for Genability Energy API"</a></h3>
			<p><em>30 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Energy pricing data provider Genability just announced the roll-out of more flexible pricing for their API.
The new pricing structure gives Genability API developers more options with no long term commitments, when accessing the Genability tariff and electricity pricing database.
Genability API pricing starts with a free plan which offers 10 unique tariff credits per month, and will serve up 1,000 calls per hour.
Genability bulk paid plans range from $89.99 / month to $1499.99 a month:

     
          Bronze for 89.99 / month, with 100 unique tariff credits per month, and 5,000 calls per hour
     
     
          Silver for 299.99 / month, with 350 unique tariff credits per month, and 20,000 calls per hour
     
     
          Gold for $799.99 / month, with 1000 unique tariff credits per month, and 50,000 calls per hour
     
     
          Platinum for $1499.99 / month, with 2000 unique tariff credits per month, and 100,000 calls per hour
     
The call per hour portion is pretty straightforward, but whats a tariff credit?
A tariff credit is when you request a full tariff (including all its rates, bands and properties), or request a price, or a calculation on a tariff. Genability keep track of each tariff you request, and keep a count of the unique ones, with subsequent calls for previously requested tariffs being free.
All of Genability's API plans both, both free and paid, include LSE data, season &amp; time of use data, and zip codes, and geo-location data.
Genability also offers custom pricing plans, if one of their doesn't fit your needs, just contact them and they'll negotiate additional services, flexible usage policies or volume pricing.
It's interesting to see pricing for an API that provides access to energy utility pricing, take on a very utility pricing model for consumption.

			<p><em>30 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm exploring the Mashape API Platform, trying to break things down and understand everything in more detail. Blogging about a topic does this for me. So let's start with deploying an API with Mashape. With the Mashape PHP Library you can deploy an API on your infrastructure. You download the library from Github, deploy on your server, and then add the methods for your API by extending the Mashape PHP component class. If you already have an API that returns JSON responses, you can just register it as a Mashape API for distribution, without deploying the Mashape PHP Library. If you've deployed your API without the Mashape PHP Library you will need to accomplish one more step. You will need to implement the Mashape Connector by adding one line of code to your API, which is required to connect your API to the Mashape Platform and handle user authorization, billing, and rate-llimiting. Whichever way you deploy your API, you can now distribute it using Mashape. The first step for distributing an API is to create an XML file that describes what the API does. This XML file gets deployed on your server and needs to be updated as your API evolves. Once your API is deployed and published to Mashape, the platform distributes your API to the Mashape Marketplace and provides a detail page with title, description, documentation, test console and PHP, Python, Ruby, Java and Objective C client libraries. Mashape then provides a way for developers to sign-up and start hacking on any API in the Mashape Marketplace with a single developer account and key. There are also social features allowing users to follow and contact other users. All APIs that are published using Mashape will connect and communicate with Mashape through an API Proxy. This is the proxy that handles the authorization of users, implementation of billing, rate limiting and other functions described above. Right now the proxy is primarily available via the...[<a href="/2011/06/30/mashape-provides-tools-to-distribute-discover-and-hack-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Facebook just officially launched the Graph API Explorer, a tool allowing developers to quickly explore the social graph of people, photos, events, pages and the relationships between them, via the Facebook Graph API.
Like other API explorers, the Graph API Explorer allows developers to make requests against the API and see formatted results in-line.
The Graph API Explorer interface allows you to obtain an access_token with the specific permissions necessary to access data, navigating the same permissions dialog users will see when permissions are requested in a production app.
The Graph API Explorer then allows developers to switch between HTTP GET, POST and DELETE to get, create, update or delete objects.  When POSTing to the API, you can also provide a list of fields and values that you want to send as parameters to the API.
For every request the Graph API Explorer provides formatted results, allowing developers to move between objects in the graph by click their Ids, showing the details of each object on the social graph. Just like the real Facebook application, the Graph API Explorer only shows you the objects and data you have acess to see, and that you give the Graph API Explorer permission to access on your behalf.
The Facebook Graph API Explorer was originally deployed by a Facebook employee, and now is being officially as part of the Facebook developers program, and is part of a growing trend of RESTful API explorers like Apigee Console and Google API explorer.

			<p><em>29 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Apigee justannounced their Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI, a new offering that enables organizations to deliver transactional APIs, securely deployed in a private or public cloud.
Apigee's new Enterprise Cloud PCI supports full compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), while taking advantage of the compute resources of the cloud to support transactional API traffic and sensitive customer data.
To fully protect critical customer credit card information, there's an increased focus on compliance, especially as more e-commerce services shift to cloud computing and APIs, said Chet Kapoor, Apigee CEO. ...The Apigee Enterprise Cloud API also protects and screens sensitive data flowing between an application and an API residing on a public cloud, so businesses can now confidently broaden their e-commerce network with transactional APIs.
The Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI solution is deployed in PCI-compliant data centers, allowing customers to:

     Build and deploy transactional APIs
     
     Maintain PCI compliance and data protection of all API traffic
     
     Tap the scalability of the cloud for secure transactional APIs
     
The Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI can also be deployed on-premise, delivering the same capabilities for in-house PCI-DSS compliant deployments.
PCI-DSS is associated with e-commerce, and financial transaction security, but can be universally applied to securing any online transactions. The availability of this type of API security will go a long way in convincing IT departments to deploy their API infrastructure in the clouds.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/27/rise-in-mobile-payments-good-sign-for-apis/">"Rise in Mobile Payments Good Sign for APIs"</a></h3>
			<p><em>27 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Mobile is hot. Everyone is talking about thegrowth in mobile payments this year.
Forrester Research predicted that mobile commerce will hit $6 billion in 2011 - and reach up to $31 billion by 2016.
PayPal just raised their 2011 Mobile Total Payments Volume (TPV) projections to $3 billion. Paypal first predicted $1.5 billion in 2011 mobile payments volume, then in February, they upped that to $2 billion, and now they've adjusted to $3 billion.
Paypal is running $10 million in mobile TPV a day, up from the $6 million they reported in March.
It shows that mobile users are actively purchasing products and services online using sites and applications on their mobile devices.
Just like with social media and cloud computing, APIs are a silent force behind the mobile revolution. APIs drive the applications and sites that mobile users are puting to use.
The growth in mobile payments is a sign of the overall growth in the mobile market, as well as massive growth in API deployment to support the mobile demand.

			<p><em>26 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>The Mashape Documentor is an engine for automatically generating a mobile version of documentation for any API running on the Mashape API Platform.
Using PHP, the Mashape Documenter reads the api.xml for a Mashape API, then generates a mobile version of the documentation in HTML5, CSS3, and Jquery.
You can drop the script into the root of an API, where the api.xml is located,customize the header and footer of the mobile interface and your up and running.
Marco Gr�tsch, who created Mashape Documenter has made it available under a BSD license, and is available for download on his blog (its in german).

			<p><em>26 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Amazon recently sent an email to all developers notifying them of upcoming changes to the Alexa Top Sites API.
On November 25, 2011 Amazon will deprecate the Alexa Top Sites SOAP API. The SOAP interface has had repeated security issues over the last couple of years, and since only a small percentage of users actually use the API, they decided to decommission it.
Alexa will also be enforcing that all requests to the API must be signed using signature version 2.  Version 2 is significantly more secure that the version, and all Amazon Web Services are being required to migrate to it.
I wonder if Amazon is having similar security issues with other SOAP APIs?   Maybe the other SOAP APIs just have more users and it was worthwhile for them to fix.
Makes you wonder how many SOAP users vs. REST users Amazon Web Services has.

			<p><em>23 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>This is one story I'm sure I will be telling over and over. Its about providing self-service registration to your API, and access to your documentation. I'm working my way through 78 travel APIs right now, reviewing each of them for a series of travel industry API stories. I'm only halfway through, and about 25% of them require me to email them or submit a contact form to get access to their API. I can understand doing this if your goal is to only work with partners and vendors, but all of these APIs came from the ProgrammableWeb API directory. So I assume your goal is to target a wider public audience. Here is how your approach is hurting you: As a developer I need instant gratification. I need to make sure your API has what I need. I need to quickly get at your documentation, see your endpoints, and potentially be able to grab a code sample and see some results. If you can't provide this for me, someone else will. As an API blogger and writer I need immediate access. If I'm going to include you in my story for the travel industry APIs, and showcase what you offer. I need access, without waiting or talking to you, to see the value you deliver, and where you fit in. Now I've submitted the contact forms and emails for each of these APIs. I've gotten a couple responses, 24 or 48 hours later (some no response). I've already moved on, I see the name in an email, realize its from my travel research, but I don't remember anything else. Even though I have access now, its unlikely that I will return. The moment to make your mark has passed. What would be the reason for limited access to your API? Maybe you don't have staff or time to manage the potential spammers or other probing type of users that will come through?

			<p><em>23 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>When managing an API and its ecosystem, we are all making this up as we go along. We have to constantly try new things, build them out, test, measure, and readjust. Measuring being the most important, and when considering your API analytics, it shouldn't be just about tracking usage of your API. You should measure every aspect of your API ecosystem. Applying metrics, gathering data, and reporting on this should be easy, and be part of your development DNA. Your metrics should be flexible and change as your ecosystem evolves. Any engineer, evangelist or other team member should be able to implement, gather and measure as the need arises. I was introduced to StatsD and Graphite reporting last week, by Flip from Infochimps, while at the O'Reilly Velocity Conference. StatsD is a dead simple NodeJS daemon that listens for messages over a UDP port. When a message is received, it parses the messages, and extracts metrics data. Graphite is a highly scalable real-time graphing system. Data can be sent to Graphite's processing back-end, carbon, which stores the data in Graphite's specialized database. The data can then be visualized through graphite's web interfaces. StatsD lets you define what you want to track, throw it at the StatsD over a UDP port, once processed you can schedule it to dump to Graphite for further processing and visualization. Using StatsD + Graphite, you can provide any metric you wish, and Graphite will just report on it, with no management overhead. This type of flexibility provides the perfect agile environment measuring anything in an API ecosystem. For example you can introduce new tracking for each deployment of an account sign-up widget using: StatsD::increment("widget.accountsignup.deploy"); StatsD will accept and process the new data, where Graphite will begin receiving, processing and provide a visualization for this new data set. Since the StatsD interface is over UDP you don't have to worry about what this will do to your API or application performance,...[<a href="/2011/06/23/api-ecosystem-tracking-with-statsd-and-graphite/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>There are many tools out there for working with Web APIs, but the one I am seeing used more and more is an API explorer. API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a Web interface -- all without writing code. These API explorers are making it a lot easier for developers to discover, learn, and integrate with Web APIs. I also think they have a lot more potential, beyond the developer community. Non-developers can use an API explorer to make calls against an API, retrieve JSON, and then use tools like Google Spreadsheets to process responses, building visualizations, and so on. There is a huge opportunity for API explorer providers to tap into the larger, non-developer community, and one of the easiest ways to do this may be by adding a widget layer to their applications. An API widget builder would have similar features to the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for APIs I proposed last week: API Discovery - Allowing users to discover and select pre-defined selection of RESTful APIs Authentication - Enable HTTP Basic and oAuth authentication with APIs Services - Render full list available services for selected API Request / Responses - Allow for building requests, manually sending, and seeing fresponses for selected API Github Integration - Allow adding and connecting to both private and public Github repositories Then I would add a new layer to the environment: Widget Builder - Provide tools for widget discovery, creation, connecting to APIs, configuration, sandbox, and copy / paste embeddable code for syndication. Export Tools - Ability to export any API responses to Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel, Comma Separate or Tab Separated values. With this type of environment, non-technical users could easily connect to APIs, mash-up responses and build widgets for embedding in their presentations, web sites, applications, and mobile devices. There are a couple of widget building platforms out there like Sprout Inc or Widgetbox, but I'm picturing something more...[<a href="/2011/06/22/widget-builder-environment-for-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>APIs are hot right now. With the success of Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and others -- due in no small part to their APIs -- the enterprise space is taking notice. The demand for enterprise API services is increasing, with a number of services providers stepping up to compete for the business. As this happens, there are three major areas that may prove challenging for API service providers targeting the enterprise space: Developers: Wide range of vendor, partner, and public developer needs and expectations. Open and Accessible - A public, self-service and accessible API ecosystem, with less of an enterprise feel Documentation - Simple, yet complete API documentation Common Tools - Forums, Mobile SK, explorers and other tools developers have grown accustom to. Monetization - The ability to make money from their work. Business Interests: Wide variety of business interests wanting to deploy and manage APIs Legal - Whole new worlds of legal concerns for some companies Transparency - Struggles with what transparent means? And how much is too much? Branding - What happens to the brand? Where are pitfalls? Where are opportunities? Non-IT - More engagement from non-IT decision makers when deploying APIs. Tools - Reports, widgets and other GUI tools that allow decision makers to put APIs to work. Enterprise IT: Sector that has high expectations when it comes to software. Secure - Mission critical security in all areas. Scalable - Scalability has to be baked in. SLA - Service levels have to be guaranteed. On-Premise - Ability to deliver behind the firewall. Private Cloud - Deploying in their private cloud infrastructure. Public Cloud - Deploy on public cloud infrastructure. When it comes to providing API services to the enterprise, you have different public, vendor and partner-developer expectations -- which all may be quite different. To complicate things, you may have decisions around APIs increasingly coming from non-IT departments, bringing a whole bunch of business related concerns. Lastly, this is the enterprise.

			<p><em>22 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Two API service providers have brought their products together to deliver a more robust enterprise API solution. 3Scale API management platform now integrates with Layer7 Technologies XML security gateways.
3scale's API Management suite includes an API portal for developers and partners on-boarding and support, API access control, policies management, analytics and billing and payments features.
The Layer7 XML Gateway provides high performance traffic filtering, API security and attack protection, traffic routing, API transformation services and caching.
Enterprise API providers can use 3scale's plugin to issue API keys, policies and access rights that can be pushed and pulled between security gateways and 3scale's management dashboards.
Layer7 XML Gateway can be deployed on-premise, in a private or public cloud. With this new partnership 3Scale offers the same deployment flexibility for their API management solution.
The partnership gives 3Scale a leg up with the enterprise with a more robust, secure enterprise API gateway, and Layer7 gains a management suite to offer their API customers. It's a win for both of them, creating a very strong enterprise API solution.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/19/hapi-hackathon-wrapup/">"HAPI Hackathon Wrapup"</a></h3>
			<p><em>19 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>The HAPI hackathon wrapped up June 12th in San Francisco. The event brought developers together to hack on over 9 APIs in order to build something cool over the course of a weekend.
The event started out Friday night with TokBox, Ebay / Paypal, Foursquare, Box.net, Twilio, Genability, Factual, and Mashery showcasing their companies and their APIs to developers.
Next, developers lined up to pitch their ideas and generate interest amongst other participants. 10 ideas were pitched, then developers formed groups and got to work.
Developers spent all weekend drinking coffee, eating pizza and bagels, and hacking away. Everything culminated Sunday afternoon when developers presented their hacks.
Over sixteen hacks were presented, with prizes going to the best:

     
          FourSquare2Go won a Foursquare prize for their offline Foursquare application.
     
     
          Energy Dashboard won both the Mashery APIs and Genabiity API prizes for their energy insight, and prediction tool.
     
     
          Congress Connector won multiple Twilio API, Factual API and Ebay / Paypal API prizes for their tool that made connecting with your congressional rep easier.
     
     
          Chat Living Room won a TokBox API prize with their group Youtube video chat room.
     
     
          Hapidocs won a Box.net API prize for their location based file storage application.
     
     
          SoshoWise won a Ebay / Paypal API prize for their expert driven how to video application.
     
TokBox who organized the event, wanted to bring the developers together into an environment where they could make whatever they want, and offer support and prizes from nine different APIs.
Overall the hackathon was a success, with developers going home with cash and schwag, and the APIs involved generated more awareness of the services they provide.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/19/apis-are-key-to-industry-growth/">"APIs Are Key to Industry Growth"</a></h3>
			<p><em>19 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>At the Glue Conference this year in Colorado, I sat on a panel called, Whats Next for APIs?. In my talk, one area I focused on, was how industries would organize and put APIs to work.
There is a growing trend within specific industries. They are coming together and pushing for standards, interoperability, and ways to work together.
I'm seeing evidence of this within the customer service industry. An industry association called NetworkedHelpDesk.org is using APIs to connect together customer service applications and establish a seamless way to communicate among industry partners and vendors.
Customer service applications are in high demand, and potentially connected with many other applications, so it is critical that they communicate and inter-operate efficiently.
NetworkedHelpDesk.org has brought together other applications such as Twilio, SugarCRM, Freshbooks, Atlassian and Zendesk, with different types of applications including ticketing systems, bug trackers, development trackers, knowledge bases, and CRM software.
The goal of NetworkedHelpDesk.org is to deliver on the promise of the cloud, and enable disparate systems to collaborate with each other, using a standardized API format for the customer service industry.
I think we'll see more industries coming together like this, to establish ways they can work together more efficiently using APIs.

			<p><em>18 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I recently moved my IDE off my desktop and onto the web. I'm test driving two separate web-based integrated development environments (IDE): Akshell - I like environment, its smooth and has Github integration. But its primarily a JavaScript IDE. I met the developers and like where they are going with it. ShiftEdit - This is the one I'm using the most, because I work 70% of the time in PHP. I like the FTP access, but only has SVN for its repositoring integration. As I was working with the Dropbox API, Posterous API, and Tumblr API today, and was thinking how nice it would be to have an IDE dedicated to APIs. There are several API explorers popping up out there, that let you play with one or multiple APIs and generate requests and display responses. This is a start. I would like a full-blown IDE that I can add RESTful APIs to my libraries and would have all the capabilities of an explorer, but also have access to client libraries, code samples, and other features of an IDE for the APIs I use the most. I could integrate both my public and private Github repositories, and I could leverage the social coding available in the Github community. Switching between APIs can be a bitch, remembering what I did last time I worked with an API, where the code is, the syntax, and more. I'm also spending a lot of time using multiple APIs, in a single script. Like pulling bookmarks from Instapaper API, generating a PDF with PDF Crowd, then sending to Mimeo to have printed. That is 3 separate API calls. I see a lot of potential for an IDE that is dedicated to the API space, an IDE that helps us developers efficiently integrate with the APIs we use most...as well as discover new APIs.

			<p><em>17 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Two new API management platforms were launched this month. Layer 7 technologies launched the Layer 7 API Portal, and SOA Software launched their Atmosphere API platform.
These new platforms show the API space is really heating up in 2011. The enterprise is taking notice of the value of APIs, and service providers are lining up to compete for the business.
These new platforms offer asimilarset of services as Mashery, Apigee, 3Scale including:

     API Provisioning
     
     Metrics and Billing
     
     Security and Control
     
     Reporting and Analytics
     
     Developer Registration and Accounts
     
     Developer Support
     
Some of them deploy their solutions on-premise, while others deploy in the cloud, and a couple of them will do both. Each provider has their own approach to API management, but essentially accomplish the same end goal.
I'm going to work on a better side by side comparison of Layer 7, Atmosphere, Mashery, Apigee, 3Scale and Mashape. Hopefully to help people understand what each API service providers delivers.

			<p><em>17 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Posterous recently launched a new API giving users access to all the functionality available through the Posterous web interface.
Instead of just delivering documentation for the Poserous API, they went a step further and made the documentation smarter, and more interactive.
Think API explorer meets API documentation. The Posterous API documentation provides a list of all API services, endpoints, and methods, but it doesn't stop there.
When logged into your Posterous account, the API documentation automatically includes your api_token, which is necessary for making API calls.
Once authenticated you can make any call against the API right in the documentation. Each endpoint allows entry of necessary fields, displays a request URL, and a JSON response message.
This type of interactive API documentation allows developers to learn and explore how an API works in a live environment, making real calls.
This approach to delivering API documentation steps up the game a little bit, and the same old type of documentation may not do anymore.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">"Atmosphere, a New API Management Portal"</a></h3>
			<p><em>17 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>SOA Software just launched a new API management platform called, Atmosphere.
Atmosphere provides a secure, platform that companies can deploy to manage their APIs for either a private or public developer community.
The Atmosphere platform gives API providers a management interface to define APIs using a wide range of messaging types and formats including REST/XML, REST/JSON and SOAP. The platform also provides paging and caching mechanisms to improve app performance.
Atmosphere also provides security capabilities that allow API providers to control and monitor app's usage of the APIs. While also protecting internal applications from overload, as well as provide customers with service-level guarantee through QoS management for SLAs and quotas.
These tools for monitoring and managing consumer contracts and traffic can also be applied to enable monetization of APIs.
The Atmosphere API Management can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud, or a combination of the two. Providing the flexibility and scalability needed by many providers.
The Atmosphere API Management platform is one of the newest players in the API management space, a growing playing field of providers targeting the enterprise.

			<p>Twitter has launched a new building block for their API community, a YouTube Channel.
The new YouTube Twitter API channel will contain interviews, tutorials and other video content that is produced in support of the Twitter API.
Its a great idea.  Perfect way to organize videos and presentations in a central location, as they are produced.  Then users can come back at anytime and learn.
A YouTube channel for an API community could also be a great way to build community, by soliciting feedback on what type of content users want to see, or even accept submissions from your developers.
I added a YouTube channel to my list of building blocks that API owners are using.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/14/the-usa-today-api-matures/">The USA Today API Matures</a></h3>
			<p><em>14 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Back when I first started doing API reviews on API Evangelist, I did a review of USA Today's API.
At first I almost didn't post the review.  It was such a simple API, with nothing innovative to speak of.  It just didn't seem worth covering.
When they first launched the USA Today API, it provided services for best-selling books, and sports salaries.  It wasn't very exciting.
Fastword 10 months, and their API is looking much more robust.  Now they also offer Articles, Book Reviews, Breaking News, Movie Reviews, Music Reviews, and Snapshots.
Most recently, USA Today also addedUS census data to their API offerings.
Looking back it was easy for me to criticize the big media company for releasing such a simple API, but in reality they are doing what I feel everyond should do, start simple.
USA Today looks like they are getting their footing with packaging up data sets and making available via their API.  This data is probably very usable by their internal teams as well as makes USA Today a potential integration partner with other applications.
I think other news and media organizations can learn a lot by following in USA Todays footsteps, and deploy very simple APIs, learn, and slowly tackle more as you find the right approach to your API community.
Also, I'm sure USA Today was able to tackle so successfully with the help of Mashery.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/13/using-your-api-to-find-new-developer-talent/">"Using Your API to Find New Developer Talent"</a></h3>
			<p><em>13 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Many API owners depend on their APIs for identifying new types of business models, turning their API ecosystems into research &amp; development platforms.
Edwin Aoki of Paypal and Ebay APIs also feels they can also be used by human resources(HR), to nurture and identify new developer talent. At the Mashery Evolution of Distribution event, Aoki mentioned how Ebay and Paypal use their API ecosystem for talent acquisition.
If you think about it, your API provides a fertile ground for developer to learn about your APIs, how to code with them, and understand your companies way of doing business.
Hopefully within your API area there are ways for developers to excel and showcase their work. Submitting code samples, applications and forum participation all give them an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.
And If your company, eats your own dog food and uses your APIs internally, hiring developers from your API community can provide immediate benefit to internal projects.
Beyond internal projects, developers can also be identified and used for partner projects. Identifying rockstar developers you feel comfortable referring to your partners, is another great use of your API community.
Another place to look for talent, is at Hackathons. Hackathons can also be fertile ground for identifying fresh new developer talent. It is place to watch developers in action, showing their skills in real-time, and demonstrate how well they work with other people.
An API provides many ways to attract, groom, and identify talent for your company. Have you ever hired someone from your API community?

			<p><em>13 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Having a privacy policy on your API is an important part of making it clear to developers and end-users, where your company stands in regard to their data and personal privacy. Just having a privacy policy is not enough, make sure it truly reflects your companies values, whats important to your users, and is in line with how you deploy your technology. One shining example of this in the API space, is Hunch. Hunch's provides a 'Taste Graph' of the entire web, providing information on what people like; anything, from books to electronic gadgets to fashion or vacation spots. Hunch is combining algorithmic machine learning with user-curated content, with the goal of providing better recommendations for everyone. The information they provide through their web application and API, is extremely valuable, as well as potentially very private. Hunch's API privacy policy articulates their position very clearly: Hunch takes our users' privacy very seriously. When using the API, Hunch returns predictions for users within the Taste Graph. Certain API calls can be made for any user, while other calls require the user to Hunch Connect before predictions will be returned. Our guiding principle for this distinction is whether the user's likes or facts about themselves are already made public on the internet. Obviously the privacy of their users is very important, and they back this up by using OAuth as it is meant to be used. Giving users granular level control over who has access to their sensitive data, while still providing other, non-sensitive, rich data without authentication. Hunch has a clear vision of API and data privacy in a space, where there is a lot of potential for abuse. An example that many other API providers should follow. Also make sure and check out the privacy policy for their main site, they really lay it out honestly, and in plain english. I wish more technology providers would approach privacy this way.

			<p><em>13 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>When I review a new API, I take a look at the technology they provide, but I tend to focus on the business of their API. One area I look at, is what tools they use to deliver the building blocks that make up their API. Did they build it themselves? Did they use Mashery, Apigee or 3Scale? Are they using other open-source tools or a software as a service (SaaS) provider? I'm always on the look out for new open-source tools or services providers that can be leveraged for APIs in this way. My goal is to find an open-source solution or service provider for each one of the building blocks I have defined. Some examples are: API documentation with SDK Bridge API forums with Get Satisfaction Application Showcase with AppStores.com I like to have an open-source tool available for each building block, but having a solid company that can deliver specialized services for a API, and have them up and running instantly is even better. Some characteristics I look for in a service provider are: Self-service - Instant registration and activation of services. Branding - The ability to brand and make look like your API area. Tiered Pricing - A pay as you go model allowing small companies to try out first, then grow as needed. DNS - Ability to point subdomain at service, to keep with a single company domain. Support - Quality support from self-service forum to someone you can talk to. Focus - Delivering a high quality service ina single area, and not trying to be everything to everyone. Data Portability - The ability to take ALL of your data with you when you are ready to leave is critical. These are just a few of the key strengths I look for when finding API tool and service providers. As an example, take a look at AppStores.com, they have almost everything I look for in a building block service provider....[<a href="/2011/06/13/api-tools-amp-service-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm working through some 100K views of the API service provider arena, and trying to evolve my perspectives of Whats Next for APIs. This is all a work in progress, so I'm publishing here on kinlane.com instead of on apievangelist.com. I wrote the other day about the Battle for Your API Proxy between the API service providers. This included a tier of "proxy" API service providers that run all your APIs through proxy before hitting your API. Next there are the group of "connector" API service providers that provide you with a connector to put in your API and provide the same services that a proxy would. Based upon what I'm seeing with Mashape and other indicators, I tried to show the playing field in a slightly different, and evolved way. My vision of the future of APIs involves several key areas of evolution. These are based upon movements I'm already seeing, and where I'd like to see things go. In this vision API service providers don't just provide proxy, connector, management, developer area tools, and API marketplaces. They also provide actual API frameworks for APIs like Mashape provides, as well industry wide developer opportunities. Developers can build code against a single API, or multiple APIs, they can build tools for API owners to deploy in their own management, developer areas as well as within the "proxy" or "connector" layer too. Service providers will provide developers with distribution opportunities to other marketplaces and API owners. API Owners will not be locked into a single API service provider for their API, Management, Proxy, Connector, Developer or Marketplace needs. They will have a buffet of add-ons they can choose from to enhance every aspect of their API ecosystem. One key difference is that API owners can choose to proxy or connect their API, or both if necessary for different services. This model provide sadd-ons at every layer of the API ecosystem.

			<p><em>11 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Every Web API is designed to receive requests from and respond to the outside world. Every day an API can receive thousands or potentially millions of calls. Before the API can process these requests and returns a response, it has to potentially tackle a huge laundry list of functionalities: Identity / Authentication Traffic Controls Rate Limiting Performance Security Scalability Filtering Encryption Logging Once all these items are handled, then the API can do what it is designed to do -- process its payload and return a response. Many API owners tackle all these layers of the API themselves. But there are also several service providers out their looking to do this for them. The first group of API service providers in this area use what I call the Proxy Flow Through, and this includes Mashery and Apigee. Mashery and Apigee deliver these service by routing all calls to an API through their proxy. Each call actually is made to Mashery and Apigee, then they route the request to the actual API for a response. The second group of API service providers in this area, use what I call the Proxy Connector, and this includes 3Scale and Mashape. 3Scale and Mashape deliver these services by providing a connector your API can use to communicate with the proxy during each call. All of these service providers end up delivering a similar set of services. This proxy, whether flow through or connector tackle the needs listed above, but then also provide much needed data on API operations. Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale provide you with tools for monitoring and analyzing this operational data. There is a lot at stake here. The next wave of Internet growth will pass through these proxies. More API owners are turning to these providers to deliver this layer, where all usage of the API from web apps, mobile apps, and other devices developed internally, by partners and the public will pass through these proxies....[<a href="/2011/06/11/the-battle-for-your-api-proxy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/10/why-is-your-restful-api-separate-from-your-website/">"Why is your RESTful API Separate From Your Website?"</a></h3>
			<p><em>10 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I was having a beer with Dr. Alexandre Passant of Seevl the other day, we were talking about music, APIs and the Seevl API.
A while back I wrote a piece about Seevl titled, With Seevl Music Discovery, the Website is the API. When building the Seevl API, instead of providing a separate API to access information, Seevl relies on content negotiation principles to deliver alternative representations of web pages.
As I was talking with Passant, I kept thinking about how RESTful APIs are often deployed separately from the web site or application. Both are using HTTP, and often deliver the same information, they are just intended for two different audiences and potential uses.
This is not a new idea. Flickr delivered the Flickr API this way in the early days, and web applications like Tumblr offer their API and application side by side.
You can visit my Tumblr blog at: http://kinlane.tumblr.com/
Simple add /api/read to the same URL: http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/
And you you get back an XML representation of my Tumblr blog.
Add /JSON to that URL: http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/json
And you get back a JSON representation of my Tumblr blog.

     In most cases, it does not makes sense for a web site or application and its RESTful API to be separated, for some reason many developers still see them as two completely separate things.
     In my opinion, if the HTML, XML, and JSON representations of information are deployed side by side. And users know they can simple adjust the URL to get other formats, the type of users that hack on, embed, and redistribute information from APIs will grow beyond the developer community.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/10/posterous-from-saas-to-paas-using-an-api/">"Posterous, From SaaS to PaaS Using an API"</a></h3>
			<p><em>10 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>In a single announcement yesterday, the blogging service Posterous went from Software as a Service (SaaS) to Platform as a Service (PaaS), with the introduction of a full set of APIs.
The new set of RESTful APIs give developers access to methods and actions that were formerly available only to the core Posterous engineering team including the ability to create new sites, manage users, posts, comments, custom themes and other data for those sites.
Beyond just exposing the core posterous technology via as a simple set of RESTful APIs, Posterous has delivered their API documentation as an interactive set of tools allowing developers to see every available method, interface with these methods and experiment bydynamicallychanging the paramaters and inspecting responses, all within the browser.
Posterous has merged the concept of API documentation and API explorer into a single set of interactive developer documentation. This steps up the game, in that not only should your documentation be simple and complete, but also functional.
The new Posterous APIs have evolved Posterous from a service where users can come and setup blogs, to a platform that companies can use as a backbone for their own blog and site managment systems.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I've heard this story several times now, but I think its a story worth telling over and over. It is the story of the Netflix API and the lessons they learned along the way. Not every API owner will be operating at the scale of Netflix, but the lessons are universal. It all started when Netflix set out to build an API, where the original charter was: Expose Netflix metadata and services to the public developer community to "let 1,000 flowers bloom". That community will build rich and exciting new tools and services to improve the value of Netflix to our customers. The concept of 1,000 flowers refers to the public community Netflix was targeting with the API, where ideas and applications would flower from each developer. Fast forward a couple years, and the API has been successful, with growth looking something like this: However the innovation did not come from where the original charter identified. The API delivered the greatest value from these groups (in order of importance): Internal Engineering Teams Netflix Product Owners Netflix Developers Partner Relationships External Device Manufacturers Public Developer Community 1,000 Flowers Even with over 18K public developers using the API, it accounts for less than .5% of the traffic to the API. With internal teams and external device manufacturers accounting for the largest consumption. With these lessons in mind, the new charter for the Netflix API goes something like this: Build and maintain an infinitely scalable data distribution pipeline for getting metadata and services from internal Netflix systems to streaming client apps on all platforms in the format and / or deliver method that is most optimal for each app and platform. And moving forward, any future architecture will focus on supporting the key target audience first with a trickle down of features to the other audience segments.

			<p><em>08 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>The Dwolla payment service just launched a new payment API called Grid. Before you can understand grid, you need to understand Dwolla'sphilosophyon payments. Every time you want to do seemingly simple things, like buy a coffee, pay for lunch, or buy gas, current providers are requiring you hand over your name, credit card number, and expiration date, leaving trail of personal and financial data behind you. With an opportunity to start fresh, Dwolla wanted to change this, and thats what they are doing with Grid. Grid provides third party developers tools to create a seamless in-app purchasing experience with no more credit card numbers. Creating a new kind of payment network, one that doesn't leave behind personal information. Why is this huge for consumers? This new network puts consumers, not networks, in control of who can access, their payment information, allowing users to revoke and modify who can access their payment network. Why this is huge for merchants? Merchants can get paid online without the recurring costs associated with other networks, and accept payments with Dwolla's regular merchant account and pay no special account fees. Why this is huge for developers? For the first time ever, developers will have access to a payment network to innovate and build on top of, that removes a lot of liability that is typically associated with credit card networks. I tend to only focus on stories around innovative approaches to the business of APIs, which usually means how an API is delivered. Another area that I enjoy covering is how businesses are using APIs to change entire industries. Dwolla fits this profile. Dwolla is taking on an industry that is extremely complex, full of holes and was not build with the Internet in mind. Providing a simple web interface, an API, and flat pricing model, they are reinventing how we do payments from the ground up. Dwolla provides a REST and SOAP API, and employ OAuth for authentication.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/08/icloud-storage-apis/">"iCloud Storage APIs"</a></h3>
			<p><em>08 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>iCloud storage APIs allow IOS application developers to store documents and other data to a central location so userscan view or edit from any device without having to sync or transfer files.
There are two ways that applications can take advantage of iCloud storage:

     Document Storage - Enabling storage and sharing of information in document form.
     
     Key-Value Data Storage - Enabling storage and sharing small amounts of data.
     
Most applications will use iCloud document storage to share documents, which is a feature that users think of when they think of cloud storage. Users care about whether photos, videos, and documents are accessible across devices while the key-value data store is not something a user would never see.
Key-value storage will be used for small amounts of data such as storing application state, settings, and other important information that delivers a better user experience. Although not as apparent to the end-user, key-value storage will be just as important as document storage.

All iCloud storage is managed centrally by the iCloud service, which handles coordination of documents and key-value stores. The iCloud service handles storage searches, change notifications, version control, conflicts, and security for applications that integrate with a user's iCloud storage account.
Neither document storage or key-value storage in the cloud are anything new. But when it is implemented as part of the IOS platform, it becomes much bigger. Apple is solving everyday problems users face when using their smart phones, by storing data centrally in the cloud.
ICloud APIs will enable developers to build rich applications on the IOS platform, and continue to grow IOS market share.

When you and your community have several web apps, mobile apps, plugins or other tools you are proud of, showcase them. Whether you call it a showcase, directory, gallery or store...having an area that highlights the applications built upon your API is critical to continued API adoption and success.

			<p><em>07 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Google Calendar has a new feature for managing "Appointment Slots". These appointment slots are a great way to let others know preferred times when you are available.
Open office hours are becoming a common way for API providers to communicate times when developers can connect with someone in person or online via chat for support. Google Calendar appointment slots area great way to manage API office hours.
Creating API Office Hours
To get started, set up blocks of time you'd like to offer as API hours. Simply click anywhere on your calendar and then on "appointment slots. From there, create a single block of time or automatically split a larger block of time into smaller appointment slots if applies.

Publishing API Office Hours
Every Google Calendar has its own personal appointments sign up page; you can embed it on your website or give the URL directly to registered API developers. You can find the URL for your appointment page at the top of the set-up page, which you can access via the edit details link.

Signing Up for API Hours
When someone visits your sign up page, their calendar is overlaid for convenience and they can sign up directly for any available appointment slot.

When they sign up, Google Calendar conveniently creates a new shared event on both of your calendars.

Making yourself available to developers is important.  API office hours can be used for premium support, limited time support, or just open time to share a pint with your developers and other people in the industry.

     iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for all music, photos, books, documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.


     Although this line of thought is nothing new, with Apple going all in…it means the cloud has gone mainstream.


     Get ready for some major growth in the cloud as Apple pushes it further, and other existing cloud providers try to compete.

			<p><em>03 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Kumar Kandaswamy, Director of Open API Platform Business for Best Buy, spoke at Mashery's The Evolution of Distribution event today.
Kandaswamy offered some practical advice for retail companies that are deciding how and where to start with their API deployments.  His suggestions included the following areas:

	Product APIs- Make your product catalog available via your API is fundamental.
	Store APIs - Give local store information including location and product availability is powerful.
	Review APIs - Deliver practical product reviews in a usable way to help consumer make purchasing decisions.
	Commerce APIs - Provide seamless purchasing and product fulfillment through at-home delivery, in-store pick-up, partner e-commerce sites, and web-based applications.

Those four areas just make sense, as they seamlessly bridge the physical retail and online retail consumer experience and extend the Best Buy brand in entirely new ways.  While there may be other innovative ways that retailers can utilize APIs, these are a great place to start.

			<p><em>02 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Providing some real-world examples, Mashery invited four leaders in the API space to speak:

     
          Daniel Jacobson, Director of Engineering for Netflix API who walked us through how APIs are allowing them to stream video to over 200 devices, resulting in Netflix dominating in their space.
     
     
          Kumar Kandaswamy, Director, Open API Platform Business for Best Buy showed us how APIs have enabled them to extend their brand with the help of partners in ways they never could have done on their own.
     
     
          Adam Kleinberg, CEO of Traction and Mashable.com Tech Writer demonstrated why brands need to focus on having an open API for developers and not get lured into distractions like building apps for single devices.
     
     
          Edwin Aoki, Chief Architect of PayPal/eBay explained how APIs enable you to be more agile, and accelerate new forms of business development, even when your building a global commerce platform where 18% of the worlds online transactions are conducted.
     
I would say the one point I heard repeated over and over was the importance of understanding who the target audience of your API is. Designing and delivering your API in a way that caters to this audience will help keep development costs focused, network overhead as low as possible, and deliver exactly the tools and resources the most important segments of your audience will need.
These were just some of the interesting insights given, into how some of the most successful brands in the space, are using APIs to enable better distribution to consumers, partners and expand their brands globally.

			<p>I'm processing all my notes from the 2011 Glue Conference, which has been one of the most thought provoking events I've been to this year.
The best part of events like Gluecon is you get to hang with some really smart and extremely experienced people.
I'm working to understand a new perspective I was exposed to while listening to Mark Suster talk about the Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years.
In his talk, he outlined three potential types of platforms:

	Platform as a Service - Platform around core application or business as an API, allowing others to build businesses on top of, and make money.
	Platform as an Extension - Platform around a core application that offers APIs as an extension for others to build on bringing value back to the core business.
	Platform as a Trojan Horse - Platform that allows others to build on, taking the risk, and the core business benefits from any value created.

As I work my way through the hundreds of available APIS I will definitely be applying what I'm learning...
What is the motivation of each of these API platforms?

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">"Open vs. Closed APIs"</a></h3>
			<p><em>01 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>With all the buzz around APIs these days, its easy to get swept up in all the hype around open APIs, and miss the mark with your own API deployment.
So what do I mean by Open APIs? Open APIs are like Twitter, Twilio and many of Google APIs that are available for anyone to register for a key, and start programming against.
Discussions around APIs tend to start here. People often hear about the popularity of these APIs and want to emulate that.
If you don't directly have experience with API deployment, I recommend getting your feet wet with a more closed API deployment.
Immediately, calling APIs closed sounds bad. Sounds like you are being selfish or exclusive and don't want anyone touching your APIs. Because of this closed APIs don't get the press coverage and discussion they deserve.
In reality very few APIs find success in being open. Most API projects will get traction in sharing data and resources with business partners, and even internally between departments within a company.
Closed APIs enable you to serve a very limited audience, maintaining control over your data and resources, which is a common concern with API deployment.
Within this closed or controlled environment you can get your feet wet with API deployment, gain some experience, then maybe someday the right opportunity for an open API will come along.
It's not about Open vs. Closed, its about doing what makes sense and possibly doing both in the long run. I would also like to see more open discussion around best practices with closed API deployment in the press an blogosphere.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/30/api-forums-using-get-satisfaction/">API Forums Using Get Satisfaction</a></h3>
			<p><em>30 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Get Satisfaction is one way to build API forums that enable productive conversations between an API owner and the developer ecosystem.
Simply engaging your customers in conversation won't earn you the respect of your community  and make your customers happy. Conversations are just a start, it's what you do with them that matter. Get Satisfaction was built on the idea of not simply creating conversations, but creating value from conversations.
Get Satisfaction focuses on outcomes in order to create value, as opposed to the confusing and ineffective taxonomy of traditional forums, it is focused on conversations around four simple, outcome-oriented topic types. This helps keep conversations focused and productive.
Working together with an API community to build a dynamic, social knowledge-base helps developers find answers to their questions on their own time, and often times much faster through traditional support channels. Every answer is publicly searchable, so there's never a need to answer the same question twice. This results in a dramatic reduction in the cost of API support, while greatly improving customer satisfaction at the same time.
Different topics inside of forums are full of opinions, wishes and wants. Opening a community conversation about your API roadmap can help you gather valuable market data you can quickly fold into your API development cycle, communications strategy or program schedule.
Another area often overlooked, is that opening an forum and inviting discussion about your API deepens user engagement, increases the amount of user generated content, and benefits your  search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. (Hopefully you have one?)
Direct interactiion with your developers through open and transparent forums increases satisfaction, loyalty and builds community. This community will give prospective customers a peek behind the curtain of how your API treats developers, make them feel like they belong, and creates a 2-way street of communication your entire ecosystem will benefit from.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/29/api-technology-odata/">"API Technology - OData"</a></h3>
			<p><em>29 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>There is an ever growing amount of data available today and much of this data is now being collected and stored across a wide variety of system, locked into specific applications or formats, making it difficult to access, integrate and share.
The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock data and free it from silos that exist in many applications.
OData frees data by applying and building upon existing web technologies like HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) and JSON to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.
OData emerged from experiences implementing AtomPub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several years. OData is currently used to expose and access data from relational databases, file systems, content management systems and custom websites.
OData works to be consistent with the way the World Wide Web works, adhering to HTTP standards just like RESTful APIs. This reuse of core Web principles allows OData to provide data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools.
OData is released under the Open Specification Promise and allows anyone to be involved with OData implementations.

			<p><em>28 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>We are in the middle of an era of unprecedented growth in the number of available web APIs. In March 2011 ProgrammableWeb hit 3000 APIs in its directory, and is already up to 3,287 APIs as of today.
This is nothing. If you want a glimpse into the future of APIs, take a look at Evrythng.
Evrythng allows you to create online presence for any sort of object - products, business assets, vehicles, trees, buildings, and beyond.
Evrythng then gives you a management system to organise and operate an online presence forobjects, storing active profiles and updates, controlling access, and tracking usage. Evrythng creates a unique online identity for every object, providing a presence on the Web through a globally accessible URI.
Now this is where it really gets good. Evrythng also provides a RESTful API toolset and secure software �infrastructure' to share, manage and access real-time information about physical things.
Using the Evrythng API, you can directly connect real world objects and databases to Evrythng, allowing developers to mashup object information, add and exchange information with other objects, then combine and coordinate information and interaction across multiple applications and interfaces.
Evrythng wants to be the �Facebook for Things', giving physical things an individualdigital profile, and share real-time object information in a managed way.
If you think there are a lot of web APIs now, wait until every object on earth can potentially be accessed through APIs.

			<p><em>28 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm reading all the starred items in my Google Reader about Google's latest closing of APIs, most notably Google Translate API. There are some pretty sensational headlines: Google pulls the rug out from under web service API developers, nixes Google Translate and 17 others GOOGLE IS NOT YOUR DADDY (OR LONG TERM RELIANCE ON APIS IS AS BAD AS OUTSOURCING) Google Translate API to Go Kaputt in December I don't feel the need to defend Google here, I wish to only defend APIs against people blaming them for what is the fault or responsibility of developers and API owners. I see this same line of attacks on APIs anytime an API company makes a change in their strategy, and developers freak out! First, let's start with the claims that developers are having the rug pulled out from under them, and you can't build a business on APIs! This week I was fortunate enough to hear Mark Suster of GRP Partners talk at Gluecon on Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years. One important point he made about business platforms and startups (ie. TweetDeck) is you need to have multiple data sources. Without expanding to LinkedIn, Buzz, and Facebook TweetDeck would have been left with only a single data source, and left completely vulnerable. This is a pretty basic concept when it comes to business. If I start a corner deli, and buy my food from a single food distribution company that delivers every Thursday by truck. Then one Thursday the truck doesn't come, and i'm left for the weekend without any food for my restaurant. Is it valid for me to claim that food distribution companies are no way to build a restaurant? Even in the case of TweetDeck, using a very unique API (ie. Twitter), they had to diversify with other services. If your building a business around Google Translate API, what sort of plan B and C do you have...[<a href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/27/with-seevl-music-discovery-the-website-is-the-api/">"With Seevl Music Discovery, the Website is the API"</a></h3>
			<p><em>27 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Seevl, a music discovery service that provides anew way to explore the cultural and musical universe of various artists, just launched an API with the assistance of 3Scale.
When deploying the API, Seevl approached it a little differently than most. Instead of providing a separate API to access data, Seevl relies on content negotiation principles to deliver alternative representations of web pages.
This means the entire Seevl website is the API and you can get JSON representations of almost every page in the site.
Seevl relies on HTTP headers to let developers request data using a particular content-types, and authenticate using three parameters:

     
          Accept - The content-type required
     
     
          X_APP_ID - Developer application ID
     
     
          X_APP_KEY - Developer application Key
     
Here is an example search results for beatles using curl:

This approach is meant to make it easier for to developers focus on the development and let the Seevl client libraries handle the content-negotiation.
The Seevl API provides everal methods to search and pull specific data about individual bands and artists and related information.
While this approach is nothing new, its an interesting way to provide users with HTML views and developers with the JSON representations of information stored in a database.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/26/loggly-introduces-user-defined-variable-pricing/">"Loggly Introduces User Defined, Variable Pricing"</a></h3>
			<p><em>26 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Loggly recently changed the structure for their cloud-based logging service from a tiered pricing, to a user-defined variable pricing structure.
Users can define their own pricing tier using two key variables:

     Daily Log Volume - 200MB to 8 GB
     
     Log Retention Time - 1 Week to 180 Days
     
The pricing change was in response to a growing user base, and demand for volumes greater than 2GB/day.
Loggly still offers a free plan which supports 200MB/day and retention of 7 days. There is also a beginning paid plan that starts with 200MB/day, but has retention of 15 days, starting at $8/month.
Loggly is also adding support for secure syslog (TLS), HTTPs on web inputs, and log archives on all account levels including the free plan.
This is a great example of Software as a Service (SaaS) and API service providers innovating around monetization and trying to find the best approach that fits their customers needs and the services they offer.

			<p>Tomorrow I'm participating in a session at Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers.
Justin Tormey of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.
Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched Facebook + Games, a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.
I wrote about the the Journalist on Facebook page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.
This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.

			<p><em>24 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>The modern Web API got its start in CRM with Salesforce, and in E-commerce with Ebay and Amazon, but it really found traction with social platforms like Flickr, Twitter, and Facebook. If we want a glimpse of whats next for APIs we need to look at the areas where web APIs have been applied for the longest. We need to look at examples likeAmazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API, and Qwerly's aggregation of social media profiles into a single API. The social space is an area where the future of APIs is being played out right now. Since the social arena has reached a critical mass in the number of platforms, users, mobile apps, and available Web APIs, the sector has matured beyond other industries, and offers great insight into what the future holds. I've talked about unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface, and the potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas, but Qwerly's approach offers another view. Qwerly aggregates social profiles across many networks into a single dead-simple data API for the social web. With Qwerly you can get data about a user by querying the API with an email address or a social identifier, like a Twitter handle, a Facebook username or a Facebook ID, and the Qwerly API returns: the person's name their location a short description, like a Twitter bio their social networking profiles and usernames across the web, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks a score of their online influence among their peers, like Klout Qwerly API responses are delivered in JSON, and you only pay for what you use. The API combines information from web crawling, public web directories, other APIs with powerful heuristics and spam-detection algorithms, delivering high quality results. Other industries and sectors can benefit from such data and service discovery APIs, deployed in a RESTful way, using a...[<a href="/2011/05/24/whats-next-for-apis-learning-from-social-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>I was writing a story for ProgrammableWeb tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console. I hadn't properly covered the API Console, API Explorer here on API Evangelist, so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each. I noticed something while reviewing Google's recent efforts to organize their family of 88 APIs, and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers. Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale does for other API providers. Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch. Beyond expertise, they provide a set of common building blocks every API should offer. These are tools like forums and blogs you can find elsewhere, but these API service providers deliver in a neat bundle ready to go for your API. But the real value they bring to the table, that you can't really find anywhere else is: API Billing API Traffic Controls API Metrics &amp; Analytics And Apigee has one other piece that Mashery and 3Scale do not. They have an API Explorer. Google provides an API Explorer, and they have open sourced the code, and made it available at Google Code. Next the Google API Console delivers billing and traffic controls, if this set of tools were made open source, this would be huge for the API community. I've been a big proponent of the need for open source API building blocks. I say this not to devalue what Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale bring to the table. Their stuff rocks. However there are many other API owners out there who aren't ready for a service like theirs, or can't afford, and a set of open source building blocks is needed. That leaves metrics and analytics. I think an open source set of API analytics would be the biggest benefit to the...[<a href="/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google APIs Explorer</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>The Google APIs Explorer is is a tool that helps you explore various Google APIs in a web interface without writing any code.
Google APIs Explorer allows you to:

	Browse quickly through available APIs and versions
	See methods available for each API and available parameters
	Execute API requests for any method and see actual responses in real time.
	Make pubic or authenticated API calls

The GoogleAPIs Explorer currently supports only JSON for responses and request payloads, even though some APIs support other data formats like XML and AtomPub.
The Google APIsExplorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.
Google APIs Explorer supports the following APIs:

	Buzz
	Custom Search
	Diacritize
	Moderator
	Search API for Shopping
	Language API
	URL Shortener

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google APIs Discovery Service</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>TheGoogle APIs Discovery Service provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs. The discovery service delivers a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document"for each of the supported APIs that includes: List of API resource schemas based on JSON Schema List of API methods and available parameters for each method Available OAuth 2.0 scopes for each API Inline documentation of methods, parameters and available parameter values Developers can use the Google APIs Discovery Service to build client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools that interact with supported Google APIs. The Google APIs Discovery Service delivers two things for each supported API: APIs Directory Resource Identification and description information, including name, version, title, and description. Documentation information, including icons and a documentation link. Status information, including status labels, and an indication as to whether or not this is the preferred version of the API. Discovery document link, the URI of the discovery document for this API Discovery Document Resource Schemas, which is a list of API resource schemas that describe the data you have access to in each API Methods, including a list of API methods and available parameters for each method. OAuth scopes, which identifies the list of OAuth scopes available for this API. Inline documentation, which provides brief descriptions of schemas, methods, parameters and available parameter values. The Google APIs Discovery Service is part of a larger effort by Google to get a handle on their growing number of APIs. Developers find themselves potentially using multiple Google APIs across many application or client projects. The Google APIs Discovery Service allows developers to find new APIs available in the directory and programmatically discover how the API authenticates, what methods, and parameters are available. Not many companies have the number of APIs that Google has, and would need an API discovery service. But with the recent growth in web APIs there will be more...[<a href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google APIs Console</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>The Google APIs Console is an interface for developers to manage and view traffic data, authentication, and billing information for up to 15 Google APIs, and more coming soon.
Developers can bundle a collection of APIs into a project, and manage the following project information:

	Activated APIs - APIs can be activated to enable traffic monitoring, filtering, and billing, and API-specific project pages.
	Traffic information - Console reports show traffic information for each activated API, and allow for capping or filtering of usage for each API.
	Billing information - APIs now can have billing activated, allowing them to exceed the courtesy usage quota. Usage fees are billed using Google Checkout and charges are invoiced monthly.
	Project keys - Each project can be identified by either an API key or an OAuth 2.0 token. Using this key/token in API requests will identify the project, and enable the recording of usage data, filtering restrictions, and bill usage to the proper project. Within the Console developers can  generate or revoke API keys or OAuth 2.0 certificates for specific application.
	Team members - Team members can be established with read, write, or ownership access to each project's Console page.

The Google APIs Console supports fifteen separate Google APIs:


	Books API
	Buzz API
	Custom Search API
	Diacritize API
	Latitude API
	Moderator API
	Page Speed Online API
	Places API
	Prediction API
	Search API for Shopping
	Site Verification API
	Storage
	Tasks API
	Translate API
	URL Shortener API

The Google APIs Console provides a pretty comprehensive set of tools for developers and companies to manage their projects that integrate with various Google APIs.
The traffic control and billing tools provide a peek into the future of how billing and monetization will occur for APIs as they become more of a utility in our every day lives.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/21/discovery-services-for-common-apis/">Discovery Services for Common APIs</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>I just wrote about the potential ofopen source API billing and traffic control building blocks, if Google would open source their Google API Console, like they did with the Google API Explorer.
I started bundling in thoughts on Google APIs Discovery Service into that post, but then realized it is a separate issue, needing its own blog post.
First, Google isn't about to open source Google API Discovery Service.  They issue developers of the Google APIs Discovery Service a patent license.  I couldn't find any more details tonight, but I'm assuming it puts this service in a different category than the rest.
I wrote an overview of Google APIs Discovery Service, but essentially it is a way to discover and describe Google APIs using an API.  Think Web Application Description Language (WADL), with a API to access, and focused only on supported Google APIs.
As the number of web APIs grow, the need for a discovery APIs and a standard description language will only grow.  We wil see services like Google APIs Discovery Service popup within specific industries and API areas.
You see potential for this with Mashsery's API Network, and even more evidence with Mashape's Marketplace.
There aren't many companies with the number of APIs that Google has, so you won't see any single company building an API discovery service like that.
However, I'd like to see API discovery services for cloud computing, social media, location-based, and telcommunication APIs appear making it easier for developers to discover, build code libraries, and integrate with common APIs.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/18/series-3d-printing-virtual-warehousing/">Series - 3D Printing - Virtual Warehousing</a></h3>
			<p><em>18 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>With the growing number of 3D models used in 3D printing there is a building need for warehouse space to store these virtual products, and parts.
Of course this is virtual warehouse space, but it has a lot of the same characteristics of warehousing for physical products.
Google provides a 3D Warehouse for users of its SketchUp softare, and Shapeways provides a marketplace and warehouse in the form a gallery for its creators.
Cloud Storage will definitely have a role to play in warehousing the growing number of 3D modeling files using platforms like Google Docs, Box.net, and Dropbox.
3D Warehouses need to provide search-able, sharable and collaborative spaces that are affordable for designers to store and retrieve their work.
As 3D printing becomes a larger part of the global manufacturing supply chain, virtual warehousing across the globe will also become necessary to provide localized storage solutions.
3D printing offers significant advantages over traditional manufacturing when it comes to warehousing, but it still will be a critical part of the 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.
