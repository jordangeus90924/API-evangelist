        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.osu.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/osu-banner-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">While updating my APIs in higher education research this last week</a> I came across an API portal I think tells an important story about an evolution in how we develop and maintain software. The current wave of web APIs that I cover has been working well because it has exposed a number of valuable resources, that once upon a time were only available in the realm of IT, making these resources accessible to a wider audience of developers, or even business users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evolution has been slowly pulling back the curtain of IT, exposing more of it's inner workings, potentially simplifying, and decoupling valuable digital resources from legacy power structures. An important piece of this transformation is the translation of IT speak to language that the average human can understand, something that is playing out within API developer portals across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/25/taking-a-look-at-whats-next-for-the-environmental-protection-agency-epa-envirofacts-data-service-api/">I touched on this subject with my work on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Envirofacts API a couple weeks ago</a>. With a little work I was able to expose a rich set of API resources, just by renaming the APIs, and hydrating some of the acronyms that were being used. While this is an example of the intersection of government IT power structures, it represents the same evolution.</p>
<p>As I was updating my university API work, <a href="https://kmdata.osu.edu/s/">I stumbled across the same evolution occurring at The Ohio State University</a>. When you land on this API developer portal, you are given no signal that this contains course, and other valuable campus related APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://kmdata.osu.edu/s/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-ohio-state-university-api-portal-hidden.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This API effort is born out of a classic IT lead project, and while it brings forward some healthy API patterns, it also carries forth the language and culture of IT. I am not saying the team behind the API portal is approaching their portal with intentional bias, these types of efforts are common, and often done by very well meaning groups, who only shortcomings are they don't think about reaching a widest audience possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that anyone should be able to land on an API portal, and be able to understand what is going on, is a foreign concept to many IT and developer groups. They build web service portals, system documentation, and other system doorways, thinking that other like-minded (IT and dev) folks will be coming there. They just aren't used to thinking that business leaders, researchers, data journalists, teachers, students, and any number of other folks might be coming there too.</p>
<p>Most groups that I come across like this, just need to be enlightened, and they will course correct. A smaller, but an often vocal group see no use in anyone outside the IT good ol boy club having access to resources--this is the old IT guard, and how power is protected. They will be gone soon, but for now you will have to just work around them. My goal is to just educate the API portal groups who are willing to listen, and stimulate API efforts from outside of IT lead groups when it is necessary, not to convert the critics.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-services.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I work with each generation of API service providers, I always notice a portion of them that are born out of a previous era of software development from the 1990s, and even sometimes the early 2000s, This reminder frequently brings up the point of how these companies need to follow the same advice they (we) offer to their own customers--decouple your resources, into small API driven services. I regularly stumble upon companies who asks me to review software services that are targeting API providers, that don't reflect an API-first approach.</p>
<p>My advice to these companies is always to step back, take a deep breath, and consider how you can embark on the same journey that the companies you are targeting have already begun traveling. Define all of your digital assets, break them down into the smallest possible API resource you can, then retool how you sell these service through an API platform, as well as web, mobile, and other micro tooling that you, and your partners can build on top of these APIs. To me, this is the Dogfood (Champagne --&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/inadarei">@inadarei</a>) 2.0 conversation that needs happen in order for the API space to mature to the next level.</p>
<p>In 2015, if you are a company that is selling a service to API providers of any shape and size, and this service is not available via an API, and offers a self-service on-boarding flow, I probably won't be talking about it often. I won't be spending too much time convincing API service providers that they need to reduce this friction--it seems like common sense at this point, I will be focusing on the leading service providers, that they need to be "communicating" using common API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, and with <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collections</a>.</p>
<p>Just like we tell companies that are considering the API journey, "don't get left behind", as an API service provider you need to make sure and decouple your services, making them more agile, nimble, and scalable. Sound familiar ?? ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rate-limit-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">As I migrate the version 1.0 of my internal systems to an API-first version 2.0</a>, one of the challenges I face is the optimization of some of the features in my own system. I have numerous systems I crafted to solve a specific need, at a specific point in time, with very little consideration about the most efficient design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 50% of my version 1.0 systems employed APIs, many systems relied on directly connecting to my MySQL databases. One example of this is my main news curation screen on my dashboard. This was the replacement for Google Reader about 6 months before they killed it off. My reader system is very chatty, every action I take against a single post (archive, curate, tag, etc.) initiates a round-trip to the database--something when you translate to API calls, becomes a very huge blip on my API analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I treat all my internal apps, just like I would one of my API consumers, and make them sign up for key, and exist within my API service tiers. There are numerous reasons for this, but in the end, it helps me see things through an external lens. When I got my report on my usage, I noticed my curated API usage was through the roof. This is good right? No! It means I have super chatty features in my application, something I need to refactor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My curation may involve 1000 to 3000 news articles which needs to be curated or archived, resulting in potentially 3000 API calls, and when you add on applying tags, and managing other details, I can be in the 5,000 to 10,000 range pretty quick. Its obvious I need a better approach, so I'm developing a new queue based system that lets me work with 25 news stories at once, and submit the changes as a single bulk API call--significantly reducing the number of calls I make.</p>
<p>In the end, my API rate limits are forcing me to think through my app design, and how I make API calls. It also is helping me rethink how I design my APIs. I want each API call to be as efficient as it can from app to server. To quote my friend Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>), "rate limits on APIs pushes developers to be more creative". Something I agree with 100%, if it truly is a transparent conversation between API provider and consumer--which in my private, schizophrenic ecosystem is pretty easy to achieve.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">I am revisiting the service composition for my own APIs on a regular basis lately</a>, along with the ever increasing number of conversations I'm having with API providers about their own API monetization strategy. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/30/is-your-monetization-rooted-in-the-resource-or-experience-side-of-your-api-operations/">An example of this can be seen with the conversation I had&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Popup Archive about their monetization strategy for their AudioSear.ch API, and how they are shifting from a resource based perspective to a more experience based monetization approach.</a> One side effect of this conversation, is that it looped me back around to thinking about the next steps for my own system.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I currently have 28 APIs, with almost 400 endpoints, most of which are content and data style APIs</a>. This represents the core of the API Evangelist network, and now that I have it well defined as a single set of decoupled APIs, it is allowing me to move forward with a whole new generation of APIs. With my current set of content and data APIs, the number one consumer is me, any 3rd party usage is something I want to stimulate, and derive any revenue--my blog, curated, and other APIs are just value add to the traffic on my network of web sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the next phase of my API development, I am looking to create more structured API resources that do things like convert CSV to JSON, process patent XML dumps to JSON, the indexing of websites, and much more. These newer APIs tend to go well beyond just pulling information from a database, and require a little more engineering, as well as potentially a lot more compute resources to make a reality. Historically I only meter my APIs to help me manage my costs, but moving forward I am looking to actually generate revenue as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service composition I currently have defined using my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a> addresses the different types of consumers who potentially will be consuming my APIs. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/08/my-api-service-composition-tiers/">I have public, retail, trusted, partner, and platform service tiers that provide me with the buckets I need to manage my consumers</a>. However, this doesn't address my granular level API monetization goals, something I am now adding as a credit based system on top of my existing 3Scale API service composition to address. Each of my APIs will now have a credit value associated with it, with many having 1 as the value, others could run you as much as 50 or 100 credits--I am guessing most will be in the 1-10 range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an API-first system where I manage all my internal APIs, alongside all of the APIs I track on in the public sphere, and I am just adding this credit value to each entry, something that will then reflected in the APIs configuration file. As each API is called, it reports to my 3Scale API infrastructure what value of usage is being consume, and 3Scale does the rest for me. My API management infrastructure handles applying of the API usage to each users application, and which service composition tier that application operates within--and invoicing of each account accordingly.</p>
<p>It will take me a while to roll this out across my stack, and begin applying to some APIs that are in development and not quite ready for prime time. Hopefully my next update will have more examples of this in the wild. I'm eager to see how I can apply a credits cross my stack, better helping me understanding the value of each of the data, content, and algorithmic API resources I'm crafting, and ultimately whether this value translates to 3rd party API consumers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apiware.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apiware-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am fortunate to be able to take part in numerous conversations around API strategy, with companies, organizations, and government agencies who are trying to understand, and maximize the role they play in the API economy. However, one side effect of this world, is that most of these conversations begin and end with strategy planning, and when it comes to deployment and management, I rarely stay on in discussions. I do have clients who do check in with me, at different stops along their journey, but for the most part my role ends once the strategy discussions end.</p>
<p>I would like to change this with a new relationship I've established with <a href="http://apiware.io/">APIWare, a new API-first agency that is dedicated to defining, developing, deploying, and managing APIs at all stages of the life-cycle</a>. I have worked with the core team that is APIWare, on earlier projects, and after a couple of years, I've learned to trust the work they do.</p>
<p>API Evangelist and APIWare are partnering to make sure that some is always available to help you meet the demand of your API operations, by exclusively focusing on:</p>
<p><a href="http://apiware.io/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apiware-working.png" alt="" width="240" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining Your API - </strong>Where do your resources originate, and what is the best path forward in defining and designing your APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Developing Your API - </strong>The actual hard work of crafting your APIs from scratch, all the way to using common API gateway solutions and frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Managing API Operations -</strong> Take care of the day challenges when operating your API from monitoring and availability to developer on-boarding.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The APIWare team is determined to stay focused in these areas, while you are busy doing other things, and the team is working hard to follow many of the best practices that I showcase across my work in the API space. Now you don't just get a handful of initial conversations with me about best practices, you have a team that will help you actually address the pieces of API operations that are falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>I will not be doing any of the development, the core team is way more skilled at this than I am, however I will be involved with defining overall best practices for the team, and will be touching each project as it comes in the door, and at regular stages throughout its evolution. This approach helps make sure I can continue having many conversations throughout an APIs life-cycle, be there to share thoughts on the road-map, while also keep telling the important stories about API operations from the trenches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The API Evangelist + APIWare partnership reflects a shift in how I will be doing things in the future. I am looking to capture more of the exhaust from my world--filling a critical gap in providing companies and organizations with a reliable source of API development, and management resources, that operates in a structured, yet agile, project management way, while sticking to an API-first vision.</p>
<p>This new evolution in API Evangelist will not change my tone. My goal is to not to build a startup, but to help meet a growing demand in the space. I will still be as opinionated, and honest about my approach, I will just have more stories to tell! ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.citimobilechallenge.com/APIs/index.php">I was made aware of the&nbsp;Citi Mobile Challenge</a> during a conversation last week <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/23/pushing-my-api-gateway-thoughts-forward-api-gateway-anywhere-with-justapis/">with the Anypresence team about their new JustAPIs offering</a>. The conversation with them has triggered several potential stories, but one that stood out for me, was the API virtualization opportunities that emerge when <a href="http://justapis.com/">you use solutions like the JustAPIs gateway</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support the&nbsp;Citi Mobile Challenge, the bank launched a set of virtual APIs to support the event. I think their descriptions tells a lot of the story:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The APIs made available through Citi&reg; Mobile Challenge power some of Citi's latest digital offerings around the globe. These APIs will give developers an opportunity to create solutions that could function with existing Citi technology. No customer data will be shared. Citi encourages developers to also use APIs outside of Citi to support and add additional features to their innovations.</em></p>
<p>The bank needed to mimic their production environment, but in a way that developers can still build meaningful mobile apps,without the immediate security and privacy concerns that are present when working with live systems. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/11/i-wish-all-apis-had-sandbox-environment-by-default/">While I wish sandbox environments were default via all API platforms</a>, which unfortunately is not a reality, however I think when it comes to fintech, the stakes are much higher--which smells like an opportunity for API definitions to me.</p>
<p>It can be a lot of work to establish and maintain both sandbox and production environments, but is something that if you do, can open up even more opportunity when it comes to supporting hackathons, providing QA environments, and much more. Additionally, if you embrace modern API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint in this process, as well as approaches to containerization like Docker, a whole new agility and flexibility can be realized as well.</p>
<p>Like API monitoring, performance, security, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">other growing incentives for embracing modern API definition formats</a>, I see the demand for API virtualization growing. When your APIs are well defined, a new world of API definition driven services emerges, making things like virtualization for hackathons, QA, load testing, simulation, as well as just a permanent sandbox possible</p>
<p>I have an API virtualization research area started, I just need to spend the time organizing the companies who are doing interesting things in the space, and consider some of the possible building blocks, before it is ready for prime time--stay tuned!</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt">I found a pretty cool Github repository during my latest review of my university API research</a>, with a mission "<span>to provide a collection of RESTful web APIs that can allow developers to create applications or services that utilize public data from the University of Toronto."</span></p>
<p>I am a big fan of jump-starting API efforts on campus in this way, <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">something I did to help fuel the API discussion at University of Oklahoma</a>. Which is a topic I will be talking more about in the near future as these conversations continue play out. In my opinion, many campuses are just not ready for APIs, and to get things rolling, it will may often take outside influences.</p>
<p>This API project I found, that is dedicated to the University of Toronto is interesting because they identify three target APIs that are being worked on.</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" type="checkbox" />&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt/tree/master/api/courses">UofT Course API</a></li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" type="checkbox" />&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt/tree/master/api/buildings">UofT Building API</a></li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" type="checkbox" />&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt/tree/master/api/food">UofT Food API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are also building their own <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/uoft-scrapers">scraping module</a>, which is available in the repository, complete with a list of target sources, where they will be scraping valuable data for inclusion in the course, building, and food API. I find the project repository is very focused, informative, and simple--well done.</p>
<p>I would call this a minimum viable blueprint for API operations on any campus, and is something that should be forked, and cleansed of University of Toronto information,&nbsp; replaced with generalized how-to instructions--complete with a scraping tool. Anyone involved with a university should be able to set a project like this in motion, by forking, and following a simple blueprint.</p>
<p>With all the work available on Github, it also means anyone else can potentially get involved and contribute, and if a single project gets abandoned, someone else could potentially pick it up. Most importantly, when a university is actually ready to legitimize the API efforts, they can also fork, and build on top of any work that has been already accomplished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this approach to doing APIs at the higher educational level may not be optimal, sometimes its all we have to stimulate the API discussion on campus, something that we just can't wait for--it needs to be set in motion as soon as possible..</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-experience-monetization.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had another one of my regular check-ins with Anne and Bailey over at <a href="https://www.popuparchive.com/">Popup Archive</a>&nbsp;today, with a focus around the monetization strategy for their <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">AudioSear.ch API</a>. I thoroughly enjoy my conversations with the team, because they have worked really hard on their audio API solutions, and are extremely open to discussion, and sharing the stories of their API journey.</p>
<p>During our talk, they tuned me into where they were at with their road-map, which includes now having <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">a solid set of API resources that provide access to the episodes, people, and shows involved in podcasts across the Internet</a>. They talked about how they have been iterating on these core API resources, with more experience focused endpoints including relatedness, trending, and tastes, to name a few. All of this really demonstrates that the company are well along in their API journey, moving beyond just the definition of core aPI resources, and actually getting in tune with how these resources will actually be put to work.</p>
<p>Next they walked me through some of the core use cases for their podcast API, ranging from radio stations looking to provide better recommendations, to advertisers who want to better understand the exploding world of podcasts, and understand where the opportunity is. Audiosear.ch is working to quantify the world of podcasting, by indexing not just the metadata surrounding audio files, but also its contents, and relationships between them--busting open a brand new realm in cyberspace, that like video, that is poised for explosive growth, and will be ripe with opportunities.</p>
<p>Now that AudioSear.ch can crack open, index, and develop awareness around the contents of podcasts, which includes the episodes and people involved with shows, they are also faced the hard part of actually defining, and delivering APIs that developers will need, and actually pay for. Meaning which API endpoints do we provide, and what do we charge for them? The number one conversation I am having with companies who have embarked on their own API journey.</p>
<p>These conversation always begin with discussion the hard costs: what did we invest in developer hours? what are our licensing costs? what does compute cost? what does our storage cost? what does our bandwidth cost? All of these costs are rooted in the resource side of the conversation. Where do the data, content, and other resource originate? How much work have we put into? How do we perceive the value of our own resources? Leaving every API provider trying to figure out what people will pay, and calculating their margins--resource-based monetization strategy.</p>
<p>Resource-based API monetization strategies are where all API operations begin when they trying to figure things out. Once you are further along in your API journey like Anne and Bailey are, you need to start thinking about more experienced based pricing, something that will be more closely aligned with how API consumers actually see things. As an API provider, you tend to be too closely aligned with your resources, focused on an API design derived from this view, and a monetization strategy that looks to cover the costs, while also bringing home a potentially good margin. When you are rooted in this way of thinking you are always chained to your core resource-based assumptions, which is often very distant from what will be important to your customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you<a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer"> look at how Audiosear.ch is iterating with the more experience based API designs like /trends, /relatedness, and /tastes for podcasts</a>, you see how they are beginning to uncover what is actually valuable to end-users. As they keep iterating on these experience based API endpoints, driven by API consumer needs, you can't have your pricing solely anchored to the resource, it needs to also reflect the value perceived by the consumer. You never know when you will find just the right endpoint for a resource, that has high perceived value to end-user, but relatively low costs associated with actually delivering--add entirely new dimensions to your margins.</p>
<p>Approaching API monetization based upon how resources will be experience, decoupling from just a resource based approach, will first and foremost increase the chance that anyone will purchase API access for any sustained period, but secondly opens up a whole new world for price increases (or reductions) based upon demand (think AWS). These are just some initial thoughts from our conversation, something I will be thinking about more in coming weeks, and hopefully provide some other more concrete examples of this in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just needed to work through some initial thoughts as I got out of the Google Hangout--thanks Anne and Bailey #GoodTimes</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apittie-node-endpoints.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>in my time as API Evangelist I've seen a number of API deployment as a service providers come and go. It is something that is technically hard to do properly, and something that historically had been hard to monetize, but as a wider awareness around APIs grows in the mainstream, the demand landscape for API deployment is shifting.</p>
<p>I got a demo of an API provider today called <a href="https://www.apitite.net/">apitite</a>, which provides API deployment and management services in the cloud. The core of the service is built around the common need to deploy APIs from datasources like MySQL, SQL Server, etc. However I wanted to highlight another feature of their platform <a href="http://blog.apitite.net/2015/07/introducing-nodejs-code-endpoints.html">which they call code endpoints</a>.</p>
<p>When I help folks understand what is possible with APIs, I break into four main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - APIs are about making data more accessible, and usable.</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> - With a focus on data, many forget to talk about serving of media and content via LAPIs.</li>
<li><strong>Functional</strong>&nbsp;- Providing more algorithmic and functional features that accomplish a task.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware</strong> - Allowing for a device to connected to by other applications and systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know this is simplified, and some tech pundits will love to poke holes in it, but when you are explaining the API opportunity to business leaders, as well as the average business user, this has worked well for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>apitite delivers on the functional portion of this API equation forward for me, with their endpoints service. Their platform is Node.js based, but allows for very small scripts to be deployed as simple API endpoints. When you couple this with marketplace-like abilities so users can find ready to go scripts they can reverse engineer, as well as a place for developers to publish and share / sell their scripts--you have a potentially very powerful API deployment formula.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen other similar solutions emerge like <a href="https://algorithmia.com/">Algorthmia</a>, but nothing that is bundled with the data API capabilities that apitite also brings to the table. Anyways, I just wanted to highlight this single point from this conversation, while it was fresh in my head. I will have more to share on <a href="https://www.apitite.net/">apitite</a> as I play with the platform more, and incorporate into a project I am working on around government data.</p>

<p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/universities.html">With my latest look at APIs in universities, I increased the number of institutions I'm watching from 17 to 48, more than doubling the number of API efforts in higher education from 2014 to 2015</a>.

<p>I could spend hours looking through each university's search, finding new APIs from student and class projects, and from research going on across campus. LIke all of my research it is a work in preogress, and I depend on my audience to help me discover what is out there.</p>
<p>If you know of a school who is doing interesting stuff with APIs please let me know, or if you work at one of the schools listed above, feel free to reach out anytime. I'm always looking to hear more stories out of universities about API design, deployment, maangement, evangelism or integration.</p>
<p>I will work harder to update my university research more frequently, and <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/white-paper.html">if you want to visit more of my research in detail, you can download as HTML or PDF for enjoyment late</a>r(helps put me to sleep). Once I get this round of papers updated, I'm going to provide ePub as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in!</p>

<p>I am currently trying to move forward the&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">917 companies, from 223 business areas, with a total 882 APIs catalogued, and 407 Swagger definitions created</a>, while working on a distributed way to understand where the profiling for each company is, and how far in defining this in a machine readable way. <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">I had kicked off another prototype APIs.json type a few months back I'm calling api-questions to handle just this</a>, in a way that allows me to ask human readable questions about APis, while also storing in a distributed, machine readable format that can be indexed via each APIs.json file.</p>
<p>I have long tracked on what public APIs are doing in a database. I keep links to Github and Twitter profiles, blogs to pricing, and terms of service. I started publishing this information to APIs.json for the companies I track on a while back. I have the information, and I'm working my way through thousands of APIs, trying to make sure there is a complete definition available, I needed an automated way to help make sure I'm asking the right quesitons consistently of each API.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">in addition to my list of Swagger oriented questions</a>, I've compiled a list of the most common APIs.json defined, API operations related questions that I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there an API? (the most important question of them all!)</li>
<li>Is there an APIs.json File?</li>
<li>Is there a blog?</li>
<li>Is there a blog RSS feed?</li>
<li>Is there a portal?</li>
<li>Is there a platform description?</li>
<li>Is there getting started information?</li>
<li>Is there documentation for the API?</li>
<li>Is there interactive documentation for the API?</li>
<li>Is there an authentication overview?</li>
<li>Is there self-service registration?</li>
<li>Is there request for access?</li>
<li>Is there code samples?</li>
<li>Is there code libraries?</li>
<li>Is there SDKs?</li>
<li>Is there email for support?</li>
<li>Is there an FAQ section?</li>
<li>Is there a knowledge base?</li>
<li>Is there a forum?</li>
<li>Is there a Twitter account?</li>
<li>Is there a LinkedIn account?</li>
<li>Is there a Github account?</li>
<li>Is there a pricing page?</li>
<li>Is there a rate limit page?</li>
<li>Is there a road map?</li>
<li>Is there a change log?</li>
<li>Is there a status page?</li>
<li>Is there a terms of service?</li>
<li>Is there a privacy policy?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me along, I've created a <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/">simple API for management of my API related questions</a>, then I created <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=https://kin-lane.github.io/api/apis.json&amp;questions=19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45">another API for asking these questions of specific APIs.json files</a>. However if you want to use this API, you need an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> index for your APIs, which all of mine in the API stack do--then it will spider and do its best to answer the &nbsp;questions above, and return specific answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results are far from perfect, but it is a start. I will be making the questions more precise, and adding new questions. My goal is to have a real-time way of telling how complete my APIs.json files are, and where the work is that needs to be done--as I am doing the work.</p>
<p>I'm sure the definition of exactly what is a complete APIs.json definition is will continue to evolve, always resulting in a human having the final vote, but for now I will just keep defining, until I find the right balance between programmatic, and the human touch.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/29/asking-the-right-questions-of-api-operations/">Asking The Right Questions Of API Operations</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-questions-ask.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I ask a lot of questions about the API space. In m quest to make sense of the growing number of APIs in the space, I partnered with 3Scale to define the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json format</a>. In the year since we launched, I've used it to help me define almost 1000 companies that I keep an eye on in the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be able to understand APIs at scale, I had to develop a way to ask questions about a companies API operations, while also asking them of my own APIs. This project was born out of some research into making API terms of service (TOS) machine readable, which led me to the project <a href="https://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>--a very important project you should know about. Long story short, I realized how much work it would be to make APIs TOS machine readable, and distilled things down to just be able to ask simple questions about APIs like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there self-service registration?</li>
<li>Can I delete my account?</li>
<li>Do I own my data?</li>
</ul>
<p>I then quickly realized the potential for my api-questions format, and that it could help me avoid getting tangle up in the legaleze of API TOS, and speed up making sense of how APIs work. I also saw that I could apply api-questions to other areas of API operations that I already track on like code resources, pricing, and support. api-questions would be a machine readable index of the questions I ask most about APIs, from A-Z.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin with I compiled almost 60 of the most common questions I ask about APIs, and launched an API to support the adding, editing, and modifying of these questions. I broken these questions down into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/29/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-apisjson-edition/">APIs.json Questions</a> </strong>- Things I generally wanted to know about API operations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">Swagger Questions</a> </strong>- Things I wanted to know specifically about the API, and since I profile them using Swagger...</li>
</ul>
<p>I have started apply an api-questions approach to the APIs that I depend on to run API Evangelist. You can see this in action with the Alchemy API. I ask the same two groups of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=http://theapistack.com/data/alchemyapi/apis.json&amp;questions=19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45">APIs.json Questions</a> - </strong>I want to understand how complete the Alchemy API operations is, and where all the moving parts are in a machine readable way.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=http://theapistack.com/data/alchemyapi/apis.json&amp;questions=46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73">Swagger Definitions</a> -</strong> I want to be able to ask the Swagger questions of each of the Alchemy APIs, where you really start seeing the need for automation here.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/data/alchemyapi/apis.json">If you look at the APIs.json I maintain for the Alchemy API you will also notice I added both these api-questions to the main API index</a>. I'm still working on the format, and the best way to reference the questions for each API, as well as the whole collection. However the goal is to provide a machine readable list of questions, anyone can put to use when evaluating what API they want to use, while also making the questions available in <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p>While formulating api-questions as a way to automate the questions I was asking of public APIs, I felt it should also be asked of my own internal APIs. I wanted to make sure my APIs meet the bar I set for the APIs I monitor in the API sector. This is where api-questions move from an external discovery thing for me, to an internal discovery plus operational quality of service.</p>
<p>api-questions gives me the ability to ask consistent questions of all of my APIs, knowing that they are indexed in each centralized APIs.json index. Right now I just have APIs.json and Swagger related questions, but I will be adding to these groups, as well as establishing entirely new groups from the business and politics of API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When applied to API operations, api-questions takes on a different lens when you are looking at external APIs, but when applied to your own internal APIs it changes views again, and helps you understand potentially where the gaps are, and helps you establish a checklist for overall operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I am using api-questions to make sure my APIs have consistently designed interfaces, interactive documentation, complete SDKs in all languages, Postman collections for integration, and monitors that keep my APIs as available as possible</a>. While I'm still working out a lot of kinks, this approach is helping me manage my own operations at scale, which also involves understanding thousands of public APIs, establishing a pretty virtuous cycle for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another layer I am adding to api-questions is the concept of api-certification, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/certification/">which I have deployed another API to support</a>, which basically groups questions together, but looks for specific answers to those questions, and certifies an API meets these requirements on a regular schedule. Stay tuned for that...</p>
<p>The purpose of this story is to help me grasp whats next for this work, while also sharing this methodology, and the tooling I have developed with my partner team at <a href="http://apiware.io">APIWare</a>. I want to make sure all APIs that are deployed and managed in a consistent way, with all the essential building blocks for success.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/27/politics-of-the-api-economy/">Politics Of The API Economy</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-protest.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I did a napkin doodle the other day at my favorite local hangout during lunch and beers. I was thinking about the finer points of the API economy that I dwell on, and feel are important not just for API success, but also developer, end-user, and industry level health. In this doodle, I'm trying to think about where I need to focus my energy when working to keep the API pipes as transparent and open as possible.</p>
<p>For me, this isn't just an API story, this is a story about the evolution fo the web, and ultimately a story of the journey humans are on, when it comes to defining our virtual self, that participates in the online domains that capture our attention on a daily basis. I wanted to better understand how companies are moving digital assets online, generating new resources, which are often times user-generated resources, empowered by developers. This is a complex world unfolding, and here was my attempt to better understand.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Virtual Domains.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I worked to distill this down, and represent the key actors, and struggles, we are facing as the API economy becomes a reality. Companies are moving more digital resources online, while also developing platforms for users and developers to generate, and work with valuable resources like images, text, videos, and more. These resources (or lifebits to users) live within the growing number of virtual domains.</p>
<p>In the early Internet days, these resources were often static content, but around 2005, during the web 2.0 phase, things became much more more dynamic. This evolution continued with mobile, and is only picking up momentum with the Internet of Things. These resources x domains x users x apps x developers = the units that make up the API economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship between all the actors involved in the exchange of these units, are often being managed by oAuth, but also other more simplistic ways like keys, passwords, etc. Identity is king, of serious value to platforms, but simply your digital self to the average online user. This relationship is heavily impacted by government and industry influences ranging from regulation to patent and copyright challenges, as well as the higher level NSA and cybersecurity conversations that plague the online world.</p>
<p>If we are lucky the resources we depend on, and the life bits we generate daily, are securely stored and transmitted with end-users knowledge and consent, and enjoying a high level of ethics by developers, with transparency at the corporate and government levels. Unfortunately this isn't something we enjoy across the board, and will be the biggest challenge of the API economy.</p>
<p>Access to resources, security, transparency, licensing, ownership and other items I included in my doodle will come into play heavily across this new economy. This isn't just about companies deploying APIs. This will be a real-time balance between platforms, developers, users, and the government, that will have to be constantly managed by everyone involved.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-write.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Most of the APIs you find out there are read only, meaning they act like a website and just allow you to retrieve data, content, and other media types, but usually do not let you read or write any data to them. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/11/augmenting-a-read-only-api-with-an-external-post-put-and-delete/">I wrote a while back about&nbsp;augmenting a read only API with an external POST, PUT, and DELETE</a>&nbsp;as I came out of the government, but wanted to update the topic, based upon some open data work I'm doing with <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">RESTlet API Spark</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://restlet.com/resources/detail/summer-of-apis-workshop/">I am preparing for my Restlet Summer of APIs webinar tomorrow morning</a>, so I am publishing some open data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) to the platform, generating data stores, and ultimately APIs. A simple example of this in action would be with <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farmers-markets-geographic-data">farmers market data from the US Department of Agriculture</a>. <a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html">There is a farmers market API, but it leaves a lot to be desired</a>, something others, <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2011/08/08/farmers-market-api/">like Code for America have tried to solve</a>, but I figured I could not just launch an API from the open dataset, I would make it read and write.</p>
<p>Deploying an API with Restlet's APISpark is pretty straightforward, something I will build a more detail walk-through in the future, but to summarize, you just download the Excel file from data.gov, and upload to Google Spreadsheet. Once you have cleaned up the spreadsheet, fields, and other elements, you can connect to your Google Drive using API Spark, and generate an entity data store--you now have a separate copy of the Google Spreadsheet, stored on APISpark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, you can publish a web API using the service, something you can use to launch multiple versions, require authentication to use, track usage, and much more. The great part, is it doesn't just generate the GET for your API, you also get the POST, PUT, and DELETE. You have now have a full read and write API for Farmers Market dataset. You could now accept submissions from Famer Market owners, merchants, and attendees to expand on the dataset, outside the original USDA source.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how you could augment existing open data sources, or even an existing API, and improve on them using Restlet API Spark. The best part is you can do this without any coding. While it does take some work to massage the data, and API design into shape, I did a handful of APIs with never actually writing any code. <a href="http://restlet.com/resources/detail/summer-of-apis-workshop/">If you want to see this in action, catch my workshop tomorrow morning at 10 AM</a>, and maybe you can find a dataset you would like to see improved with a simple API, and <a href="http://restlet.com/summer-of-apis/">participant in the Restlet Summer of APIs</a>.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/280px-Environmental_Protection_Agency_logo.svg.png" alt="EPA" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was asked by folks at the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> to provide some feedback on the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html">Envirofacts Data Service API</a>, as they prepare to work on the next iteration. I took a quick glance at the landing page for their service, I saw a simple URL layout showing how to make API calls, and made an estimate that it would take me probably an hour or two (at the most) to profile the API.</p>
<p>As I dug into the process of profiling the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API one evening in May, I realized I was wrong about the scope of the API, and became unsure how long it would actually take me. Then this work got lost in the shuffle of my summer, and is something I only recently picked up. I'm not happy if I can't provide an agency with some direction on where to go next, and after about 12 hours of work, I think I have some valuable feedback that they can run with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html">The&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API program consists of a single landing page</a>, with an overview of how to use the API, and a myriad of pages below, that explain the underlying data model put to use. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/22/an-example-of-resource-based-api-design-over-at-the-envirofacts-data-service-api/">The API is what I consider a very resource driven API design, meaning it reflects the database resource it came from, and not much emphasis on how the API driven resources will be used</a>.</p>
<p>While the API does use the URL, it uses few of the other HTTP components that make some RESTful. I can see how the design would make sense to a database engineer, but will be a little confusing for API developers.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/epa-envirofacts-api-base-url.gif" alt="" width="100% /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you get to know the interface, it starts to get a little more coherent, but lacks the intuitive aspects of a modern web API. Once you get familiar, you start to realize the number of tables available as part of the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service, and realize at the same time the wealth of data available, as well as the volume of work it will take to fully understand and profile the API.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially there are 20 separate groupings of tables, but I was only able to really identify actual API I could profile for 13 of them. &lt;a href=" /><a href="http://developer.epa.gov/">After looking beyond this portal I have since found other possible APIs,</a> but honestly they are often even more incoherent than the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API. I'm not trying to review the entire EPA API efforts, and will be specifically focusing on the resources available in the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API for this round.</p>

</table>
<p>After I discovered the 411 tables across these 13 groups, and learned the common URL pattern for querying, I decided to define each table as its own endpoint, rather than relying on each table to be included via a {table} path parameter, I opted to hard code it. Even though most of them are incoherent, some still articulate a little bit more about what they resource might do, and once you make a request, you get an even better idea. All of this can go a long way towards helping people understand what is going on.</p>
<p>It wouldn't take much to apply a coherent summary&nbsp; to each endpoint that describes what is stored in the table for use. Once I had a list of all tables, I went ahead and made a call to each of the 411 endpoints in the 13 areas, and generated a Swagger API definition for each. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/parsing-charles-proxy-exports-to-generate-swagger-definitions-while-also-linking-them-to-each-path/">Using Charles Proxy I was able to generate the underlying data model for each</a>, which is necessary for generating SDKs, and can be used as a central truth throughout other aspects of API integration. The current API design also allows you pass in a field, and apply an operator against it when searching--I opted to leave this out of this iteration, until I had a clear diction of endpoints, and the underlying data model defined for each.&nbsp; The API is perfectly usable without this.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping Things Simple</strong><br />My recommendation for any future API release out of the EPA team would be focused on just simplifying things. When you land on the home page, you get the idea there is an API present, but you do not grasp the depth of the resource. A simple list of the various API groups is important. A list that I hydrated from the acronyms, to better demonstrate what lies beneath. Calling things by their actual names just makes things more intuitive. You need to reach out of your government silos. I had to really work hard to make sense of the data model at play, I was sure there would be a meta API or download allowing me to quickly understand things, but I couldn't find it. By creating Swagger definitions for all API endpoints, complete with associated definitions for the data model, I can now easily build querying, filtering, and other mechanisms into my clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speaking In Plain English</strong><br />While FRS_PROGRAM_FACILITY&nbsp;may had made sense to the database administrator when naming the original, it does not adequately describe the resource it is serving up. A big part of the next version for these APIs needs to focus on renaming towards more meaningful endpoints over the cryptic table names, and more descriptive fields for each of the underlying data definitions. After crafting the Swagger definitions for these APIs I am blown away by the amount of information in here, obfuscated by the cryptic database naming conventions.</p>
<p><strong>Wrap In A Clean Portal</strong><br />The current landing page for the Envirofacts API is fairly cluttered, and ultimately doesn't say much--it made me work to hard to get what I need. My goal was to distill down the 13 APIs I found buried in the Envirofacts API page, and expose exactly what you need to understand and get to work using any of the 13 APIs and the over 400 endpoints--nothing more. &nbsp;<a href="http://epa-envirofacts.apievangelist.com/">I started with a simple Github Pages hosted template, with a single APIs.json home page, and interactive documentation for each of the APIs</a> (which you can fork).</p>

The EPA was proposed by President Richard Nixon and began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the president and approved by Congress. The current administrator is Gina McCarthy. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.</td>

<p>With my new portal, you get the overview of the EPA API, with link to each API, but I also use the Swagger definition to generate Swagger interactive documentation, rather than sending you to the EPA data model page. This is just the start. I can also use Swagger to generate sandbox environments, cloning APIs, and maybe allowing for updates and changes. I could also use the Swagger to generate client libraries for EPA APIs using <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a>. <a href="http://epa-envirofacts.apievangelist.com/roadmap/">I'll add all of this to the roadmap, I think I have done enough work for now, and ready to hand things back to EPA</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see EPA consider some of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common building blocks</a> I recommend as part of <a href="http://api-portal.apievangelist.com/">my default developer portal</a>. You don't have to do everything, but the more you do to engage the public around your API, the more chances they will actually use it. Additionally if you go through all APIs, and translate everything from databaseze to English, the potential someone will build on it will exponentially increase.</p>
<p><strong>Continue On The API Journey At EPA</strong><br />Beyond the portal, and better describing the APIs, my advice is to just continue on the API journey at EPA--this is where the learnings come from. On the current Envirofacts API page, there is another API in addition to the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API, the UV Index API. I can tell the thinking that went into this, are the beginning steps of more experience based API design, focusing on how the API will be used. There is still a lot of the same design mistakes in crafting URLs for this API, but I can tell the desire is there to continue improving on the original design.</p>
<p>When you look at the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/multisystem.html">Envirofacts Multi-system Search</a>, and the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/widgets.html">widgets that are present</a>, you also see some serious thought put into usability--this needs to be applied to the API design. The API is for other developers, but you can assist them in better understanding the potential through better API design.</p>
<p>I haven't changed anything with the current EPA&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API, I just worked to understand how it works, profiled each service I found as a Swagger definition, <a href="http://epa-envirofacts.apievangelist.com/apis.json">and then brought them all together as a single APIs.json driven collection</a>. This process helped me understand the 13 APIs and 400+ endpoints, while also distilling this definition into a set of machine readable index, that I use to <a href="http://epa-envirofacts.apievangelist.com/">drive the Github Page developer portal I launched</a>. APIs.json drives the home page, and each APIs Swagger definition drives its associated interactive documentation.</p>
<p>When it comes to the next iteration of the EPA&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API, I'd focus on a simple, concise portal for supporting developers, complete with the common building blocks found in other leading API platforms. I would also focus on taking the API definitions I've created, and get to work humanizing the design of these 13 APIs, and 400+ endpoints. Make the endpoints intuitive, standardize your approach to query, and pagination based upon other leading approaches established by API architects. Then do the dirty work of humanizing the underlying definitions, field names, and descriptions. Think deeply about both the request and response structure, and make it speak to developers--your simple, intuitive portal, with the right building blocks will provide a potential feedback look for this cycle (if you do it right).</p>
<p>If you do this, then get to work generating some SDKs, setup some monitors with <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a> or <a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a>, and provide <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collections</a> for your API consumers, and&nbsp; get busy evangelizing that these APIs even exist--the API will get used. There is a lot of value present here, it just needs to be brought out, polished, and presented in a way that showcases the hard work going on at EPA.</p>

<p>API Evangelist has always been about helping on-board the masses with concepts involving APIs, something that takes a lot of work, because more often than not, an API is a very abstract concept, far removed from the everyday lives of normal people. When services like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> launched, I became very optimistic about how APIs can be put to work by the average individual, and today my optimism went up another notch, with the redesign of <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a>.</p>
<p>The Blockspring home page image says it all in my opinion--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">valuable API resources, neatly available in Google Sheets, and Excel on the desktop, and in the Cloud with Office 365</span>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Blockspring-Money-Shot.png" alt="" width="100%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>This is it! This is the window to the API economy that will be required to take things to the next level. Most of the worlds business is conducted through this interface, without drag and drop access to valuable API resources, the API economy is a non-starter.</p>
<p>I've been tracking on Blockspring for a while, <a href="http://theapistack.com/">and have been working with them to define machine readable API definitions in Swagger that they can use in their spreadsheet connector(s)</a>. However their site redesign really struck a chord with me when it comes to the API Evangelist mission, something I wanted to take a moment to share.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>Bruno Pedro (<a href="/admin/blog/bpedro">@bpedro</a>) who has been building <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> into his <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com">API Changelog service</a>, made a pull request to the specification recently, pushing forward the link relation conversation for APIs.json. As listed in the specification, we have long intended to make APIs.json an official media type:</p>
<p><strong>3.5. &nbsp;Media Type</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the media type "application/apis+json" will be&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted to IANA as per RFC:&nbsp;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4288</p>
<p>However when it came to expressing your APIs.json as a link relation, we didn't even really have a plan in our road-map, resulting in a very generic allocation of a link relation for APIs.json.</p>
<p><strong>3.8. Link Relation</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In order for an API to reference its own description, it is recommended that it include header or in-line references to the APIs.json file using the existing described by link relation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Note, this is a generic link relation but seems to fit the bill]</p>
<p>What Bruno is suggesting that we get a little more precise when it comes to our link relation, something the rest of the governing group for APIs.json agrees with. Here is the last update to the link relation:</p>
<p><strong>3.8. Link Relation&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In order for a Web site to reference its API description, it is recommended that it includes a header or&nbsp;&nbsp; in-line reference to the APIs.json resource using the api link relation, e.g.:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the link relation &ldquo;api&rdquo; will be&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted to IANA as per RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988</p>
<p>As with the media type, we intend to submit the link relation to Iana, per its RFC. Bruno's pull request sets in motion the formal link relation, but then also escalates the media type submission as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the interest and usage we have seen in the first year of the specification, we are confident the API discovery format will get traction. We are already seeing exploration around the link relation, achieving RSS like experience in the browsers, when visiting websites that have an active API program.</p>

<p>I have added a link relation to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="/admin/blog/Kin Lane">Kin Lane</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">Master API project</a>, all pointing to my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json">central APIs.json</a>, which provides an index of not just each of the APIs I use to operate the API Evangelist network, but also the supporting building blocks of API operations like pricing, support, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Bruno for the pull request, pushing out a minor release of the APIs.json spec, <a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.15.txt">moving us to&nbsp;0.15</a>. This release primes the pump, for a queue of APIs.json requests that are in the works, like more API property types, country origin, and much more.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2015</span>

<p>I open up my Thursdays to briefings, calls, demos and other phone,  skype, and hangout related activities. This morning I received a  walk-through of the <a href="http://justapis.com/">JustAPIs platform</a> from <a href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a>, taking my thoughts in a much different direction than in my conversation with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/23/pushing-my-api-gateway-thoughts-forward-api-and-single-page-app-development-with-wavemaker/">Wavemaker, which was at the intersection of API design and API gateway in  this new cloud-based, single page application design studio</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>JustAPIs is a downloadable, installable, portable, little API design, deployment, and management engine, which you can install on Linux, Windows, Mac, and even your Raspberry Pi. This represent the functionality I have in mind, when I think about the future of what is an API gateway--a little node that can put <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYWHERE</span> to serve up, proxy, and manage my APis.</p>
<p>I downloaded JustAPis, ran at localhost, and begin mapping it to a handful of my remote APIs, and crafting a couple simple APIs to understand what is possible. Its obvious there is still a lot of work to be done, as the whole management side of JustAPIs is under construction, but I like what I see so far. I like the micro gateway characteristic. I think it has potential in not just the API economy, but specifically in the mobile, and IoT layers of the API economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/JustAPIs-Admin.png" alt="" width="75%" /></p>
<p>As with my Wavemaker discussion today, there are aspects of JustAPIs I'd like to see a become a reaility, in the realm of hypermedia, discovery with APIs.json, and portability, and interoperability using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, but it is a great start. JustAPIs is a significant movement forward in the evolution my perception of just what is an API gateway, and after talking with the JustAPIs team, I am confident that because of the extensibility available in the solution, it will become a ubiquitous layer of the API economy.</p>
<p>JustAPIs dovetails nicely with other movements I'm watching in the API space around containerization, and software defined networking. When you have a lightweight gateway that you can launch anywhere, with the ability to launch existing API blueprints, as well as allow extensibility by other API driven services--the landscape will begin to shift quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a number of other stories, derived from my conversation with JustAPIs today, but I will save them for the future. I will keep playing with, and exploring the JustAPIs engine. Todays conversation with Wavemaker and JustAPIs has done wonders for my API gateway perspective, at a time where I'm open to possibilities, and determined to move the conversation forward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wavemaker/wavemaker-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I open up my Thursdays to briefings, calls, demos and other phone, skype, and hangout related activities. This morning I received a walk-through of the <a href="https://www.wavemakeronline.com">Wavemaker Online platform</a>, and got a look at the intersection of API design and API gateway in this new cloud-based, single page application design studio.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">I bitched a little the other day about the Amazon API Gateway released, talking about how I was underwhelmed</a>, and I also <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/22/thoughts-on-api-gateway-deployment-over-artisan-farm-to-table-api-design-and-deployment/">blew some hot air about deploying APIs using a gateway solution vs. what I call farm to table API development</a>, but ultimately I'm just pushing myself to think harder about how we not just deploy our APIs, but keep in alignment with our design, and management processes. It was interesting that more than one call this Thursday are in alignment with this journey I find myself on--good timing Wavemaker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screenshot below from my WaveMaker Studio workspace tells an important story. This is API design, deployment, and management, all in the service of rapidly deploying a single page app client, via a single platform.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/gateway/">While Wavemarker has their own gateway solution as well</a>, the WaveMaker Online Studio has "gateway-esque"features in it, allowing me to design and deploy APIs in support of my single page application, and widget development.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wavemaker/WaveMaker-Studio.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Wavemaker speaks the common gateway speak I would say that your average application designer would need to speak, allowing you to craft APIs for your apps from other web APIs, SOAP, APIs, feeds, and databases (the common gateway building block). You just define each of the resources you depend on, and they are available in your toolbox.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wavemaker/WaveMaker-Studio-Web-Service.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I'm going to call this API gateway light(wish I had better word). This gateway is in the service of single page application development (which is another spect I like), and I'm assuming they could be part of your larger Wavemaker API strategy, but they might also never be used past this single implementation. With all of your newly configured, "gatewayed" resources in your toolbox, you can being crafting apps, widgets, visualizations, and other common API driven implementations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wavemaker/WaveMaker-Studio-3.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Ideally any application designer who was using the Wavemaker Studio to craft their APIs, would also have a wealth of internal API resources to depend on, who are managed by skilled API teams, but even if they don't, Wavemaker acts as an API gateway to existing internal infrastructure, as well as the wealth of public API resources available to us today. To me, API design solutions like Wavemaker are beginning to look like web design solutions of the last 10 years, but are applying gateway logic to help move beyond just data and document stores for sources, and going API-first.</p>
<p>This is just the start of API gateway discussions I am having with Wavemaker. They are going to schedule regular conversations with me, and the next one is specifically about their actual API gateway offering. While there are aspects of Wavemaker I think are slightly behind where API design is going (ie, <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">Hypermedia</a>, <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com">Swagger</a>, Postman, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>), I think their approach to baking in common features of gateways into existing API, as well as app design workflows, is pushing the conversation forward.</p>
<p>Stay tuned as I keep gathering my thoughts on how to push the API gateway conversation forward, as well as learn more about Wavemaker.</p>

Leaving me thinking...what is the better way to design, and deploy an API? Gateway or hand-crafted? &nbsp;Ok, cut to the chase, its a bullshit question, but for the sake of working through my own anxiety, I'm going to explore.</p>
<p>For my audience, I'm going to oversimplify what an API gateway is by stating it is a hardware and / or software appliance you can you use to connect to any existing, internal system like a database, CRM, or other, and then quickly and efficiently design, deploy and manage APIs driven by these resources.</p>
<p>Personally I am from the artisan, farm to table guild of API architects--I prefer to hand craft my APIs. Well OK, that is bullshit--I use an API framework, but I wire it up by hand to whatever is the original resource is (database, file-store, other API). This is just my style, and probably most aligned with the fact that I cannot afford any API gateway--something the release of Amazon API gateway has me thinking more about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My overall opinion of the gateways I've used is that they lack the amount of granular level control I desire--maybe this is just me. However this is something that is being re-examined for me because of the emergence latest cloud-based API service providers like <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">Restlet APISpark</a>, <a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/">Wavemaker</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/">DreamFactory</a>, <a href="https://www.apitite.net/">Apitite</a>--and AWS. Honestly I think Amazon will skew the concept of what is an API gateway with their new offering, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">they just took the name to sell it to the enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>I guess I didn't even have a real point to this story. I just wanted to talk to my API therapist about my own enterprise API gateway baggage and PTSD, and justify my hippie dippe, artisan approach to APIs. Sucka...I got you to listen!! In the end I think I support your API offering, by any name, as long as you help move the conversation forward, which I have to admit I think AWS is doing with their new AWS API Gateway offering--even though they used that name!!!</p>

<p>I told a contact of mine at the Environmental Protection Agency I would provide some feedback for the next iteration of <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html#uvindex">the Envirofacts Data Service API</a>, and as I prepare my formal response, there is a huge opportunity for me to carve off some other smaller stories. These stories are what make API Evangelist go around--pulling off these nuggets of learningz, as I'm working with API various providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A concept I work hard to help API designers and architect adopt is around <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/17/future-api-design-orchestration-layer/">experience-based API design over resource based API design</a>. Something I learned from my friend Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>) at Netflix, but have been taking it in different directions to help designers and architects from smaller API groups, adopt this way of life--I feel like my work today on the Envirofacts Data Service API provide a great opportunity to move this conversation forward.</p>
<p>When you land on <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html">the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API page</a>, you are given a single base URL to employ when "constructing a search" for the API:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/epa-envirofacts-api-base-url.gif" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Ok, not the best API design, a little confusing, but where do I find the list of possible values for every potential path variable? I scroll down and see some examples, but I have to read the opening paragraph again, before I find a link to the data model. Once I click on the text link, I'm faced with 20 separate "tables"--which in reality are 20 separate APIs, all housed under the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API. (who named this??)</p>
<p>This is resource based API design. You craft an API, that either resembles, or in this case is exactly named just like your database, and its fields. This type of API design, while very appealing to database administrators (DBA), but will leave any new API developer and potential "customer", pretty lost, left with having to work overtime just to understand what is possible. (you can do more work on my behalf)</p>
<p>I had no idea the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API had such a wealth of resources. The overall API landing page, and API design does not tell the story of the value that lies within. Anyways, I'm just embarking on the profiling of this API, and providing a formal review that the team can put to use in their efforts. I'm not trying to bash their work, just help demonstrate to other folks, what I mean when I say "resource based API design", furthering my work to help folks design APIs more focused how they'll be used, not just where they come from, only ticking the box on the task you were given--launch API.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/reddits-future-future-internet/">As I tune into the fallout around the Reddit community</a>, I think it is a good time to pull a story out of my notebook, that I began writing a month or two ago. These thoughts are born out of my post&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/09/ask-the-stack-when-you-need-api-support/">Ask The Stack When You Need API Support</a>, where my friend&nbsp;Jeremiah Lee (<a href="https://twitter.com/JeremiahLee">@JeremiahLee</a>) commented, disagreeing with my recommendation that API providers use Stack Exchange as part of operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeremiah shares his story about how hostile Stack Overflow can be (I'll let you read his comment on your own), something that has been re-enforced many times along the way. While I still endorse Stack Overflow as a valuable building block for some APIs, I completely agree with Jeremiah about the overall community tone. While Stack Overflow is definitely a different beast, it suffers from some of the similar systemic illnesses, that Reddit does. I find some very valuable information on Stack Overflow, which I use regularly, but if you are looking to develop an API community, I can envision the community potentially working against you, in several ways.</p>
<p>It really depends on your API, and the target audience you are trying to reach. Sometimes, the male dominated, "gamified community of meritocracy, where established members have many rules and politics", as Jermiah says, is exactly who you should be engaging, but you really need get to know the personae of your ideal customers, and decide on your own. For API Evangelist, both my storytelling, and the APIs I provide, I've long felt Stack Overflow is not my target audience.</p>
<p>Similar to Reddit, Hacker News, and DZone, I get very little value from these communities. While I do find nuggets of information at these places, I do not post my stories, and engage in conversations there, because the hostility that can come from these channels I have found outweighs any value they might bring in traffic. I seek a much wider audience, than the individuals who often dominate these tech hangouts.</p>
<p>I encourage you to think deeply about who you want to reach with your APIs, and while building your own community in your own wiki, forum, or other solution, might take a lot of time and work, it gives you greater control over the tone your forum takes--which might make the difference in attracting the right developer and business audience you seek.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-monetization-level.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have spent a lot of time thinking about API analytics. Understanding who is signing up to access API resources, and how they are putting those API resources to use, is one of the most valuable aspects of modern API management solutions in my opinion. The awareness derived from API operations that use analytics, can have the biggest impact on not just how you run your API, but how you craft your API products, tailor your monetization strategy, evolve your overall roadmap and company.</p>
<p><a href="http://wso2.com/library/webinars/2015/07/building-enterprise-awareness-with-api-analytics-in-the-api-economy/">API analytics was the topic of a webinar I conducted with WSO2, one of my partners, this morning</a>. I've been invested in WSO2 since they first contacted me for feedback on their then upcoming release of their <a href="http://wso2.com/api-management/try-it/">open source API management solution</a>. During this mornings webinar, I gave the basics on "why" API analytics during this mornings webinar, then sat back and listened to&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.com/about/team/nuwan-dias/">Nuwan Dias</a>&nbsp;demonstrate the "how" of it.</p>
<p>First thing that caught my attention was the WSO2 predictive analytics, which is a concept I have to say I have never thought about, but will be pondering more around what this might mean (or not) to the business and politics of API operations. Another thing that caught my attention was an idea Nuwan shared during the QA, about API monetization at the API analytics layer--very interesting thought.</p>
<p>While the conversation is not as far as long as I'd hoped by 2015, the concept of using API analytics to help you craft your API monetization strategy is pretty well established. API providers like 3Scale and WSO2 have been helping API providers understand the value delivered via APIs, while also providing a framework for crafting service tiers, pricing, and manage usage and billing for API consumers--what Nuwan is thinking about, takes this up another level.</p>
<p>A generation 1.0 API monetization scenario might be an art gallery, who could have an API that feeds the gallery web or mobile app, and during the planning of their API they identified that they shouldn't charge for API access, because it just adds value to their overall business objective--get foot traffic in the door. So the more developers building their art gallery content, products, and services into other 3rd party apps and sites, the better. Maybe along the way the gallery might also choose to serve up high resolution, or interactive version of exhibits for a fee, adding another layer to their monetization strategy--this is a classic example of API monetization discussions I've seen in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>A generation 2.0 of this API monetization scenario, reflecting Nuwan's vision, could involve the Art gallery actually selling leads in real-time, to partner galleries, restaurants, and other businesses that their customers might also be interested in. To reference the WSO2 real-time API analytics example, you could craft a definition of what ideal scenario would look like, and when a user logs into the web or mobile app, matches the profile, the exhaust from the API usage could also be accessed via a higher level API crafted off of your API analytics API (head scratcher). Of course you'd want to design some sort of layer that would require users to opt-in so that they are aware that their data was being captured, and shared, but in theory that exhaust from a single users API transactions could provide a whole new API monetization opportunity.</p>
<p>I'm still thinking this through, but gen 1.0 is about identifying the value of the digital resources of the gallery including the physical locations, art inventory, artist details, etc. You try to establish ways of extracting direct, and indirect value from these digital assets, by making them available via an API. Indirect monetization would be about driving web and mobile usage, as well as in-person foot traffic, where direct monetization would be about selling high resolution images, or possibly virtual gallery experiences. A gen 2.0 API monetization conversation in this art gallery scenario would be about identifying specific personae of users and experiences via the web, mobile, or even device and sensor based APIs that could be targeted in real-time, triggering other secondary, API driven event and experiences.</p>
<p>This type of APIs for the meta layer of API operations seems like more of a partner level API composition layer. Meaning as an API provider you'd have access to these APIs, but as far as your community, you'd probably only extend these APIs to trusted partners, who you have an established relationship with. As I try to think through API monetization at this layer, I'm guessing partners would pay a flat fee, or maybe a per transaction fee depending on the amount of data shared, or perhaps based upon successful transaction or sale? IDK, just spitball'n.</p>
<p>This is just me thinking through a single hypothetical scenario to help grasp the potential here. It adds a new dimension to both the API analytics discussion, as well as the API monetization one. Lots to chew on, from the business and politics side of API operations. Would love to hear your thoughts...</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design-guide.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">I recently went through my API design research</a>, updating and evolving it, to help me better understand changes in the API design space, while also sharing as much of the information as I can with my readers. <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">One of the resources I include under my tools section are the increasing number of API design guides being published</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I'm showcasing the API design guides for <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">18F in the federal government</a>, <a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">Heroku</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/paypal/api-standards/blob/master/api-style-guide.md">PayPal</a>, then the other day my friend Holger Reinhardt (<a href="https://twitter.com/hlgr360">@hlgr360</a>), formerly of <a href="http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx">CA Technologies</a>, now the CTO at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haufe.de/">Haufe Group in Germany</a>, shared his teams API design guidie with me. The executive summary for the guide says it well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Purpose of this style guide is to gather a list of rules, best practices, resources and our way of creating REST APIs in Haufe Group. The style guide addresses API Designers, mostly developers and architects, who want to design an API. Intention is to ease the design process by providing helpful rules to create a successful API that your customers will love.</em></p>
<p>One thing I really like, is they also added "p<span>lease follow the guidelines but don't follow blindly! you can break the rules with justification". Overall the API design guide is full of very pragmatic API design theory, much of what I've heard before, but also emphasizes some very import, forward thinking aspects of modern web API as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The design guide leads with some very sound API wisdom:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You should think of an API like a product. Indeed a Business API is a product.</li>
<li>Design your API with a customer, or at least with a customer in mind and Get Feedback.</li>
<li>Do not implement API Management (use existing services)</li>
<li>Every API MUST be described using a formal API description language</li>
<li>API clients MUST use a self-service API portal to get access to the API via an API Key</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, they do not miss a beat going into REST principles stating: "<span>All our REST APIs MUST support hypermedia." The way they lay out their API design best practices makes everything very accessible, leaving hypermedia seeming a very sensible practice, not a bleeding edge design theory. I'm going to try and go through each section and apply to my own internal API design practices, there are several things here I could do so much better, by following.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.haufe-lexware.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Logo_Haufe_Gruppe.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span>I may even begin work on my own API design guide, based upon what I've learned from the&nbsp;Haufe Group, 18F, Heroku, Paypal, and others. Not that my version would be any better than the sources, but I'm feeling the process of parsing the work of others, and assembling into my own document will be a healthy journey all by itself. An API design guide is quickly becoming an essential building block for API providers of all shapes and sizes, and publishing it publicly via Github is becoming a badge of leadership and transparency for the rest of the API community.</span></p>

<p>All of my public web sites, research projects, API portals, and micro apps run on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, which means there is always a Github repository behind each website. I'd say 75% of my projects have a publicly available master repo, as well as a publicly available gh-pages repo. This approach to running public infrastructure, i feel does one important thing--it opens up all of my work for community contributions.</p>
<p>Beyond just accepting outside contributions, there are many other secondary effects to this way of operation. The first is that anyone can submit blog posts, pages, and any other data or content they desire. The second is that anyone can fix or correct anything you find across my network of sites and apps. Some of my favoritest grammar and spelling trolls in the world, have forked, and submitted pull requests to help edit my work. :-) &lt;3</p>
<p>I have had other grammar trolls who laugh at me when I suggest the fact that they can edit my work. I know that most of it is centered around insecurity in understanding Github, and Jekyll, but they also think it is ridiculous that I wouldn't polish my work, let alone ask others to do it for free. i mean c'mon!!</p>
<p>The API Evangelist network is an open workbench for the API space. I actively work here, to curate information, data, and content that is relevant to the space. If you see something missing, you can add it. If you see a typo, or grammar hiccup, you can correct. Remember the API space is yours too, and it is what we make it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your contributions--I depend on all of you to help me make sure API Evangelist is complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My storytelling on API Evangelist has two sides, one is about refining my own understanding of the API space, and the other is about refining, evolving, and helping make the stories I tell make sense to the widest possible audience that I can. I spent the week around a number of folks who had no idea what an API was, they had heard about them, but admitted that they really did not get what they were. Coming out of this experience, I felt the need to take another crack at the most fundamental API question out there--what exactly is an API?</p>
<p>APIs are just the next step in the evolution of the World Wide Web (aka WWW), which is virtual space where HTML documents are accessible via URLs on the Internet--which allows humans to browse, and consume (or create) information, data, and media (photos, videos, etc). APIs are the same thing, but instead of returning HTML for humans, it returns XML and JSON that is meant to be used by other computer systems, applications, devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies provide HTML web pages, so their customers can access information, data, and media. APIs enable companies to provide the same resources to websites, web or mobile application, and increasingly physical devices in our real world, like home appliances, our cars. APIs are not a single companies product or service, it is just the next evolution of the web, which gives companies a wider reach than just a single website.</p>
<p>In the early days of the web, only developers were using it, and now EVERYONE is using it. In 2015, we are just coming to the end of the phase where only developers are putting APIs to work, and we are entering the phase where API service providers like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">APISpark</a>, and <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a> enable anyone to deploy, consume, and orchestrate with APIs--no programming required.</p>

<p>A core aspect of my mission as the API Evangelist is to help bring awareness amongst "the normals" of what an API is, as just how ubiquitous they are becoming. While I am excited about the potential of APIs in the hands of the developers, I am increasingly optimistic about the potential of APIs in the hands of non-developers. I think what developers have done with APIs is just the tip of the iceberg, when it comes to the API opportunity.</p>
<p>What developers do with APIs is just one step forward in the evolution of software development and information technology, where APIs in the hands of the average citizen and business person has the potential to actually democratize digital resources--something you hear API developers and providers trumpet. The average individual and business person tend to be much closer to actual problems that need to be solved, rather than just looking to develop an app that reflects a developer's own interests.</p>
<p>I've longed talked about the potential around&nbsp;<a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity</a> providers like <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, and how they provide valuable services that help the average Internet citizen manage their online, businesses and personal lives. Another similar area of growth in the API space that is fast growing is around using APIs for deploying APIs, as well as being employed as an API client. This is something that is significantly picking up speed with the help of API service providers like <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet APISpark</a>, and <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a>.</p>
<p>Using Restlet's APISpark platform, anyone can deploy an API from a Google Spreadsheet, and using Blockspring any user can put the growing number of public and private APIs to work, in the environment that is most familiar to them--the spreadsheet. I'm working with Blockspring to define Swagger definitions for the best public APIs available today, which will significantly increase the momentum around API usage, amongst non-developers.</p>
<p>Think about what the web was like when only developers were using it way back in the day, and what it is like now with EVERYONE using it. Now think about what has happened during the last 10 years with only developers using APIs, now think about the opportunity when EVERYONE is using APIs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2015/07/pinboard_turns_six/">The story of Pinboard's sixth anniversary came up on my API monitoring this last week</a>, and beside being funny as shit, it reminded me of how successful APIs can be, even when they do not follow traditional funding paths. Let me preface this with the fact I'm not against companies seeking funding, so that the usual suspects do not crawl up my ass. In my opinion, Pinboard is an important API economy story, and something I want make sure API entrpreneurs hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I am a pinboard API customer. I was one of his early buy-in customers, and it has been a critical aspect of API Evangelist operations ever since. If you read stories on my blog, or read my API.Report, you are seeing the value exhaust generated by Pinboard. Pinboard is service that does one thing well.</p>
<p>Maciej Ceglowski, the founder of Pinboard has done well in providing the social bookmarking service, complete with a simple, yet robust API. He has worked to optimize his business model, in an open transparent way, that doesn't negatively impact users, while also keeping the service up and running for six years--without taking VC money that could potentially change everything that is Pinboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">I used Pinboard along with AWS, and Instagram in my support of EFF in filing the Amicus brief in the Oracle vs. Google API copyright case</a>, in addition to depending on it for my own operations. Pinboard is a cornerstone of my world, and I consider it to also be very important model for the API economy. Not every resource, available in the API needs VC funding, something that in my opinion has derailed some very valuable API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When crafting your own APIs strategy, and thinking through your business operations, please think of Pinboard. While the service may not be the shining unicorn Silicon Valley worships, it is an extermely valuable part of the API economy, a sustainable business for&nbsp;Maciej Ceglowski, and all without taking on loads of investment.</p>

<p>Those in the know with hypermedia, often express their frustration when it comes to the overall progress of hypermedia adoption, and the bespoke approaches of many API designers. while there are many hypermedia skeptics who just don't buy into the concept, I think there are many out there who would be willing to to apply common hypermedia patterns in their work, but face many challenges.</p>
<p>I'd put myself in between those willing participants, and those in the know. I get the the concepts at play, but I wouldn't say I know what I'm doing. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">I am working to apply Siren, one of the leading formats, to my curation API</a>. In my work, I do not struggle with a willingness to do it, I struggle with my high cognitive load.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to practioners, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">cognitive load theory</a>&nbsp;is borken down into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intrinsic</strong> - The effort associated with a specific topic</li>
<li><strong>Extraneous</strong> - The way information or tasks are presented to a learner</li>
<li><strong>Germane</strong> - The work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a&nbsp;schema</li>
</ul>
<p>I suffer in all three of these areas, and I know many other people do, they are just not willing to admit it--I have no problem admitting to what I do not know, or do have time to learn. My cognitive load is extremely high, and I know almost everyone in the API world is in the same boat. Hell, everyone is potentially in the same boat, when it comes to Internet technology.</p>
<p>There are some aspects of cognitive load I don't think we can solve 100%, we are just in an age of information overload, but I think there is some responsibility that hypermedia need to own. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I read more about cognitive load theory, I find that it <em>"... has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance"</em>. I know my own hypermedia education has been stunted by hypermedia practitioners expectation of me to "just get" the concept (maybe this is my perception), and "just do it"--get up to speed man!!. I often feel like many of them (not all) are unwilling to provide educational materials that bridge where I am currently in my API design knowledge, and share working examples and prototypes that I can reverse engineer.</p>
<p>As I continue on my own hypermedia journey, I will work to provide more of these education materials, and open source all of my API designs so others can learn from. I'm starting with <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, but will be tackling other formats like <a href="http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/">Hydra</a>, <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collections+JSON</a>, and beyond. Join me in providing materials (if you are a hypermedia practitioner), and if you are trying to learn more about hypermedia, please let me know what challenges you face, so I can help provide bridges.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/12/a-universal-me-api/">A Universal Me API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-me.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am pretty demanding today, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/11/i-wish-all-apis-had-sandbox-environment-by-default/">I just asked for sandbox environments to be default for all APIs</a>, and now I'd like to see a universal /me API. I am profiling AngelList API, <a href="http://theapistack.com/">as part of my API Stack work</a>, and while AngelList does not have it broke out as its own endpoint on the menu (it is just buried in the oAuth section), I thought it was worth breaking out all by itself.</p>
<p>At AngeList, when I hit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">api.angel.co/1/me</span> endpoint, it gives me back everything <a href="https://angel.co/kinlane">about me on AngelList</a>. To make it work, I have to pass along a valid oAuth token, which I generated from my AngelList account, which is how the API knows who I am. As I was playing with this API, and breaking out as its own Swagger file, as part of my AngelList API profiling, I can't help but want this feature everywhere.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be given <span style="text-decoration: underline;">oAuth controls for ANY account online</span>, whether it was a tech company like Twitter, or a government agency like the US Census Bureau. Using oAuth, you could generate an App (w/ token), and easily make a call to /me, and find out everything a company knows about you, and I mean <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERYTHING</span>. Using oAuth you could easily open up this access to anyone 3rd party provider you wanted to, for any period of time you desired.</p>
<p>/me, provides a very powerful endpoint to frame discussions about our digital self. As we continue to spread our lifebits across the Internetz, we are going to have to demand more /me endpoints for platforms, as well as oAuth control over the lifebit exhaust we generate--as a basic human right. I'll keep building on my own definition of what /me endpoints should be available, and who knows maybe someday a universal /me API will be a default approach for any online domain.</p>

<p><a href="https://angel.co/api">I am working through every endpoint of the AngelList API</a>, making sure I make as many successful calls as I can, as I work to generate Swagger definitions for the API, using Charles Proxy. To support this effort I setup each endpoint in Postman, and populate enough detail about an API to make a successful call--which I record through Charles, and then import to generate a semi-complete Swagger spec.</p>
<p>Some of the API endpoints requires adding and deleting of information. For example I will add a comment to my profile, then update in, and remove it, all in a series of API calls. Most of the time I can accomplish this without doing much damage to my live profile, but sometimes it requires sending messages to people, initiating processes that trigger other system aspects that I may not be able to undo.</p>
<p>As I'm playing with the AngelList Reservations API, which&nbsp;"are non-binding commitments to invest in a startup's current fundraising round", I can't help but think how nice a sandbox environment would be, as well as some dummy data to help me in my API journey. Some APIs I play with provide a sandbox environment, but I'd say it is not a common enough occurrence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://getsandbox.com/">I'm seeing service emerge to cater to this need, as with Sandbox</a>, which is a service layer of the API lifecycle I think will only grow in coming months. I can see the need to create simple sandbox for any APIs as you are kicking tires, but I can also see the need for sophisticated simulation environments built on top of common APIs, allowing some apps to test out more advanced, and specialized scenarios.</p>
<p>If you need an example of this, <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/">take a look at what Carvoyant is up to in the connected car realm</a>. While sandboxes, and simulations may not be as critical as in the world of cars, I think be critical for developers to build the next generation of web, mobile and IoT apps, and may not be something that every API provider can deliver on their own.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-highway.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/09/the-new-aws-api-gateway-anyone-who-does-not-do-this-will-be-fired-thank-you-have-a-nice-day--jeff-bezos/">I shared my view on the AWS API Gateway yesterday</a>. I'm all about the AWS kool-aid (oh yeah!), but overall I was left underwhelmed. I feel the release of the API solutions represents a pretty significant milestone along the API highway, but overall I think we should be further on down the road.</p>
<p>There is much to celebrate about what AWS is up to. It acknowledges the need to deploy APIs from the common resources we have move into the cloud, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/">and provides us some pretty forward thinking ways of crafting&nbsp;resource-based API that uses Hypertext Application Language (HAL)</a>. #WINNING</p>
<p><span>I'm sure AWS chose their wording very carefully when they named the project, but where the AWS API solution falls short for me, is with the concept of a gateway (that this moves us forward). I'm all behind what AWS is delivering for consumers, I just do not get behind paving over the lessons learned when migrating these legacy resources (holy shit--we have legacy resources in the cloud), and evolving them (along with our on-premise ones) towards a more sensible resource-based API-centric approach.</span></p>
<p>I just would like to see less gateway, and more HTTP, Hypermedia (Siren, Collections+JSON, JSON-LD), and API literacy along the way, something that could be incorporated into the road-map (wink, wink). While there are forwarding thinking aspects of the AWS API Gateway, I feel like it is more crafted to deliver what the enterprise will buy, and not necessarily what they need to put them on the meaningful API journey they need to be on--this feels more like a vendor journey to me.</p>
<p>As my friend Steve Klabnik says, it can be tough when your idols fail you--when we hold them up so high. Anyways, we are just getting started with AWS API Gateway, maybe there still is hope! ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2015</span>

<p>It has been almost 10 years since Amazon shifted the conversation on the Internetz, with their release of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis--amazon-s3/">Amazon S3</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis--amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2&nbsp;</a>-- showing us that web APIs were more than just a hobby thing you do in this new social kids game, but that you could actually deploy any digital resource, including storage and compute, at a global scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-api-gateway-build-and-run-scalable-application-backends/">As I process the release information about AWS API Gateway today</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">I can hear the echoes of Jeff Bezos's now mythical mandate</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.</li>
<li>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.</li>
<li>There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team&rsquo;s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what technology they use.</li>
<li>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t do this will be fired. &nbsp;Thank you; have a nice day!</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2015, Bezos is now making this mandate to you, in your own business operations. If you do not embrace APIs, as the next step in the evolution of the web, you will not make the cut. Goodbye! In the early 2000's, it was unacceptable to Bezos that his businesses didn't operate in an API -entric way. By 2006, Amazon was leading by example, showing all of us how Amazon had identified essential digital assets, optimze their usage internally using APIs, and then externalize via a publicly available API driven platform--something we now call cloud computing. In 2015, AWS is continuing to define their core competencies as API centric services, but this time opening their methodology to you, so that you will embark on the same API journey with your own business and organization.</p>
<p>As the AWS API Gateway press release information states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;create an API that acts as a &ldquo;front door&rdquo; for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The new gateway will take all that existing infrastructure you have accumulated (in the cloud), and it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;..handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Distilling down the lessons from the last five years, and selling it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;With the proliferation of mobile devices and the rise in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is increasingly common to make backend systems and data accessible to applications through APIs.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The new AWS API Gateway reflects all the modern approaches to API operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build, Deploy and Manage APIs</li>
<li>API Lifecycle Management</li>
<li>SDK Generation</li>
<li>API Operations Monitoring</li>
<li>AWS Authorization</li>
<li>API Keys for Third-Party Developers</li>
<li>Enhancing Legacy Services</li>
<li>Traffic Management</li>
<li>Data Transformation</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm on board!! I have been drinking the AWS Kool-Aid (oh yeah) since 2006. I was an early adopter, and honestly have built my career as the API Evangelist, on the work of Amazon, and what I have learned from their approach. To me, the release of the AWS API Gateway is a pretty significant milestones in the evolution of what is API. By 2006 the web had matured, and the Internet was being used for much more than just consumption, the API community was realizing that we could deploy vital digital resources using the Internet as a vehicle. Almost 10 years later, Amazon understands the opportunity in enabling you to do this for yourself--helping you either embark on, or speed up your API journey.</p>
<p>The best part is, this is all for the low, low price of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"$3.50 per million API calls received, plus the cost of data transfer out, in gigabytes."</em></p>
<p>Allowing you to manage any of your digital assets as an API, using AWS API Gateway, is just the beginning of the expertise that Amazon is packaging up for all of us in the latest release. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway is just the initial technical building block</a> they are making available. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-partner-program-for-saas/">AWS is also continuing the business conversation with their release of the&nbsp;AWS Partner Program for SaaS</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/">beating the politics of API drum of their Identity and Access Management (IAM), and security solutions, via the AWS platform</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the business opportunities that AWS has crafted, and shared with the world. I am also a big supporter of the standardization around IAM and security, that they are pushing (important). <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/07/time-to-remove-or-rotate-your-api-access-keys/">I just wrote about their API key practices, which are something the rest of the API space should emulate</a>. I think there are endless lessons that the API industry can be extracted from Amazon, and their "web of services". As with Twitter, I will keep holding up Amazon as a model for how we can do things right, but where I also think the healthy API focus begins to be degraded by big money, big companies, big systems, and a belief in scope and scale in a more centralized wall garden, rather than an open, truly distributed approach.</p>
<p>Like earlier offerings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Amazon API Gateway is a pay-as-you-go service that takes care of all of the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in securely and reliably running APIs at scale.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>You get all the benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalable</li>
<li>Efficient</li>
<li>Self-Service</li>
<li>Highly Usable</li>
<li>Reliable,</li>
<li>Secure</li>
<li>Performant</li>
<li>Cost-Effective</li>
</ul>
<p>You leave all the heavy lifting to Amazon. As I said, I'm a big Amazon Kool-Aid (tm) drinker--have been since the early days. While the release of AWS API Gateway is a huge milestone along the API journey for me, this is where the vision begins to fall short for me. Amazon, and Google at this point are starting to feel like just a newer version of historical approaches to delivering software, and take on a "VENDOR" vibe for me. I know SalesForce, Amazon, Google, and Twitter have all shifted the conversation, making a huge impact on how we deliver software, and architect our business systems, and will deliver on many of these comfort points, but at some point, when there is enough scale, and money on the table, everything eventually becomes what we all were seeking to disrupt (aka we have nothing nice).</p>
<p>I will keep using Amazon, and will explore deploying APIs with the new AWS API Gateway. I know Amazon put a lot of thought into the features of this service, as well as the naming, but the concept of a gateway under-delivers for me. I understand as a large organization you have a lot of legacy resources to move forward, and gateway solutions are very appealing. The problem is it abstracts away a lot of the heavy lifting that you should be doing, and need to be in tune with. When you rely on a single platform to deliver this for you, you aren't evolving -- you are stuck in a corporate circle jerk. Your infrastructure portfolio should be diverse, modular, and meaningful, reducing the bottlenecks, and points of failure. Our increased reliance on AWS isn't moving forward, its slowly being sucked back into what we just escaped.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I am on board with the AWS vision of the cloud (changed my life). I just do not think it is as decoupled, and distributed as it could be. Sure you can deliver on-premise, alongside your cloud infrastructure, but the spaghetti mess we proxy with the AWS API Gateway seems similar to what we gateway(ed) 5, 10, and 15 years ago. I enjoy the convenience a gateway brings to the table, and the ability to quickly define, deploy, manage, and monitor from our existing infrastructure, but I feel like some of the more important devops and microservice related lessons are being paved over in this vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, I'm very excited about what the AWS API Gateway release means for the overall API industry. I also know that my vision of what should be, will not win out in the end, and that we are only capable of baby steps beyond what just was, especially when the powers that be, begin to tune into the conversation, and change things to be more in tune with their objectives. My mission is to just push back, and course correct where I can, until I'm ground up by the machine.</p>

<p>When API Evangelist began five years ago it was a single research into the business of APIs, which ultimately became a research project which I called API management. Over the last four years, I have spliced off other areas of research including the elements of my core research into API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal with each research project, is to evolve my understanding of each area of the API space by identifying the key companies and organizations involved, the open tooling being developed and put to work, and some of the common building blocks that make up each area. For each of my research projects, you can visit its Github repository to get regular updates, but I find many people seem to prefer browsing a single, portable paper of my research.</p>
<p>Each year I usually published a PDF version of each research project, something I have always intended to update regularly. However it seems, this is usually is an annual thing that I find time for in the summer. To helpl change this, I've evolved my own tooling for publishing for what I considers guides to my research areas, allowing me to more easily publish the information and content I regularly curate about the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/paper/">finished v1 of my paper API</a>, which allows me to aggregate pages, organizations, building blocks, tools, and news that I curate, into field guides for my research. Using this new API, i intend to update each of my core research areas each month, getting more disciplined about distilling my research down to a single, coherent story.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/guide/api-evangelist-api-design-industry-guide-july-2015.pdf">Here is a copy of my API design research as a single PDF guide</a>, you can also find it on the main navigation for my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design research</a>. Now that I have my paper API stabilized, I will going through API deployment, and management, publishing a research guide for each. This process couldn't have come at a better time, as I'm carving out a couple of new research areas for API performance, testing, and monitoring, and I would like to be able to quickly publish guides for each of those areas as well.</p>

<p>I got an email from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> this morning, regarding a set of API keys I setup a while back, for a prototype I was building. The project was over a year ago, and the keys have not been evolved, and managed like I do with the rest of my regularly used AWS API keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the email I received:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We noticed that your account contains root access keys that are more than 1 year old. As a security best practice, AWS recommends removing your root access keys entirely and using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instead. At a minimum we recommend rotating access keys regularly or removing access keys if they are no longer in use.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>To help you determine whether your access keys are safe to rotate or delete, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) now reports the time stamp&nbsp;when access keys for an IAM user or root account were last used, along with the region and the AWS service that was accessed. These details complement&nbsp;password last used&nbsp;data to provide a more thorough picture of when an IAM user or root account was last active.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>To view your root access keys and when they were last used, go to the&nbsp;security credentials page&nbsp;in the AWS Management Console. After you have located the old keys, rotate or delete them by using&nbsp;these steps. Note that you can also view the access keys of an IAM user in the&nbsp;IAM console&nbsp;or see a snapshot of all the access keys in your AWS account by downloading an&nbsp;IAM credential report.</em><br /><br /><em>To learn more, read&nbsp;Best Practices for Managing AWS Access Keys&nbsp;in the AWS documentation.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I like the fact that they notify me about keys like this, and they provide me with links to resources where I can management my API keys, see when they were last used, and also provide access to best practices around key management.</p>
<p>I am in a unique spot, because I sign up for hundreds of API keys, to test out the services I talk about, so management of my API keys gets pretty unwieldy. This is something I'm working on as part of my <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json work</a>, and something I'm hoping to share with others, as key management is both an API provider, and an API consumer problem.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.intuit.com/appconnect"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/itduzzit_formula.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">I wrote about Intuit's acquisition of API reciprocity provider&nbsp;itDuzzit last summer</a>, and <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2015/06/12/announcing-intuit-appconnect-beta">earlier this month they made the acquired technology available as a new platform extension</a>, they are calling&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.intuit.com/docs/0200_appconnect">Intuit AppConnect Beta</a>. I have been tracking on <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers</a> for some time now, something you see API providers adopting at an increasing rate, as a standard building block for their API ecosystems.</p>
<p>API reciprocity tools and services like Intuit AppConnect, help connect APIs, in ways that even non-developers can take advantage of, making the overall API conversation, available to a much wider audience. Intuit describes their new offerings as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Intuit AppConnect is an iPaaS (integration Platform-as-a-Service) offering that runs wholly on Intuit&rsquo;s AWS stack. With Intuit AppConnect, 3rd-party developers have a faster, simpler way to create integrations between their apps and QuickBooks Online &ndash; without needing to cut or deploy code, and without writing directly to APIs that might change over time.</em></p>
<p>iPaaS is a huge growth area for the API industry. I choose to call this layer of the API world, API reciprocity, because if you don't make the approach about ALL parties involved, the platform, developer, and the end-user--it is just yet another IT effort. iPaaS is just the next step of ETL, where we move bits and bytes around online in the cloud as opposed to the corporate network. API reciprocity is doing this, but remembers those bits and bytes you are moving around, mean something to every human and business or organization involved.</p>
<p>As I stated in last summer's post about Intuit's acquisition, API reciprocity is increasingly important for API providers who are looking to reach a wider business audience, elevating an API platform from just a developer thing, to a business thing--something that is essential to Intuit's small business audience. API providers who don't have the resources that Intuit possess can use popular iPaaS / reciprocity providers like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, which is something I'm seeing become more common place--<a href="http://api.report/2015/07/06/weekly-apireport-for-july-6th-2015/">take a look at this last weeks APi.Report (search for API Reciprocity)</a>.</p>
<p>I'll keep an eye on the Intuit AppConnect program, and also look out for other large, and small API platforms who are doing similar things. As more tech savvy business users realize the potential of API reciprocity services like Zapier, IFTTT, and others, the importance of these integration tools and service will only increase for the average API provider, and consumer.</p>

<p>Building on what Orlando (<a href="https://twitter.com/orliesaurus">@orliesaurus</a>) brings up in his story on <a href="https://medium.com/@orliesaurus/the-missing-brick-in-the-api-industry-1163a9c25791">the missing brick in the API Industry</a>, we are missing a common place to discovery and share common API designs--<a href="http://theapistack.com">something I've been working hard on with my API Stack</a>. As I read <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/06/23/container-apps-now-available-in-the-azure-marketplace/">this piece from Microsoft Azure on&nbsp;Container Apps now available in the Azure Marketplace</a>, I'm reminded of how robust the app deployment, and management ecosystem has become with the containerization evolution, but when it comes to API deployment we are still way behind the times.</p>
<p>There are numerous containerized marketplaces of apps available out there today, what I am looking for is the same thing, but for common API patterns. After over 10 years of solid design, deployment, and management of web API patterns, we should have a wealth of API design patterns to choose from. I shouldn't have to launch my own user API, or image API, there should be the WordPress of APIs out there, ready for me to deploy.</p>
<p>These APIs should be available with common API patterns, well defined using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, available in a variety of server side languages from PHP to Go. I should be able to search, and browse these APIs, and with a single click of a button deploy into my containerized architecture of choice, from Amazon to Google, and Microsoft to the Raspberry Pi in my living room--<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button">think Heroku deploy button</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Ok, back to work on defining the common public APIs out there on my API Stack</a>, could someone please get to work on this containerized API marketplace? I have a number of standardized API definitions I can share to get you going, and happy to focus on crafting any new ones you need, derived from common patterns I'm finding across my API Stack work.</p>
<p>There is a reason we have the bespoke API design, and deployment way of life--everyone is lacking the marketplace of ready-to-go, containerized APis, that individuals, businesses, institutions, and government agencies will need for success in the API economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">I am working hard to generate detailed profiles, that include APIs.json indexes, and Swagger definitions, for each of the 1000 companies I have listed in the API Stack</a>. I have encouraged anyone to step up and help me profile these companies, join the conversation via the Github issues where the API stack is hosted, resulting in some really nice folks jumping in to hellp me tackle the hard work.</p>
<p>One of these brave souls who stepped up, and get their hands dirty is Bob Salita, who is also sharing his experience, via what he calls an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"API Police Report"</span>, derived from his experience onboarding with APIs. I thought his condensed thoughts reflect what I see everyday as I onboard with new APIs, and was worth sharing.</p>
<p><strong>He starts with a simple question: What do developers want?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To use your API. Duh! Don&rsquo;t get in their way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do we force a developer do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google for your website.</li>
<li>Sign up as a generic user (usually unstated).</li>
<li>Wait for email verification link.</li>
<li>Click on verification link.</li>
<li>Log into website.</li>
<li>Find link to developer site.</li>
<li>Find link to API documentation.</li>
<li>Register app (usually OAuth).</li>
<li>Figure out how to obtain API credentials.</li>
<li>Find link to endpoints.</li>
<li>Figure out how to use API credentials.</li>
<li>Play in playground.</li>
<li>Search for SDK in preferred language.</li>
<li>Cancel dinner date.</li>
<li>How can we improve onboarding?</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What you can do! Anticipate needs, minimize process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Big button showing &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;. No registration needed.</li>
<li>Transfer to Playground with temporary key installed.</li>
<li>Offer easy navigation to friendly API Docs, SDKs, permanent credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>The anti-patterns to onboarding</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Secret onboarding. No Google hits.</li>
<li>No Developer or API link.</li>
<li>No Sign Up button. No Sign Up imperative.</li>
<li>No App registration link.</li>
<li>No Get Credentials link.</li>
<li>No Authorization procedure.</li>
<li>No authorization endpoints (shhh, secret).</li>
<li>No Rest API documentation link.</li>
<li>No Curl link.</li>
<li>No API playground</li>
<li>No safe sandbox (financial industry).</li>
<li>No SDK link. Too few languages choices.</li>
<li>Must interview with sales or support rep.</li>
<li>Must mail in API registration.</li>
<li>SSL certificate warnings. &ldquo;Get me out of here!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Inability to change locale, language or monetary unit.</li>
<li>USS (Ugly Site Syndrome). So 2005.</li>
<li>Unclear use case.</li>
<li>Uncompelling content.</li>
<li>Confusing website.</li>
<li>Confusing biz plan.</li>
<li>Too much unnecessary registration info requested.</li>
<li>Slow registration process, delayed email verification, snail-mail (s/b &lt; 10 seconds).</li>
<li>Missing page navigation.</li>
<li>IP blacklisting.</li>
<li>Short trial &ndash; 7/14 days. s/b 30 days.</li>
<li>Broken registration, broken authorization process, broken APIs.</li>
<li>Too much engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Are The Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ol> </ol> 
<ul>
<li>OAuth 2 support.</li>
<li>API Playground.</li>
<li>Safe sandbox (financial services).</li>
<li>Use mashery.com.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sometimes you have to be a snob &ndash; for good reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit registration size. Limit beta size.</li>
<li>Vet registrants for reasons of security, accountability (Bitcoin), company size, sales volume.</li>
<li>Refuse because of IP location.</li>
<li>Refuse because of free email account.</li>
<li>Be expensive.</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>I am just publishing his raw report as is, because I think it reflects what a tough job it is to profile these APIs, and the thoughts that go through your head as you do the work. This work is something API providers should be doing themselves! They should be going through their APIs, putting on their external developer hats, and try to think like a new developer might--experience the friction.</p>
<p>The process of trying to understand what an API does, how to get access, and the process of indexing the API operations using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and craft individual <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> definitions for each available APIs is a lot of work, but it represents the work, and thought you should be putting into your API--it is an important journey!</p>
<p>I will be referencing these "<em>API Police Reports"</em> in future stories, because Bob's honest thoughts, as he does this hard work, provide a wealth of detail that all API providers should be tuning into.</p>

<p><em>This is a guest post by&nbsp;Guillaume Laforge (<a href="https://twitter.com/glaforge">@glaforge</a>) of <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a>. He did a very cool API deployment project over the holiday weekend, as was good enough to share the details of his project as a story. I've been trying to make time to do more of these simple how-to API deployment guides like this, so I'm always happy to guest post these when they help users understand that they can deploy APIs--no developer necessary.</em></p>
<p>For the 4th of July, to celebrate the United States&rsquo; Independence Day, <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a> built a fun little website and API to list all the <a href="https://fireworks.apispark.net/v1/html/index.html">fireworks in your area</a>. You can see all the states where fireworks have been found, and lists of towns in those states where those fireworks were taking place. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a Google Sheets form that you can fill in to submit fireworks in your area that were not mentioned.</p>
<p>This fireworks app is actually an API with an associated website served by APISpark, using a Google Sheets wrapper for storing the data and receiving form submissions, and a Github file store wrapper to deliver the HTML / CSS / JavaScript assets. In this blog post, I will explain how to make your own APIs with their associated web elements.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-1.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="471px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it all started with this idea of listing all the fireworks. We also wanted to let people submit ones in their area, as it&rsquo;s difficult to find each and every possible event in the whole country. That&rsquo;s why we thought it&rsquo;d be important if we could use Google Sheets to store the data, as we can let people fill in the gaps in our listings thanks to a Google Form that automatically saves data in your spreadsheet. Thankfully, <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">APISpark</a> provides a <a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/tutorials/turn-spreadsheet-to-api">Google Sheets wrapper</a> which allows you to expose spreadsheets as a Web API.</p>
<p>Having data served through a Web API is nice, but you won&rsquo;t cURL it to find an event nearby! You might be a geek with cURL super powers, but I doubt, say, your neighbors are able to find fireworks nearby with a Web API. Thus, you want to be able to view everything through your web browser or mobile device. Which means we had to find a way to display the data from the API through some web pages. To do so, we used an APISpark&rsquo;s <a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/tutorials/github">Github file store</a> which serves the content of a Github repository as a Web API&hellip; but also as a mere website with its HTML / CSS / JavaScript, like on any website on the Web. For reference, here are my <a href="https://github.com/glaforge/fireworks-assets">own assets for the fireworks API</a>. In turn, this means that your Web API can serve the associated website that goes with that API for easier human consumption &mdash; no need for finding a host and setup a server for your website!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s replicate this little fireworks project together!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with creating a Google Sheets document and associating it the following form, which let anyone submit new fireworks, with details about the city, state, date and time:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-2.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="512px;" /></p>
<p>Your website visitors will be able to fill in a form like so:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-3.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="543px;" /></p>
<p>And your spreadsheet will be updated as new entries are flowing:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-4.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="267px;" /></p>
<p>The sole modification I&rsquo;ve done here is to rename the sheet to &ldquo;fireworks&rdquo;, but you can also do that later on when configuring the Google Sheets wrapper&hellip; speaking of which, it&rsquo;s time to create it and import that spreadsheet in APISpark!</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">created an account on APISpark</a> (if you haven&rsquo;t done so yet), login, then, from the dashboard, create an &ldquo;Entity Store&rdquo; and select a Google Sheets wrapper:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-5.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="545px;" /></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be asked to select a Google account (the one with which you&rsquo;ve created the spreadsheet), then select the spreadsheet document you&rsquo;ve created for that purpose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that the import of the spreadsheet succeeded, and that some normalization has been done to the name of the properties of your entities, corresponding to the questions of the form (as the column names of the spreadsheet contained special characters like spaces of question marks).</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-6.png" alt="fireworks-6.png" width="624px;" height="391px;" /></p>
<p>As those property names will be appearing in the resulting Web API we&rsquo;re going to create next, I&rsquo;ve gone the extra step of going through each property to rename them to more succinct names (state, city, date, time):</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-7.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="496px;" /></p>
<p>Now is the time to deploy this first &ldquo;Cell&rdquo; so that it can be made available and imported into our future API (just click the &ldquo;Deploy&rdquo; button).</p>
<p>If you click on the little cog button in the top right hand corner, near the &ldquo;Deploy&rdquo; button, you can export a Web API from this data store directly, so that the API is pre-configured to import it:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-8.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="601px;" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve checked the &ldquo;Read-only API&rdquo; checkbox (as modifications are done only through the Google Sheets interface), and I&rsquo;ve selected &ldquo;No authentication required&rdquo; for the &ldquo;Default permissions&rdquo; as we don&rsquo;t need authentication here.</p>
<p>Your Web API is ready, and you can see the resource and representation for corresponding to our fireworks sheet:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-9.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The Web API is functional, if you deploy it, you&rsquo;ll be able to make calls to it with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie">httpie</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-10.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="504px;" /></p>
<p>Alright, but we said earlier that mere mortals are not cURL warriors, are they? So let&rsquo;s make a light web frontend on top of that. We don&rsquo;t want the hassle of finding a host for our website, of dealing with the server, or anything of that sort. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going to let APISpark host the web assets too, thanks to a Github file store! The HTML / CSS / JavaScript / image assets can be served as part of the API.</p>
<p>Go back to the dashboard, and click the &ldquo;Create file store&rdquo; button to create a file store, selecting the Github flavor:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-11.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="381px;" /></p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; tab, you&rsquo;ll fill in your credentials to access Github, and add an &ldquo;Import&rdquo; pointing at your Github repository containing your web assets:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-12.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="279px;" /></p>
<p>When configured, you&rsquo;ll have to deploy your cell to make it usable. Then, heading back to your Web API cell, you&rsquo;ll be able to add a new import, in the &ldquo;Settings &gt; Imports&rdquo; section:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-13.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="332px;" /></p>
<p>Now the API will contain two imports: one for the Google Sheets wrapper, and this new one for the Github file store.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t detailed it yet, but what will your Github repository will be looking like? You&rsquo;ll have to create folders for the various categories of assets that you have. In my online fireworks demo, I had created an &ldquo;html&rdquo;, &ldquo;css&rdquo;, &ldquo;javascript&rdquo;, and &ldquo;images&rdquo; folders. For the sake of simplicity here, I&rsquo;ll just create an &ldquo;html&rdquo; folder, and put an &ldquo;index.html&rdquo; file that will contain the following HTML and JavaScript code:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5d3a857b88897f621bf5.js"></script>
<p>This page will be served at <a href="https://fireworks.apispark.net/v1/html/index.html">https://fireworks.apispark.net/v1/html/index.html</a> by APISpark. I&rsquo;m using JQuery to call my API, and you will see this simple output in your web browser:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-14.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="199px;" /></p>
<p>Nothing really fancy, but &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.">Q.E.D.</a>&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what we had to demonstrate: a Web API delivering data off of a Google Sheets document, but also serving the web assets to offer a UI frontend to interact with that API. No need to host that website elsewhere on some server in the cloud, everything can be done and served through APISpark easily. Having setup Google Sheets for the data makes it easy for non-technical persons to contribute new content and data for your database of fireworks. APISpark then takes care of both exposing a reusable Web API, as well as serving a website to share your nice listing of fireworks to the world!</p>

<p>I'm working to profile as many of the top, publicly available APIs out there, <a href="http://theapistack.com/">as part of the API Stack</a>. While I've come to feel that no API definition will ever actually be complete, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">I'm working to at least establish a healthy baseline for the APIs I am profiling</a>, while also automating as much of the process as I possibly can.</p>
<p>To help focus my work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/23/the-over-30-apis-i-depend-on-to-run-api-evangelist/">I'm targeting 30 companies that I depend on to run API Evangelist</a>, and one of the first APIs I wanted to harden my process on was the AlchemyAPI. The API is fairly straightforward in design, and operation, so it made for an easy target--so far here is what I have:</p>

<p>My goal was to index the AlchemyAPI operations using an APIs.json file, while define each of the APIs using Swagger. I want each Swagger definition to be as complete as possible, so I can actually generate functional APIMATIC SDKs, and function Postman Collections--something I have achieved here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have everything I need from an AlchemyAPI profiling, for my needs. I have details about API operations like the pricing and terms of service, and I have each of the unique endpoints profiled at about &nbsp;what I'd consider to be 80% complete. All the APIs listed allow you to pass in a URL as the content source. For most of these APIs, there is also a version that allows you to pass in HTML or plain text--for now I am just profiling all of the APis which use the URL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me complete this work, I am using my API questions tooling, which allow me automate what work needs to be done to each API, like ensuring there is a terms of service, parameters, data model, and security definition. <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/alchemyapi/apis.json">Using the APIs.json file</a>, I can ask these questions of <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">any of the almost 1000 companies listed on the API Stack</a>--it will help me tackle the work needed to get all the APIs in the stack profiled as complete as I possibly can.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a logo, description, and common URLs like website, blog, Twitter, and Github, I'm including links to APIs.json, SDKs.io profile, and Postman Collections. I haven't updated any of the SDKs.io profile, but the Postman Collection is current. I will make sure all of this is available in the Github issue I am using to coordinate work on the AlchemyAPI.</p>
<p>Each API could potentially be missing some parameters, and the definitions may still have some flaws (if you see any, feel free to fork and fix ;-). Shit, now I remembered I forgot to reference all the sub-models in some of the API data models. Oh well, will add to the list to be done, and get it tackled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also find a link to a crude Swagger editor available for each API, and a page to ask Swagger related or APIs.json related questions. All the Swagger related ones are answered, but I'm still working the configuration of the APIs.json ones, and the Swagger editor (work in progress)--this same functionality is available for each company, and APIs I have listed on the API Stack.</p>
<p>Ok, well anyways..on to the next microproject (tm). I have an overhaul on my API Design white paper almost complete, and then I think I will tackle the profiling of Angelist and the Crunchbase API--two APIs I depend on to run API Evangelist. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>P.S. One thing I also liked about the Alchemy API, is how easy it was to break the APIs down into the small possible units of value, and provide a single Swagger definition for each API. I think I will also provide a single Swagger specification for all of them, but for now I'll rely on the APIs.json index to link them together.</em></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/03/five-years-of-api-evangelist/">Five Years Of API Evangelist</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-five-years-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>In July of 2010, I started researching what would be the next step in my career. I was VP of Technology at WebEvents global, and was in charge of the technical side of running conferences for SAP and Google. I enjoyed the work I did, scaling the technology to support the events, using the Amazon Cloud and APIs, but I was not fully satisfied in the events industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clearly remember spending my Fourth of July weekend researching some possible next steps. Building on my strengths at the time, I looked at what I could do in the cloud computing space. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/Home">My early research is still even online, forever preserved as a Google Site</a>. The last update to the research was mid half way through July, when after a couple weeks of careful evaluation and contemplating, I saw the core of cloud computing was really about APIs.</p>
<p>I had an epiphany -- APIs were central to the recent social and cloud evolutions in the Internet, and as I looked deeper, I saw that web APIs were also beginning to play a central role in the mobile evolution as well. As I continued my research in July of 2010 I also noticed that everyone was focused on the technical aspects of APIs, discussing, often arguing about the technical merits of REST, and very few people were talking about the business side of successful API efforts.</p>
<p>Through my early research in cloud computing, and ultimately APIs, I had found my focus -- the business of APIs. My partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) was also looking for her own direction, and we agreed that if she started <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Hack Education</a>, I would help her run her server and other IT infrastructure, and if I started API Evangelist, she would help me learn to write, and craft better stories--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/why-a-tech-journalist-cares-about-your-api/">some of the early stories were actually written or edited by her</a>.</p>
<p>July 2010's research was all about finding my focus, and by August I purchased the domain apievangelist.com, where I would openly share my research, and by October I published my first story, which I think was appropriately titled, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/09/25/the-api-economy/">the API Economy</a>. The plan was to research the business of APIs, while sharing my research in real-time via the API Evangelist site. Five years later, I am still doing what I originally set out to do, I've just gotten more organized about how I conduct my research, evolved my storytelling voice, and have expanded the focus beyond just the business of APIs, to what I consider to be the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>I couldn't be more happy with the work I've been able to do over the last five years. Something that wouldn't happen without the support of my partners <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a>, and <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>--<strong>THANK YOU!!!</strong>! While I do have claustrophobic moments, where I freak out, questioning why the hell I do what I do, in 2015 I can see myself doing this for at least another five years. Who knows though, things could change, and go in a different way, at any point..but at the moment, I think API Evangelist will stick around.</p>
<p>From my current vantage point, the next five years will be focused more on the politics of APIs, continuing my work around the copyright of APIs, API patents, the importance of open API definitions, and advocacy around privacy, transparency, access, data portability, interoperability and security issues. I'll continue to rely on others to innovate around the tech of APIs, shining a light on the best practices, and work to understand how the business of APIs is evolving, as the API economy truly becomes a reality, but I feel the politics of APIs will be the biggest challenges we face in the next five years.</p>
<p>Thank you to all my readers, and people who support what I do. I really enjoy what I do, and from I can tell, there are a number of people, and companies who benefit from what I do, which keeps me going. I need as much help as I can, to make sure the API economy stays secure, accessible, transparent, and truly open for developers, in a way that includes end-users in the conversation, focusing on building healthy API driven platforms, that businesses, organizations, governments, and individuals can depend on.</p>

<p>I was doing one of my regular checkins with my friend Anne Wootton (<a href="https://twitter.com/annewootton">@annewootton</a>) of P<a href="https://www.popuparchive.com/">opup Archive</a> today, something we try to do regularly, to share stories about what they are up to in the world of audio and podcast API, and what I am seeing across the voice, audio, video, and wider API landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anne was walking me through their latest rollout&nbsp;<a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/">AudioSear.ch</a>, <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/">a&nbsp;full text search &amp; recommendation API for podcasts and radio</a>, that is API driven. One of the endpoints for the <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">AudioSear.ch API</a> allows for searching of people who are involved with the podcasts and radio programs that they are indexing. As we talked, she articulated that in order to help people see the value the <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">AudioSear.ch People API</a>, rather than just telling them about it, they were <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/people/a">building micro applications, that demonstrated it</a>.</p>
<p>This may seem obvious too many, but I've made a career out of shining a light on the obvious, and with APIs being such an abstract concept, little ideas like this can go a long ways. In this era of microservices, the concept of micro, portable, simple, and focused goes a long way, and what AudioSear.ch is doing with their people API is something that other API providers should consider as well.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the little things like a demo micro application built on top of your API can be the thing that plants a seed in someones mind about what your API does--a seed that over time could grow into something much, much more. <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I already advocate for other code related building blocks like SDK, PDKs, and starter projects</a>--maybe I'll add micro apps as a building block and see if I can incite API providers to deploy more of them to support API operations.</p>

<p>I try to go through each of my areas of research as often as I can and update the content, as well as my understanding. Ideally I update the news each week, take a look at the organizations involved once a month, and evaluate the building blocks and tools each quarter. Unfortunately it doesn't always happen as planned, but as a one man operation, I think I do pretty well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just went through my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>, and adjusted my definition of what I felt needed be listed there. As I move API definitions to their own research area(s), I'm reconsidering what I want to keep an eye on when it comes to API design, and my current definition involves organizations who offer API design editors, either in the cloud or as download. They should allow you to add, edit, and manage the API details, then also provide the ability to import and export using common API definition format(s).</p>
<p>Currently I have nine organizations represented, as part of my API design research:</p>

<p>As I work to refine each of my research areas, it can be hard to draw the line where each projects starts, and ends. I had <a href="http://readme.io">Readme.io</a>, and <a href="http://wavemaker.com">Wavemaker</a> on this list, but I really felt they were more in the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a>, and <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> realms, resulting in me drawing the line where I did.</p>
<p>Next I am looking to tackle the API design tooling, which I am looking to organize into groups, as there is kind of a mash-up of different things there now. Hopefully I can break it all into a more coherent breakdown of not just the open tooling, but also open content, and other resources that might help all of us all in our API design journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I have to say after updating the list of organizations on my API design research, is I am impressed how far the services, tooling, and overall API design mindset has come in just two short years. We have more than one editor, with a couple of the implementations being open source--I'd say this is pretty healthy progress. ;-)</p>

<p>I am going through each of my research projects, and tightening things down, now that I have them all driven through my new, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">master stack of APIs</a>. First up was <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/30/tightening-up-the-organizations-that-are-included-in-my-api-design-research/">the other day I spent time going through the organization I track on as part of my API design research</a>, and today mission was to refine the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">tooling section</a>.</p>
<p>Previously my tooling page was just an alphabetical list of tools, and I wanted to at least group things in a more meaningful way, reflecting how I break them down in my own monitoring system. So I reworked the publishing to allow me to group the tools by tags, resulting in the following list:</p>

<p>I have other resources I need to add to this list, but each one requires a certain amount of love before its ready to be included. Everything here should be openly licensed, providing essential tools API providers, designers, and architects will need. If there is something that you think should be here, let me know, and I will consider adding it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One area I am still working on, is cross linking areas of tooling, potentially with other research areas. For example <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> has its own evolving area, and <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">Swagger</a> does as well. This is why I wanted to retool and break things down by tags, because some of these tags eventually become other projects, and when I break off a new area, I&nbsp; want to keep things connected.</p>
<p>Next I'll give the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API design building blocks</a> page a little attention, but it was recently overhauled, so I think I am pretty good there. After that, I need to give my paper API a little love, which allows me to aggregate my design research into a white paper. Once I'm done with that I'll quickly go through some of my other core research like API deployment, management, discovery, and beyond.</p>

<p><a href="http://recode.net/2015/06/29/u-s-top-court-declines-to-hear-google-appeal-in-oracle-software-fight/">I just read on Re/Code, that the Supreme Court declined to hear Google's appeal on the Oracle v Google case</a>--prepare for the waves of stories from tech blogs, that this will suffocate the API economy. During the last response to the case by the US Solicitor General, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/28/regarding-the-solicitor-general-weighing-in-on-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case-are-you-really-surprised-they-do-not-get-apis-i-am-not/">I wrote about how I can't even argue the concept anymore</a>, and nothing has changed for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to take the moment to remind everyone that this decision means nothing if we all share our API definitions, in open ways, using machine readable definitions like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. The disturbing move by Oracle to bring a lawsuit against Google, and the very unaware decision(s) made all the way up to federal level, will NOT bring down the API economy--your inaction will!</p>
<p>If I've learned anything during my time defending APIs, as part of the Oracle v Google case, is that many of you are holding your API designs close to your chest, thinking maybe, just maybe, they are intellectual property we should protect, and can make money on, when we are the next unicorn start-up. You are willing to do this, even at the expense of the success of your APIs, ignoring that it creates huge amounts of friction with developers, and the businesses you are asking to integrate your APIs into their systems.</p>
<p>When you bundle this with the large numbers of folks who don't even understand the difference between an API definition or design, and its code back-end, you end up with a very dangerous, controllable group of folks, who will slowly stifle, and potentially suffocate any momentum we have built with the API economy. It will be these groups of individuals and companies, who will blindly do Oracle's bidding, and make sure any democratizing power APIs had, stays in the hands of the powerful few.</p>
<p>Why would anyone integrate your API definition into their application, if at some point they can be forced to license and pay for the naming, and order of API endpoints that are called? I sure wouldn't. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/3scale-launches-api-commons-to-allow-developers-to-share-apis-under-creative-commons-licenses/">This is why Steve Willmott and I started API Commons</a>, so that we can start sorting out the open API definitions, from the closed ones, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">index these API operations using APIs.json</a>, allowing the API economy to filter itself at run-time, leaving closed, potentially dangerous definitions behind.</p>
<p>Please join me in the fight, by helping me define the common API patterns available across the space, as part our&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>&nbsp;work--do not let this decision get you down.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">I wrote that&nbsp;we should be generating Slate API documentation from Swagger so we maintain a machine readable core the other day</a>--while I love the look of <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a>, I want to make sure all API meta data is machine readable by default. Shortly after publishing my post, someone kindly pointed me to a version of Swagger that was developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jensoleg">Jens-Ole Graulund</a>, which was exactly the evolution that I was looking for.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui">The more response, Swagger driven version of Slate API document is perfect</a>!&nbsp;Giving API providers a more attractive, response version of Swagger UI (sorry Tony), while also keeping the core machine readable.--it is the best of both worlds! I plugged in one of my other complete Swagger definitions, and boom...I had a new version of my API docs.</p>

<p>Tips like this from my readers is why I blog about all my ideas out loud. If I kept my thoughts locked up, this type of discovery would never occur. I am going to play with deploying this version of the Swagger UI for my API stack, to see how versatile it is, and how well it works with my own site template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to put it out there that this new option for Swagger UI exists, in case you were looking for an alternate version of the Swagger UI. I predict this is the beginning of many different iterations on Swagger UI, resulting in one eventually that is themable. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://atom.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/atom-editor/atom-editor-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been using the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom editor</a>&nbsp;when I work on local files on my workstation for some time now. With the latest version 1.0 release I took a fresh look at the architecture, and under the hood at the packages that make the platform so powerful, and extensible. One of the packages I was reverse engineering this weekend, is the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-atom-api">Atom API Autocomplete Package</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-atom-api">The&nbsp;Atom API Autocomplete Package</a> is one of <a href="https://atom.io/packages/search?q=autocomplete">several autocompete packages</a> that gives Atom some of that IDE feel when you are editing files. I like the feel of Atom autocomplete, and I really dig that this functionality is extensible via Atom packages. This experience got me thinking again about the IDEs role in API design and development, and how I'd like to see more API definition driven dictionaries, defined using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, driving IDE autocomplete features like the Atom editor has.</p>
<p>Like everything in my world, my concept of APIs.json driven dictionaries is a work in progress, but to kick things off <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/dictionary/">I launched a new API I'm calling my dictionary API</a>, that helps me build and manage dictionaries that I can potentially use in an Atom autocomplete package. As I do with all of my work, I want to put my ideas out there early to get feedback, and stimulate other people's imaginations.</p>
<p>To provide the content for my dictionaries, I am using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, my primary API definition format. All I do is index any single, or collection of multiple APIs using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and pass the URL to my new dictionary API, and I get back a JSON dictionary.&nbsp;</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/378e4a9a4ec021fb7c4a.js"></script>
<p>This is my first draft of an potential dictionary output. I still have to get familiar with the Atom package design, and I've noticed different autocomplete packages handle their completions differently, but I at least wanted an automated way for importing Swagger definition(s), and create a single JSON dictionary that I could use as my Atom package completion store. My API will allow me to iterate on my JSON schema until I find one that works, while allowing me to generate dictionaries from existing APIs.json collections that I have defined.</p>
<p>Along with other APIs.json driven services that I am working on, like generating <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">Postman Collections</a>, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a>, I want to be able to easily generate API dictionaries that can be used throughout the API lifecycle to enrich any developer's IDE experience, and make sure they have the paths, parameters, and underlying data models for the APIs they need, right at their fingertips, in the environment they already use.</p>
<p>Imagine what API dictionaries could do for enterprise groups, in helping them standardize their API design practices, across groups, and an entire organization when they are working from common dictionaries, that are kept in sync using machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, bound into indexes using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">API documentation when done using Slate</a>. It creates very beautiful, and easy to use documentation, that makes learning about an API much more pleasant. You can find some pretty good examples of Slate being used in the wild, with the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/api/#overview">Travis CI API</a>, <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/#introduction">Dwolla API</a>, and <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/docs/api">API Science API</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slate goes a long way in standardizing the documentation for APIs, but I would like to see this go further. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/23/the-over-30-apis-i-depend-on-to-run-api-evangelist/">I am working to profile both Dwolla and API Science as part of defining the stack of APIs that I depend on to operate the API Evangelist network</a>, and while I enjoy the attractive UX Slate brings to the table, I'm lamenting the lack of a machine readable API definitions along the way.</p>
<p>I have a set of import scripts I use to scrape API documentation, and generate Swagger definitions, which I will be using to auto-generate a first draft Swagger file for any API I come across using Slate for the documentation, but I'd like to see a formal solution emerge. It would make sense to have a Slate generator from Swagger, for the API providers who would prefer the attractive looking Slate documentation, over the more functionality interactive <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>.</p>
<p>We definitely need to make sure API documentation UX is as polished as possible, but we can't lose any of the momentum we've gained from machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">I have previously talked about moving forward the API documentation and UI conversation forward</a>, and making sure Slate, and other attractive API documentation tooling, are interoperable with common API definition formats will be critical to keeping things moving forward.</p>

<p><em>This is one of several stories I am evolving as part of series I'm calling API fairy tales. With these tales I want to educate business leaders, technologists, and government about the importance of Application Programming Interfaces (API), and how they are being applied in almost every aspect of business occurring online today--providing simple examples that mainstream users can learn from, as well as retell in their circles.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Internet is slowly changing almost every aspect of our society, and a major part of this evolution is rooted in how we develop software, something that has been slowly building over the last 15 years, in the form of what is known an Application Programming Interfaces, or simply called APIs. This new breed of web APIs are providing access to data, content, and the other digital assets that are essential in building websites, mobile applications, and increasingly even physical devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This modern web API movement is not some new software from a company like IBM, Microsoft, or Google, it is simply the next step in the World Wide Web, where you don&rsquo;t just surf the web, consuming HTML documents. In the API economy you navigate the Internet, creating, consuming, and interacting with not just HTML files, but any type of content, data, or digital resource that can be accessed via the web, desktop, and mobile applications that we increasingly depend on in our personal, and professional lives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">APIs are being used by almost every type of company, across almost every industry, to deliver the web and mobile applications business and consumer users are demanding. Companies ranging from Amazon to AT&amp;T are putting APIs to work across business operations, and are something you increasingly see in governments as well, with APIs available for the city of San Francisco, New York, the White House, and across government of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you buy a product online, stream the latest movie, pay health insurance, send money online, or pay your taxes--it is likely your transaction used one or many APIs to make it happen, exposing the unit of currency for the API economy. This new API driven economy provides a digital transaction format that can be used in any business, any industry, anywhere in the world, via any Internet connected device.</p>
<p dir="ltr">APIs are not just the latest high tech product, they are the next evolution of the Internet. In 1995 companies were trying to decide whether or not they needed a website, and by 2000, having a website became critical for almost all aspects of business. In 2010 companies were trying to decide whether or not they needed an API, and in 2015, having an API is becoming critical to doing business in the rapidly expanding API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://form.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/form-io/formio-logo-full.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The concept of a form, is one one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphs</a>, that have taken on an entirely new life on the Internet. The concept of a form is baked into HTML, PDFs, and many other commons aspects of our digital lives, while also still dominating many of the information exchanges in our physical worlds. There are a handful of APIs out there that let you build forms, and their are APIs that let you build forms for platforms like Drupal, but I have yet to see a platform that uses the concept of a form, as carrot to design, deploy, and manage your API--until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://form.io/">I was introduced to Form.io at Gluecon this year</a>, and was very please with the demo I was given (and my time playing with since). Form.io is a platform that enables developers to build web and mobile applications using a drag &amp; drop interface which allows you to create both the forms and the RESTful APIs all at once. I like this concept, because forms is something the average business user will potentially understand, and is something that has helped them also better understand web, PDF, and other digital platforms--whcih tells me it might do the same for the world of APIs.</p>
<p>Form.io lets users craft their resources, from a forms point of view, allowing you to construct using common elements like email, password, address block, as well as being able to define the custom elements you will need. This is important because it is shifting API design to begin from the standpoint of how it will gathered or put to use, rather than just the system resource it came from like a database. This approach, in my opinion, has the potential to bring API design, closer to the people who are trying to solve everyday problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://form.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/form-io/form-io-builder.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have crafted your forms, and the underlying resources, Form.io gives you the ability to publish <a href="https://angularjs.org/">an application front-end as an AngularJS driven Single Page Application (SPA)</a>, which will be a whole other aspect that I will write about in coming weeks. Using Form.io, you end up with simple, embeddable forms you can publish anywhere, and a complete API that you can easily integrate with other systems, or web, and mobile applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am putting Form.io into the category of meaningful approaches to API design, deployment, and management for the masses, like <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">APISpark for building APIs from common file and data sources</a>, or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono for scraping web data, and publishing as simple API</a>. I also feel it will <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">move the API conversation forward significantly with mainstream business users like Blockspring is doing</a>, because like spreadsheets, users just get forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will hear more about Form.io from me in coming months. The platform is in beta right now, but will be announcing a wider release soon. I am also helping them work through their thoughts about how they deliver their services in the cloud, on-premise, and their overall business model and service level agreements. I am eager to support services like Form.io because while they help move the API discussion forward, they do it in a way that supports the average business user, not just developers, and the API elite.</p>
