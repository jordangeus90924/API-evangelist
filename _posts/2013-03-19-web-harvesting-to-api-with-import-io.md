{% include JB/setup %}<p>I had a demo of a new data extraction service today called Import.io.The service allows you to harvest or scrape data from websites and then output in machine readable formats like JSON.This is very similar to Needlebase, a popular scraping tool that was acquired and then shut down by Google early in 2012.Except Iâ€™d say Import.</p>
