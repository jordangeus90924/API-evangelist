<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-1.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I was writing a story for [ProgrammableWeb][1] tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console.

I hadn't properly covered the [API Console][2], [API Explorer][3] here on [API Evangelist][4], so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each.

I noticed something while reviewing Google's recent efforts to organize their family of [88 APIs][5], and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers.

Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as [Apigee][6], [Mashery][7], and [3Scale][8] does for other API providers.

[Apigee][9], [Mashery][10], and [3Scale][11] provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch.

Beyond expertise, they provide a set of [common building blocks every API should offer][12]. These are tools like forums and blogs you can find elsewhere, but these API service providers deliver in a neat bundle ready to go for your API.

But the real value they bring to the table, that you can't really find anywhere else is:

  * API Billing
  * API Traffic Controls
  * API Metrics
