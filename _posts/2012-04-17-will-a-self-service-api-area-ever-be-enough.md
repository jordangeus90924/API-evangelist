{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the essential ingredients of a successful API, is a self-service area to support your API developers.In my opinion this is a no-brainer.You have to have registration, documentation, code samples, forum and other essential API building blocks available to developers in a self-service way--so they can engage with your API 24/7 without asking for access.I’ve worked hard to make sure the CityGrid API area has a logical navigation, taking developers to the essential information they will need to learn about and integrate with the APIs: Getting Started  Publisher Overview  Ads by CityGrid Documentation  Content by CityGrid Documentation  Code Samples  SDKs  Usage Requirements  Terms and Conditions  Version History  FAQ  Blogs  Forum  Dashboard With those 13 links you can get to everything you need to know about the CityGrid Places, Offers, Reviews and Mobile, Web and Custom Advertising APIs.I keep a regular flow of information going through the blog to make sure there is excellent SEO content, so developers can search for anything at Google, and the blog will support linking to whats relevant in the CityGrid Developer Center.</p>
