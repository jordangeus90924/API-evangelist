<p>I got an email from <a title="IFTTT" href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> last night, simply stating:&nbsp;
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As of today, IFTTT has stopped supporting the Posterous Channel. The Channel has been removed, along with any Recipes that made use of Posterous Triggers or Actions.&nbsp;</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1c6f696c6c736e685c757a686868327f737132">[email&#160;protected]</a> Thanks for your continued support.&nbsp;</em>

<p>This announcement, follows a similar one a couple weeks ago, where <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/09/21/why-ifttt-forced-remove-twitter-triggers-red-alert-developers/">IFTT also ceased support for channels that pull your data from Twitter</a>. &nbsp;
<p>Since Posterous is owned by Twitter, it's easy to see the parallels in the decision by IFTTT. &nbsp;
