<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape/mashape-manage-your-APIs.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Mashape[released a few enhancements][1] to their API management platform.

  * **Inbox** \- Mashape redesigned their inbox and messaging system. Developers can contact you from your API detail page, and the inbox provides interface for managing developers and your conversations.
  * **API Wizard** \- The API setup and management wizard is no longer a step by step wizard. It now gives you five options in a left hand navigation, leaving the room for more options to be added in the future.
  * **Private APIs** \- You can now deploy a private API with Mashape, only inviting the developers you want to have access.
Some small changes, but prettyimportantchanges for API owners and developers who use [Mashape][2].

I would say the ability to deploy a private API is the most significant, as more people realize the value of APIs, and deploy them for partners, not the general public.
