2012 has been a great year to be in the API space. We saw some pretty amazing growth, and everyone is talking APIs going into 2013.

I wrote [243 blog posts on API Evangelist in 2012][1]. The top 10 posts for 2012 were:

  1. [Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API][2]
  2. [Twitter Rolls Twitter.com Back to a Server-Side Architecture][3]
  3. [The Secret to Amazons Success Internal APIs][4]
  4. [APIs Are Forever, Wait No...They Can Go Away at Any Time!!!][5]
  5. [30 APIs To Look At When Planning Your API][6]
  6. [Let Developers Register for Your API with Their Github Profile][7]
  7. [Mobile Backend as a Service Roundup and the Future of Web APIs][8]
  8. [Github is the Social Network of the Future][9]
  9. [The Building Blocks of a Successful API][10]
  10. [Open Building Blocks for an API][11]

I'm pretty proud of these posts. I think they represent the tone I'm trying to set with API Evangelist, and I'm stoked that people actually read them. Â I'm looking forward to 2013!
