<p><a href="https://gum.co/Wlwnk"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_industry_guide_api_definitions_2019_09_cover.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a>This is a guide to the world of API definitions--<a href="https://gum.co/Wlwnk">introducing you to  what the machine and human readable schema and API specification formats  are used for when it comes to defining API-driven capabilities.</a> Formats  like JSON Schema, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Postman Collections are  changing how we define our APIs, and then use definitions to engage with  developers throughout the API life cycle.</p>
<p>This API definitions  guide is the result of almost 10 years of research and participation in  the evolution of API definitions as part of community development,  conferences, and the API efforts behind the specifications themselves.  I've worked to distill my research on API definitions down into a short  guide that business as well as technical individuals can follow.  Providing a single guide to the impact that API definitions are making  across the sector, empowering both API providers and consumers when it  comes to putting APIs to work in web, mobile, and device applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Table of Contents:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Tooling</strong> - Tools that can be used to reduce friction when managing API definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Defining Operations</strong> - API definitions define APIs, as well as API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Defining Consistently</strong> - API definitions help consistently deliver APIs for consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Reusing Patterns</strong> - Reuse of patterns across APIs are enabled using API definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Defining Capabilities</strong> - API definitions are about defining the capabilities APIs enable.</li>

</ul>
<p>This guide is meant to help decision makers make sense of how the API movement grew organically out of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) industry and produced a wealth of competing schema and API definition formats that are used to define what APIs do, but also are critical for powering almost every stop along the API lifecycle. While this guide is focused on a very technical subject, it is designed to be consume by both developers and non-technical audiences, attempting to encourage business and technical stakeholders to work together to deliver the next generation of providers.</p>
<p>API definitions aren't just the first stop in the API lifecycle. They are the most critical stop that will service every other stop, providing the human and machine readable definitions that are needed to deliver the technology and business of APIs. Get your copy of the API Evangelist API Definitions Industry Guide to help give you the understanding you need of why API definitons are critical to your API success. Helping ensure you have all of your organization'ss capabilities properly defined, discoverable, and properly applied across teams for all of the APIs you are delivering or consuming.</p>
