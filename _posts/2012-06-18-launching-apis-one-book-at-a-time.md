{% include JB/setup %}<p>Last May, Pearson Publishing began the roll-out of their new API platform, by doing initial tests using their DKâ€™s Eyewitness Travel Guide material, before moving on to a wider range of subjects.By the end of the summer they had rolled out a total of three APIs: Eyewitness Guides FT Press Longman Dictionary A year later, they now have APIs for the Pearson Kitchen Manager and most recently the Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API.Pearson is obviously being very cautious with their precious business assets.Taking time to do it right when bundling up these resources and making available for developers via a RESTful interface.The Pearson Developers community has many of the essential API building blocks like documentation, blog, forum, and FAQ.</p>
