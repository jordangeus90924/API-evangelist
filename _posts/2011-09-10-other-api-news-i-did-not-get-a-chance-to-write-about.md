Here are a couple news stories from the week that I didn't get a chance to write about.

  * **[Google APIs Client Library for PHP][1]** \- Google launches a new set of PHP Client LIbraries that work across multiple Google APIs including Buzz, Books, Latitude, Page Speed, Tasks and URL Shortener.
  * **[Breaking Down E-Commerce APIs][2]-** An amazing breakdown of E-Commerce APIs by Marc Mezzecca,, founder of NextGen Shopping, over at ProgrammableWeb.
  * **[Madison Transit API Homebrew][3]** \- A great story about hacking together an API for the Madison Transit, by scraping their website site and abstracting an interface that developers can really use.  
  * **[Google API Not Close …Unless You’re “Trusted”, Then It’s Ready][4]** \- Techcrunch let us know that their is a Google API, and if you happen to be what Google considers a “Trusted Tester”, you could be getting access to the API much sooner. 
  * **[Infochimps Acquires Keepstream][5]** \-  Infochimps purchase of social media curation and analytics company, Keepstream.

Wish I had more time in each day.
