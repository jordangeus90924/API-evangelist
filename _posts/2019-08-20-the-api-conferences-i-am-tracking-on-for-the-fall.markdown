As we approach the fall it is time to begin thinking about the conference season, and what the most relevant API conferences are. I haven’t been doing any events this year, but staying in tune with the conference circuit has always been important to my work. Who knows, maybe I will be spend some more time investing in API related events after taking a break for six month. When it comes to API events and conferences, here is what I am tracking on.

<strong>API Days: Banking APIs and PSD2</strong><br>

<strong>API Days: From Legacy to Agile, From Product to Ecosystems</strong><br>
Paris, France<br>
December 10-11, 2019<br>

The original API Days location in Paris, France has grown into the biggest API gathering in the world. It is been happening since 2012, and attracts people from across the globe to talk APIs across many different industries. If you pick one conference to attend this fall, I recommend you make it to APIs Days, Paris.

These are all conferences I have been to, supported and helped grow throughout the years. If you are new to the world of APIs, or an experienced veteran, I recommend hitting as many of the events on this list as you can. While some of them have a more narrow focus, there is something to learn at each of these events on stage, and in the hallways talking with attendees.

It looks like a strong API conference season this fall. It definitely makes me miss being on the road, and able to hit all of these events. I'm happy to see all of these events continuing, but I'm most happy to see APIStrat be reborn as the API Specifications Conference, which I think is the most important subject we can be talking about in the API sector going into 2020.
