{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just wrapped up the AT&amp;T Mobile App Hackathon in Las Vegas.I had a great time hanging out with developers at the Palms Hotel, and watching everyone compete for the 30K in prizes.My primary goal at these events is to get to know developers and hear what they have to say.I was fortunate to connect with one such developer, Ravi Singh (@Code4Ever), and he was so kind to share Ravis Rules for Hackathons: 1: Use Eventbrite or Meetup to organize the event.Dont spin your own system because it is a waste of time.</p>
