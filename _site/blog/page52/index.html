<p>I got an email from <a title="IFTTT" href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> last night, simply stating:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As of today, IFTTT has stopped supporting the Posterous Channel. The Channel has been removed, along with any Recipes that made use of Posterous Triggers or Actions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at support@ifttt.com. Thanks for your continued support.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&mdash;The IFTTT Team&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This announcement, follows a similar one a couple weeks ago, where <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/09/21/why-ifttt-forced-remove-twitter-triggers-red-alert-developers/">IFTT also ceased support for channels that pull your data from Twitter</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Posterous is owned by Twitter, it's easy to see the parallels in the decision by IFTTT. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-days-madrid/api-days-editerranea-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just got back from Madrid, Spain, where I spoke at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIdays Mediterranea</a>.  I really enjoy the API Days format, because the events are small, intimate API learning and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>While at API Days I got to hang out with many of the usual suspects Andy Thurai of <a title="API Management" href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/api-management">Intel</a>, Guillaume Balas of <a title="API Management" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, Ronnie Mitra of <a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a>, Bruno Pedro of <a title="CloudWork" href="http://cloudwork.com">CloudWork</a>, Swift of <a href="http://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a> and API Days organizer Mehdi Medjaoui of <a href="http://webshell.io">WebShell</a>.</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to re-enforce some existing relationships in person, with Isabelle Mauny of <a title="API Management" href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>, Jeremiah Lee a UX researcher from SF and Eduardo Basterrechea and Elena Alvarez of <a href="http://www.apicultur.com/en/">Apicultur</a>.</p>

<p>API Days Mediterranea was a great introduction to the API innovation occurring in Spain, and a great opportunity to have conversations with companies and developers from the region, and hear the challenges they face in getting the word out about APIs in their country.</p>
<p>I really dig going to new regions and helping spreading the API gospel.  Thank you so much to Apicultur for bringing me out, and Webhsell and <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">Fabernovel</a> for helping organize.  Also don't forget 3Scale, Intel, <a title="Email" href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a> and WSO2 for organizing.</p>
<p>I can't wait for the next edition of API Days, the model really works well for planting the necessary seeds in new regions to get the API conversation going.  Next up is API Days San Francisco (no seed planting required), but there will be other cities added, so make sure and step up if you'd like to see API Days in your city!</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-urge-court-block-copyright-claims-oracle-v-google-api-fight"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/google-v-oracle-brief.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-urge-court-block-copyright-claims-oracle-v-google-api-fight">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recently filed a a brief</a> in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, urging the court to block copyright claims in the Oracle v. Google legal battle.  The EFF approached me several months ago to provide feedback for the brief.   I sent over my research and published some of my thoughts to <a href="/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">Help EFF Make Case For No Copryight on APIs</a> and why <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/12/08/api-copyright-would-restrict-api-interoperability/">API Copyright Would Restrict API Interoperability</a> and also lent my support as one of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">Signatories to the Computer Scientists&rsquo; Amicus Brief</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a summarized version of the arguement:</p>
<blockquote><em>As computer scientists, amici have relied on the open nature of APIs and the programs built on them to create and operate new software.  Amici depend on APIs remaining open to sustain wide spreads compatibility standards used by startups and incumbents alike.  Reversing the District Court would dangerously undermine the settled expectations of computer scientists who rely on the open nature of APis. </em><ol style="padding-left: 25px; list-style-type: upper-roman; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces were essential to the development of modern computers and the Internet</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>The BIOS of the Original IBM-Compatible PC</em></li>
<li><em>Major modern operating system reimplement the ground break UNIX API</em></li>
<li><em>The C programming language became universal because of its uncopyrightable interface</em></li>
<li><em>Computers rely on the uncopyrightable nature of APIs and network protocols to communicate over the Internet</em></li>
<li><em>The uncopyrightable nature of APIs for the industry standards for cloud computing</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces spur the creation of software that otherwise would not be written</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces allow software that makes different systems compatible<br /></em></li>
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces help programmers develop completely new capabilities for software</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Copyright in interfaces would creat an "orphan software" problem</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces protect both developers and users<br /></em></li>
<li><em>The orphan software problem disproportionately affects the public sector</em></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<blockquote><em> Conclusion: </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The freedom to reimplement and extend existing aPIs has undoubtedly led to robust software and hardware industries, but also to an explosion of technological advances that do more than merely increase companies' bottom line.  They open the world for the sharing of information, increased communication, and technological advances that could never have been contemplated.</em></blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-computer-scientists">full brief that was filed over at EFF</a>.  Keeping APIs open, and free from copyright is something I am passionate about and feel very strongly that it is critical to a healthy, vibrant online economy.</p>
<p>I'm confident that the Judge will throw out Oracle's case, but I do no think this is the last time we'll see a company step up and try to apply copyright to APIs.</p>
<p>I'm very thankful for the EFF and the other computer scientists who researched and supported the brief.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://webshell.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Have you checked out what the <a title="Webshell.io" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell.io</a> team is up to lately? &nbsp;I know I haven't been in there for a couple months, and it looks like they've been heads down making some interesting improvements.</p>
<h3>New Cloud IDE</h3>
<p>Rather than re-invent the wheel, Webshell has integrated <a title="Cloud9" href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>&nbsp;web-based IDE, into the API scripting platform:</p>
<p><a href="ttps://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h3>New Documentation</h3>
<p>They overhauled their platform documentation on the continuous mission to make them more valuable by developers:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-2.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h3>New API Explorer</h3>
<p>They've changed the API explorer making playing with APIs a better experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-3.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-3.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3>New Codecademy Lesson</h3>
<p>They have created "Webshell 101" course, providing an easy way to understand how Webshell works:<br /><a href="http://7za.r.mailjet.com/redirect/0v8nhcjr7rysybw5poob6n/www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-Gux11/0/1" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" alt="image" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>That is four pretty significant building blocks from the Webshell platform. If your not familiar with some of the innovative API integration Webshell is doing, I recommend checking them out. &nbsp;Also if you haven't taken a fresh look in a while, like me, I recommend taking a moment.</p>
<p>The Webshell team gets the future of API usage, what they are doing via their platform represents a meaningful blend of the technology, business and politics of APIs, providing a model for the programmable web.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/29/api-aggregation-for-federal-government-with-fedapi/">API Aggregation For Federal Government with FedAPI</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Fed-API-Logo-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been tracking on what I call API aggregation for some time now.  I started seeing the <a href="/2010/11/19/universal-apis/" target="_blank">API aggregation trends in 2010</a>, then I saw this pick up in 2011 with the emergence of providers like <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=34" target="_blank">Singly</a> and <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=35" target="_blank">Adigami</a>.</p>
<p>While many new companies provide you with interoperability and automation between multiple APIs, I consider aggregators to be about bringing together multiple APIs into a single aggregated end-point for developers to use, then also providing potentially new APIs that are only possible, because of the aggregation.</p>
<p>Last year, after I started spending more time in Washington DC, I met a talented group of folks who were playing around with the idea of an aggregate API for federal government.  In the last couple weeks it looks like they were serious about it, and launched the debut version of <a href="http://fedapi.com/">Fed{API}</a>.</p>
<p>Fed{API} is looking to make government data more accessible and reusable by taking data from multiple sources, some easy to pull and some much more difficult, then collect, correlate and catalog into a single, aggregate API stack that developers can put to use.</p>
<p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/fedapi/fedapi-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API Aggregation</a>.  I think this is the future of standardizing APIs and data across many sources, but as I'm watching providers tackle this, you begin to realize what a massive undertaking it will be.  And FedAPI is looking to do this by opening up federal government data, which by itself is a massive challenge.  So FedAPI is tackling two pretty massive problems, as a core business model.</p>
<p>Even with the massive challenge ahead, I will be supporting FedAPI 100%, and doing what I can to make sure their initiative is successful. To do so, I think they will have to get two other groups involved:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Other API Aggregate Providers</strong> - FedAPI needs to make sure and reach out to Singly, Temboo, Adigami and the other API aggregators and see what they can learn, share knowledge and wisdom.  Aside from FedAPI, all these providers need to work together and not re-invent the wheel when it comes to Auth and API connectors</li>
<li><strong>Public At Large</strong> - FedAPI has to introduce tools that allow figure everyday Joe and Jane citizen into the equation.  Some users are going to be very knowledgable and passionate about specific areas, and there has to be ways to share the load and let them help clean and verify data, and other meaningful tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think that API Aggregation is the answer to all the problems that plague API integration, but I think API aggregators will play a major role in helping standardize API interfaces, data formats and provide critical cross-provider, inter-agency knowledge and wisdom--something individual API providers may never be able to deliver alone.</p>
<p>One thing I want to lend a hand with, when it comes to FedAPI, is help create the blueprint of which federal agencies already have APIs and open data sets, and where these exists.  I can also be the aggregator of news, analysis and best practices across the federal API landscape.</p>
<p>I'm on board FedAPI, let's make this happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p>Expansion is in the air.  Quarterly reports are in, we are moving into summer and companies like Twilio, Evernote, Salesforce and Foursquare are expanding and growing at healthy, steady paces.</p>
<p>Mobile is king.  I'm having trouble keeping up with the new mobile players in different niche areas, as well as all the big players paying strong attention to the mobile space including Yahoo, SAP, Intel and beyond. BaaS will continue to be a dominate theme throughout 2013.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things is prominent with tech blogosophere coverage, webinars and new companies rolling out IOT APIs and technology. &nbsp;As we see the rhetoric step up on autombiles, homes, buildings and other fast growing IOT areas we'll continue to see new companies and investment, the trick will be to sort through it all and make sense.</p>
<p>API management is definitely on everyone's minds.  I'm seeing existing PaaS platforms make plays with API management tools, new database to API discussions and all the big players are as active &nbsp;as ever, even Mashery and Layer 7 after their recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>API testing, monitoring and other developer focused tools is my favorite new area to research lately.  I'm seeing an explosion in this area with high profile launches from Runscope, TheRightAPI and a strong presence from existing players like SmartBear and Pingdom.</p>
<p>A new area I'm adding to my API trends monitoring is around what is being called Single Page Applications (SPA).  There was a great talk by Steve Willmott of 3Scale this week at Gluecon on the relationship between SPA and APIs.  But I'm also seeing major movement from devs and API providers in use of SPA oriented frameworks and libraries like Angular.js, Ember.js, Knockout.js and Backbone.js.</p>
<p>Beyond testing and monitoring, security is an important theme.  As the API space expands, the concern for securing APIs and their accompanying web apps is growing.  We are seeing major providers continue the roll-out of two-step verification, as well as security and identity providers stepping up to offer services in the space.</p>
<p>Overall the space is showing healthy expansion.  New APIs, service provers and tools are emerging, while the existing players are expanding at a healthy rate.  It has been a good spring for the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-stack/api-stack-logo.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Over the last year I've worked hard to standardize and automate as much of my monitoring of the API space as I can. The amount of information I was monitoring daily was getting overwhelming--I needed to scale what I do, so I created what I call my <a href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API Stack Ranking</a>.</p>
<p>The API Stack Ranking is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not meant </span>to be a top 25 list, it is meant to be a ranking that I can sort companies by each week, giving me a meaningful stack of companies, who are doing interesting things in the API space.</p>
<p>Each week I publish my <a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank">API Stack</a>, but you can also see this influence on any of my research areas. &nbsp;If you go to <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> or the <a title="Backend as a Service (BaaS)" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">Backend as a Service (BaaS</a>) research projects, the providers are sorted by their ranking for the week.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing my stack each week, I'd like to also share the criteria I use to determine my stack. &nbsp;Currently I bundle my signals into three areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Signals within control of the companies I'm monitoring      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Has a Blog</li>
<li>Number of Blog Posts</li>
<li>Has a Twitter Account</li>
<li>Number of Tweets</li>
<li>Has Github Account</li>
<li>Number of Github Repositories</li>
<li>Number of Commits Across Repositories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>External</strong> - Signals from the public, outside of the companies control that I'm monitoring      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Number of Twitter Followers</li>
<li>Number of @Mentions for Twitter</li>
<li>Blogsphere (Techcrunch, GigaOm, ReadWrite, etc) Posts</li>
<li>Social Bookmark (Hacker News, Reddit, StumbleUpon) Links</li>
<li>Stack Exchange Reference</li>
<li>Number of Github Followers</li>
<li>Number of Github Stars</li>
<li>Number of Github Forks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analyst</strong> - Signals that are dependent on what I personally see and feel is important      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Curated News</li>
<li>Curated News I Write Notes About</li>
<li>Syndicate to Twitter</li>
<li>Syndicate to LinkedIn</li>
<li>Syndicate to G+</li>
<li>Publish story on API Evangelist</li>
<li>Vote Up&nbsp;</li>
<li>Vote Down</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My API Stack Ranking is always in flux.  I'm considering other signals like job postings, events as well as sentiment analysist, but this listing represents what I'm currently evaluating to generate my stack each week.</p>
<p>While internal signals give me a good idea of what a company is up to, and the external signals give me some idea regarding what the open developer community is saying, it all really comes down to the analyst part of the algorithm. &nbsp;A company may tweet a lot, but its up to me to decide if those tweets are valuable.</p>
<p>The API Stack Ranking isn't perfect. &nbsp;But it has allowed me to quadruple the amount of information I take in, and surface what I feel are the real stories and reflect the companies that are truly impacting the API space each week.</p>
<p>I have also been able to expand the API Stack Ranking to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> business or topical sector I wish now, much like I applied to <a title="BaaS" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">BaaS</a> I'm now evaluating <a title="Federal Government" href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com">federal government</a>, <a title="healthcare" href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com">healthcare</a> and other sectors in the same way.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me directly about the API Stack, and the data and content I produce each week. &nbsp;I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/28/new-features-from-baas-provider-anypresence/">New Features From BaaS Provider AnyPresence</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.anypresence.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/anypresense_logo_New.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm adding some new BaaS features I found in a recent press release from BaaS provider <a title="AnyPresence" href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a> titled, "<a href="http://www.anypresence.com/press-release/AnyPresence_Launches_4th-Generation_Mobile_Backend_as_a_Service_Platform.php">AnyPresence Launches 4th-Generation Mobile Backend-as-a-Service Platform with Unparalleled Enterprise Capabilities</a>", to my list of BaaS features. &nbsp;As I'm processing them I notice they are some pretty significant features:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Application Cloning -&nbsp;</strong>For organizations looking to build multiple apps that have common core functionality with only minor variations, this powerful feature allows them to create a copy of an existing app along with all data source, object, and user interface definitions, saving significant development effort.</li>
<li><strong>Automated App UI Testing -&nbsp;</strong>Developers who use AnyPresence to generate a starter mobile app user interface (UI), now get the added benefit of functional test scripts for native iOS, native Android, and jQuery Mobile web apps. These test scripts can be run to ensure the app is interacting with backend functionality as expected, saving time in testing and improving reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Server Extensions -&nbsp;</strong>While developers have always been able to add custom code to objects within AnyPresence, they can now create re-usable &ldquo;Extensions&rdquo; that can be shared across teams or lines of business. This also enables third parties to encapsulate their services as official AnyPresence Extensions, enabling a marketplace of add-ons that can be used across the AnyPresence customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise App Store Integration -&nbsp;</strong>AnyPresence now supports the ability to deploy apps to employees directly via enterprise app stores powered by Mobile Application Management (MAM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. Apperian EASE is first MAM partner solution to be integrated directly with the AnyPresence Designer.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure Management -&nbsp;</strong>For the default cloud backend server deployment to Heroku, administrators can now control the performance characteristics of their app, and choose from hundreds of Heroku add-ons, directly from the AnyPresence Designer. This seamless integration enables developers to plan for the required capacity and usage of each individual backend server instance, and manage them from one central location.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to interpret each BaaS provider's products and services, and establish any sort of common definition, but applicaiton cloning, automated testing, custom server extensions and enterprise app stores are pretty straight-forward and powerful BaaS features.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see where AnyPresence goes with their custom extensions. &nbsp;I think whoever can do this part of BaaS correctly will win the BaaS world championships! (That is an award, right?)</p>
<p>Lot's of exciting stuff coming from the BaaS sector lately! &nbsp;Fun space to watch.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/27/api-management-using-apiphany/">API Management Using APiphany</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 May 2013</span>
        <p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-logo-blue.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm working my way through all the <a title="API management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management providers</a>, making sure I'm up to speed on what service each provider is offering these days.  As part of this work I've been playing with the <a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank">Apiphany</a> platform, using a demo site the Apiphany team was so kind to setup for me.</p>
<p>Using Apiphany I can manage my APIs, and launch a portal which allows me to hang all my APIs, then manage all aspects of their operations. Apiphany focuses on the three main components of API deployment &amp; consumption:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - API resources and their operations you've deployed and would like to hang and manage via your Apiphany portal</li>
<li><strong>Products</strong> - Virtual products you create, which allow access to various combinations of API resources and operations</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - Applications that are registered with the platform, and consuming APIs via various product subscriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>The way Apiphany sets up the systems is very intuitive, giving you quick, administrative control over the systems you will need to execute on either a very simple, or even a very complex API strategy.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-apis.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>APIs</strong></span><br /> Apiphany provides all the basics for API management, allowing you to add to endpoints, manage the title, description and manage operations for each endpoint, allowing you to define service operations to enable service documentation, interactive API console, per operation limits, request/response validation, and operation-level statistics.  Beyond the basics you can mask APIs, implement sophisticated caching and import overall API definitions from a WADL, Google Discovery Document, Swagger or OData format.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/aiphany-import.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Products</strong></span><br /> After you have all your raw API resources defined, you can move to define your "products", composed from your valuable API resources. The Apiphany product manager allows you to provide names and descriptions for your products, choose who has access and whether their are published or unpublished and the terms of use for any developer who subscribes to a product.  API product management takes a lot of work, experience and creativity--the Apiphany management system makes it something anyone can do.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Policies</strong></span><br />The policies management area of Apiphany is where it gets seriously powerful.  Using the products, APIs and their operations, you can define granular level policies that are essential to API operations.  Policies can range from converting XML to JSON, providing JSONP or simply setting headers for specific APIs operations, and potentially within as specific product composition.  Policies gives you a library of common policies that are used across the API industry via easy to apply templates, but also allow you to define custom Node.js policies.  The ability to define and apply policies across products, APIs and their operations provides a very modular, reusable and granular control over all aspects of your API platform.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-policies-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>APIs, Products and Policies are the heart of the Apiphany API management solution.  These provide the essential operational building blocks every API owner will need to execute an API platform. Apiphany also provides the necessary CMS framework to manage and support the developer portal, which wraps around your products, APIs and operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Portal Management System</strong></span><br /> The APIPhany solution gives you full control over a developer portal to hang products, APIs and operations within--giving yuo control to customize the look, navigation of the portal with full page, content and media management. The Apiphany API Portal comes complete with the essential building blocks like documentation, blog, support and other CMS essentials to support an API platform.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-dashboard.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Analytics</strong></span><br /> Apiphany has added a pretty robust suite of API analytics that allow you manage the most common aspects of API operations, in the following three areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Usage - Calls and bandwidth</li>
<li>Health - Status code, cache and API response time</li>
<li>Activity - By developer, product, API and operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apiphany analytics package allow you to filter by products and operations broken down by default dates like today, yesterday and 7,30,90 day or custom timelines. It gives you the basics of what you will need to be in tune with your API operations and make short or long term decisions for your API roadmap.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Developers</strong></span><br /> Developers are central to any API operations and Apiphany provides the tools you will need to manage developer details and their subscriptions to products, and how their applications are using API resources. Apiphany gives you the control to block, reset and define access levels and roles for each of your developers, providing the control you need to manage your API ecosystem.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-developer.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is my first deep dive into the Apiphany API management platform. I like what I see.  It has all the tools you will need to define, secure, manage and evolve your APIs. Deploying APIs requires a certain level of understanding of APIs, but with Apiphany anyone could take a set of API endpoints and transform and evolve them into some meaningful API driven products.</p>
<p>After spending some time playing with what is possible with the Apiphany platform I'm left with thoughts about how I could craft products around the API resources I have.  I feel like I could easily define some pretty robust API products developers could subscribe to and integrate with.  But I also feel like I could easily iterate and add products, policies and create new APIs and operations to better meet potential consumers needs with very little effort.</p>
<p>I'm going to continue setting up my API infrastructure with Apiphany, and help me understand what is possible.  I'd love to have my core platform available on all self-service API platforms, helping me understand where the space is at, and what each company brings to the table.</p>

<p>I have been using <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> to manage my code for a couple years now, but in the last year I'm using Github more often for a variety of projects that don't always have code involved--examples ranging from <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/">hosting slide decks for my talks</a> to repositories for my <a href="/trends/">API research projects</a>.</p>
<p>In the last couple months I've noticed I'm not the only one using Github to organize projects, check out of a few of these examples:</p>

<p>Github lends itself to managing markup and markdown documents in a very collaborative way, allowing for tracking issues and revisions along the way.  There is something about the open source process that introduces transparency and visibility into the document creation and management process.</p>
<p>I'm wll keep tracking on the innovative ways I'm seeing Github used.  So far I'm pretty impressed with the different ways I'm seeing Github used. &nbsp;If you know of any other interesting ways, please send my way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 May 2013</span>
        <p>I wanted to share a quick visualization of the beneifts of&nbsp;<a title="Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama's Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API</a><span>, following&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a><span>, and part of the Whitehouse CIO's strategy, entitled "</span><a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a><span>" and the potential of the recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf">Open Data Executive Order and accompanying Open Data Policy</a>. </span></p>
<p>Each federal agency should have three things available online at their domain:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>agency.gov/digitalstrategy/</li>
<li>agency.gov/data</li>
<li>agency.gov/developers/</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are three pretty important signals in the API space. &nbsp;This represents each agencies technology roadmap, data and developer resources. Which can be some pretty interesting signals for the overall health of a federal agency.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, let's look at the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Let's go to: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy">http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy</a></strong></p>

<p>After the Department of Energy, let's take a look at another agency, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>

<p>Granted, these are two very different agencies.  But I can't help but think that the IRS should hand out a copy of the White House Open Data Policy internally, and figure out how they can begin to let a little light into their operations and culture.</p>

<p>I'm reading <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2013/05/24/irs-turn-over-a-new-leaf-open-up-data/">IRS: Turn Over a New Leaf, Open Up Data</a>, from the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> blog.  I'll let you read it in its entirety, but these are the points that are sticking with me:</p>
<blockquote><em>One of Mr. Werfel&rsquo;s first actions on the job should be the immediate implementation of the groundbreaking Presidential Executive Order and Open Data policy, released last week, that requires data captured and generated by the government be made available in open, machine-readable formats. Doing so will make the IRS a beacon to other agencies in how to use open data to screen any wrongdoing and strengthen law enforcement.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>By sharing readily available IRS data on tax-exempt organizations, encouraging Congress to pass a budget proposal that mandates release of all tax-exempt returns in a machine-readable format, and increasing the transparency of its own processes, the agency can begin to turn the page on this scandal and help rebuild trust and partnership between government and its citizens.</em></blockquote>
<p><em><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs/irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></em></p>
<blockquote><em>Making IRS data open won&rsquo;t solve every problem; the recent scandal has proven that the IRS must be more transparent about both the information it collects, but also how it manages that information. A commitment on day one to share the data it collects in a machine readable manner would show true leadership by Mr. Werfel and help solidify the Obama administration&rsquo;s legacy as an open government.</em></blockquote>
<p>From my vantage point, in the world of APIs--I can't help but feel the solution to our "big government" illnesses is a little API therapy. &nbsp;The Open Data Policy has set the bar, and its up to the individual agencies to pay attention.</p>
<p>APIs are not just a technical band-aid.   APIs start with a technical seed, but if a business or government entity internalizes the concepts around opening up, providing access, and setting up a feedback look with the public, partners or even with other departments, they will potentially let in a little sunlight.  Something that can go a long way in preventing many of the illnesses we often associate with "big government".</p>
<p>I'm optimistic that the IRS can regain its footing.  I'm <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">seeing a lot of API and open data innovation coming out of the federal government lately</a>.  For such a controversial entity like the IRS to recover, they will need to open up, and communicate with the public, in a way that only APis can provide.</p>

<p>Using the DeveloperForce sandbox you can create copies of your data, allowing you to develop, test or train against, not just a sandbox, but a relevant and meaningful copy of your company's data.</p>
<p>The Force.com sandbox has always allowed you to create a separate copy of your data, but now they let you create sandbox templates, allowing you to create specific data sets that you can reuse in different ways.</p>
<p>Seeing this feature coming out of Salesforce has prompted me to take a closer look at their approach to the DeveloperForce sandbox environment.  I'm sure there are other features and approaches to sandboxing we can learn from the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.</p>

<p>I just had a demo of some of the new features in the <a title="API Manager" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/">WSO2 API Manager</a>.   Since WSO2 is one of my partners, I have a regular call with them to discuss the space and I often get demos of their new products and features.</p>
<p>Today's topic was <a href="http://wso2.org/library/articles/2013/05/multitenant-api-management-new-wso2-api-manager-140">multi-tenacy in their API Management platform</a>, meaning&nbsp;you can easily deploy multiple API portals using the platform.  Not every company will need more than one API portal, but for some companies that are further along, it provides a pretty sophisticated way to engage with API consumers.</p>
<p>When it comes to slicing and dicing your APIs, we usually segment our API resources by service level, apps and users.  WSO2 introduces a fourth layer--by the domain.  So now you can group API resources under domains, crafting different "API storefronts" for your consumers.</p>
<p>I'm still thinking through all of the opportunities with API management multi-tenancy, but at first thought, it will help me counteract many of the questions I get around a company's concern that APIs have to be public.  Most companies have learned about APIs from the popularity of public APIs, so I spend a lot of time explaining the opportunities for internal or partner APis.</p>
<p>The WSO2 approach to API management multi-tenancy allows me to help companies understand that unlimited ways they can provide access to their valuable resources in not just public, private ways, but to any group, user base or target audience in a very organized and branded way.</p>
<p>You can hear me, and Chris Haddad VP, Technology Evangelism at WSO2 discuss multi-tenancy as part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2013/06/your-api-branding-strategy">Your API Branding Strategy</a> webinar on Thursday, June 13, 2013.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://fargo.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dave-winer/fargo-small-picture.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Cloud storage of documents is becoming commonplace. Individuals, companies, government and non-government organizations have increasingly seen the potential of storing files in the cloud using services like Amazon S3, Dropbox and Box.</p>
<p>As a web or mobile application developer, it is becoming more common to provide integration, syncing or even direct usage of popular cloud storage services like Dropbox as the application's storage system.</p>
<p>This last week I started playing with Dave Winer's (<a href="/admin/blog/davewiner">@davewiner</a>) simple idea outliner, notepad, todo list and project organizer--<a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>.</p>
<p>What caught my attention is Dave's use of Dropbox as the central storage for the app.  It reminds me of another application I use called <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a>, which uses Github as the central storage system for the app.</p>
<p>I really dig this approach to delivering, dead-simple, meaningful apps like Fargo, that don't re-invent the wheel and focus on delivering value on top of the existing tools and platforms we already use.</p>
<p>I asked Dave what his thoughts are on this approach, in which he simply replied:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">kinlane</a> -- works like a dream</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
</div>
<p>I like Dave's approach to app development which is about delivering simple, useful apps that that sensibly put APIs to use, and establish a foundation using open formats like OPML.</p>
<p>As the hardware and operating systems developers depend on continues being vritualized and migrating into the cloud, the usage of open formats and common, API driven cloud resources like storage from Dropbox, will be common among successful app developers.</p>
<p>I think Dropbox as your apps default file system is here to stay.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://datasift.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm increasingly finding a company's approach to using Github, a vital signal of the health of a company, their team, and the products and services they are delivering.</p>
<p>An example of this is with social data platform, <a href="http://datasift.github.io/">DataSift's new open source area</a>.  DataSift has thrown up a Github page which re-enforces the company's commitment to consuming and producing open source software, as well as a list of important, Github driven signals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Latest Updates</strong> - The latest repository updates acorss all of DataSift's repositories</li>
<li><strong>API Client Libraries</strong> - Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and other client libraries for the DataSift API</li>
<li><strong>Public Github Repos</strong> - Other tools and utilities that are avaiable via DataSift Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Job Vacancies</strong> - A listing of current job openings at DataSift</li>
</ul>
<p>I think DataSift approach is a very meaningful demonstration in the potential of being "open". &nbsp;As a company, DataSift provides access to valuable social signals, that any company can access via their interface and API, allowing them to develop insight and intelligence.  If you look closely at their approach to deploying their Github hosted, open source site, it provides four very critical signals.  API client libraries, open source code projects, job openings and updates across the company's Github profile.</p>
<p><a href="http://datasift.github.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-open-source.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Think about it.  The number of platforms supported for an API, the number of public open source code projects and the number and type of job postings for a company are pretty significant signals regarding the health of a company these days. &nbsp;These can be pretty difficult areas to fake, and in many cases will quickly show the activity, growth and stability of a company.</p>
<p>I like DataSift's approach to their Open Source area.  It doesn't just provide code and tools for developers to be successful, it provides us a deeper look into how DataSift operates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the 1,640 tech companies I monitor, 751 of them have Github accounts. &nbsp;I think many of these companies can learn a lot from DataSift's approach to open source and how you can put Github to use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/digital-services-innovation-center.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm working through the wave of API innovation coming out of our Federal Government recently. During normal days at API Evangelist, I'm pulling private sector API usage examples and crafting them into stories to help the Federal Government execute on their API own strategies.  Today, I'd like to showcase something the Federal Government is doing, in hopes that more companies in the private API sector will emulate as part of their API strategies.</p>
<p>The GSA's&nbsp;<a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/">Digital Services Innovation Center</a> has launched the <a href="http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/">Mobile Code Catalog</a>, an open source catalog of web and native applications that government agencies can use to jump-start their projects. Think application showcase, but all the applications are open source and allow for your API developers to download, fork and re-use code.</p>
<p>The idea of a code catalog is pretty interesting, and I see it as an evolution of several API building blocks I talk about--code samples, SDKs, starter kits and application showcase all rolled into one.  Imagine if your API consumers can come into your developer area and not just find code samples, they can find complete applications that they can download, reverse-engineer and put to use.  Talk about going from zero to API integration in as short of time as possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/mobile-code-catalog.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I know that many API owners compete with their ecosystems, by deploying their own version of their mobile, web or desktop apps, but for the others a code catalog is an excellent way to facilitate integrations with your platform.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about the Digital Services Innovation Center Mobile Code Catalog, is that the catalog itself is open source and hosted on Github.  This is a whole other aspect of the innovation around a code catalog, that the catalog itself can be downloaded, forked and published anywhere on a public website or private portal.</p>
<p>I envision hundreds of code catalogs available in the near future, across many business, government and NGO sectors.  While there is money in building proprietary apps on top of APIs, I think there is even more money to be made when you put meaningful, high quality apps in the hands of end-users.</p>

<p>He talks about the evolution towards Single Page Web Applications (SPA).  Which is the migration <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">from</span> static web pages and database driven web apps to dynamically driven HTML, CSS and JavaScript apps designed using popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - Ember<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span> is an open-source client-side JavaScript web application framework based on the model-view-controller (MVC) software architectural pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page applications<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">[</span>1] by incorporating common idioms and best practices into a framework that provides a rich object model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, automatically-updating templates powered by Handlebars<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span>, and a router for managing application state</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running what <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">are known</span> as single-page applications. Its goal is to augment browser-based applications with model&ndash;view&ndash;controller (MVC) capability, in an effort to make both development and testing easier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - Backbone<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span> gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Single page applications have benefits like speed, no page reloads, mobile optimization, real-time pushes, notifications and they just look <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">freak'n</span> cool.  But there are also downsides like needing some healthy JavaScript talent to maintain, SEO issues and a general deviation from the linked, document driven web we are used to.</p>
<p>The popularity of frameworks and libraries like Ember, Angular and Backbone, and the Single Page Application approach isn't something just developers are noticing.  Some top platforms are seeing the potential, and providing code and toolkits for integrating using Ember, Angular and Backbone:</p>

</ul>
<p>With the popularity of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and growing number of <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">SPAs</span>, there is a huge opportunity for API providers to offer API driven libraries and widgets that are plug and play with frameworks like Angular and Ember, and are compatible with libraries like Backbone.</p>
<p>As I monitor the API space I will continue looking for examples of APIs doing interesting things with Ember, Angular and Backbone. Let me know if you see anything I should take a look at.</p>

<p>We got together at Microsoft around 6PM and I talked from 6:30 until 8:00, evolving on my <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/api-meetup-dallas-tx/web-to-programmableweb-to-programmableworld/index.html#/" target="_blank">From Web, to ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld</a> talk.</p>
<p><a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://www.therightapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/therightapi-logo-2.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The meetup was about 45 people ranging from developers to investors.  I showed up with a lot of content, but I wanted to make sure and cover the full API spectrum, while also introducing some new content about specifically about API consumption.</p>
<p>During the event I had some time to get to know the <a href="http://www.therightapi.com/">theRightAPI</a>, <a title="BAaS" href="http://www.proxomo.com/">Proxomo</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 Technologies</a>&nbsp;<span>and&nbsp;</span><a title="Tech Efficiency and Innovation" href="http://www.parivedasolutions.com/">Pariveda Solutions</a> folks--while connecting with the rest of the meet up group members.</p>
<p><a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/att-foundry.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Then, this morning theRightAPI crew brought me out to Plano, TX to the <a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/">AT&amp;T Foundry</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/attfoundry">@attfoundry</a>), where I got to talk with Vincent Button (<a href="https://twitter.com/vebutton">@vebutton</a>) and Jennifer Conley (<a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferconley">@jenniferconley</a>).  I was a little blown away by what I saw.  It wasn't what I was used when visiting the campuses of big telco companies in the past.  The facility was something you associate with Silicon Valley and Bay Area. Open layout with a variety of people working on things ranging from voice solutions to the internet of things.</p>
<p><a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/gravity-center/gravity-center-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards, Jennifer walked us up to the <a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/">Gravity Center</a>, which has been provided access to AT&amp;T and Alcatel-Lucent resources to support multiple startups in the North Texas area.  I got to meet to the <a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/">BookShout</a> team and hear about how they are navigating and working to change the book publishing space, while allowing people to discover books, and build social networks around books and authors.</p>
<p><a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bookshout/bookshout-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm pretty impressed with what I saw in Texas in the last 48 hours.  I met some pretty tech savvy people building interesting startups, putting APIs to use in meaningful ways, and a community around them that is investing in what they are doing. While I was there, I saw all the same elements for startup success I see in Silicon Valley, but without much of the hype.</p>
<p>I was stoked to be able to help kick off the DFW API Professionals Meetup Group.  I appreciate theRightAPI for bringing me out, and  Proxomo, Layer 7 and Pariveda Solutions for making it happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 May 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dark-matter.jpeg" border="0" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I encounter many enterprise folks who dismiss APIs as nothing more that just one of the technical building blocks of SOA.  Folks who, no matter how much I explain, will never see APIs beyond a technical specification and implementation.</p>
<p>API Evangelist solely exists to shed light on not just the technology of APIs, but the equally important business and politics of the APIs.  It is the business and political building blocks that help the concept of API grow beyond just its technical roots.</p>
<p>An API won't  find success just because you made a resource available via a URL. An API is successful because it is logically priced, possibly has revenue sharing, code samples to jumpstart integration and a support and resource network that a developer can tap into.  An API is successful because it is open and self-service, but sensibly secured, providing a terms of service that benefit API owners, and developers, while also protecting the interests of end users.</p>
<p>APIs bring together a unique blend of technology, business and politics into a transparent, self-service mix that can foster innovation. As someone who is heavily invested at the enterprise scope, it can be difficult to see things through this lens sometimes.  You will need to upgrade your prescription with the eye doctor.</p>
<p>Why "API" is working is not just a REST+JSON technical answer, there is a dark matter that binds the whole movement together, while also providing the right about of lubricant and oxygen necessary for innovation. In the enterprise you will often see this dark matter as governance, in the world of APIs it will have a lot of the same characteristics as your governance, but it is actually the exact opposite of governance.</p>
<p>I don't expect to convert all you enterprise folks to see APIs like I do. I don't think you are equipped to view the dark matter that keep the API movement expanding and moving forward. You are focused on seeing things through another lense of control and about the extraction of value--a lense that will always prevent you from seeing the dark matter that makes APIs an evolution beyond SOA.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 May 2013</span>

<p>I've been tracking on a trend in the API space that I call <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API aggregation</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://singly.com" title="Singly">Singly</a> and <a href="http://www.adigami.com/" title="Adigami">Adigami</a> are aggregating APIs into more meaningful API stacks, than any single API provider can deliver on their own.</p>
<p>In my regular monitoring, I'm always on the hunt for examples of the benefits of API Aggregation, and last week I saw some pretty interesting payment gateway data being provided by payment API aggregator <a href="http://spreedly.com" title="Payment API Aggregator">Spreedly</a>--which definitely reflects the positive effects I'm looking to shine light on in the space. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly is a cloud based credit card vault</a> that allows you to work with one or multiple payment gateways over time or simultaneously, and has published some pretty interesting <a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/">analysis of failed transaction rates across multiple payment gateways</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/spreedly/spreedly-success-failure-stats.png" border="0" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'll let you head over to Spreedly to <a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/">read the analysis</a>.  What I find interesting is that they are open to sharing this data with the public.  This type of information sharing by API aggregator providers is critical to the overall health of the space. I'm often frustrated by the lack of data that API providers share, because they so often are keeping their cards so close to their chest, trying to protect their valuable business data or often lack of business data.</p>
<p>There is huge opportunity for API aggregators to share information about their experience with the common APIs they integrate and aggregate with.  The whole industry can learn from this, but also work its way back upstream to the payment API providers, providing them with insight into how their APIs are operating, but also provide benchmarks of where they stand with their competitors, good or bad.</p>
<p>Let me know if you see any other examples of API aggregators sharing data like <a href="http://spreedly.com" title="Payment API Aggregator">Spreedly</a>.</p>

<p>After looking through the list of folks who have RSVP'd for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/">DFW API Professionals Meetup in Dallas tomorrow night</a>, it looks like an interesting mix of tech and business folk.  The tech group is definitely the larger, with a mix of mobile, web and enterprise.  The business folks look like a mix of VC, project manager, marketing and startups.</p>
<p>I'm heading out to Dallas in the morning, and I am spending my afternoon preparing my talk.  When it comes to meetups, I like to wait until the last moment, see who has RSVP'd and shift my talk to being more tech, more business or more API 101 depending on the audience.   I like the mix of people I'm seeing RSVP'd for tomorrow night.</p>
<p>I'm pulling together a talk from some of my regular material, but updating for what is going on right now.  Resulting in the following outline I'm calling, "From ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld":</p>

<p>As I'm monitoring the API space I'm trying to create meaningful grouping for companies to belong when tracking API trends.  My groupings are sometimes in alignment with what we hear in the tech blogosophere, but other times I try new definitions to help expand my monitoring definition and see if I can identify emerging patterns like I'm seeing with <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com" title="Backend as a Service">BaaS</a>.</p>
<p>Each week I do a little more exploration in concept of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com" title="API aggregation">API aggregation</a>, and this week after <a href="/2013/05/13/potential-for-api-aggregators-to-provide-valuable-industry-data/">studying payment API aggregator Spreedly</a>, I'm considering adding a new, overlapping area with aggregation, called API brokers.  Let's see if I can make this work.</p>
<p>API aggregators like <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> are providing personal data access to popular SaaS platforms by aggregating APIs.  You can pull a list of photos from Singly, for a user, and it could pull photos from Flickr, Instagram and Facebook.  This is pretty straightforward API Aggregation.</p>
<p>Other providers like <a href="http://temboo.com" title="Temboo">Temboo</a>, provide this functionality but focus more on the API interoperability or as i call it <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com" title="API reciprocity">API reciprocity</a> side of things.  Temboo does aggregate multiple APIs like Singly, but focuses on providing interoperability as well as aggregation.  While Singly does to, there are differences in their approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly</a> has all the telltale signs of an API aggregator.  They allow you to program against 48 payment gateways in 71 countries.  It has aggregation, but rather than interoperability it seems to be about brokering transactions.  Spreedly can help you choose the gateway based upon location, cost and availability.  Which has all the elements of what I'd consider an API broker.</p>
<p>I envision other new API brokers emerging, in niche areas like images, video or messaging.  Imagine if you could use Twilio, Tropo or other SMS API provider, but use through a broker who will give you the best availability and costs based upon various needs.  This type of API aggregation is not meant for providing users with access to multiple cloud silos via APIs, it is more about brokering API resources and establishing a marketplace.</p>
<p>Not all APIs can be brokered, and maybe Spreedly is unique, but I bet I will find more of this behavior from other companies, once I start looking.  Let me know if you know of any companies who broker API resources in a similar way to Spreedly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restful-labs/restful-labs-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Curently I'm immersed in discovering, vetting and tracking on signals that show me which companies are trending in the API space.  I'm looking for signals that will tell me which companies are making movements on a week to week basis, and when the blogosphere and developer communities are buzzing about these companies and technologies.</p>
<p>Three very important signals I use are blogs, twitter and Github.  These tools provide me with great signals I can use to tune into what a company is doing, when they push code, write a story or tweet about it.  They also provide me with signals of when developers are engaging with API owners, because they follow on Twitter and download, fork, favorite and follow Github repositories.</p>
<p>However, in some scenarios a companies blogs, twitter and Github accounts can also tell me when a company has given up and has run out of money or just stopped putting energy and resources into a project.  An example of this is with a company I came across during my monitoring last week, called <a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank">RESTful Labs</a>. RESTful Labs has all the eye candy to draw me in.  I mean they have REST in their name, and they build tools for developers!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restful-labs/restful-metrics.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>RESTful Labs provides API analytics tools for developers.  I'm pretty stoked anytime I find something like this, then I immediately look at the common signals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Check! - Last blog posted 11 months ago</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Check! - Last Tweet 8 months ago</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Check! - Last commit was 8 months ago</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface, RESTful Labs has all the right signal generators in having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts.  But immediately these signals start working against them, rather than the positive signals I would normally gather from someone having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts.</p>
<p>It is clear that RESTful Labs WAS something last year, but now it is all but a ghost town.  It is not a tool I will recommend anyone use because there is nobody home to support.  Since they have a Github account, there might be resources that can be picked from the bones of the startup, but not much else beyond that.</p>
<p>I keep companies like this in my database, as I want live examples like this to show people, and help them understand how to send the right signals that they are doing good things in the space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2013</span>
        <p>Does anyone else notice the evolution of the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter developer area</a>? The site has taken a page from the LinkedIn playbook and become more about embeddable buttons, badges and widgets than about APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-homepage-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Granted, you can click on documentation and get at the REST API v 1.1. &nbsp;I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing. &nbsp;I'm a big supporter of embeddable strategies for API providers. I think that evolution is very telling of Twitter's API strategy and what type of "developer" they want to support with the API.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with Twitter's overall API strategy, there is a lot to learn from their approach to API driven embeddable tools. &nbsp;I will produce more pieces aobut their approach to cards, timelines, buttons and other embeddable tools.</p>

<p>I've been working on expanding the amount of research and writing I can do via API Evangelist lately.  In the last couple weeks I rolled out new projects in three areas: <a title="API Toolkits" href="/2013/04/27/evolving-beyond-api-service-providers-and-api-tools-to-goal-based-api-toolkits/">API Toolkits</a>, <a href="/2013/04/28/api-trends/">API Trends</a>, <a title="API Priorities" href="/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a>.  This new approach is helping me focus on the areas I think are most important or exciting to the API space and generate as much, high quality news, analysis and white papers for the API space as I can.</p>
<p>The first of my white papers, using my new approach is finished.  The new paper is called <a title="Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space" href="https://apps.facebook.com/marketpage/mu07n26dfwwupqoy6k0xj/item/MWP6Hfn" target="_blank">Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space</a>, and is the aggregation of all my research into the BaaS space.   Here is a breakdown of the white paper:</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/xero/xero-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank">Accounting API platform Xero</a> has been taking a deeper look into the languages that their developers are using when integrating with the Xero API. Currently there are 1,600 active applications communicating with the Xero API, from a mix of Xero add-on partners to custom integrations engineered by 3rd party developers. &nbsp;But which programming languages were they using?</p>
<p>To create a snapshot of what tools developers are using, Xero needed to find the best source to obtain this data. Xero doesn't ask developers which platform they use upon registration, and since Xero doesn't require any sort of user agent or other identifying signature, it was difficult to know where to best acquire the data they needed.</p>
<p>The next best place to look for this data, is with the code samples themselves.  It would be nice, if Xero code samples were hosted using Github where they could track downloads, forks, followers, etc.  But the best they had, was the page views from the pages for each code library, within the Xero developer area.</p>
<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/xero/xero-2013-usage-chart.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using this approach, Xero was able to extract some pretty interesting data about which programming languages developers were clicking on.  Identifying the growing dominance of languages like PHP and the emergence of newer approaches using Node.js.</p>
<p>While Xero was able to learn a lot, I think we all should learn from Xero's story. There is a lot to be learned by other API providers: 1) API integration needs to be language agnostic 2) Working to understand which languages are beings used or in demand from developers, on a regular basis is important.</p>
<p>This seems like a pretty basic topic to some of us, but when an API is born out of a company that has a single language focus, it can be difficult to understand the needs of developers who are using other platforms and languages.</p>
<p>Make sure you prepare an approach to gathering and regularly evaluating data around which languages your API developers are needing to integrate ad work to support that as much as you possibly can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/api-billionaires-club.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the API space, we have to be constantly measuring and looking for signals that will help us understand where we should be focusing our resources, as part of an overall strategy.  One of the ways we measure value within the world of APIs (and business) is using KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators. Using KPIs we strive to measure the Return on our Investment (ROI), as we gamble with the technology, business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>One approach to quantifying the value, that has emerged from API providers, API service providers and the tech blogosphere is using the "API call". It is simple. You launch an API, so you quantify it by the number of times someone calls it.  Kind of like a page view, right?</p>
<p>Out of this eyeball derived reality(which is silly since APIs aren't for humans), the API space has become obsessed with the number of API calls, resulting in what is known as the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/">API billionaires club</a>.  The Billionaires Club is an elite group of tech providers who have billions of calls per month on their API.  It is a pretty simple algorithm. Have API + Have Billions of Requests = Your In The Billionaires Club. And if you are in the billionaires club, you are successful. &nbsp;End of calculation.</p>
<p>To quickly get to the point of my story, let's take one of my favorite members of the API billionaires club, Netflix. &nbsp;Billionaire Club Membership + Shutting Down Public API = Success. It is a different variation on the whole concept of measuring API success. The news, commonly held KPIs and definition of success doesn't immediately pan out in the whole Netflix story.</p>
<p>Netflix, along with Twitter are both &nbsp;API case studies for the history books. Both of these API stories reflect the ups and downs of the API world, and the often bipolar nature of the public API ecosystem and schizophrenic nature of the tech blogosophere.  In contrast, along with Amazon Web Services, Twitter and Twilio, Netflix is a constant player in the stories I tell about success in the API sector. But at the same time, Netflix is considered to be a failure by common public APIs measurements. Are you feeling the crazy? &nbsp;I do!!</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-square.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I've <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">covered before</a>, the blogosphere tends to associate closure of the Netflix, with the ecosystem failures of Twitter.  While this is an easy comparison to make, when you look further, you see a lot more going on. &nbsp;Which tells me we need better ways to measure API success and failure and tell the stories around the ups and downs.</p>
<p>After monitoring the API space for some time now, I'm looking for signals beyond what normal bloggers, analysts and pundits are following. In this hunt, Github is becoming an ever increasing gold mine of signals. &nbsp;To help demonstrate, let's take a look at the signals the <a href="https://github.com/netflix">Netflix Github account</a> puts out.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Priam">Priam</a></strong> - Co-Process for backup/recovery, Token Management, and Centralized Configuration management for Cassandra. (Last updated a day ago)</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/archaius">archaius</a></strong> - Library for configuration management API (Last updated 17 days ago)</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pulled this data, several days ago, there are 15 separate repositories, in four separate programming languages, including Python, Java, Groovy, Scala, that have all been updated in the last 30 days. &nbsp;The fact that Netflix has a Github account, has open sourced so much of their code, while also actively maintaining it all, point at some very meaningful signals that we can tune into and work to emulate.</p>
<p>While the number of calls against an API is a valid KPI to measure the potential success of an API, we have to have multiple KPIs when truly trying to understand the value of a company, the platform or any single API resource. &nbsp;Let's not get hung up on any single KPI, let's consider as many as we can--to see what makes sense and truly defines succcess.</p>
<p>There is so much to learn from reading between the lines in the world of APIs.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Internet of Things, APIs have a bright future. I tend to focus on the greater good when showcasing APIs, but occasionally I get tripped up by the market potential of APIs. I came across the <a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/baby-toys-get-an-app-extension/">Baby Toys Get an App Extension</a> post in the New York Times this week, and I can't think of a more lucrative market for API interaction via a smart phone, than a baby or toddler's toys.</p>
<p>First, can you image every mom or dad in America with access to their kids toys via their iPhone.  Talk about an emotional connection.  You have a real-time chord that is attached to a parents heart string.  So if you are at work, missing your child that is at home, in day care, or even when you are at home with them, you have the opportunity to interact with your child via their crib, playstation or other toy? I'm not even going to start profiling the toys and the opportunity here.</p>
<p>Second, can you imagine the data available for toy, clothing and other manufacturers?  You have a daily, permanent connection between a parent and their child via the toys that are most important to a child each day, and by default, what is important to the parent.  With API connectivity between this toy and a parents smart phone via the home wifi connection, there is an unlimited flow of data about what impacts a child's life, and their parents world each day.</p>
<p>As the connection between APIs and the Internet of Things comes into focus for me, I get excited about opportunities like connecting our children's worlds to our smart phone enabled worlds.  Then as soon as I get excited, I immediately get freaked out.  Think about the opportunity, for&hellip;well, exploitation.  We need to make sure there are best practices for terms of use, privacy and security in these fascinating, and new possibilities within the API space.</p>
<p>Lots to think about with APIs and the Internet of Things.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 May 2013</span>
        <p>BaaS stacks have the potential to be the operating of the next generation of computing. BaaS has a lot of the characteristics of what we have historically defined as an OS, but tailored for apps that run on devices and in the clouds vs the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows OS -&nbsp;</strong>Think of what the Windows operating system did for computing. It brought together a meaningful stack of resources into a single stack that could be installed on the new world of personal computers (PC). &nbsp;Windows provided application developers with a single platform they could build apps, targeting PC users. &nbsp;Windows provided a basic set of API resources developers could use, but ultimately it was open for the ecosystem to innovate in any business sector they desired.</li>
<li><strong>Server OS -&nbsp;</strong>When it comes to the server, many developers have migrated from desktop to web via Windows server operating systems. &nbsp;While to others they think of other OS flavors like Linux, BSD. &nbsp;These server environments provide developers with a base operating system for interfacing with user management, file system, database access and other libraries or APIs to develop either server side, network or web applications. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) -&nbsp;</strong>Cloud providers have moved the OS into the clouds--enabling developers to build at three different levels, providing a base OS, with set of often API driven resources for delivering site and apps to end users. &nbsp;The operating system has moved onto the world wide web, allowing for an entirely different approach to application development, usage and monetization.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualized BaaS OS -&nbsp;</strong>BaaS isn't just a new type of business. &nbsp;BaaS is a new way to deliver operating systems tailored for mobile and the next generation of devices, sensors and the Internet of Things. &nbsp;BaaS delivers the compute, storage, messaging and other essential OS features, while also bringing together other, potentially distributed resources in a single meaningful system for mobile developers to operate on and provide a meaningful experience for their users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using BaaS, providers can deliver virtualized operating system stacks, for general purposes, much like Windows has served for decades or deliver specialized operating systems meant specifically for telco or healthcare. &nbsp;Imagine virtualized OS stacks that could be delivered to support fixed installations like the energy grid or telco installations, all the way to temporary, high demand situations like disaster recovery or large scale events.</p>
<p>BaaS will allow us to keep much of the potential delivered by a hardened set of resources we become accustomed to with desktop and server OS's, but also realize the agility and flexibility that is delivered by loosely coupled, individual API resources. &nbsp;Allowing for a new approach to app design, development, deployment and life-cycle management that is much more organic and alive.</p>

        <p>BaaS is an evolution. &nbsp;Its not a revolution, gamer changer or ground breaking new technology. &nbsp;It is a logical response to the demand for mobile applications and how to logically bring together individual API driven resources into a loosely couple stack, that will allow mobile developers to build apps more efficiently.</p>
<p>If we do this right, we can meet the demand of our growing need for apps on our mobile and tablet devices as well as the backend compute resources needed for the other areas of the growing, Internet connected world.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 May 2013</span>
        <p>As BaaS evolves, we are seeing the huge investment from numerous start-ups, as well as grabbing the attention of a handful of larger tech companies, but we are also seeing the first signs of major investment in the space. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Acquisition of Parse -&nbsp;</strong>Facebook recently acquired on of the top BaaS providers in the space, Parse. &nbsp;While there has been rumors swirling around the tech space for some time, regarding Facebook's desires to manufacture their own mobile device and possibly their own mobile operating system to rival iOS and Android, the Parse acquisition seems a little closer to reality. Facebook's investment in the BaaS space acknowledges that mobile dominance won't always be about device dominance, and the potential of well tuned, meaningful, virtualized stacks of resources for mobile developers. &nbsp;Facebook is looking to invest in mobile and BaaS represents that path forward. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Intel Investment in BaaS -&nbsp;</strong>In the same timeline as the Parse acquisition, &nbsp;BaaS platform FeedHenry announces a 9M investment from Intel Capital--showing more investment in mobile by the chip-maker. &nbsp;Revealing more of the mobile aspirations of Intel, the chip-maker recently announced the acquisition of enterprise mobile service provider Aeopona.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Lucent Mobile Acquisition of Proxomo </strong>-&nbsp;Lucent Mobile, Inc. reached a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Proxomo Software, Inc., a BaaS provider. As part of the transaction, Lucent Mobile, Inc. a private investor-backed company will operate going forward under the Proxomo name.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a small slice of the investment going on in the space. &nbsp;To understand the market opportunity, white papers such as the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/baas.asp">report&nbsp;published</a><span>&nbsp;by&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/">MarketsandMarkets</a><span>.</span> will provide that, but to understand the innovation opportunity, much more experimentation and research needs to occur on exactly what resources current developers are needing to truly be successful.</p>
<p>The research and development environment for the future of API resources will play out within the BaaS industry, through the efforts of small start-ups as well as from the major tech companies.</p>

        <p>The definition of what is a BaaS provider has not just an evolving meaning, but also means different things to different people. API Evangelist is looking to help define the space, and formulate a way for discovering new providers, while defining the different types of existing providers, potentially establishing a harder definition for BaaS.</p>
<p>When it comes to BaaS there are a handful of clear leaders who are dominating the space. &nbsp;These leading BaaS providers are delivering the features that developers are demanding, while also working define the best of breed services that are leading the space in new directions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After reviewing the space, monitoring the blogging and tweet volume of each provider, their activity on Github as well as references to them in top blogs like TechCrunch and GigaOM, and discussion about them on Reddit and Hacker News, it is easy to identify the leaders. &nbsp;Because of their own efforts, but also the conversations of analysts and developers, a pattern for BaaS success begins to emerge.</p>

        <p>While there are clearly leaders in the BaaS movement, there are 37 other companies working to make their mark on the space and serve the mobile app developer community. Each of these providers have their own approach to delivering their BaaS stack, but many are emulating the successful patterns of the BaaS pioneers.</p>
<p>Some BaaS providers are looking to enable mobile developers to build cross-platform apps on any device in any business sector. &nbsp;While other are looking to serve a niche like gaming or focus exclusively on strengthening the marketing efforts of companies via this fast growing world of consumer devices. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>Unless you are a BaaS provider or a mobile application developer, the linkage between BaaS and APIs may not be immediately clear. But once you study the space, you quickly notice that APIs are the heart of BaaS, providing platforms with the flexibility and resources they need to meet mobile developers needs.</p>
<p>BaaS and APIs are working together in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native BaaS APIs </strong>- Each BaaS provider offers up a default set of REST APIs for manipulating core data and object stores, providing programmatical access to almost every part of the BaaS platform</li>
<li><strong>Custom APIs</strong> - Most BaaS providers allow for the design, deployment and configuration of custom REST APIs from data an objects defined via the system. Turning many BaaS platforms into API deployment frameworks, opening up a whole new channel for development</li>
<li><strong>Deploy BaaS Platforms&nbsp;</strong>- The growth in number of APIs resources, coupled with the BaaS movement opens up the opportunity for new providers to step up and deliver BaaS stacks, using their own API resources, bundled 3rd party APIs or a combination of the two.</li>
<li><strong>An API Blueprint</strong> - The patterns that are emerging among BaaS providers provide an excellent blueprint of what types of API resources mobile developers are demanding. &nbsp;Closely watching the BaaS space has potential to provide a blueprint of what API resources are in demand, which aren't and potential opportunities for new API resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>BaaS is a natural progression of APIs from single uses to meaningful stacks of resources for developers. As the number of APIs a developer might use in an app grew from 1 or 2, to potentially 10 separate APIs, the need for aggregation and consolidation of resources grew as well. &nbsp;Mobile app developers don't have time or resources to maintain infrastructure as well as discover, qualify, integrate and maintain relationships with 10 separate API providers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs have helped identify and make available essential resources developers depend on like compute, storage, messaging and authentication, and within the BaaS framework, the next generation of essential API resources are being identified like geo, voice, targeting, friends and virtual commerce. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a danger that BaaS will move us back to more rigid, platform approaches to application development, but BaaS has the potential to be a kind elastic glue, that will bring together authentication and other essential resources into a permanent or temporary, but meaningful stack for developers to put to use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>API calls and passing on cloud storage costs are the most common ways to approach BaaS pricing. &nbsp;But beyond these two areas, there are numerous other ways BaaS providers are pricing BaaS services for developers.</p>
<p>With mobile app users being the center of the world in mobile app development, it makes a per user charge charge for BaaS services seem logical. A per user fee, potentially couples a BaaS provider monetization strategy with their developers. &nbsp;In this approach a provider may assume their developers will be monetization each end-user of their platform, thus can afford to pay more as they add users.</p>
<p>Other BaaS providers state that charging developers based upon API calls and number of active uses results in a kind of success tax. &nbsp;Meaning the more successful your app is, the more active users and API calls you will have, equally a significantly larger BaaS bill. &nbsp;There is still a lot of open discussion around this point.</p>
<p>BaaS pricing is far from standardized. &nbsp;It is much more a reflection of the IaaS layer beneath the BaaS providers than it is about the end users of the platforms. However there is a lot of experimentation going on in Baas, resulting in numerous other approaches to pricing across 45 BaaS providers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> doesn't focus on market or investment opportunities. I keep an eye out for product and innovation opportunities, which are a much different beast. These represent places where there are gaps in the delivery of API driven resources that developers will need to deliver the generation of not just apps, but compute.</p>
<p>There are numerous opportunities for innovation within the umbrella that is being defined as BaaS in the areas that are obvious and fast growing in market spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile -&nbsp;</strong>We are 2-3 years into the solid growth of the mobile smartphone market. &nbsp;This is nothing new. &nbsp;But with the adoption rate, the hype and the potential within emerging markets, we can ignore the opportunity within the mobile sphere. As the demand for mobile apps grow, the demand for efficiencies in mobile app development will grow exponentially. If a business can efficiently go to market with steady flow of high quality apps designed for web, mobile and a wide variety of mobile platforms, it will succeed in the current space</li>
<li><strong>Tablets -&nbsp;</strong>Tablets are displacing the desktop, and even laptop computers. The world of developing apps for mobile is rapidly morphing into a blurry world of hundreds of different devices from iOS to Android. &nbsp;There is a lot of potential for delivering BaaS platforms that focus specifically on the needs of emerging tablet devices across manufacturers</li>
<li><strong>Readers -</strong>Devices are blurring the lines between phone, tablet and dumb terminals. Across the publishing industry, from providers like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Nobles, we are seeing reader devices like the Kindle and Nook. &nbsp;As we see publishing applications like Flipboard and Zite find an audience we will see a growth in demand for backend services that support reader and other consumption focused devices</li>
<li><strong>Niche -&nbsp;</strong>Most BaaS providers are about delivering a general purpose stack of resources, allowing developers to design, develop and deploy apps across any business sector. &nbsp;Among the current pool of BaaS providers there are already the emergence of niche or specialty platforms in the area of gaming, e-commerce and advertising. &nbsp;There is a lot of opportunity to deliver BaaS platforms that deliver specialized area such as education, finance, government or beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Transport -&nbsp;</strong>Technology is penetrating every aspect of our daily lives. Automobiles are becoming a platform for digital deliver, with auto companies like Ford and GM getting into the API game. BaaS is a universal backend platform that can be tailored to any implementation. &nbsp;Our vehicles will have very different requirements if we are a soccer mom or a fleet of delivery vehicles in NYC. Lots of opportunities to understand the world of BaaS in the service of transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Things -&nbsp;</strong>The Internet of Things is the catch all bucket for "everything else" in the world of Internet enabled devices. &nbsp;We put everything from quantified self and 3D printing to smart grid technology into the Internet of Things bucket. &nbsp;This is the biggest, yet to be fully explored opportunity in BaaS. &nbsp;With the special needs of the power grid or public water supply it only makes sense there would be backends dedicated to each sector. &nbsp;This leaves a whole world of opportunity and speculation within the Internet of Things.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to delivering a precise, meaningful backend that drives technology, there will be unlimited opportunities for new platforms. &nbsp;When you view BaaS as a relevant stack of valuable API resources, bundled with a sensible business model, the model can be applied into many business sectors.</p>
<p>Beyond just mobile, tablets, readers and niche opportunity, once the world of Internet of Things expands, the opportunity for BaaS to connect our physical worlds to our virtual worlds will be unlimited.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>After reviewing the top BaaS providers like Appcelerator, Appery.io Kinvey, Parse and StackMob, a pattern of building blocks begin to emerge. Building blocks that BaaS providers are using to assemble their platforms into meaningful stacks that developers can put to use. &nbsp;While each BaaS provider has their own approach, a handful of common building blocks emerge, allowing a coherent definition of what is a BaaS provider to emerge.</p>
<p>Using this list of common building blocks I looked to find other companies that offer similar backend services, resulting in the discovery of 45 total BaaS providers. After reviewing each BaaS provider, each feature of their offering was entered into a database--uncovering a common blueprint, of which building blocks mobile developers are seeking.</p>
<p>Over 200 building blocks have been identified in over 40 areas, across 45 BaaS providers. 37 building blocks in over 18 areas have been identified as common between at least 3 providers before they are included within my common BaaS blueprint.</p>
<p>This common BaaS blueprint represents one potential blueprint for using APIs, that are just not about consuming single API for a mobile app, but aggregating them to improve the overall delivery, management and life-cycle of mobile applications.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>The approaches to BaaS pricing are still evolving. &nbsp;Most of the providers have gone with an API call or storage cost approach to pricing, but there still is much debate about just which pricing model is most beneficial to developers and will ensure BaaS providers are profitable.</p>
<p>The struggle in BaaS pricing reflects a struggle between BaaS platform providers covering their costs, while generating a profit for investor,s and the demands of developers who are often needing to start with a freemium tier, but may have radically different needs once their applications are in production, serving potentially hundreds or thousands of users.</p>
<p>Today, you see most BaaS providers pricing reflect the platform in which they are built on. &nbsp;Many of the current BaaS providers operate on Amazon Web Services, so the BaaS pricing is currently reflecting their upfront platform costs, compute and storage.</p>

        <p>The mobile app development space has grown into such an opportunity, it has begun to attract the attention of some of the heaviest hitters in the API space, Amazon Web Services, SalesForce and RackSpace.</p>

<h1>Backend as a Service</h1>
<p>There is an emerging trend in mobile application development, that people are calling backend as a service (BaaS), also known sometimes known as mobile backend as a service (MBaaS). With the growth in the number of mobile devices like iPhone from Apple, Android from Google, Windows Phones from Microsoft and the historic contender Blackberry, a number of BaaS providers are emerging to meet the demand for building, deploying and managing the mobile app life-cycle.</p>
<p><strong>What is BaaS?</strong></p>
<p>BaaS is an approach for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to connect their applications to backend cloud storage and processing while also providing common features such as user management, push notifications, social networking integration, and other features that mobile users demand from their apps these days.</p>
<p>This new breed of BaaS services are provided via custom software development kits (SDK) and application programming interfaces (APIs). BaaS is a relatively recent development in cloud computing, with most BaaS start-ups dating from 2011 or later. The global BaaS market is&nbsp;estimated to grow from $216.5 million in 2012 to $7.7 billion in 2017 from a <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/baas.asp">report&nbsp;published</a> by <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com">MarketsandMarkets</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How Does BaaS Differ From IaaS and PaaS?</strong></p>
<p>Baas has evolved out of frustration around deployment of IaaS platforms like Amazon Web Services, just to fire up a single new mobile application--accompanied with the fact that the traditional PaaS offerings have not stayed on top of what is needed for mobile developers. BaaS is about abstracting away the complexities of launching and managing your own infrastructure, then bridging a stack of meaningful resources targeting exactly what developers need to build the next generation of mobile apps.</p>
<p>BaaS, has a lot of the same intent as PaaS, to speed up the application development process, but BaaS is purely a backend, providing an infrastructure that automatically scales and optimizes, bundled with a set of essential resources developers require, like content, data, messaging tools and all best 3rd party, API driven services they are used to like Facebook, Twitter and Dropbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Are The Benefits of <strong>BaaS</strong>?</strong></p>
<p>BaaS is all about making developers lives easier. BaaS is born out of a shortage of mobile developer talent and an overwhelming demand for high quality mobile apps, not just on iOS, but across Android, Windows and Blackberry devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>BaaS Delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency Gains</strong> - Reducing overhead in all aspects of mobile app development, increasing efficiency at all stages of development</li>
<li><strong>Faster Times to Market </strong>- Reducing the obstacles to take a mobile app from idea to production and overhead with operations once in production</li>
<li><strong>App Delivery With Fewer Resources</strong> - BaaS supports development with fewer developers and supporting data and IT resources</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for Mobile and Tablets</strong> - BaaS providers have put a lot of time and resources into optimization of data and network for mobile apps, and reduce fragmentation problems across multiple platforms and devices.</li>
<li><strong>Secure and Scalable Infrastructure </strong>- BaaS provides a bundled infrastructure that deals with scalability, security, performance and other operational headaches, leaving developers to do what they do best</li>
<li><strong>Stack of Common API resources</strong> - BaaS brings common and essential 3rd party API resources into a single stack, preventing developers from having to go gather them separately</li>
</ul>
<p>BaaS tends to reflect what is consider to be a no-ops development environment that allows companies and developers focus just on building the best applications with the most unique feature set. &nbsp;All of the infrastructure deployment and management that is historically associated with developing applications is abstracted away into a single backend platform.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Build With BaaS?</strong></p>
<p>While BaaS is primarily focused on mobile application development, the approach has characteristics that can easily be used across multiple areas of development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Development</strong> - While BaaS is focused on mobile application development, it provides a much more flexible approach to development web applications. It provides all the opportunity of PaaS, with less interface restrictions, just a meaningful stack of resources to build &nbsp;variety of web apps.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Apps</strong> - BaaS is designed with developing mobile apps in mind. &nbsp;BaaS providers are focusing on optimizing data for mobile, bringing together essential resources like geo-location, social, places and other critical elements of mobile apps.</li>
<li><strong>Readers -</strong> Publishing to Kindle and other devices that are intended to support the world of book and magazine publishing. &nbsp;Devices like Kindle, Nook and other healthcare or education specific devices are emerging and being driven by BaaS</li>
<li><strong>Launch APIs </strong>- BaaS platforms provide easy to deploy API frameworks as part of their data and object stores. BaaS provides a quick way to launch APIs and other infrastructure around data and resources, potentially making it available to mobile or web developers</li>
</ul>
<p>What is possible with BaaS varies depending on the platform provider, but we are starting to see some common building blocks emerge from the 40+ BaaS providers on the landscape currently.</p>
<p>BaaS is a natural response to software development being moved into the cloud, and the decoupling of common resources into individual APIs. &nbsp;In 2013 we know we need our platforms to perform and scale in the cloud, while bringing the resources we depend on into meaningful sets that we can efficiently build apps around, without having to go gather them from around the web.</p>

<p>I sent three emails this morning to people, explaining what it is that I do and how they can get involved. This process reminded me that I need to do the same here via the blog on a regular basis, to help people understand what API Evangelist is, and my vision for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite popular belief I do not evangelize any single API to developers, my role (self-appointed) is to evangelize <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> APIs to the masses, most importantly beyond the developer community--penetrating business, marketing and other key groups.</p>
<p>At API Evangelist I monitor the entire API space. To do this I track on 2000 of the best of the APIs out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've gone through the entire <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb Directory</a> and hand pick the ones that are worth paying attention to, and I continue doing this in real-time as they are added. Its not that the rest aren't worthy of use, just not an approach I feel is worth showcasing to other API owners.</p>
<p>700+ of these APIs have blogs, 1000+ have Twitter accounts and many have Github accounts. I monitor all in real time. I also track on 250+ blog feeds from mainstream tech blogs (TC, Gigaom, etc) as well as lesser known feeds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I watch all this in real-time and tag everything using a centralized system I've developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I derive my blog posts and generate what I call my&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/"><span class="s1">API Stack</span></a>. The API Stack isn't meant to be a definitive list of who are the best, in a single order, but a living stack of which APIs are worth paying attention to, and are doing innovative things on a week to week basis.</p>
<p>I generate The API Stack using my home grown ranking system which is based upon 3 types of signals:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;- Number of blog posts, tweets, github repos and other internal activity from the APIs themselves</li>
<li><strong>External -</strong>&nbsp;@mentions of twitter, stack exchange, hacker news, tech blogosopher, github repo follwers and activity</li>
<li><strong>Analsyst -</strong>&nbsp;My curation, flagging w/ notes, voting up and writing stories about an API or company</li>
</ul>
<p>From all of this weekly process I have carved several areas I focus deeper on:</p>

<p>These areas will evolve and grow as my research continues and the space changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;From all of this research I produce short form analysis (blog posts, project sites) and long form content (whitepapers, books).&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep things simple I provide a single standard monthly subscription to partners wishing to access of all this for $1500.00 / month.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li class="li4"><strong>Writing&nbsp;</strong>- Access to all of my long form content.&nbsp;&nbsp;White papers, research, etc.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Data</strong>&nbsp;- I generate a lot of data exhaust tracking, ranking and curating the API space.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have JSON data available across all aspects of my work.</li>

<li class="li4"><strong>Weekly / Monthly Summary -</strong>&nbsp;I produce a weekly and monthly summary of the top APIs and industries, with curated news and my analysis from the API industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>This monthly subscription provides access to all research, data and writing I produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm willing to negotiate other relationships, but this helps me keep a nice pool of clients, and me knowing I'll be in operation next month.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps me focused on research and not chasing new customers all the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes I also do specific industry research looking for patterns and opportunities as well going deeper by targeting specific APIs, like Twitter or Twillio, but I try to keep targeted research feeding into my overall pool of industry data, providing value to the bigger picture and overall space.</p>

<p>I am tracking on 2000 APIs that I have deemed worthy enough to pay attention, out of the 9000 on <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, 13,000 in <a href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and numerous APIs in <a href="http://mashape.com">Mashape's marketplace</a>.  In addition to these APIs, I'm also closely watching <a title="backend as a service providers" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">30+ backend as a service providers</a>, <a title="reciprocity providers" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">20+ reciprocity providers</a> and emerging big data, analysis, visualization and other emerging platforms who are using APIs in new ways.</p>
<p>I was reading some of the great research coming out of <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>, which is a "Open-Source, Web-Based, Framework for Integrating Applications with Cloud-based Services and Personal Cloudlets"--specifically the post on <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/openi-api-framework-part-i-studying-the-landscape-of-cloud-based-services/">OpenI API Framework: Studying the Landscape of Cloud-Based Services</a>.</p>
<p>What is great about OPENi, is they are doing all this research and planning, and sharing the process with everyone publicly.  Which is great for everyone, but will take some time to play out, as they study, plan and execute in the space.</p>
<p>As I watch aggregate API providers like <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> plow forward and reciprocity providers like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> deliver some amazing integrations, using APIs, and bridging some of the most meaningful cloud platforms in our world--I can't help but think about how much redundant work is going on amongst startups.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/openi-api-framework-part-i-studying-the-landscape-of-cloud-based-services/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/OPENi-Blog-API1.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to the definitions of specific APIs, the nuances of their interface and authentication, each of these service providers is doing their own work, in a silo. In a perfect world, API providers would provide Swagger definitions, standard oAuth implementations, etc.  API owners would do a lot of the legwork for these providers. &nbsp;As we know, this isn't the reality, and each of these aggegrators, reciprocity providers, analytics tools are all mapping these API connections on their own.</p>
<p>I can't help but think about, how if providers stepped up, communicated with each other, they could establish some sort of commons for all of these API definitions to reside. &nbsp;They could colloaborately develop a way they could identify the meaningful APIs, hang Swagger definitions and code for connecting and authenticating in a multitude of programming languages.</p>
<p>Each provider could still maintain their secret sauce, what happens before and after each API connection, allowing them to have their own unique approach to API aggregation, reciprocity, analysis, visualization or real-time tools. But by sharing the API definitions and working together on the connections, they could spend more time on what makes their companies unique, rather than hand-rolling each API connection in isolation.</p>
<p>Just some random thoughts, as I navigate the world of APIs, from within my own silo!</p>

<p>Hey everyone.  I'm heading out to the Dallas-Fort Worth area the week after next, Tuesday, May 14, to kick off the <a title="DFW API Professional Meetup Group" href="http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/">DFW API Professionals Meetup</a>.</p>
<p><a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://therightapi.com">TheRightAPI</a>&nbsp;team were so kind to invite me out to speak, hang out and talk APIs, to help kick-off the area API group. Both&nbsp;<a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://therightapi.com">TheRightAPI</a>&nbsp;and backend as a service (BaaS) provider <a href="http://www.proxomo.com/">Proxomo</a> are sponsoring the shindig.</p>
<p>The group will be meeting at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=7000+Texas+161%2C+Irving%2C+TX">Microsoft Campus, 7000 Texas 161, Irving, TX</a>.  We are thinking we'll kick it off with food and drinks from 6:00 - 6:45 PM, and I'll start talking around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>After that we can just hang out and talk about APIs and see what all y'all are doing with APIs in Texas.  Ping me if your in the DFW area, so that I know you will be there.</p>
<p>Look forward to seeing you there and connecting.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/02/how-much-do-you-spend-attracting-and-supporting-freemium-api-developers/">How Much Do You Spend Attracting and Supporting Freemium API Developers?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 May 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/freemium-customers.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had a question from an API owner land in my inbox.  It is regarding the amount of attention and resources that should be spent on on-boarding new customers.  Directly from the email:</p>
<blockquote><em>How would you suggest companies place a quantifiable value on free API users?  I know that it is very important to have a lot of people use your API so that they can make great things with your API and also give people a chance to really understand the value of what the API offers, but do you have any thoughts on how companies should decide how much to spend on an API conversion (AdWords, Hackathons, etc.)</em></blockquote>
<p>Let's first address the freemium part of the question.  It is my opinion that every API should have a freemium layer.  But only as one part of a well planned developer incentive ladder.  This freemium tier is the top layer of your funnel.  It will provide a way for people to test drive your API, understand what it does and the value it can deliver in their world.</p>
<p>Your freemium layer should be easy to access, no billing required and provide a sensible access to your API resources--also your freemium tier should never appear as if it is in danger of going away. &nbsp;But freemium should be that first step, with clear, meaningful next steps towards on-boarding users as paid customers.  Provide clear paths to becoming a solid, revenue generating and contributing participant in the platform.</p>
<p>Make it clear to developers that at a freemium level they don't get support, that they have to pay to get that.  Don't let this tier of users dominate you.  With this said you better have good docs, code samples, active forum, FAQ and other essential building blocks for your self-service, freemium customers to use.  But the amount of resources dedicated to your freemium customers should be minimal.</p>
<p>In my opinion, your resources should go into supporting your paid tiers of customers, the one who fee your revenue model, communicate and provide feedback to your platform and deliver value to your platform and business--reciprocating the value you have provided them.  API ecosystems are a two-way street.</p>
<p>The second part of the question I think is regarding how much resources you should spend to attract developers into the top part of your funnel, potentially bringing them into your freemium tier, with hopes of quickly converting them into paid.  I have a different perspective on this than probably many other companies.  I'm a fan of organic campaigns vs. paid campaigns.</p>
<p>My approach to API Evangelism is about generating organic content that will help explain what an API does and the value it delivers.  I hack PHP, Python, Ruby or mobile projects against the API. I find problems to solve, that may reflect what my target audience is trying to solve.  I just don't think very many people are ever going to look for an API. They are going to be looking for a solution to their problem, and it may just be the solution your API provides.  So advertising and traditional marketing is harder to dial in.  I prefer identifying, coding, solving the problem and telling the story that speak to the customers I'm looking for.</p>
<p>The downside of an organic API evangelism campaign is it takes time to work.  It takes months before you see anything. It is a very SEO driven approach, but it is how I've built API Evangelist over 3 years.  Its lower cost than Google Adwords spend and hackathons, but takes someone with passion and domain expertise, mad programming skills and the ability to write stories, publish to Github and work social media like kung foo master--to execute!</p>
<p>The moral of the story is, that you should spend as little as you possibly can on bringing in developers into your funnel, and supporting them in operating at your freemium tier.  Don't let the freeloaders rule your world.  But this is easier said than done.  Its a lot of work to generate resources that will bring the right customer in the door, in an organic way, and it <a href="/2012/09/18/simple-api-developer-tracking-framework/">takes a lot of outreach to engage with the customers</a> you have in the door to develop a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">sensible developer and partner framework</a>.</p>
<p>I think I have several more stories to derive from this great question, so stay tuned.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://parse.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/parse-cloud.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I don't personally use <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a> or any other <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">backend as a service</a> (BaaS) provider to build mobile applications.  I'm just playing role as analyst when it comes to the backend as a service space, but I am a developer so I can tell when any technology provider is speaking to developers or just marketing and hock'n their wares.</p>
<p>Each week I monitor the tech blogosphere, the API space and where it has expanded into the backend as a service space and driving mobile development.  I pull 300 + feeds from random blogs and 700+ feeds from APIs providers.  I see the contrast between what Techrunch, GigaOm and NextWeb produce alongside what API and BaaS providers publish to their blogs.</p>
<p>Day after day you can really start smelling the bullshit. The positive side is that this high profile bullshit really makes good quality posts, that are actually about solving problems, stand out.</p>
<p>I see a lot of posts come out of BaaS providers, and day after day, Parse is producing high quality posts, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/04/29/versioning-and-verification-for-your-aws-security-group-configuration/">Versioning and Verification for your AWS Security Group Configuration</a> and <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/04/09/six-creative-ways-to-use-push-notification-marketing-in-your-mobile-app/">Six Creative Ways to Use Push Notification Marketing in Your Mobile App</a>.  When you read their blog, it is mostly posts that are about solving problems that developers are facing, and goes beyond just using Parse.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons Parse was an attractive investment for Facebook, but I think the Parse blog is a very positive signal that Parse is more than just about building a company for acquisition--Parse is building a platform that solves developers problems. Another important aspect of this, is they tell the story of how they do this in real-time. &nbsp;Without telling the story, you can be doing some amazing things and nobody will know about it--Parse gets this.</p>
<p>Another sign of Parse's conviction, is the blog post rhythm hasn't changed since the acquisition of Facebook. I get the feeling that I will continue showcasing Parse's approach, much like I have done with Twilio, because they just get it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-in-api-we-trust-trimmed.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>Listening to an episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a> yesterday, renewed a concept that John Sheehan(<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), founder of <a title="Runscope" href="https://www.runscope.com/signin?next=%2F">Runscope</a> made in an <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/03/12/apis-are-dead-long-live-apis/?fromcat=all">article he wrote for NextWeb back in March</a>. In the post, John walks us through his &ldquo;Three Commandments for Using Someone Else&rsquo;s API&rdquo;, which, after listening to him talk about his story on <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/post/46485798823/episode-8-im-going-to-withdraw-my-objection">Episode 8 of Traffic and Weather</a>, I couldn't stop thinking about commandment #2:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>An open API is a great way to test drive an integration, but it does not absolve you from the responsibility of building a relationship with the provider. If you can&rsquo;t reach someone, that should be all the reason you need not to use that API.</p>
<p>This commandment comes out of Johns unique experience which spans:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twilio - Experience managing large, successful developer ecosystem</li>
<li>IFTTT - Experience being consumer of not just one, but many APIs</li>
<li>Runscope - Providing tools that make API developers lives easier</li>
</ul>
<p>This experiences is what make John&rsquo;s perspective unique.  He doesn&rsquo;t just understand delivering APIs and managing developers, he knows what it is like to be a developer and consumer of APIs.  Which I think makes him either just the right balance or he&rsquo;s his own worst enemy, not sure--could be both.</p>
<p>Anyways, regarding John&rsquo;s commandment: <em>Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person</em>.  In the past I have put a lot of pressure on API providers to consider <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">different potential layers of their API ecosystem</a>, and work hard to have a consistent approach to communicating, supporting and engaging with your developer ecosystem.  While this all holds true, and API owners should focus on healthy developer outreach, it is a two sided coin, in which developers are accountable too.</p>
<p>The target audience for API Evangelist is API owners, so I guess my point is that as an API owner you have to craft a healthy communication and support framework, but also explain to developers when they sign up or are getting started, that while you&rsquo;ll work to support them, it is up to them to step up and meet you halfway.</p>
<p>In the hype fueled tech blogosphere it's easy to take sides, rather than actually discuss the nuances of API ecosystems, and give sustainable advice--something that only comes from domain experts like John Sheehan.</p>

<p>Some of the APIs they offer are pretty straightforward like MMS, SMS, Location and Speech. &nbsp;But the TV, Healthcare, Notary and even advertising seem like they are from a different planet. Which is a signal in itself I think.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T pops up on my radar a lot because of their presence at hackathons, and coverage in the blogosphere. &nbsp;I'd like to make more time to dissect AT&amp;T's approach to APIs from an outside perspective. I think there is a lot to learn from their strategy, both good and bad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>

To do this I monitor the best of the existing and new APis, using the blogosphere, Twitter, LinkedIn, Github and the open web looking for examples of how people are using APIs in different ways.</p>
<p>Currently I monitor the blogs of 804 API related companies and 205 blog feeds from other news and blog sources, as well as around 1000 API twitter accounts.  As I read and curate this every day, I tag items according to a process I've evolved over 3 years of operation.  Then at the end of each week I look at which tags are trending for the week, based upon what I've written and other news items I've curated along the way.</p>
<p>This is how I monitor trends.  When Is see a tag trending, and I feel the area is interesting or has potential, I tend to spin off the topic into its own trend area.  Now I can monitor it separately and potentially give it more attention, with the hope of finding new sources of information, companies and domain experts in this area.</p>
<p>I have done this with four main areas I've seen trending in 2013:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Aggregation</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Backend as a Service</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Reciprocity</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Realtime</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the areas I've had time to isolate and spin off into their own research projects.  I have a short list of other areas I will tackle very soon, including voice, data analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>None of these project areas are concrete.  They can change at any time, becoming entirely new areas or stay as it is, and since each project is its own Github repository, it can go idle, without any impact on the overall network--leaving it open for anyone else to use the data and content available within the project.</p>
<p>I will add new trending projects as I find them and have time, as well as add news, companies, APIs, tools, services and any analysis to existing project areas.</p>
