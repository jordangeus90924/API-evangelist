{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m always looking for new, relevant ideas to write blog posts on for the CityGrid Developer blog.I have several topics I write about regularly including new projects I’m working on, new releases around the API, and what I find during my local, mobile and social landscape analysis.However it can be hard to find topics to write about that are relevant to CityGrid developers, or publishers as we call them.To help write blog posts that are useful to my API community I started harvesting ideas and topics from actual forum posts from developers.Earlier today a publisher submitted a forum post stating their concerns about the age of some of the reviews they get along with businesses, when making requests against the CityGrid Places API.</p>
