<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2021/08/03/an-openapi-lifecycle-extension/"></a>I have been working to define the lifecycle of an OpenAPI defined API, and working establish a way to talk about, but also describe in a machine readable way the lifecycle of an API</a>. One of the reasons I joined Postman was to be able to get more hands on with much of my work on defining the API lifecycle. I wanted to stop just talking about it, and actually move to demonstrating it, and the Postman platform provides a great way to think through this, and to help me with this exercise I created this crude composition from the application to help me think through the lifecycle for each API.</p>
<p><img src="/images/openapi-lifecycle-1.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p><img src="/images/openapi-lifecycle-2.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>Postman capabilities for iterating upon an OpenAPI, but this visual snippets from across the application provide me with a range of capabilities that I can use to define the overall API lifecycle. These elements of the Postman API platform provide me with a range of ways to define the API lifecycle, but also provides me with the ability see what exists in the cracks or needs pulling out via the interface. Ultimately I am looking to nail down what a range of API definitions could be for the API lifecycle, and what a machine readable definition might be for helping us define this API lifecycle as part of an OpenAPI-defined API lifecycle. To help me leverage these Postman capabilities to do this, I extracted this key.</p>

<p>I have already identified a few capabilities that are missing through some preliminary work, but this provides me with a good way to root my API lifecycle work in our API platform which is used by 15M developers. The next part of my API lifecycle extension work is to iterate through all of the API lifecycle(s) people shared with me as part of my "what is your API lifecycle?" tweetstorm and story. Pushing the Postman platform, and our definition of what the API lifecycle is or isn't helps me harden some of these definitions, while making sure my extension can actually support what is happening. With that in mind, here are range of API lifecycle definitions where I have played bingo with using the Postman platform.</p>

<p>Whewww!! That was a lot of thinking about the API lifecycle, using these thirteen separate definitions of what an API lifecycle can be. It is an interesting exercise because of the different words we use, and how precise or broad we can be with how we describe the API lifecycle. I find it also interesting that the lifecycle continues so few mentions of versioning and maturity. However, that is why I am doing this exercise. The next step of this is to take what I've learned and go back to my API lifecycle extension and see what else I need to add in to accommodate all of these definitions of what an API lifecycle is. It was an interesting exercise because it pushed me to think about how the Postman API platform enables the API lifecycle, grounding and providing a hands-on way to make the API lifecycle more tangible for me, something that the API lifecycle extension further grounds for me.</p>
<p>This exercise really shows how important the API design portion of this process is, and it is how you set APIs in motion, but also how you iterate upon them. It also shows me how important observability is to not only the reliability of APIs, but also the overall API lifecycle. It also reinforced for me the role that the feedback loop plays in the API lifecycle. Taking all of this and then hammering on my OpenAPI API lifecycle extension is going to really interesting now. At first I was just going to have all of the technical building blocks of the API lifecycle along with maturity and change management, but now I see the important of the design process, observability, and feedback loop is to all of this. Once I get one more draft of the API lifecycle extension the next challenge will be getting folks understanding what the hell I am talking about so I can start putting more scaffolding in place to demonstrate the value of this type of definition for helping guide our APIs forward throughout their lives.</p>
