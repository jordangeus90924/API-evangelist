title: The API Timeline
width: small

I am perpetually captivated by how APIs have come to be. I have heard since I started talking about APIs that they've been around longer than I state in my history narrative or within blog posts. Honestly, if you see application as all about applying a concept or resource of some kind, then APIs go way back to even African drumming circles. Every once in a while I geta wild hair and scratch at this narrative, and this page reflects what I consider to be the API timeline.

I am also playing around with another view of this same landscape with [my resource timeline to look at API providers by the digital resources they provide](https://apievangelist.com/timeline-resource/). I have also begun studying the early regulation of the railroad, telecommunications, electiricity, and radio--[creating a timeline to help be understand how regulation unfolded for these industries](https://apievangelist.com/timeline-industry/), and why we pushed it forward.
