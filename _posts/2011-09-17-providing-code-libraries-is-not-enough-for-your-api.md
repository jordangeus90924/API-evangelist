{% include JB/setup %}<p>Code libraries have been a staple of open API communities for quite a few years now. API owners provide developers with working samples of code in a variety of programming languages, to get started working with an API. Sample code helps developer get up and running quicker, and increases the chances a developer will actually adopt an API.I was reviewing how Google approached the release of the Google+ API this week, and noticed their download section not only contained the usual code libraries, but also contain whats called starter projects. These starter projects provide a complete framework with everything you need to get start with OAuth, and to start building an application on top of the Google+ API.</p>
