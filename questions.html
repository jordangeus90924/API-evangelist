<h2>API Evangelist Questions</h2>

<p>There is a lot to learn when jumping into the API economy. Whether you are consuming APIs, providing APIs, or both, you will have lots of questions along the way.</p>
<p>My role in the API space is to help business and government leaders understand the potential of APIs, and find success in your efforts. With this in mind, I'm happy to answer questions.  There are a couple of ways to get your questions answered:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
    <li>Ping me via email at: <a href="mailto: info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a></li>
    <li>Tweet my way at: <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/apievangelist">@apievangelist</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The quickest way to get your questions answered is via Twitter, as there are days I don't address my email, as I get quite a bit, so I highly recommend short email or publicly via Twitter if it is appropriate.</p>

<p>There are other options as well, I am happy to schedule larger chunks of time on the phone, Skype or Google Hangout. Drop me a quick email and I'm willing to schedule some dedicated time that is billable in 15 minute increments, and help prioritize your questions.</p>

<p>I'm happy to provide one time or ongoing availability to answer your questions and discuss your API efforts. Sometimes it is nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of. I'm also happy to discuss deeper consulting in the following areas:</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
    <li><strong>API Design</strong> - Helping you design your API and generate a machien readable spec like Swagger or RAML</li>
    <li><strong>API Deployment</strong> - Assist you in the deployment of your API in the cloud on AWS, Google or other platform</li>
    <li><strong>API Management</strong> - Provide direction on how to craft your API management strategy</li>
    <li><strong>Developer Portal</strong> - Deliver design and deployment resources to help you launch an effective developer portal around your API(s)</li>
    <li><strong>API Review</strong> - Help you see your existing API from an outside perspective, reviewing the technical and business aspects of your API</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the main areas I can help you in your API iniatives. Feel free to drop me an email or engage on Twitter and we can discuss how I can help further.</p>
