        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-vice.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been getting demos of some pretty interesting new work spaces meant for API architects, and designers. Examples of this are <a href="http://apigarage.com/">API Garage</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reprezen.com/">RepreZen API Studio</a>, and the recent <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a>. These are just some of the API life-cycle solutions I'm seeing emerge recently, where companies are trying to provide API design, development, and deployment solutions in a single, tidy, work space.</p>
<p>Now that the API life-cycle has expanded beyond just API management, deployment, and design, into testing, monitoring, security, and beyond, I predict these types of API work-spaces that span multiple stops along the API life-cycle will become common place. To help prime the pump, and ensure there will be more viable products launched, I wanted to share a few thoughts on what these solution providers should consider as part of their offerings.</p>
<p>Here are some of my scribbles while drinking an IPA at my local bar:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions -</strong> Speak Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other common API definition formats, and allow for the importing and exporting of them at every step.</li>
<li><strong>Provide APIs -</strong> Make sure you provide APIs to all the functionality available within the workspace -- paying the whole API thing forward.</li>
<li><strong>Consume APIs -</strong> Make sure you allow the consumption of APIs, from within the interface, either as part of http client, or add-ons.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-in Framework -</strong> Allow some sort of extensibility of the work space, allowing 3rd parties to augment the platform via plugins.</li>
<li><strong>Play Well With Others -</strong> Please play nice with other service providers, all of this works because of interoperability, and I should be able to use the services I need via my work space.</li>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> Provide a comprehensive search, allowing me to discovery across everything I do within a work space, via a comprehensive history</li>
<li><strong>Notebook -</strong> Give me a notebook for storing my work, draft APIs, and other items I gather through my work, allowing me to come back and re-use work from the past.</li>
<li><strong>Use Github -</strong> Make sure Github is a first class citizen within the workspace, allowing me to import, and publish all my work to Github -- think orchestration, not just import and publish.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Developer Friendly </strong>- Make sure tht the work space isn't just for developers, and anyone can come in and participate throughout the API life-cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a HTTP Client -</strong> Make sure there is a built-in, or embeddable HTTP client, so get building one, partner with existing, or acquire one you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of my thoughts as I received a demo of one API work space, and was reading about a couple of other new products. After scribbling these thoughts, I sat back, drank a another pint of IPA, and contemplated the role of these types of work spaces in the future of the API industry. I predict there will be a wave of these API work spaces emerge in coming months, providing their own take on exactly what the API life-cycle looks like, and want to help developers standardize and be successful.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to playing with all the new work space, and hoping there will be at least one to emerge that suits my unique needs as the API Evangelist. I will need all of the elements listed above, or I probably won't be working in there full-time. &nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/10/02/playing-with-the-new-swaggerhub/">Playing With The New SwaggerHub</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tony-kin-swaggerhub.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I received a personal demo of the new <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a> from Mr. Swagger himself -- Tony Tam, this last week. SwaggerHub is a new API life-cycle hub, centered around the API definition format, developed by the SmartBear Swagger team. The new hub brings together all of the Swagger tooling into a single, collaborative web application, that allows you to manage API definitions through varioius stages of the API life-cycle.</p>
<p>SwaggerHub lets you import and export your JSON or YAML Swagger definitions, giving you an environment for storing, searching, versioning, and collaborating around the definitions. Using the platform, you can edit Swagger definitions using Swagger Editor, generate server and client side code with Swagger CodeGen, and play with the API using Swagger UI--all wrapped in this new versioned and collaborative API design environment.</p>
<p>After importing a handful of my APIs into SwaggerHub, it feels like a solution to help me manage the central truth that are my API definitions, allowing me to bring other people into the process, and generate the code and docs that will be needed at other stops along the API life-cycle. I'm assuming that other stops like testing, monitoring, and virtualization will emerge in future iterations of SwaggerHub.</p>
<p>SwaggerHub works well for API definition centralization, collaboration, and management, but some of the publishing of docs, server and client code didn't work as I'd expect them. There is Github integration for logging into SwaggerHub, and a "Github Push" feature, which I couldn't get to work, so I'm assuming the publishing and orchestration around APIs will only improve -- something I'm really interested in, because I use Github to manage all aspects of APIs life-cycle.</p>
<p>I like what I see so far in the <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a>, and see hints of the future with Docker image references, an API behind the platform, and I know there is APIs.json goodness right behind the surface. For now, I will just keep importing my designs into SwaggerHub, keep playing with, and seeing where Tony and the team takes the new API collaboration destination.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/09/29/a-review-of-the-callfire-communication-platform/">A Review of The CallFire Communication Platform</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-logo.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This is a review of the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">communication API platform CallFire</a>, crafting a snapshot of platform operations, from an external viewpoint, providing the CallFire platform team with a fresh take on their API from the outside-in. The criteria applied in this review is gathered from looking at the API operations across thousands of API providers, and aggregating best practices, into a single, distilled review process.</p>
<p>This review has been commissioned by CallFire, but as anyone who's paid me for a review knows, money doesn't equal a favorable review&mdash;I tell it like I see it. My objective is to help CallFire see their platform through a different sense, as developers might see their platform. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees, and I find the API review is a great way to help API providers see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I prefer to share my API reviews in a narrative format, walking through each of the important aspect of API management, telling the story of what I see, and what I don't see. Here is the story of what I found while reviewing the communication API platform for CallFire.</p>
<p><strong>Overview<br /></strong>CallFire makes for an easier review than some API operations, because the API is the product. As soon as you land on the homepage of the website, you begin your API journey as a potential API consumer. The first thing you read is "Over 2 Billion Messages Delivered&rdquo;, so you immediately understand what CallFire does, and the next thing that grabs your eye is &ldquo;Signup For Free&rdquo;&mdash;way to not miss a beat, CallFire.</p>
<p>Next you see five simple icons, with simple text, breaking what CallFire does down: Text Messaging, Call Tracking, Video Broadcast, Cloud Call Center, IVR. Within the first five seconds you fully understand what is being offered, and given the opportunity to sign up. If that is not enough, you are also told the reasons why: Engage Your Customers, Save Valuable Time, Increase Revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-home-page.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>After you look at thousands of APIs, nothing is more frustrating than to have to figure out what an API does. CallFire gives me what I need, in five seconds or less, without clicking or scrolling. This is the way all APIs should be, if not the homepage of website, then the landing page of the API developer portal. The main page of the CallFire website is well designed, and organized in a simple, and robust way, giving you one-click access to everything you need to get going with the platform--no other feedback required.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoints</strong><br />This is the part of the review I dive into the actual design of the API, and provide some feedback on the technical endpoints of the APIs themselves. CallFire is unique because it has a REST and a SOAP version of the API available, which I think is important in today's business climate, where APIs are targeting open developers, as well as those within the enterprise.</p>
<p>The CallFire API is very robust, with wide range of endpoints / methods for the most basic text and call features, all the way up to campaign, subscription, and contact management. You can tell the system is well thought out, providing a full suite of communication resources for all types of developers.</p>
<p>On you dig into the REST API you begin to see quite a bit of SOAP residue, and while the API has a well thought out list of endpoints, many elements of the parameters, requests, and responses feel SOAPy, including the XML responses. There is also a lack of consistent response codes, and defined data model, giving the REST API an unfinished, empty bottom feeling.</p>
<p>Overall I give the API a solid B in that it is a very robust stack, but I'd say it needs some hard use, and integrations before some of the rough edges are hammered off, parameters become more intuitive, and request and response structures normalize. Much of this just comes with usage, and requires getting closer to real world use cases, end users, before it becomes more of an experience based design vs. the resource based design it currently is.</p>
<p>I could easily go through the entire Swagger definition for CallFire and make recommendations on naming conventions, and help craft the resource definitions for the underlying data models, but this is best worked out with the community, iterating, and communicating with developers, and learning more about truly what they need. Think of it as kiln firing of the API, through developer execution, and robust platform feedback loops.</p>
<p><strong>On-Boarding</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API was frictionless. I went one click from home page, authenticated with my Google Account, and immediately I was dropped into my account dashboard, with a helpful intro screen showing me where things are. I easily found the area in my account to add an application, and get my API keys, then stumbled into the overview of how to activate your account as well&mdash;account management was intuitive.</p>
<p>The intuitive and informative CallFire home page made the API easy to find, and with frictionless account signup, and a standard API app management, I was ready to make my first call on the API within 10 minutes. The only thing I would consider adding as part of the process, is an option for signup and login using my Github credentials, in addition to Facebook, and Google.</p>
<p>On-boarding with an API is often the most frustrating part of API integration, and it wasn't something I worried about at all with CallFire. The process was intuitive, smooth, and didn't leave me trying to understand what the API does, and how I am supposed to make it work. Solid A on the on-boarding process for the CallFire API.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/api-documentation/rest/version/1.1"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-api-documentation.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br />Documentation is one of the most critical aspects of API integration, making or breaking many integration efforts by developers. CallFire has double duty, in that it needs to provide documentation for the REST and SOAP version. Somethig CallFire manages to deliver with no problem, providing clean, easy to follow documentation for both APIs they offer.</p>
<p>The SOAP API document provides a simple breakdown of operations and methods, with easy to follow descriptions for everything. Ultimately the SDKs do most of the heavy lifting here, but the SOAP docs provide a nice overview of the CallFire platform.</p>
<p>The REST API for CallFire is defined using the machine readable API definition format Swagger, and uses Swagger UI to generate documentation, making learning about the API more interactive. Swagger provides a machine readable overview of the CallFire API, and is an approach to delivering API documentation that keeps pace with modern approaches.</p>
<p>I do not have much feedback for the documentation side of CallFire, I'd like to see more information about the underlying data model described in the Swagger definition, as well more detail about the response codes, but I give the platform documentation a solid B for being simple, clean, and complete--the API just needs some hardening, and the documentation will improve.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API is frictionless, and adding an app, and finding your API keys are intuitive enough. The platform also provides a nice overview on how to enable the API on your CallFire account, but ultimately the topic of authentication is neglected.</p>
<p>Authentication for SOAP interactions, and REST for that matter, are abstracted away by each of the SDKs. However one of the elements of RESTful APIs is that authentication should be clearly defined as part of the documentation. I suggest adding a page, or section on an existing page that is dedicated authentication, explaining the BasicAuth used to secure the CallFire API. For any experienced API consumer it isn't difficult navigate, but the app manager with login and password, has appearance that it may be app key via a header or parameter, not BasicAuth--a dedicated authentication overview page would help clear up.</p>
<p>As part of authentication review I do not usually advocate for a specific authentication approach, when the choices are BasicAuth, or using the app id and keys in the header or parameters. The best option is to pick one, be consistent, and explain it clearly, on a page that stands out. Overall the authentication for CallFire is intuitive, it just needs a little bit of information to makes things 100% clear when you first find yourself making that first API call.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Since I wrote this review, and the time of publishing, <a href="https://answers.callfire.com/hc/en-us/articles/205407787-Authentication">CallFire has updated their portal to include a well formed authentication overview for the platform</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Code</strong><br />After documentation, code samples, libraries, and SDKs are key to a painless API integration. For the CallFire API, there are only two SDKs available currently, for the PHP, and .NET platforms. It is common that platforms who are just getting going, only have a handful of SDKs in specific language, and is forgivable, but is also a sign of platform immaturity (aka lots of work still to be done).</p>
<p>Another aspect of SDK design for CallFire, that I'd like to bring up, is the cohabitation of REST and SOAP in a single SDK. I'm not sure this type of cross pollination is ideal for all integrations. Maybe it is just my architectural style, but I like seeing each SDK be as smallest possible footprint as possible, and meet the needs of developers without any extraneous bloat.</p>
<p>CallFire needs to have Python, Ruby, Java, Node.Js, Go, and JavaScript language SDKs to be able to serve as wide as possible audience as we possibly can. To help achieve this I recommend soliciting the help of platform users, or even paying a 3rd party developer to build SDKs, if needed.</p>
<p>Moving beyond SDKs, into what I call Platform Development Kits (PDK), CallFire does well in providing two distinct platform plugins for WordPress and Drupal. I recommend bringing these PDKs to the surface, and showcase them in a full SDK and PDK showcase page&mdash;showing what is possible. &nbsp;Maybe even considering the next step, of what is the 3rd PDK that could be developed? SalesForce? Heroku?</p>
<p>The usage of Github by CallFire is another important signal, showing the platform is progressive, and something that developers can depend on. I recommend further bringing Github into the site, linking to accounts, providing direct links to SDK and PDK repositories from an official page, and add Github authentication for developers to be able to create and manage their accounts. Github isn't just about code, it is a potentially important social layer to the CallFire API ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong><br />There really is no evidence of any mobile SDKs, or information for mobile developers available on the CallFire platform. It is common to find entire sections dedicated to mobile developers, or at least links to mobile platform specific code libraries. I recommend establishing a mobile focused section of the platform, and invest the resources necessary to help developers build iOS, Android, and Windows mobile applications using CallFire.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br />CallFire is doing well on the support front, providing building blocks for both direct, and self-service support. I like to see a mix of support services that developers can find on their own, getting the help they need 24/7, but they also need to be able to get direct support when they get stuck.</p>
<p>When it comes to direct support, CallFire is rocking it, with a support email, live chat, phone number, contact form, and ticketing system tied to your account messaging area. The only additional things I could recommend CallFire offering is paid support plans, allowing developers to pay for one-on-one support via chat, online hangout, or other means.</p>
<p>With self-service support, there is the CallFire FAQ, which I'd call more a knowledgeable than a simple FAQ, providing a wealth of knowledge about the platform. The only common element I see missing is more of a community element with a forum, or usage of Stack Overflow to engage with the wider developer community. &nbsp;The current FAQ is very robust, and with the integrated ticketing system, the potential is great, but it is all missing that community piece.</p>
<p>Overall, CallFire support is as robust as you'd expect from any API platform. When you combine with the social media presence the platform has, that I'll cover as part of the communication strategy, the platform has all of its bases covered. A+ on support effort.</p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong><br />When it comes to my review criteria for communications, other than a newsletter, CallFire nailed everyone of them. The platform has all of the expected social media platforms, has an active blog with RSS feed, and is very accessible with email, phone, and chat. All of this sends the right signals to the community, and potential API consumers, that someone is home. I have nothing to contribute when it comes to communications, as long as all channels are kept active, CallFire is doing everything it can in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Change Practices</strong><br />As platform providers, we are asking developers to depend on us, and integrate our resources into their applications, and businesses. That is asking a lot, and we need to provide as much information as possible about what the future hold, to hlep build trust with developers. There a handful of proven ways for doing this, established by leading API platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - API roadmaps are usually a simple, bulleted list, derived from the APIs own internal roadmap, showing what the future holds for the platform. Transparency around an APIs roadmap is a tough balance, since you don't want to give away too much, alerting your competitors, but your developer ecosystem needs to know what is next.</li>
<li><strong>Status Dashboard -</strong> Status dashboards are a common way for API platforms to communicate the availability of an API, but also show the track record of a platform, helping developers understand the track record for an API they are to integrate with. There are several simple services, that help API providers do this, without investment in new tools and systems.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log - </strong>Knowing the past is a big part of understanding where things are in store for the future. A change log should work in sync with the API roadmap building block, but provide much more detailed information about changes that have occurred with an API. Developers will not always pay attention to announced updates, but can use a change log as a guide for deciding what changes they need to make in their applications and how they will use an API.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Sharing the change history of a platform, a roadmap to the future, and a status of API operations at the moment go a long way in help build trust with developers. Transparency in the development of any platform, is essential in helping developers feel comfortable that a platform will be around to support their needs, and is worthy of their time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/pricing"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-pricing-page.png" alt="CallFire Messaging Pricing" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Business Model</strong><br />When reviewing APIs, the overall business model is usually one of the most incomplete aspects of operations, in my experience. This is ok, as many platforms are still figuring this out, however this is not the case with CallFire. The business model for the platform isn't just well defined, it provides me with an example to use when helping other API providers visualize what is possible.</p>
<p>The pricing page for CallFire is clean, well thought out, and provides sensibles tiers of operation, with clear units of measurement, letting me know what I get for each level. I can easily upgrade the access tier directly from my account settings, and I can get volume pricing if needed. This is how APIs should work, allowing me to easily calculate what I'll need, and figure out which tier I will be operating within, complete with a self-service option for scaling as I need, paying for what I use, as I go.</p>
<p>The billing management and credit system for CallFire is superior to most of even the most thought out API billing and pricing models. It is clean, well thought out, and makes sense from a user perspective&mdash;which is the most important aspect. I'll be using CallFire credit system as a reference when I talk about how the platforms should build tooling that supports the underlying API business model.</p>
<p>I can't articulate enough, how well done the business model, pricing, supporting billing and the other business elements of the CallFire API.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong><br />When it comes to available support resources, it is another area CallFire does very well. The platform has heavily invested in case studies, videos, webinars, and a tour of the platform. They even have a communications and marketing glossary developers can use to get up to speed. CallFire does a good job of providing valuable resources to get developers quickly understand all aspects of platform operations..</p>
<p>A couple of areas I could provide suggestions for improvement, in is when it comes to more industry level white papers, and when the evangelism side of things kicks in maybe consider posting slide decks from events CallFire presents at, as well as a calendar of interesting events. These things will happen I'm sure once an API evangelism strategy is kicked into full gear, but for now just keep doing more of the same--providing lots of rich resources for devs.</p>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br />I'd file R&amp;D in the same category as mobile, non-existent. API ecosystem are essentially external R&amp;D labels for companies, and general operations are about exploring ideas of what can be build with an API, but it helps to have some element available to stimulate overall R&amp;D via the platform.</p>
<p>Some of these elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea Showcase - A place the community can share ideas of what could be built with the CallFire platform.</li>
<li>Labs Environment - A workbench showing what CallFire is working on when it comes to their own integration.</li>
<li>Opportunities - Available opportunities to build things like SDKs, PDKs, or specific projects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>These are just three things that help stimulate the innovation around an API. Sometimes developers just need something to spark the imagination, or possibly see an existing labs project to help them see something in their own work. These rich R&amp;D environments can provide a great opportunity to help meet the needs of CallFire, and its partners.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department</strong><br />CallFire has the requisite Terms of Service (TOS), and privacy policy. I'm not a lawyer, so i'm not going to parse all of the details of each. There was nothing that raised my TOS alarms too significantly, the TOS were pretty standard, and the privacy policy didn't raise any huge privacy concerns as well I wouldn't have any problems integrating my own platform and business into CallFire.</p>
<p>A couple of items I'd recommend also considering, based upon what I seen on other platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code License - </strong>The PHP SDK has an MIT license, but the .NET didn't have anything. A centralized code licensing page could help as well.</li>
<li><strong>API License -</strong> A license for the API itself, applied to the REST API interface that is defined by Swagger, using API Commons format.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA) - </strong>Provide a service level agreement for API consumers to take advantage of, and understand service level commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Branding -</strong> There are no branding or style guidelines with support resources like logos, etc&mdash;missed opportunity for spreading word, and steering developers in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Just a couple of things to think about. All of these would go a long way in building trust with developers, and the branding thing is a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. When you bundle these with the TOS, privacy, and compliance information already provided by the platform, it would round off the legal department of the CallFire API nicely.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong><br />Embeddable tooling is another area that is non-existent for the CallFire API. There are no embeddable tools like widgets, buttons, etc that allow the average end-user, and developer to put the API to use in web pages, and applications. I'm not sure what an embeddable suite of tools would look like for CallFire, that would need to be a separate brainstorming process.</p>
<p>When it comes to communication platforms, especially ones involving media, and deep social interactions, embeddable tools are a proven way to grow platform, expand the network effect, and potentially bring in new developers. I recommend including an embeddable section to the site, with a handful of embeddable tooling to compliment the SDK and PDK resources already available.</p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong><br />One area I consider when looking through API operations, is the environment itself. By default many APIs are live, ready for production use, but increasingly platforms are employing alternate environments for development, QA, and potentially variant product environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - With the sensitive information available via many APIs, providing developers a sandbox environment to develop and test their code might be wise idea. Sandboxes environments will increase the overall cost of an API deployment, but can reduce headaches for developers and can significantly reduce support overhead. Consider the value of a sandbox when planning an API.</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - When planning an API, consider if all deployments need to have access to live data in real-time or there is the need to require developers to request for separate production access for their API applications. In line with the sandbox building block, a separate API production environment can make for a much healthier API ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Simulator</strong> - Providing an environment where developers can find existing profiles, templates or other collections of data, as well as sequence for simulating a particular experience via an API platform. While this is emerging as critical building block for Internet of Thing APIs, it is something other API providers have been doing to help onboard new users.</li>
<li><strong>Templates</strong> - Predefined templates of operation, when a new environment is setup, either sandbox, production, or simulator, it can be pre-populated with data, and other configuration, making it more useful to developers. These templates can be used throughout the API lifecycle from development, QA, all the way to simulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>This approach to delivering an environment for the CallFire API is not essential, but I could see it providing some interesting scenarios for communication campaigns, and the deployment of messaging infrastructure in a containerized, Internet of Things rich environment. Deployment CallFire communication infrastructure should be as flexible as possible to support the next generation of Internet enabled communication, both in the cloud and on-premise.</p>
<p><strong>Developers</strong><br />An often overlooked aspect of API operations is the tools provided to API consumers. CallFire is in a fortunate position as the API is core to their product, and the API integration is an extension of a primary CallFire user account. The account area for CallFire is well done, clean, and gives users, and those who choose to be API consumers, quite a bit of control over their communication infrastructure.</p>
<p>CallFire nailed almost every API account area I like to see in any API platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Dashboard - </strong>The dashboard for CallFire account is well done, and information.</li>
<li><strong>Account Settings - </strong>CallFire provides a high level of control over account settings.</li>
<li><strong>Reset Password -</strong> Resetting password is important, and I like to highlight separately.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - The app management for CallFire is on par with rest of industry.</li>
<li><strong>Service Tiers -</strong> The ability to change service tier, and scale is pretty significant.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - An import part of the communication and support strategy of platform.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> &nbsp;- Essential to the economy portion of platform operations, well executed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of areas I'd like to see, to round off developer account operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Authentication -</strong> It would fit nicely with Facebook, and Google Auth--I prefer authenticating for APIs with my Github.</li>
<li><strong>Delete Account - </strong>Maybe it is in there, but I couldn't find it. The ability to delete an account is important in my book.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Logs &amp; Analytics -</strong> I'd like to see application specific analytics like on the dashboard, showing usage per app.</li>
<li><strong>Account API -</strong> Allow API access to all account operations, allowing access to account settings, usage limits, billing, messaging and other areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The CallFire account management for users and developers is much more robust than I see in many of the APIs I review. Like I said before the monetization portion is something to be showcased, and all the most important aspects of account management for API operations are present. It wouldn't take much to round off with a couple more features, some more analytics, and an account management API would really take things to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong><br />I always enjoy when I come find consistent design, and function across API operations. This is what I found with CallFire. The API isn't an afterthought like other platforms, it is their product, and the site design, messaging, and content are consistent across the platform.</p>
<p>The API design is consistent, and the supporting documentation is as well. The only thing I'd add is design patterns across the SOAP and REST API should be less consistent, and stay true to their own design constraints. The details of the REST could be tightened, to be more consistent in how parameters are formed, and response formats, and error code are commonly presented.</p>
<p>Usually when reviewing APIs, I look for fractures between API operations, like clunky UI between website sections, or incomplete documentation, often created by disparate teams. This doesn't exist with CallFire, and while there are many details that could be cleaned up, the consistency is all there.</p>
<p><strong>Openness</strong><br />This is a term thrown around a lot in the space, and very seldom do sites live up to it. There are many things that contribute to whether or not an API is truly open. CallFire delivers on all of the important areas, making open a word I'd apply to CallFire.</p>
<p>First on-boarding for the platform frictionless, and everything is self-service, even scaling your account when you need more credits. You have control over your account, and the terms of service and privacy policy are liberal. These are all hallmarks of an open API. Add the ability to delete my account, I'm 100% on board.</p>
<p>One of the things I think heavily contribute to the openness of the CallFire platform is the business model. The monetization strategy is well formed, with pricing and service tiers well defined. You know what things cost, and how to get what you need. This type of approach eliminates the need for other extraneous rate list, or restrictions&mdash;this type of balance is important to truly achieving openness.</p>
<p>After this review I'd call CallFire an open API, but only time will tell, if the platform is also stable, support channels are truly supportive, and other aspects of open that only CallFire can deliver on. For right now I consider them open for business, and open for developers, but ultimately whether or not CallFire is willing to share this review, will put the exclamation on the platform openness definition, won't it! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Evangelism</strong><br />The usual footprint you'd see when an API platform has an active evangelism program doesn't exist for CallFire, but that is part of the motivation of this review. We are looking to take a snapshot of where &nbsp;the platform is at, in hopes of providing much needed input for the roadmap, as well as establish a version 1.0 evangelism strategy--we will revisit the evangelism portion of this review in a couple months.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In short, the CallFire passes my review. There are several key areas like mobile, and roadmap communication, that are missing from the platform entirely, but then there are other areas CallFire nails almost every one of my review criteria. The API is robust, the documentation is complete, and they provide all the essential support building blocks.</p>
<p>One of the things that really stand out for me is the CallFire business model, something that I think really cuts through the BS of many APIs I look at. CallFire has a clear business model, and the tools to manage your API usage. There is no grey area with the business of model for CallFire, which is something I just don't see a lot of.</p>
<p>I'd say my biggest concern with the platform is the lack of diverse code resources. I can't tell if they are just getting going, or maybe the lack of developer skills is slowing the diversity of available coding resources--I am just not sure. My guess is their is a lack of diverse developer skills on staff, which explains the lack of mobile SDKs, and the SOAP residue on the REST API. My advice is to invest in the developer resources necessary to load the platform up with a wide variety of coding resources that developers can put to work in their projects.</p>
<p>Beyond the code resources, it is really just a bunch smaller items that would bring the platform into better form. CallFire definitely reflects everything I'm looking for in an API platform, and is something I've included in the top APIs I track on as part of my API Stack. Additionally, I've gathered a couple of other stories while doing this review, including the overall monetization strategy, the notification system under account settings, and their usage of Swagger&mdash;which is always another good sign of a healthy platform, and a positive review.</p>
<p>Lots going on with the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">CallFire platform</a>, I recommend taking a look at what they are up to.</p>
<p><em>This was a paid review of the CallFire platform, if you'd like to schedule a review of your platform, <a href="mailto: info@apievangelist.com">please contact me</a>, and we'll see if I can make time. &nbsp;A paid review does not equal a good review. it is my goal to give as critical, and constructive feedback as I can to help API providers enhance their roadmap and better serve their consumers.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/four-new-apis.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a whole bunch of APIs I want to deploy. There is a queue of APIs that I will never get to, but I can't help myself, and when I am tired of watching what everyone else is doing, and want to get busy actually building things, I crack open my queue of ideas. This weekend I launched four new APIs, that will be in the service of some very different objectives that I have.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">Low Hanging Fruit</a></strong> - Identifying the potential CSV, XLS, XML, and table resources that exist in any domain, and publish them to Github as a list for deploying as APIs - aka the low hanging fruit.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.tsa.report/">TSA.Report</a></strong> - A simple form for submitting your thoughts as you are going through the airport line.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.apis.how/">APIs.How</a></strong> - The URL shoretner for the API Evangelist and Kin Lane network--getting off Bitly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.magnetic.jargon.kinlane.com/">Magnetic Jargon</a></strong> - A dictionary creation API, allowing the building of word lists to use for a magnetic fridge web and mobile app I am building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these APIs have a specific purpose. Low Hanging Fruit, and APIs.how are both very back-end system tools, where TSA.Report and Magnetic Jargon are meant to drive simple web and mobile applications. The purpose of these applications are not the point of this story, the minimum viable existence of these four new APis is what I want to talk about.</p>
<p>These four APIs are far from complete. I anticipate that TSA.Report and Magnetic.Jargon will evolve based upon the apps that are developed on them, but Low Hanging Fruit and APIs.How are core to how I do business, and will continue to evolve as far as I can afford to scale them (ie how many sites and links I can index).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal this weekend, is to just get the APIs up and running. Their overall relevance and productivity in my world will be decided by their roadmap. I just needed to establish them as a real project, and get a mimum viable definition up and running. Here is what defines a minimum viable API in my world right now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API</strong> - One or many endpoints that serve data, content, or other resources via one of my domains.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - A JSON definition of the surface area, and underlying data model for any API I provide.</li>
<li><strong>API Blueprint -</strong> A markdown&nbsp;definition of the surface area, and underlying data model for any API I provide.</li>
<li><strong>Postman </strong>- A Postman Collection allowing anyone to quickly deploy an API in a Postman Client.</li>
<li><strong>API Science Monitor </strong>- At least one monitor of one of the endpoints, acknowledging it is up and running.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json -</strong> Providing an index of each project, giving me machine readable access to each API, as well as its operations.</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo -</strong> A repository to house the server code (privately), but also publish a developer portal with API definitions available via a known location.</li>
</ul>
<p>This the current minimum viable definition of an API in my world currently. I will be adding more endpoints to each of these APIs, as well as other building blocks to support their operations, but this represents the start for each of these projects for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly I do not know if each of these APIs will survive. They will each have their own road-maps, one that is driven based upon how much I evangelize, and ultimately attract interest from consumers. Each API will have its own monetization strategy, something I will work on sharing via the API definitions that I've published in their API portals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of these APIs are core to my operations as API Evangelist, while two of them are just really for fun, and are in support of simple micro apps I wish to deploy. Low Hanging Fruit will depend on how much funding I can get for each domain indexes, and APIs.How will thrive based upon the growth of my own writing and storytelling. The other two will be driven by advertising revenue, and I do not expect anyone to actually build anything else on the APIs, they only exist because I am API-first in everything I do.</p>
<p>Now that I have a minimum viable existence for all four of these APIs I can move into the next next steps for each project, while also addressing other items on my task list, but at least I know these projects are up and running, and discoverable when I get time to get back to them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzle-strategic.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/issues/159">I was gathering my thoughts today around API management solutions can better work together, in response to an industry discussion going on between several creators of open source tooling</a>. The Github thread is focused on proxies, and how they can work more closely together to facilitate interoperability in this potentially federated layer of the API economy, but as I do, I wanted to step back and look at bigger picture before I responded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was gathering my thoughts, <a href="http://apigarage.com/">I also had an interesting conversation with the creator of API Garage</a>, in which one of the topics was around how we encourage API service providers to want to work closer, but this time from the perspective of a <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">API client workspace</a>. This made me think, that the thoughts I was gathering about how open source proxies can better work together, should be universally applied to every step along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Open APIs</strong><br />It should be a no-brainer for API service providers--have an API! <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">One of the best examples of this, is with 3Scale API management--they have a very robust API, that represents every aspect of the API management layer</a>. Other service providers like <a href="https://developer.apiscience.com/">API Science</a>, and <a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io/">APIMATIC</a>, who server other stops along the API life-cycle, also have their own APIs. If you want your API tooling to work with other API tooling, have an API--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/20/swagger-20-for-the-docker-api/">think about Docker, and their API interface, and make your tools behave this way</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong><br />Provide openly licensed tooling around any service you provide. Make your tooling as modular as you can, and apply open source licenses wherever it makes sense. Open licenses, facilitate people working together, and breaks down silos. This is obvious to the folks on the API proxy thread I'm referencing, but will not be as obvious to other service providers looking to break into the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Definitions</strong><br />Speak common API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and in Postman Collections, and provide indexes using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. If consumers can import and export in their preferred definition format they will be able to get up and running much quicker, share patterns between the various proprietary services, and the open tooling they are putting to work. There are a lot of opportunities to partner around common API definitions for API deployment, and management, which would open up a potentially new world of API services that aggregate, integrate, and sync between common API platforms throughout the life-cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Open Plugins</strong><br />Developers never want their tooling to be a silo. Allow the extensibility of any tooling or services, from design, to management, or client, using common approaches to connectors, plugins, etc. Make plugins be API first, so that other API service providers can easily take their own APIs, craft a plugin, and quickly bring their value to another platform's ecosystem. Plugins are the doorway to the interoperability that open APIs, source code, and definitions bring to the table for platform providers.</p>
<p><strong>Open Partnerships</strong><br />Open APIs, source code, definitions, and plugins all set the stage for ever deeper levels of partnership. APIs are the pipes, with open source code and definitions providing the grease, and if all API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com">testing</a>, <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">security</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, and <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> providers allow for plugins, strategic partners can occur organically.</p>
<p>All of this really sounds familiar? It really sounds like what the API space is telling the rest of the business world, so I can't help but see the irony in giving API service and tooling providers this same advice. If you want more partnerships to happen, expose all your resources as APIs, providing open tooling and definitions, allow other companies to plug their features into your solutions, and a whole new world of business development will emerge.</p>
<p>With the mainstream growth we are seeing in the API space in 2015, there are some pretty significant opportunities for partnership between API service providers right now--that is, if we follow the same API-first approach, currently being recommended to API providers.</p>

<p>My own API management system allows me to import Postman collections, HAR files, Charles Proxy XML files, and Swagger version 1.2, but when it comes to output, it only speaks Swagger 2.0. I've been wanting to create a tool for outputting my definitions as API Blueprint for some time now, but just haven't had the time to do the work.</p>
<p>I have been secretly hoping someone would build a good quality, so I wouldn't have to do this work myself. Now I have <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>, an API definition translation platform, developed by the <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. Using API Transformer you can upload or pull API definitions in the following formats:</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/"><img style="margin-top: 60px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-with-blueprint.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>API Blueprint</li>
<li>Swagger 1.0 - 1.2</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 JSON</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 YAML</li>
<li>WADL - W3C 2009</li>
<li>Google Discovery</li>
<li>RAML 0.8</li>
<li>I/O Docs - Mashery</li>
<li>APIMATIC Format</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you can output API definitions in the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Blueprint</li>
<li>Swagger 1.2</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 JSON</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 YAML</li>
<li>WADL - W3C 2009</li>
<li>APIMATIC Format</li>
</ul>
<p>With API Transformer, they are offering a pretty valuable service, that any API service provider, and API consumer can put to work right away. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I quickly generated four API Blueprints, for my API, audio, blog, and building block APIs, which I also indexed as part of each APIs.json file</a>.</p>
<p>As any good API service provider should, The API Transformer has an API. You can build in API transformations between definition into any service or tooling. In my opinion, every API service provider in 2015 should speak as many API definitions as possible, always allowing customers to import, and export in all of the formats offered above.</p>
<p>API Transformer reflects how API service providers should work, it is doing one thing, and doing it well, and it provides a simple web interface, as well as a dead simple API. There is no way I will be building out my own service now that <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">APIMATC has launched API Transformer</a>.</p>

<p>I just sat in on an <a href="http://apiware.io">APIWare</a> call with a fast growing startup, developing a better understanding of how we can assist their team. They have a pretty solid development team behind their API, so providing core API development resources is not in the cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where&nbsp; this startup is needing the most help, is where the APIWare team shines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Operations Review -</strong> Taking a look at how an API platform works from the inside out, preferably starting with an outside perspective, so we can bring that fresh perspective to the table, and immediately begin adding value to the road-map.</li>
<li><strong>Crafting API Strategy -</strong> With a better understanding of how an API works, inside and out, we can take a walk through our massive list of best practices, and see what we can apply when it comes to bringing together a strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing companies with a comprehensive review of their API operations from an outside perspective, but also walking through their architecture, team, and other internal resources, is a valuable process on its own. Having a team of experience API professionals listening, and walking through the current makeup of your API operations helps you better articulate your vision while also helping us define how things work, so a coherent API strategy can be crafted by our team.</p>
<p>This is the stage we are in with this particular startup conversation--kicking off a formal review, so we can help them craft a coherent API strategy. Once this is done, we can re-assess how we can help them, and probably begin telling more public stories about the project. This conversation reflects other conversations the APIWare team is having with other startups, SMB and enterprise groups. However one thing that did present itself on this call, is how APIWare is also becoming a burst-able development team that can act as a backup when small startups are faced with potentially large enterprise relationships that come with API success.</p>
<p>This particular startup&nbsp; just had a new enterprise customer come in through their API, the dream of any small API, until you actually have to scramble to meet the demands. I have seen the interest of the enterprise be both a blessing and a curse in the past for small teams, something that has the potential to derail a startup, taking them away from the daily work that matters. The enterprise has the resources to throw at these projects, but small startup teams do not always have what it takes to keep day to day operations running smoothly, while also meeting the needs of a large project or partnership.</p>
<p>This is APIWare. In addition to helping this startup review their current API operations, and craft a coherent API strategy, the APIWare team is here to help their core API developer team expand and contract as necessary. We are getting to know know the company's existing infrastructure and operations, primarily to be able to help craft the overall API strategy, but this awareness also puts us in a good position to step in and help either to help with a larger project, or augment the core team, while they address the needs of larger, temporary projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability for APIWare to be there for a company in this capacity always starts with an API operations review. We can't be waiting in the wings, ready to work, if we aren't up to speed on how things are currently operating, and in tune with the road-map. It is nice to be starting these conversations early, so we are up to speed when we are needed most. I am happy to see that staying specialized in the areas of API design, deployment, and management is proving to be a valuable approach to the startups we are talking with so far.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-engine-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Sometimes I have ideas, that are sticky, meaning they won't leave my brain, but are not always concepts I personally enjoy exploring. This is just a little insight into the madness that is my brain, focus Kin...FOCUS! So, I found myself thinking last week about API monetization, while I was also updating my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> and <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a> research--then, during this Reese's peanut butter cup moment, I came up with an idea for a suggested or sponsored link relation engine for hypermedia APIs.</p>
<p>First, I'd prefer to start with what I'd consider to be a hypermedia suggestion engine, that could provide external suggestions for related links to any structured data that is being returned via an API. It is a suggestion engine that an API provider, who has followed hypermedia principles as part of their API design, could use to augment the resources they are serving up. Such a suggestion engine would have to be pretty smart, and work from an existing index that API providers could train via an external API.</p>
<p>One possible example of this from my existing work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/15/can-we-keep-important-scientific-research-projects-alive-through-revenue-generated-from-api-access/">is present in a scientific research API</a>, that might be serving up research papers, and with each API call you could potentially get some native related links for annotating, tagging, and other opportunities that are dictated by the API providers. But, what if the institution, where the research occurred could provide related links to other research going on at the institution, or maybe a governing scientific organization could suggest other related research or resources, and it was up to the API provider to whitelist or blacklist link relations that were included.</p>
<p>Taking this to the next level, which is inevitable, and I might as well be the asshole who suggest it, but what if API providers could approve a paid index of links to suggest as a link relation, for any product in the catalog. Sure you can add this product to your wishlist, or shopping cart, but you could also donate it to a non-profit organization, or buy it through a partner who will modify it for me, and deliver it to me in a way that improves on the original product experience. Such a link relation engine could inject valuable links into the API stream, and the API provider, and potentially developers could tap into this as a potential revenue stream. Of course, all links included would be fully vetted, and <a href="https://metacert.com/">certified secure using a service like Metacert</a>.</p>
<p>If you are still reading this, this link relation engine does not exist. This is just a random idea derived from the collision of several of my active projects, with a little forward thought of what could be one possible dystopian post-advertising world, API monetization world might look like. I'm sure, like current advertising, 90% of the links in a link relation engine would be total shit, but who knows, they might also add value to the increasing number of structured objects being served up via APIs, and maybe active as a next generation financial engine that is tailored specifically for the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-dev-code.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If  you are in an industry being impacted by technology, you have probably  become very aware of the term Application Programming Interfaces, more  widely known as APIs, and how they are driving web applications, mobile  applications, and increasingly everyday  objects in our homes, cars, businesses, and across the public  landscape. If you are finding yourself part of this growing  conversations, you have most likely have also heard talk of a new breed  of API definition formats that are becoming ubiquitous like Swagger  and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>API definitions are a way to describe what an API does, providing a  machine readable blueprint of how to put the digital resource to work.  API definitions are not new, but this latest round of available formats  are taking the API conversation out of just  IT and developer groups, and enabling business units, and other key  stakeholders to participate throughout the API life-cycle. Much like the  latest wave of web APIs has made data, content, and other digital  resources like video and images more accessible,  API definitions are making APIs more accessible across the rapidly  expanding digital business landscape.</p>
<p>The first widely available API definition format was the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl"> Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</a>, which is an XML format  established in 2001 that described web services. Much like web services  (an API predecessor), WSDL was a very technical vision of APIs,  something dictated by IT, and developer groups, with  heavy top down governance from business and industry leadership. While  web services, and WSDL are still ubiquitous across the enterprise, they  are rapidly being replaced with much lighter weight, simpler web APIs  that use the Internet as a way of delivering  the digital data, content, and resources web, mobile, and devices are  demanding in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round-certified.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Along the way, newer, more web friendly API definition formats emerged, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language"> Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, but ultimately WADL was  something that never took root, suffering from many of the same illness  of its predecessor WSDL. It wasn't until a new format called <a href="http://swagger.io"> Swagger</a> was born, that we started to see the conversation around how  we define, communicate and develop standardized tooling around APIs  evolve, providing an open specification for defining all the details  that go into an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger provided developers a way to describe an API that was more in  sync with everything else modern API developers were used to, including  using JSON, rather than the XML of previous web services, WSDL and  WADL. Swagger gave us something more than just  way to define APIs, it gave us swagger UI, which is a interactive  version of API documentation that made learning about what an API does,  and how to integrate with it, a hands on, interactive experience. This  new approach to documentation gave us a solution  to the number one problem plaguing API providers, which was out of date  documentation that confused consumers.</p>
<p>Shortly after Swagger began seeing wide adoption because of the  interactive documentation it provided for APIs, a new API definition  format also emerged called API Blueprint, which provided interactive  documentation, but rather than using JSON, it used Markdown,  making the process of defining APIs a little less intimidating for  non-developers. Apiary, the makers of API Blueprint did another thing  that would move the conversation forward again, making the reasons for  defining APIs in these formats, more about API design,  than just about delivering up-to-date documentation.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-blueprint-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Using API Blueprint, API designers could define an API, before any  code was actually written. Developers could craft an API using Apiary's  tooling, then a mock version of an API could be generated, which could  be shared with other project stakeholders, from  business users, to potential web or mobile developers. This process  saves considerable time, money, and other resources in ensuring than API  would be something web, mobile, and device developers could actually  put to use. With two new API definition formats  Swagger, and now API Blueprint, the processing of defining, designing  APIs in a machine readable way, was accessible to everyone, across a  rapidly expanding API life-cycle.</p>
<p>This evolution has all occurred over the last 4 years, a period which  has also produced other API definition formats like RSDL, RADL, RAML,  I/O Docs, and MSON--just to name a few. All of these API definition  formats are quickly becoming the preferred format  for not just defining, and designing APIs, as well as delivering  documentation. Another positive by-product has been that a new breed of  API service providers are also using it as the central definition for  quickly putting their services to work on any API,  for documentation, mocking and virtualizing APIs, generating server  code, producing software development kits (SDK), and setting up  essential testing and monitoring to keep APIs stable and reliable for  consumers--the API definition driven life-cycle continues  to expand.</p>
<p>In 15 years, like APIs, the API definition formats have moved out of  the real of the technical, and are providing vital business interactions  that ensure APIs meet critical internal, partner, and public needs.  They are also being applied to bring much needed  balance to the political side of API operations, from making sure APIs  are stable, and available, to defining pricing, rate limits, terms of  service, and even helping secure APIs that operate on the open Internet.</p>
<p>API definitions have become a machine readable contract that defines  the boundaries of a relationship between API provider, and its  consumers. Acting as a central truth, that is crafted by developers and  API architects to govern how an API operates, from  mocking to client integration, but in a way that is also setting the  technical, business, and legal expectations of consumers. This API  definition-driven contact is transcending the often proprietary, black  box algorithms that make an API function behind the  scenes, providing a portable, shareable, machine readable contract that  can be shared internally, and externally with partners or the general  public.</p>
<p>The importance of this new layer, and its role in the future of software development can be seen playing out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc."> Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>, where Oracle (using the courts)  has set the precedent that the naming, and ordering of your interface is  separate from the code, and falls under copyright protection. Beyond  the core legal case, the questions, and understanding  of exactly what is code has been even more interesting. Many API  architects do not see APIs as anything but code, having not seen impacts  of the modern API definition movement within their architecture yet.</p>
<p>API definitions aren't just about defining the URLs, parameters,  headers, and other aspects of API operations that developers need to  know, it is also bringing much needed clarity and awareness of value  generated by APIs among business users, and the end-users  of the applications that APIs are powering. API definitions provide a  common format in markdown, YAML, or JSON, that describe the technical  surface of an API, but then also take this technical specification, and  allow it to be applied across every stop along  the API life-cycle, from idea to deployment, to resulting integration  with web, mobile, and device applications.</p>
<p>As APIs make their way into almost every aspect of our business and  personal lives, driving our social relationships with family and  friends, meter our connections to our utility companies, connect us to  educational and healthcare opportunities, this touch-point  between platform, and the web, mobile, and device applications it  powers, is becoming increasingly critical. To businesses this layer  represents critical supply chains, but to each individual this touch  point is where all of our life bits flow--further emphasizing  the importance of, but also the sensitivity required in defining APIs  in a meaningful way, that makes sense to EVERYONE involved.</p>
<p>In 2001, a WSDL definition was very much about communicating what a  service did between platform and an the system that was integrated,  something that only involved IT, and developers. In 2015, a modern API  definition format provides the same benefits that  WSDL has historically delivered, but it is also addressing the  business, and political elements of how Internet enabled software works.  &nbsp;A modern API definition provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>a medium for API designs, architects, and business stakeholders to  craft exactly the API that is needed, before any production code is  written. </li>
<li>a necessary set of instructions needed for a quality assurance (QA) team to make sure an API meets business requirements </li>
<li>a definition of sandbox, mocking, simulation, and virtualization environments that developers may need to be successful </li>
<li>what a developer needs to integrate with another system, or  build an application through interactive documentation, and even  complete Software Development Kits (SDK) </li>
<li>what the API testing, monitoring, and performance groups will need to ensure service level agreements are met or exceeded </li>
<li>the known surface area that security auditor will need to  properly secure the infrastructure web, mobile, devices, and ultimately  users will depend on </li>
<li>a map that government regulators can use to understand the  industry landscape, and help keep all players in alignment with the  nations priorities </li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a sampling of how API definitions are being used as a  driver for what is widely being called the API economy, which is the  heart of cloud, mobile, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and almost  every other technical trend of the last ten years.  While API definitions provide the much needed machine readable  instructions for computers to understand what occurs at these vital API  touch-points, they also provide the much needed human readable  instructions, that people can use to interpret business agreements,  individual relationships, that are playing out across our increasingly  digital lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2015</span>

<p>When it comes to the API space, it always takes numerous conversations with API providers and practitioners, before something comes into focus for me. I've spent five years having <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> conversations, an area that is very much in focus for me when it comes to my own infrastructure, as well as using as a metric for reviewing the other public and private APIs that I review regularly.</p>
<p>While I have been paying attention to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a> for a couple years now (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), in 2015 I find myself involved in 20+ conversations, forcing the topic to slowly come into focus for me, whether I like it or not. When talking to companies and organizations about how they can generate revenue from their APIs, I generally find the conversation going in one of two directions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource</strong> - We will be directly monetizing whatever resource we are making available via the API. Charging for access to the resource, and composing of multiple access tiers depending on volume, and partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - We believe the technology behind the API platform is where the money is, and will be charging for others to use this technology. Resulting in a growing wholesale / private label layer to the API economy.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>90% of the conversation I engage in are focused in the first area, and how to make money off API access to a resource. The discussion is almost always about what someone will pay for a resource, something that is more art than science--even in 2015. The answer is, we don't know until there is a precedent, resulting in an imbalance where developers expect things for free, and providers freak the fuck out--then call me. ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/08/catching-my-breath-on-my-api-monetization-ramblings-before-i-enter-into-some-new-conversations/">As more of my thoughts around API monetization solidfy</a>, a third dimension is slowly coming into focus, one that won't exist for all API providers (especially those without consumers), but is something I think should be considered as part of a long term roadmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exhaust</strong> - Capture, and make accessible the logs, usage, tooling, and other resources that are developed and captured through the course of API operations, and make available in a self-service, pay as you go approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways you can capture the exhaust around API operations, and sell access to it. This is where the ethics of APIs come into play--you either do this right, or you do it in a way that exploits everything along the way. This could be as simple as providing an API endpoint for accessing search terms executed against an API, all the way to providing a franchise model around the underlying technology behind an API, with all the resources someone needs to get up and running with their own version of an API. If you are very short-sighted this could be just about selling all your exhaust, behind the scenes to your partners and investors.</p>
<p>To me this is all about stepping back, and looking at the big picture. If you can't figure out a theoretical, 3rd dimension strategy for making money off the exhaust generated by the resource you are making available via an API, and the underlying technology used to do so---there probably isn't a thing there to begin with. Well, if you can't do this in an ethical way, that you will want to talk about publicly, and with your grandmother, you probably shouldn't be doing it in the first place. I'm not saying there isn't money to be made, I'm say there isn't real value, and money to be made that also lets you also sleep at night.</p>
<p>This opens up a number of ethical benchmarks for me. If you are looking at selling the exhaust from everything to your VC partners, and never open it up via your public APIs, you probably are going to do very well in the current venture capital (VC) driven climate. What I'm talking about, is how do you generate a new layer of revenue based upon the legitimate exhaust, that is generate from the valuable resource you are making available, and the solid technological approach that is behind it. If there is really something there, and you are willing to talk about it, and share publicly, the chances I'm going to care and talk about on my blog increases dramatically.</p>
<p>If you do not have a clue what I'm talking about, you probably aren't that far along in your API journey. That is fine. This isn't a negative. Just get going as soon as you can. If you are further along, and have people and companies actually using your API, there is ap robably a lot of value already being generated. If you partner with your ecosystem, and educate, as well as communicate with end-users properly--I am just highlight that there is a lot of opportunity to be captured in this 3rd dimension.</p>

<p>Amazon did a good job, providing a GUI interface for crafting the methods, resources, and underlying data models for APIs you are deploying using the gateway. However when you <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">compare to some of the GUI API design editors I mentioned in my last post on this subject, from Restlet, APIMATIC, and Gelato</a>, the Amazon interface clearly needs evolve a little more.</p>
<p>AWS is just getting started with their solution, so I'm not knocking what they have done. I just wanted to keep comparing of all of the solutions as they emerge, and highlight the opportunity for some standardization in this layer of API tooling. I see a pretty big opportunity for some player to step up and provide an open source API design editor that provides a seamless experience across API service providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This post is nothing new. I am just trumpeting the call for open API design tooling each time I see another new interface introduced for crafting APIs, their paths, resources, parameters, headers, authentication, and underlying data models. At some point, a new player will emerge with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">the open source API design editor I am looking for</a>, or one of the existing players open sources their current offering, and evolve it in context of the wider API design space, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/we-need-an-open-abstraction-layer-to-help-us-better-define-and-design-our-apis/">providing an abstracted layer that supports all API definition formats</a>.</p>
<p>With the growth in the number of service providers I see stepping up to server the API space, the need for common, open tooling when it comes to API design is only going to grow. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">It took almost four years of waiting for the API management space to figure this out</a>, I'm hoping I don't have to wait as long in the API design side of things.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-monetization-strategy.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of my readers recently reached out to me, in response <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/08/catching-my-breath-on-my-api-monetization-ramblings-before-i-enter-into-some-new-conversations/">to some of my recent stories of monetization opportunities around government and scientific open data and APIs</a>. I'm not going to publish his full email, but he brought&nbsp;up a couple of key, and very important realities of open data and APIs that I don't think get discussed enough, so I wanted to craft a story around them, to bring front and center in my work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most open data published from government is crap, and requires extra work before you can do anything with it</li>
<li>There currently are very few healthy models for developers to follow when it comes to building a business around open data</li>
<li>Business people and developers have zero imagination when it comes to monetization -- aka ads, ads, ads, and more ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>My reader sums it all up well with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I don't dispute that with some pieces of government data, they can be  integrated into existing businesses, like real estate, allowing a  company to value add. But the startup space levering RAW open, or paid  government data is a lot harder. Part of my business does use paid  government data, accessible via an API, but these opportunities the  world over are few and far between in my mind.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think his statement reflects the often unrealized challenges around working with open data, but in my opinion it also the opportunity when it comes to the API journey, when applied to this world of open data.</p>
<p>APIs do not equal good, and if you build a simple API on top of open government data, it does not equal instant monetization  opportunity as an API provider. It will take domain experts (or aspiring ones) to really get to know  the data, make it accessible via simple web APIs, and begin iterating  on new approaches to using the open data to enrich web and mobile applications in ways that someone is willing to pay for.</p>
<p>The reality of taking an open data set, cleaning it up, and then  being able to monetize access to it directly via an API is simply not a reality,  and is something that will only work in probably less than 5% of the  scenarios where it is applied. However this doesn't mean that there aren't opportunities out there when it comes to monetizing adjacent to, and in relationship to the open data.</p>
<p>Before you can develop any APIs that any business or organization would want to pay for you have to add value. You do this by adding more meaningful endpoints that do not just reflect the original data or database resources, and provide actual value to end users of the web and mobile devices that being built--this is the API journey you hear me speak of so soften.</p>
<p>You can also do this by connecting the dots between disparate data-sets, in the form of crosswalks, and the establishing common data formats that can be applied across local, and regional governments, or possibly an industry. Once common data formats and interface models are established, and a critical mass of high value open data, common tooling can begin to evolve, creating opportunities for further software, service, and partnership revenue models.</p>
<p>The illness that exists when it comes to the current state of open data is something partly shared between early open data advocates when it came to over-promising the potential of open data, and their own under-delivery, as well as the governments under-delivery when it came to the actual roll-out and execution around their open data efforts. Most of the data published cannot be readily put to work, requiring several additional steps before the API journey even begins--making more work for anyone looking to develop around it, putting up obstacles, instead of removing them.</p>
<p>There is opportunity to generate revenue from open data published by government, but it isn't easy, and it definitely isn't VC scale opportunity, <a href="http://hdscores.com/">but for companies like HDSCore, when it comes selling aggregate restaurant inspection data to companies like Yelp, there is a viable business model</a>. Companies that are looking to build business models around open data need to tamper down their expectations of being the next Twitter, and open data advocates need to stop trumpeting that open data and APIs will fix all that is wrong with government. We need to lower the bar, and just get to work doing the dirty work of exposing, cleaning up, and evolving how open data is put to work.</p>
<p>It will take a lot of work to find more of the profitable scenarios, and it will take years and years of hard work to get government open data to where it is default, and the cleanliness and uselessness levels are high enough, before we see the real potential of open data and APIs. All this hard work, and shortage of successful models, doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. For example, just because we can't make money providing direct access to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">Recreational Information Database (RIDB),</a> doesn't mean there isn't potentially valuable APIs when it comes to understanding how people plan their summer vacations at our national parks--it will just take time to get there.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> project is purely about the next steps in this evolution, and making valuable government "open data" that has been published as CSVs and Excel, more accessible and usable, by cleaning them up and publishing them as JSON and / or APIs. I am just &nbsp;acknowledging how much work there is ahead of us when it comes to making the currently available open data accessible and usable, so we can just begin the conversation about how we make them better, as well as how we generate revenue to fund this journey.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-loader/">Element Loader from API service provider Cloud Elements</a> came across my monitoring this week, providing a configurable JavaScript application that help simplify data migration, allowing you to move content and data between cloud platforms, by putting their APIs to work.</p>
<p>The Element Loader is interesting to me as an evolution to the concept of what I&rsquo;ve long called <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">API reciprocity</a>, where companies like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> allows you to migrate your bits and bytes between the platforms we are all increasingly finding ourselves dependent on.</p>
<p>I think Cloud Elements is moving the needle forward just a bit, by formalizing a tool that is dedicated to real-time sync, between the platforms you depend on. You can accomplish similar things with Zapier, but I think looking at it purely about sync of specific life bits (objects) can be a very valuable exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been calling this reclaim your domain for a couple years now, where I think the process of identifying the services we depend on is extremely valuable, and one where establishing a plan for how your bits and bytes work in concert, really pushes things into the realm of actually healthy IT operations--for both individuals and businesses.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-loader/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ElementLoaderWorkflow.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I do not have my world synced. My contacts on Google, LinkedIn, and other platforms are totally out of sync, and my documents are spread between Google, Amazon, and Dropbox, without any coherency at all. Don&rsquo;t get me started on my images. This is a real problem, that is only growing, and a segment where I'd like to see more solutions like Element Loader emerge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start tracking on reciprocity providers like Cloud Elements who are doing specific things like sync, which will become one of the common building blocks I&rsquo;ll add to my research when I get the time to update. Hopefully I will find some more time soon to take a deeper look at my my <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API automation and interoperability research</a>--it has been a while.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://learn-more.idxbroker.com/developer-summit/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/idx-summit-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://learn-more.idxbroker.com/developer-summit/">I preparing a talk this week in Portland, OR, at the IDX Developer Summit</a>. IDX serves the real estate industry, providing real estate professionals access to hundreds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service">multiple listing services (MLS)</a> groups, from around the United States. If you are a real estate broker or agent, and you need real estate listings on your site, IDX is how you do this--they are leading player in the space.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with the world of real estate data, it has been long controlled by a network of MLS groups, totaling almost 2000 (I think), spread around the nation. These MLS organizations tightly control their data, deciding exactly who has access to it, and exactly how it can be used, and how it MUST be displayed in print and across the web. This is a process that has long existed, prior to the existence of the web, but since 1995, it is mechanism that has gotten even more strict, and litigious, seeking to maintain their control over a very valuable, and increasingly digital layer of our physical worlds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, the real estate industry is the OG API provider, making data available via FTP locations as soon as the web was a thing. However, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">when it comes to the core principles of what makes APIs work</a>, the real estate industry is the anti-API. MLS hoard facts, something that cannot have copyright applied, but if you are litigious enough, it is something you can defend. The address, and details of residential and commercial property is data that should be accessible to everyone, but MLS groups, and National Association of Realtor (NAR) have created a cartel, that prevents this from ever being a reality. Think what the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and record labels have done to music--the MLS and NAR do this to real estate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/idx-real-estate.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>IDX has struck a balance between hundreds of these MLS organizations, allowing them to process their prized data, and enable real estate agents and brokers to publish this data on their websites using seamless and often embeddable tooling, that adheres to the distribution, and branding guidelines set by the MLS. IDX provides a bridge between the online digital world, and this legacy world of data control, potentially providing the real estate industry with the online tooling they will need to be successful.</p>
<p>Ok, if the MLS, NAR, and real estate industry is the anti-API, what the hell am I doing speaking at a real estate industry developer conference? Well, I was the original tech founder of IDX. ;-) I build the original system for pulling real estate data, targeting the first handful of MLS organizations. I exited the company sometime around 2005, and my technology is long gone (thank god), and my two co-founders have gone on to do some very interesting things, building a thriving company in a very difficult space.</p>
<p>I won't be going to the&nbsp;IDX Developer Summit to talk shit on the MLS and NAR, I will be helping to inspire the developers, about how much opportunity is available out there right now, even in the real estate industry. There are a lot of open data, and Internet of Things related opportunities emerging when it comes to residential, and commercial buildings, as well as neighborhood, and city level development possibilities. My objective is to help them understand the realities of the space they exist in, and still build value within, and around an industry that is so entrenched when it comes to data sharing--it can be done!</p>
<p>I also hope to get them to use my nationwide MLS API, and bypass the MLS and NAR system. Just kidding!! If you have ever worked in the industry, this is the question every newbie asks, "can't I just get access to the nationwide MLS?". ;-)</p>
<p>I am actually really honored to be speaking at the&nbsp;IDX Developer Summit this week. My buddies Chad and Jeff have done some good work, in a very difficult industry--I am proud of them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aws-api-gateway-icon.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I sat down for a second, more in-depth look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a>. When it first released <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/09/the-new-aws-api-gateway-anyone-who-does-not-do-this-will-be-fired-thank-you-have-a-nice-day--jeff-bezos/">I took a stroll through the interface, and documentation</a>, but this time, I got my hands dirty playing with the moving parts, and considering how the solution fits into the overall API deployment picture.</p>
<p><strong>API Design Tools</strong><br /><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home">As soon as you land on the Amazon API Gateway dashboard page</a>, you can get to work adding APIs by defining endpoints, crafting specific methods (paths), the crafting the details of your HTTP resources (verbs), and round off your resources with parameters, headers, and underlying data models. You can even map the custom sub-domain of your choosing to your Amazon API Gateway generated API, giving it exactly the base URL you need.</p>
<p><strong>API Mapping Templates</strong><br />One feature provided by the&nbsp;Amazon API Gateway that I find intriguing is the mapping templates. Using the data&nbsp;models and the mapping template tool, you can transform data from one schema to another. This is very interested when you are thinking about evolving your own legacy APIs, but I'm also thinking it could come in real handy for mapping to public APIs, and demonstrating to clients what is possible with a next version--designed from the outside-in-<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/04/swagger-api-definition-mapper/">mapping is something I've wanted to see for some time now</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Integration Types</strong><br />Up until now, in this review, we are just talking about designing APIs, and possibly mapping our data models together. There are many other ways you can gateway existing systems, databases, and other resources using Amazon API Gateway, but the one that seems to be getting the lions share of the discussion, is deploying APIs with Lambda functions as the back-end.</p>
<p><strong>API Integration Using Lambda Functions</strong><br />Lambda functions give you the ability to create, store, and manage Node.js and Java code snippets, and wire up these resources using the Amazon API Gateway. When you create your first Lambda function, you are given a small selection of blueprints, like a microservice, or db connection, which also allows you to edit your code inline, upload a .zip file, and pull a .zip file from Amazon S3 (where is the Github love).</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM)</strong><br />The Amazon API Gateway gives you some pretty simple ways to secure your APIs using API keys, but then also gives you the whole <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS IAM platform,</a> and resources to put to leverage as well. I think most of the IAM will be more than many API providers will need, but for those that need this, I can see this part of their gateway solution sealing the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling Lambda Functions Behind</strong><br />Being scalable is one of the promises of a Lambda backed API deployed using Amazon API Gateway, which I can see being pretty alluring for devops focused teams. You can allocate each Lambda function to posses the memory it needs, and individually monitor and scale as needed. While I see the recent containerization movement taking care of 50% of the API back-end needs, I can also see that being able to quickly scale individual functions as you need using the cloud, taking care of the other 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Events For Lambda Functions</strong><br />Another powerful aspects of a Lambda function, is you can engineer them to response to events. Using the interface, command line, or API, you can define one or many event sources for each Lambda function. Amazon provides some pretty interesting sources for triggering each Lambda function.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Amazon Kinesis</a></strong> - Real-time data processing</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa Skills Kit</a></strong> -&nbsp;Voice interaction with devices</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a></strong> - Storing mobile user data</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a></strong> - A NoSQL database&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></strong> - Secure object storage</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns">Amazon SNS</a></strong> - Push notification service</li>
</ul>
<p>Those six event sources provide some pretty potent event sources for triggering specific functions in your vast Lambda code library. &nbsp;You can rely on running code stored as Lambda functions using the API you deploy using Amazon API Gateway and / or you can have your code run in response to a variety of these events you define.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Lambda</strong><br />When it comes to defining a back-end for the APIs you deploy using Amazon API Gateway, Lambda is just the beginning. Amazon provides three other really interesting ways to power APIs. I see a lot of potential in managing code using Lambda, and using it to scale the back-end of many APIs pretty quickly, but these areas provide some pretty interesting potential as well.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Proxy</strong><br />A quick way to put Amazon API Gateway to use is as a proxy for an existing API. When you think about the potential in this area, when put mapping templates to work, transforming the methods, resources, and models. I haven't mapped it to any existing APIs yet, but will make sure and do so soon, to better understand the HTTP proxy potential.</p>
<p><strong>Mock Integration</strong><br />Another way to quickly deploy an API is mock your integration, providing a quick API that can be used to hack on, making sure an API will meet developer's needs. You may even want to mock an existing public API, rather than use a live resoure as you are developing an application. There are many uses for mock integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AWS Service Proxy</strong><br />The final way Amazon gives provides for you to power your API(s), is by proxying an existing AWS service. This opens up the entire AWS cloud stack for exposing as API resources, using the Amazon API Gateway. This reminds me of other existing API gateway solutions, except instead of your on-premise, legacy infrastructure, this is your in the cloud, more recent infrastructure. I'm guessing this will incentivize many companies to migrate their legacy infrastructure into the cloud, or at least make it cloud friendly, so you can put the AWS service proxy to use--lots of possibilities here.</p>
<p><strong>Defining The Stages Of Your Lifecycle</strong><br />Going beyond the types of integration you can employ when crafting, and deploying APIs using the Amazon API Gateway, the platform also provides a way to define stages that APIs will exist in from design, development, QA, production, or any other stage you wish. I like the concept of having a stage defined for each API, designating where it exists on the API life-cycle. I tend to just have dev and prod, but this might make me consider this a little more deeply, as it seems to be a big part of defining the API journey.</p>
<p><strong>API Monitoring By Default</strong><br />Amazon has built in monitoring by default into the API Gateway, and Lambda functions. You can connect APIs, and their designated integration back-end to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/">CloudTrail</a>, and monitor everything about your operations. CloudTrail is very much a cloud infrastructure logging solution over API analytics solutions, but I could see it evolve into something more than just monitoring and logging, providing an overall awareness of API consumption. Maybe an opportunity for the ecosystem to step in via the API(s).</p>
<p><strong>CLI An API For The API Gateway</strong><br />You have to admit, Amazon gets interfaces, making sure every service on the platform has a command line interface as well as an API. This is where a lot of the API orchestration magic will come into play in my opinion. The ability to automate every aspect of API design, deployment, management, and monitoring, across your whole stack, using an API is the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There Are Some Limitations</strong><br />There are some <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/limits.html">current limitations of the Amazon API Gateway</a>. They limit things to 60 APIs maximum per AWS account, 300 resources maximum per API, 10 stages maximum per API, and 10-second timeout for both AWS Lambda and HTTP back-end integration. They are just getting going, so I'm sure they are just learning how people will be using the API deployment and management infrastructure in the cloud, and we'll see this evolve considerably.</p>
<p><strong>What Will This Cost?</strong><br />Lambda is providing the first 1 million requests per month for &nbsp;free, and $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter, or $0.0000002 per request. The Amazon&nbsp;API Gateway costs&nbsp;$3.50 per million API calls received, plus the cost of data transfer out, in gigabytes. It will be interesting to see what this costs at scale, but I'm sure overall, it will be very inexpensive to operate like other AWS services, and with time the cost will come down even further as they dial it all in.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/amazon-api-gateway-screen.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>AWS API Gateway Has Me Thinking</strong><br />I won't be adopting AWS right away, I'd prefer to watch it evolve some more, but overall I like where they are taking things. The ability to quickly deploy code with Lambda, and use blueprints to clone, and deploy the code-behind APIs, has a lot of potential. Most of my APIs are just simple code that either returns data from a database, and conducts some sort of programmatic function, making Lambda pretty attractive, especially when it comes to helping you scale and monitor everything by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">My original criticism of the platform still stands</a>. Amazon is courting the enterprise with this, providing the next generation of API gateway for the legacy resources we have all accumulated in the cloud. Something that really doesn't help large companies sort through their technical debt, allowing them to just grow it, and manage it in the cloud. Win for AWS, so honestly it makes sense, even though it doesn't deliver critical API life-cycle lessons the enterprise will need along way to actually make change.</p>
<p>This is a reason I won't be getting hooked on Lambda + Amazon API Gateway anytime soon, because I really don't want to be locked into their services. I'm a big fan of my platform employing common, open server tooling (Linux, Apache, NGINX, MySQL, PHP), and not relying on specialty solutions to make things efficient--I rely on my skills, and experience and knowledge of the resources I'm deploying, to deliver efficiency at scale. My farm to table approach to deploying APIs, keeps me in tune with my supply chain, something that may not work for everyone.</p>
<p>While the tooling I use may not be the most exciting, it is something I can move from AWS, and run anywhere. All of my APIs can easily be recreated on any hosting environment, and I can find skills to help me with this work almost anywhere in the world. After 25 years of managing infrastructure, I'm hyper-aware of lock-in, even the subtle moves that happen over time. However, my infrastructure is much smaller than many of the companies who will be attracted to AWS Lambda + API Gateway, which actually for me, is another big part of the API lesson and journey, but if you don't know this already, I'll keep it to myself.</p>
<p>I'd say AWS gives a healthy nod to the type of platform portability I'm looking for, with the ability to import and export your back-end code using Lambda, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/07/introducing-swagger-importer-easily-import-swagger-api-definitions-into-amazon-api-gateway/">and the ability to use API definitions like Swagger as part of Amazon API Gateway emerge</a>. These two things will play a positive role in the overall portability, and interoperability of the platform, but doing this for the deeper connections made with other AWS services, will be a lot harder to evolve from if you ever have to migrate from AWS.</p>
<p>For now, I'll keep playing with Amazon API Gateway, because it definitely holds a lot of potential for some very powerful API orchestration, add while the platform may not work for me 100%, AWS is putting some really interesting concepts into play.</p>

<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/call-for-papers/">There is a little more than 24 hours left for you to submit your talk for APIStrat in Austin, TX, this November 18th, 19th, and 20th</a>. With this sixth edition of APIStrat, we are taking things back to our roots, and not choosing a theme, but making it a conversation about the most important topics in the space facing API providers and consumers in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From looking at the talks that have been submitted so far, API definitions, design, and Internet of Things seems to be leading the pack. We've also seen a couple session talk submissions that we think are probably more worthy of being keynotes, because they are just that good.</p>
<p>The APIStrat team feels like 400 people is the sweet spot when it comes to having a productive API discussion, so we chose a venue that fits this vision, which will most definitely sell out. Check out the sponsors who have already lined up, and we have only announced two keynotes (more coming this next week).</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/call-for-papers/">Make sure and submit your talk before tomorrow night, so that you are part of the conversation</a>. Also, make sure you jump in and &nbsp;sponsor the event, as we are already looking at closing off one tier of sponsorship--<a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/contact/">contact us today if you want to get in on the action.</a></p>
<p>We'll see you in Austin!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My last rant of the evening, I promise. Then I will shut up and move back to actual work instead of telling stories. I'm working on my <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> project, processing&nbsp;<a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/geographic-distribution-of-va-expenditures-fy2013">a pretty robust spreadsheet of Department of Veterans Affairs expenditures by state</a>. As I'm working to convert yet another spreadsheet to CSV, and then to JSON, and publish to Github, I can't help but think, "where is the save as JSON" in Microsoft or Google Spreadsheets?</p>
<p>I can easily write scripts to help me do this, but I'm trying to keep the process as close to what the average person, who will be adopting a government agency data set, will experience. I could build a tool that they could also use, but I really want to keep the tools required for the work as minimal as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would just be easier if Microsoft and Google would get with the program, and give us a built in feature for saving our spreadsheets as JSON.</p>

<p>I had a reinder on my task list to check-in on where some of the common database platforms were when it came to APIs. I think it was a Postgres announcement from a while back that put the thought in my notebook, but as an old database guys I tend to check-in regularly on the platforms I have worked most with.</p>
<p>The point of this check-in, is to see how far along each of the database platforms are when it comes to easy API deployment, directly from tables. The three relational database platforms I'm most familiar with are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SQL Server - </strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa174556(v=SQL.80).aspx">The platform has APIs to manage</a>, and you <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg192995.aspx">deploy an OData service</a>, as well as <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-dotnet-rest-service-aspnet-api-sql-database/">put .NET to work</a>, but nothing really straightward, that would allow any developer to quickly expose simple RESTful API.</li>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> - I'd say PostgreSQL is furthest along with thier "early draft proposal of an extension to PostgreSQL allowing clients to access the database using HTTP", as they have the most complete information about how to deploy an API.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong> - There was a <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/09/MySQL-RESTLabs">writeup in InfoQ about&nbsp;MySQL offering a REST API</a>, but from what I can tell it is still in <a href="http://labs.mysql.com/">MySQL Labs</a>, without much movement or other stories I could find to show any next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The database that drives my API platform is MySQL running via Amazon RDS. I haven't worked on Postgres for years, and jumped ship on SQL Server a while back (my therapist says I cannot talk about it). I automate the generation of my APIs using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim framework</a>, then do the finish work like polishing the endpoints to look less like their underlying database, and more like how they will actually be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe database platforms shouldn't get into the API game? Leaving API deployment to the API gateway providers like <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a> and <a href="http://blog.dreamfactory.com/add-a-rest-api-to-any-sql-db-in-minutes">DreamFactory</a>. It just seems like really low hanging fruit for these already used database solutions, to make it dead simple for developers to expose, and craft APIs from existing datasources.</p>
<p>if you are using any database to API solutions for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL, please let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://pages.3scale.net/api-design-provider-guide-wb.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design-providers-guide.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There was a pretty interesting conversation around API design going on in one of my API slack channels over the last couple days, about what is API design, and what is needed to get developers, and even non-developers more aware of the best practices that exist. It is a private group, so I won't broadcast it as part of this post, but I did want to extract a narrative from it, and help me set a bar for other API design discussions I am having.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Restafarian, hypermedia, and linked data folk have long been frustrated by the adoption of sensible API design practices across the sector, and the lack of basic HTTP literacy among developers, and non-developers is at dangerously high levels. The good news, is some of this is beginning to change, but we still have so much work to do, something that won't be easy, and unfortunately it won't always have the clean outcomes leaders in the space are looking for.</p>
<p>APIs returning JSON is just the next step in the evolution of the web, and when you consider how much work it took to get everyone on-board with HTML, and building web pages, then web apps, and recently mobile apps, you can begin to understand the work that still lies ahead. We have to help the next generation of developers be more HTTP literate (something the previous generations of developers aren't), and possess a baseline knowledge of common API design best practices. This needs to be done in a world where many of these developers really aren't going to care about the specifics of good API design, like us API architects and early pioneers have.</p>
<p>The average API designer in the future will not always be willing to argue about the nuance of how to craft URLs, whether to use a header or parameter, caching, and how to version. They just want to get the outcome they seek, accomplish their project, and get paid for their work. Consider the solar industry as a quick comparison. The first wave of installers were domain experts, while the following waves of installers who will be focused on scaling and maintaining the industry, will only need to be trained on only what is required to get the job done in a stable, profitable way.</p>
<p>Ok. So how do we do this right? I feel like we are already on the good path. We just need you to publish your own API design guide somewhere that we can all learn from, like other leading API providers already present in<a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html"> my API design research</a>. As we build a critical mass of these, we need to also work to aggregate the best practices across them, so that instructors and textbook publishers can incorporate into their curriculum. If you have an API platform, and have ever wished that there were more highly skilled API designers out there, make sure you have your API design practices documented, and shared with the world.</p>
<p>This will get healthy API design practices out of the trenches of startups, SMBs, enterprise, and government agencies, and get it into the educational institutions around the world. Then we can start equipping the next generation of programmers with the knowledge they will need to be successful in delivering the resources need for the next generation of Internet powered apps, networks, and devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to add on emore thing. API service companies who are looking to provide tooling that API providers can use to do deploy APIs, will have share in the load here. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">This is core to my criticism of the AWS API Gateway, in that I applaud their use HAL, but please make sure you also provide a healthy dose of hypermedia literacy along the way, don't just hide it behind the curtain</a>. I really do not want to see the another FrontPage for APIs, so if you are building an API editor, let me know so I can provide you with some ideas. (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">1</a>) (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">2</a>).</p>
<p>We all have a lot of work to do, in preparing the next generation of developers, and business users when it comes to a baseline of HTTP literacy, as well as a healthy dose of API awareness. We are going to need an army of API designers to help us deliver on the API economy we are all seeing in our heads--so let's get to work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/crafting-and-publishing-api-design-guide-shows-that-you-are-further-along-in-your-api-journey/">If you do not have a formal API design strategy get to work on one (let me know if you need help)</a>.

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears-questions.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have two more conversations kicking off on the topic of API monetization, so I just needed to take a moment to gather up the last wave of posts on the subject, catch my breath, and refresh my overall thoughts in the area. What I really like about this latest wave, is that they are about providing much needed funding for some potentially very important API driven resources. Another thing is that they are pretty complicated, unproven approaches to monetizing APIs--breaking ground!!</p>
<p>Over the last couple weeks, I have be engaged in four specific conversations that have shifted my gaze to the area of API monetization:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/30/is-your-monetization-rooted-in-the-resource-or-experience-side-of-your-api-operations/">Audiosear.ch</a>&nbsp;- Talking with the PopupArchive team about making money around podcast search APIs.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;As I think through the approaches above, I'm pushed to exercise what I can from these discussions, on my own infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/05/expanding-on-my-api-monetization-strategy-and-research/">My API Monetization</a>&nbsp;- As I look to add more APIs to my stack, I'm being forced to clearly define all the moving parts of my API monetization strategy.</li>

</ul>
<p>The API Evangelist network is my research notebook. I search, re-read, and refine all the thoughts curated, and published here. It helps me to aggregate areas of my research, especially in the fast moving areas, where I am receiving the most requests for assistance. Not only does it refresh my memory of what the hell I've written in the last couple weeks, I also hope it gives you a nice executive summary in case you missed anything.</p>
<p>If you are looking for assistance in developing your API monetization strategy, or have your own stories you'd like to share, let me know. If you have any feedback on my stories, including feedback for the folks I'm talking to, as well as items missing from my own API monetization approach, or blockchain delusions--let me know!</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-pricing.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I believe in the ability of APIs to pull back the curtain of the great OZ, that we call IT. The average business and individual technology consumer has long been asked to just believe in the magic behind the tech we use, putting the control into the hands of those who are in the know. This is something that has begun to thaw, with the introduction of the Internet, and the usage of web APIs to drive applications of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn't just that we are poking little holes into the corporate and government firewall, to drive the next generation of applications, it is also that a handful of API pioneers like Amazon, Flickr, Twitter, Twilio, and others saw the potential of making these exposed resources available to any developers. The pulling back of the curtain was done via these two acts, exposing resources using the Internet, but also inviting in 3rd parties to learn about, and tap into these resources.</p>
<p>Something that is present in this evolution of software development, is trust. API providers have to have a certain amount of trust that developers will respect their terms of service, and API consumers have to have a certain amount of trust that they can depend on API providers. To achieve this, there needs to be a healthy dose of transparency present, so API providers can see into what consumers are doing with their resources, and API consumers have to be able to see into the operations, and roadmap for the platform.</p>
<p>When transparency and trust does not exist, this is when the impact of APIs begin to break down and they become simply another tech tool. If a platform is up to no good, has ill intentions, selling vapor ware, or there is corruption behind the scenes, the API concept is just going to create problems, for both provider and consumer. How much is exposed via an API interface is up to the API designer, architect, and ultimatley the governing organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-shipping-container.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are many varying motivations behind why companies open up APIs, and the reasons they make them public or not. APIs allow companies to keep control over their data, content, and algorithmic resources, while also opening them up so "innovation" can occur, or simply be accessible by 3rd party resources to bypass the historical friction or bottleneck that is IT and developer groups. Some companies I work with are aware of this balance being struck, while many others are not aware at all, they simple are trying to make innovation happen, or provide access to resources.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.com/blog/">As I spend some brain cycles pondering algorithmic transparency, and the recent concept of "surge pricing" used by technology providers like Uber and Gogo</a>, I am looking to understand how APIs can help pull back the curtain that is in front of many algorithms impacting our lives. in the same way APIs have pulled back the curtains on traditional IT operations, and software development. As part of this thought exercise I'm thinking about the role Docker and other virtualized contaniners can play in providing us with more transparency in how algorithms are making decisions around us.</p>
<p>When I deploy one of my APIs using my microservices model, it has two distinct API layers, one for the container, and one for what runs inside of it. Docker comes ready to go with an API for all aspects of it operations--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">here is an Swagger definition of it</a>. What if all algorithms came with an API by default, just like each Docker container does? We would put algorithms into containers, it would have an interface for every aspect of its operation. The API wouldn't expose the actual inner workings of the algorithm, and its calculations, but provide a complete interface for all its functionality.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithm-flow.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>How much of this API a company wished to expose, would vary just like with APIs, but companies who cared about the trust balance between them, their developers, and end-users, could offer a certain amount of transparency to build trust. The API wouldn't give away the proprietary algorithm, but would give 3rd party groups a way to test assumptions, and verify the promises made around what an alogorithm delivers, thus pulling back the curtain. With no API, we have to trust Uber, GoGo and other providers about what goes into their surge pricing. With an API, 3rd party regulators, and potentially any individual could run tests, validating what is being presented as algorithmic truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know many companies, entrepreneurs, and IT folks will dismiss this as bullshit. I'm used to that. Most of them don't follow my beliefs around the balance between the tech, business, and politics of APIs, as well as the balance between platform, developer, end-users, and what I consider to be an invetiable collison with government regulation. For now this is just a thought exercise, but it is something I will be studying, and pondering more, and as I gather more examples of algorthmic, or "surge pricing", I will work to evolve these thoughts, and solidify into something more presentable.</p>

        <p><a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-monetization-strategy.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This is a full walk-through of me trying to distill down my approach to API monetization, in a way that can be applied across not just 30 APIs, but potentially 300, or 3000. There are several things converging for me right now, which includes the maturing of my own infrastructure, as well as conversations I'm having with startups, enterprise groups, federal government agencies, and my own partner(s).</p>
<p>I need to keep hammering on this to help me operate my own infrastructure, but I am also partnering with <a href="http://apiware.io/">APIWare to help me deliver on much of the API design, deployment, and management</a>, so I need to have a good handle on my costs. As with all of my areas of research, within the area of <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> I am just trying to get a handle on the common building blocks, and provide a checklist of considerations to be employed when I'm planning and operating my API infrastructure.</p>
<p>To help me build a base, let's walk through some of the building blocks of my own API monetization strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition</strong><br />What do I have invested into any single API. Even if I am building something from scratch, what went into it? Every API I possess has some sort of acquisition cost, even if it is just $14.00 for the two pints of beer I bought while I was brainstorming the idea.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover -&nbsp;</strong>What did I spent to find this. I may have had to buy someone dinner or beer to find, as well as time on the Internet searching, and connecting the dots.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong>&nbsp;- What time to I have in actually getting access to something. Most of the time its on the Internet, and other times it requires travel, and meeting with folks.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong>&nbsp;- There is a chance I would license a database from a company or institution, so I want to have this option in here. Even if this is open source, I want the license referenced as part of acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong>&nbsp;- Also the chance I may buy a database from someone outright, or pay them to put the database together, resulting in one-time fee, which I'm going to call "purchase".</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a framework for me to think about the acquisition of each API resource I possess, makes it easier for me to think it through when I am brainstorming new API ideas. Something that makes sure I am tracking all details from the moment of inception, to when I commit to actually making it available via an API on my platform.</p>
<p><strong>Development</strong><br />What does it actually take to stand up an API. There are a lot of moving parts with making an API happen, and not all of them are technical. Am I willing to invest the time necessary to stand up an API or will it require outside investment, as well as resources. What is needed to take an API from acquisition to actual operation?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment -</strong>&nbsp;Who put up the money to support the development of this API resource? Was it internal, or did we have to take external investment.</li>
<li><strong>Grant -&nbsp;</strong>Was the development of this API rolled up in a grant, or specifically a grant for its development. Covering costs involved.</li>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong>&nbsp;- What does it take me to cleanup, and normalize a dataset, or across content. This is usually he busy janitorial work necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;- What does it take me to generate a Swagger and API Blueprint, something that isn't just auto-generated, but also has the required hand polish it will require.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong>&nbsp;- How much work am I putting into setting up the database. A lot of this I can automate, but there is always a setup cost involved.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong>&nbsp;- Defining the amount of work I put into setting up, and configuring the server to run a new API, including where it goes in my overall operations plan.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>&nbsp;- How much work to I put into actually coding an API. I use the Slim PHP framework, and using automation scripts I can generate 75% of it usually, but there is always finish work.</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong>&nbsp;- What was the overhead in me defining, and configuring the DNS for any API, setting up endpoint domain, as well as potentially a portal to house operations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically when it came to APIs, I just dove into writing code with little consideration for what went into it. I'd say this is one by-product of the microservices way of thinking, is that I decoupled the moving parts of each of my APIs, allowing me to approach development in this way. I'm sure I will keep slicing off other elements within the development process as I progress.</p>
<p><strong>Operation<br /></strong>What goes into keeping an API operational, reliable and available? How much do I spend on all aspects of an existing APIs lifecycle to make sure it meets the standards of API consumers. Ideally operational costs go down the more efficient the platform gets with overall operations, reducing overhead, and streamlining across everything.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>&nbsp;- How much resources am I applying to creating and maintaining APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprint definitions for my APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of my AWS compute is dedicated to an API. Flat percentage of the server its one until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>&nbsp;- How much on disk storage am I using to operate an API? Could fluctuate from month to month, and exponentially increase for some.</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>&nbsp;- How much bandwidth in / out is an API using to get the job done.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of API management resources is dedicated to the API. A flat percentage of API management overhead until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Code -</strong>&nbsp;What does it cost me to maintain my code samples, libraries, and SDKs for each individual API, or possibly across multiple APIs and endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong>&nbsp;- How much energy do I put into evangelizing any single API? Did I write a blog post, or am I'm buying Twitter or Google Ads? How is the word getting out?</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is surface area for monitoring?</li>
<li><strong>Security -</strong>&nbsp;What does it cost for me to secure a single API, as part of the larger overall operations? Does internal resource spend time, or is this a 3rd party service.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization -</strong>&nbsp;What am I spending on virtualization for an API, as part of QA process, for retail sandbox and simulation environments, or for specific partner needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally the more APIs you operate, the more detail you will get about each of these areas, and some of these areas you should get better deals, the more volume you run through each area listed above. Example of this would be with compute and storage costs going down, as we do more business. The more we understand the details of operations, the more we can optimize operations.</p>
<p><strong>Access Levels<br /></strong>What sort of access levels are we going to provide across <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL APIs</strong></span>, not that all APIs will use all areas, but we should be ready for as many scenarios as we possibly can. We need to be clear of what access is the free layer, as well as the tiers of access, and any wholesale, partner, or re-sellers aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free (unlimited) -</strong>&nbsp;This is just a free API, I won't be rate limiting the usage of it. It will act similar to any website I put out there, but instead of HTML it is JSON.</li>
<li><strong>Free Trial&nbsp;</strong>- I am only going to offer a limited use, or time period for access a resource, giving just a taste test, but won't be in main pool of APIs available.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Not For Profit -&nbsp;</strong>This API is being subsidized somehow. Either there is direct investment from internal or external resources to subsidize or there is a grant involved.</li>
<li><strong>Educational Access -&nbsp;</strong>Is this API available as an educational resource, with special pricing for students and teachers? This will usually be reflected in the tier, and credit availability.</li>
<li><strong>Tier(s) -</strong>&nbsp;Which of these service tiers is an API available in, and which endpoint paths + verbs are accessible in the tier (api-pricing definition).      
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- General access, you usually don't even need a key. Only limited to specific APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Retail</strong>&nbsp;- This is the pay as you go level for public acess to all APIs. This is where the retail side of business operations will occur.</li>
<li><strong>Trusted</strong>&nbsp;- These are just a handful of trusted individuals or companies, who may have write access to some endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Education -&nbsp;</strong>Providing a specific access tier for education partners, including students, teachers, and institutions. Providing higher levels of free access, and lower price points.</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong>&nbsp;- These are partners I have prearranged agreements with, something I will be transparent about, showcasing them on partner page.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale</strong>&nbsp;- The wholesale, often non-rate limited portion of my platform, where I deploy APIs in other people infrastructure, or our own for flat fees.</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong>&nbsp;- This is all internal access by applications I build for my own usage. I still rate limit, and manage this access, I just give myself different privileges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Partner Program -</strong>&nbsp;A structured program allowing API consumers to achieve higher levels of access, with reduced pricing levels, flat rate access, and other benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Reseller Program -</strong>&nbsp;A structured programming for allowing API consumers to prove themselves, and share in revenues from API usage, affiliate links, and revenue share.</li>
</ul>
<p>My intent around access levels is to be as transparent as possible. Not all users will access at all levels, and not all APIs, and their endpoints will be available within at all access levels. The goal is to optimize access, remain as open as makes sense, while also sensibly monetizing resources to cover costs, and make a fair profit.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing &amp; Credits<br /></strong>I am employing a universal credit system that will be used by all APIs. The goal is to expand the unit of currencies I employ beyond just API calls, and attach a universal unit of value that can be applied across all APis. API consumers will be given a certain amount of API credits to be used each day, as well be able to buy and sell credits at various rates.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Value</strong>&nbsp;- Each API will have its own credit rate set, where some will be one credit, while others may be 100 credits to make a single call, it can be defined by API or a specific endpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Limit -&nbsp;</strong>The daily allowed credit limit will be determined by the access level tier is registered at, starting with daily free public access to retail, trusted, and potentially custom tiers.</li>
<li><strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;- How many credits does any one user use during a day, week, or month, across all APIs. When each API is used, it will apply the defined credit value for the single API call.</li>
<li><strong>Incentive</strong>&nbsp;- How can the platform give credits as an incentive for use, or even pay credits for writing to certain APIs, and enriching the system, or driving traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase -</strong>&nbsp;What does it cost to buy a credit, something that could fluctuate from day to day, week to week, or month to month.</li>
<li><strong>Buyout -&nbsp;</strong>Allow API consumers to get paid for the credits on their account, preferably all users are encouraged to spend credits, but buyout is an option.</li>
<li><strong>Discounts</strong>&nbsp;- Can we give discounts when you buy credits through specific channels, promotions, or other type of planned deal.</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong>&nbsp;- Are there volume discounts for buying of credits, allowing consumers to purchase credits in bulk, when they need to and apply when they desire.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Applying</strong>&nbsp;- Can you wait to apply credits you have accumulated? Given the option with each billing cycle to apply, or you may want to wait and use at future date.</li>
</ul>
<p>I envision credits being the lifeblood of the API monetization strategy for my platform, and would love to see it spread beyond any single API ecosystem, and be something that all providers could put to work. The benefits of this would be seen by both API provider, as well as consumers, in helping us establish a currency for the API economy.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Value Generation<br /></strong>What value is generated via API operations that isn't directly monetized, but driving value in other ways. These indirect value generators are often overlooked, and under-showcased areas of operation, often resulting in API failure--always showcase the buzz.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle -</strong>&nbsp;Having an API is cool these days, and some APIs are worth just having for the PR value, and extending the overall brand of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Web or Mobile Traffic -</strong>&nbsp;The API exists solely for distributing links to web and mobile applications, driving traffic to specific properties - is this tracked as part of other analytics?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -</strong>&nbsp;Applying a brand strategy, and using the API to incentivize publishers to extend the reach of the brand and ultimately the platform - can we quantify this?</li>
<li><strong>Data &amp; Content Acquisition -</strong>&nbsp;Using the API, and the applications built on top as part of a larger data and content acquisition strategy--can we quantify this?</li>
</ul>
<p>I could see data and content acquisition grow into an area we can better quantify soon. Putting a base value on each resource in the system, and figure out how much each resource grows in size, and quality over time. Applying value to these indirect areas is something I'd like to expand upon in future iterations.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Revenue Generation<br /></strong>Ideally any platform should be sharing the revenue and value exhaust generated via the ecosystem, providing revenue opportunities for web, and mobile application developers. There are a handful of ways revenue can be shared via API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link Affiliate -&nbsp;</strong>What revenue is generated and paid out via links that are made available via the API, with potentially externally affiliate links embedded.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Share -</strong>&nbsp;What portion API revenue is paid out to potential re-sellers who drive API usage. Revenue is percentage of overall credit purchases / usage.</li>
<li><strong>Credits to Bill -&nbsp;</strong>All revenue is paid in credits on account, and user can decide to get buy out of credits at any time, or possibly use in other aspects of system operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be expanding on these areas in the future, as I play with ways to incentivize content or data creation, or just driving API consumption well into the paid tiers. Right now many API platforms I study are essentially sharecropping plantations, reaping the value generated from developer activity. In the future, developers should be incentivized with cash and credit to help achieve platform monetization goals, which is something I want to explore via my own API resources when I have the bandwidth.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Revenue Generation<br /></strong>Where are we making money? What revenue is generated across the platform, and then what are the breakdowns. I want to understand who my rockstar users and applications are, something that isn't isolated to external users. I am looking to craft all of my applications as individual citizens within the API ecosystem, measuring and limiting what type of access they have, and treat them like any other consumer on the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for a specific user, for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for a specific application,&nbsp;for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Tiers -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Which tiers generate most usage and revenue? I should be applying just as easily to aspects of platform / internal usage as well.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate Revenue -</strong>&nbsp;What was generated from affiliate links made available via APIs, minus what percentage was paid out to API consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Revenue -&nbsp;</strong>What advertising revenue was derived from web or mobile application traffic resulting from the API, minus whatever was paid out as rev share to API consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of my platform is not simply to make money. Sure I like making money, but I'm looking to flush out a reproducible framework for hanging each API, and making sense of it as part of my larger API platform operations. Not all APIs will be created equally, but I should be able to equally measure what it costs to develop, and operate, and apply consistent ways of generating revenue around its use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this looks intimidating when you scroll back through. However my goal is to produce a standardized pricing page that can exist across all of my API ecosystem(s), which are growing in number, and prompting me to think in this way. I need a better handle on my costs, and ultimately be able to generate more revenue to keep me with a roof over my head, food on the table, and my AWS bill paid.</p>

<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">While I only have a single API portal right now</a>, I'm preparing to deploy a specific collection using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and publish as version 2.0 of my API Evangelist developer portal. I'm also looking to immediately publish a few other API portals, designed to support various collections or stacks of APIs available in my network (images, API definitions, etc.). I need a standard way to deliver on-boarding, and pricing for the APIs, and this backend framework gives me the v1 approach to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each API that I launch will have a pricing page, with each of the available service tiers as a box, and within each box it will list how many free credits you get each day, and other features available like per credit rate beyond the daily allowed limit, support elements, and other relevant details to that tier. There should also be links to more detail about partner, re-seller, and wholesale options for each API portal I launch. The API consumer never sees all of this. This framework is for me to hang each API upon, and think through it in context of the overall API lifecycle and platform operations.</p>
<p>I'm applying this outline to the 30 APIs I have in my stack, and then also applying it to a handful of new data APIs I'm working on. Along the way I will flush it out a little more, before I get to work on some of the more advanced pieces like a partner and re-seller programs. I'm not a big fan of advertising, but I do have some single page apps that perform pretty well, and it wouldn't be too intrusive to have some advertising on them. All of these SPAs are driven by my APIs, and they often exist as tools across my API driven content network as well.</p>
<p>This post will be published to my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization research</a>, and this list will be published as common building blocks, that can be considered as part of any API monetization strategy. It makes me happy to see this portion of my research finally move forward, and evolve, especially since its based upon my own platform goals, as well as my wider monitoring and review of the space.</p>

<p>I have had this discussion several times now, in the dark corners of bars in San Francisco, Paris, Berlin, and Barcelona. It is something I just want to make sure is published on my site, as part of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/05/expanding-on-my-api-monetization-strategy-and-research/">my latest expansion of my API monetization research</a>. I'm rolling out a standardized credit system as part of my API operations, and using my API service composition layer to apply credit usage as part of each API call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My objective is to make it easy as possible to buy and even sell credits via my platform, and easily apply those credits across any API I publish, in a variety of access tiers. As I think through this, I can't help but start thinking about how this can play out on a larger scale. Meaning, how do we get API providers to adopt a universal API credit system, so you could buy and sell credits anywhere, use them on any API platform, and transfer them between platforms.</p>
<p>Every time I think about this topic, I end up at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)">blockchain</a>. It just makes sense that we would use blockchain technology establish a currency that could be used as fuel for the API economy. The blockchain ledger could be used to manage API credit exchanges, but also could be used to store other relevant details that could impact API driven transactions in real-time. With the most important piece being about interoperability, and the fact that you can use in any API ecosystem.</p>
<p>An API world, where you could generate credits on one platform, and transfer them for buying of API calls on another platform, opens up some pretty interesting API driven scenarios for me. Not many platforms pay developers to use APIs, most are just free, or charging per API call. There isn't much incentive for API providers to shell out cash, to incentivize API consumers, but when you could pay in credits, that were transferable, it might change the dynamics.</p>
<p>Honestly, I am not very knowledgeable on the blockchain. It is something I've only recently started educating myself about it. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/05/expanding-on-my-api-monetization-strategy-and-research/">I'm also still mapping out my own API monetization strategy, and gathering my thoughts on an API credit system that is based upon my needs, but it is something that is also rooted in my monitoring of common API platforms</a>. I have a lot to learn about the blockchain, and have numerous details to work out as part of my larger API monetization strategy, but I wanted to at least put this out there, and make sure it is part of my API monetization conversations and storytelling in the future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-map-pricing.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It has been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/history-of-apis--google-maps-api/">almost 10 years since Google launched the Maps API</a>. With as many APIs as Google have, you'd think they'd have a better handle on a standard approach to pricing across all of them. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/history-of-apis--google-maps-api/">As we've seen with Google Translate, they have struggled with the right way of pricing APIs, as well as communicating this to their developer ecosystem.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2015/09/introducing-more-flexible-option-to.html">This week Google took further steps on the road to standardizing how you pay for Google Maps API, opening up pay as you go purchasing via the Google Developer Console</a>. Here is how they put it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In this new purchasing structure, the Google Maps Geocoding, Directions, Distance Matrix, Roads, Geolocation, Elevation, and Time Zone APIs remain free of charge for the first 2,500 requests per day, and developers may now simply pay $0.50 USD per 1,000 additional requests up to 100,000 requests per API per day. Developers requiring over 100,000 requests per day should&nbsp;contact us&nbsp;to purchase a premium licence.</em></p>
<p>It is good to see Google run with some pretty standard pricing, and running with something in line with what other API providers are putting to work. Just like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-20/">Google worked to standardize OAuth 2.0 across the APIs</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">get their approach to API management organized via the developer console</a>, it looks like they are now working hard to get their API pricing in order.</p>
<p><span>I still see many API providers struggle with API pricing, both large and small. Many of the larger API providers do what Google did, and offer a free access level, and then once they need to generate revenue they shut things down, or tighten things up, rather than just offering a clear path to paying for resources. This approach has fueled the debate around whether you can depend on APIs, and also whether or not a freemium approach to APIs will work at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Another common stumbling block I see API providers trip over when it comes to pricing, is a disconnect between each level of access, meaning there is a freemium layer, and there are paid tiers of access, but there is no even steps between them, making it impossible for many developers to traverse. This generally makes a clear statement that it is ok to play with our API, but you really need to be the enterprise to actually do business with us.<br /></span></p>
<p>This is all something that can be mitigated with a clear, pay as you go, pay for what you use API model with a free tier of access, and sensibly tiered paid levels of access, as well as a robust, transparent partner program for higher levels of needs. There are plenty of models out there to follow when crafting your own <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> strategy, so make sure you something in place from day one, even if you are tweaking along the way like Google has had to do.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://blog.dwolla.com/simple-integrated-ach-payouts/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/dwolla-white-label-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you have heard any of my talks at <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/api-docker">API Days Sydney</a>, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYR7A0r598c">Barcelona</a>, or at Gluecon in Colorado this year, you've heard me talk about wholesale APIs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">how I am using Docker to help make some of my APIs available for use as private or white label APIs.</a> The concept of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/">white label, private label, or wholesale API</a> is something I've been talking about for a while, and is something I am starting to see more of in the wild.</p>
<p>The most recent sighting is from payment API provider Dwolla, with <a href="http://blog.dwolla.com/simple-integrated-ach-payouts/">four new API endpoints that deliver a white label&nbsp;ACH payout API solution</a>. According to the announcement from Dwolla, the white label API solution will:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"..leverage Dwolla&rsquo;s existing infrastructure&mdash;our fraud analysis, bank partnerships, real-time fraud analysis, communication protocols and more&mdash;while maintaining your brand&rsquo;s look, feel, and name on end-user interactions. This functionality will provide platforms a powerful, flexible, and custom ACH infrastructure at a fraction of the cost and time."</em></p>
<p>When you use the Dwolla white label ACH payout API,<em> "there are no individual transaction fees or percentages&mdash;regardless of how many times you, your business, or your application transfers money". </em>Providing a pretty interesting alternative to the common, pay for what you use business model used by man API providers today.</p>
<p>I predict this approach to API deployment will become more common place in coming years. Many developers, and API consumers will be quite content just calling your regular retail API, but more specialty, and larger partners are going to want the functionality you offer, but are not going to want to be metered for each API transaction.</p>
<p>When I deploy wholesale, or white label versions of my APIs I will not be charging for each API call, however I will still be managing API access, and usage with my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, because I still want to be able to get analytics, and other awareness generated via my API management layer. The cost of each wholesale API installation will depend on the scope of the instance, whether it is in our infrastructure, or yours, and how much ownership <a href="http://apiware.io">me and my APIware team</a> will have in API operations.</p>

<p>I'm always on the hunt for API driven solutions that will help the average business user be more exposed to the power of APIs. It is common for us technologists to kick up dust, and get all excited about what we build, when in reality, it doesn't mean anything to the average person in the real world--after 25 years in business, I still do this regularly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why, having a constant reminder to look for solutions that bridge the technical world of APIs, to the average business users world, helps me break free from my own biased approach. When I lean back in my chair, and think about what solutions are currently available in the space, that have this potential, these are the two companies.</p>
<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="200" align="center"><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/blockspring-logo.png" alt="" width="150" /></a></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both of these platform speak API, but more importantly they speak spreadsheet and forms, two of the most common dialects spoken by the average business user today. I'm closely working with both groups to better understand how they can communicate what they do to the business world, and repeatedly the examples in play are not focused on API, they are focused on solutions that make sense to the end user, but just happen to be API driven.</p>
<p>While much of the API design, deployment, management, and integration services and tooling that has evolved over the last five years will play a significant role in providing the API base we will need for the API economy, services like Blockspring and Form.io will bridge the critical last mile to the average user. These two companies are making APIs accessible via the most ubiquitous client out there, the spreadsheet, and helping average users understand what an API is, and what they do, through another ubiquitous interface, that almost everyone gets--the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to take a moment to highlight the importance of these types of services and tools, among the wealth of other companies I am highlighting.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I setup individual research projects, is to provide me with a structure for better defining each aspect of the API world, something I am working hard to jump-start within my <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security research</a>. You will notice the project does not have any building blocks defined, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">which when you compare with one of my oldest research areas</a>, you start to see what I mean.</p>
<p>The blog posts, and other links I curate as part of my API security will help me find companies and tools that are providing value to the space. As I break down each company, and what they offer, I often have to read between the lines, in trying to understand how an API, service, or tool can be used by API providers, as well as potentially API consumers. I am looking for APIs that offer security, but also APIs that offer security to APIs--make sense?</p>
<p>As part of this research, I am playing with <a href="https://metacert.com/">Metacert</a>, which bills itself as &nbsp;a security API for mobile application developers, helping them block malicious ads, phishing links &amp; unwanted pornography inside apps, but I think it is so much more. I could see Metacert being pretty valuable to API providers, as well as API consumers building web and mobile apps. Security isn't always about brute force attacks, and could easily just be in a simple link, added with some content, via your API.</p>
<p>I am adding Metacert to my API security research, with a focus on its potential to API providers. I could see API providers seamlessly integrating <a href="https://metacert.com/api-documentation/getting-started/">the Metacert API</a> into their own stack, processing all links that are submitted through regular operations. I will also be adding link screening like this as a building block to my API security research.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a wise investment in the API security space, you should be talking with Metacert. APIs like Metacert provide us with a model for thinking about how we deliver API driven security services for web, mobile, and IoT applications, but it also provides a potential wholesale API layer that other APIs can use to better secure their own APIs. I consider it a strong blueprint, because its API driven, they have all the essential building blocks, which includes a monetization strategy, and they do one thing, and they do it well.</p>

<p>As I make my way across my research projects, I'm learning more about how <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/01/breaking-down-the-layers-of-api-security-and-considering-link-integrity/">companies like Metacert can deliver valuable security services to API providers</a>. I'm also getting a better idea of the nuance that goes into monitoring APIs, from <a href="http://apifortress.com/landing/">API Fortress</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apifortress.com/even-billion-dollar-brooklyn-companies-arent-perfect/">API Fortress has very interesting API monitoring story, derived from the Etsy API</a>. This isn't the API monitoring story you'd think, it isn't about the overall stability of the Etsy API, and whether its up or down, it is about the details of API payloads, and inconsistencies they found scanning the API.</p>
<p>Through a payload toast of the Etsy API, the API Fortress team found an occurrence of NULL values in 3,600 out of 50,100 items scanned--which negatively affected what results that were actually accessible via the API vs the Etsy interface. Something that can result in loss of exposure for products, translating into reduced sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While full API outages are definitely front and center when you think about monitoring, things like this could potentially drain revenue over a long period of time, in a way that makes it very difficult to discover. I can only imagine, when you are doing things at the scale Etsy is, this kind of monitoring could plug some pretty big holes in your sales bucket.</p>
<p><a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API Fortress is already part of my API monitoring research</a>, but just like with API security, I am going to add content analysis, and pattern matching like this as building blocks for API monitoring. After I make my way through all of the current companies I have listed in my API monitoring, I will publish the master list of common building blocks I've collected.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-nose-disguise.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am always pleased to see API providers publishing Swagger definitions, and using them to drive their interactive documentation. Projects like the&nbsp;<a href="http://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System API</a>, are getting on the API definition bandwagon, and this is a good thing. I have been pushing API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint since 2012, but in 2015, while I want to keep on-boarding folks to the concept of using API definitions for interactive documentation, but I also want them to also understand that their APIs definition will be used in other areas of API operations as well.</p>
<p>Most people think <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> is the documentation, and have not been able able to separate the specification from the interactive documentation. I think <a href="http://apiary.ioo">Apiary</a> has done a better job of this separation with the separation of <a href="http://apiblueprint.com">API Blueprint</a> from Apiary. As an API provider, you may not have evolved to a full API-first level of operation, which is ok, but I encourage you to make your Swagger or API Blueprint definition as accessible as possible, so your API consumers can put to use in other ways--even if you don't have the time.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw that the&nbsp;<a href="http://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System API</a>&nbsp;employed Swagger for their documentation, the next thing I wanted to do was also use in my <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman client</a>. While the Swagger UI provides me with a hands-on way of getting to know the GCIS API, I have to come back to the site to play with more, and it doesn't give me as much detail about how the API works, as my Postman client does. All GCIS API team has to do, is publish a text or image link to <a href="/admin/blog/view-source:http:/data.globalchange.gov/api_reference.json">their Swagger definition</a> in a prominent location, so it is obvious to us consumers.</p>
<p>I get easily reverse engineer the Swagger UI, using my Google Developer tools, but it is a couple of extra steps for me, that stands in between me, and making calls to the GCIS API in my local Postman Client. Interactive API documentation via Swagger and Apiary has significantly moved the API definition conversation forward, but <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/thinking-beyond-just-language-specific-clients-and-also-speaking-the-formats-popular-http-clients-are-using/">just like we should be thinking beyond just language specific clients, we also need to be enabling our API consumers to speak the formats popular HTTP clients like Postman speak</a>.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-padlock.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security</a>, there are a number of things to consider, something I will be be working to define, and share as part of my ongoing research. However there are three building blocks that are front and center in most security conversations--SSL, API keys, and OAuth. SSL is a must-have, and OAuth is fast becoming a must-have when there is personal data involved, but I still encounter numerous misconceptions around the role API keys actually play in security.</p>
<p>API key, and its accompanying secret are a common way to secure API access. You require developers to register for an account, create a new application, and they are then given an application key, plus a secret that is passed along with each API call. You cannot call the API, without passing in your API key and secret. This act alone, is what people view as the security role API keys are playing, and I get a number of questions if this is truly secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No it is not. Looking for two values being passed with each API call, really doesn't do that much. The actual security of your platform requires a much higher level, IT view of security (which I won't go into here), with API keys being just one tool in your security toolbox. Where keys do play a huge role, is around the awarness that is introduced, of who is accessing what, and managing how much they can access (aka mitigating how much damage is done, when there is a breach).</p>
<p>This short sighted views of API keys is why many companies feel they can just roll their own API management solution, and why many API developers and architects think the keys themselves possess some magical security pixie dust. The actual power comes from your awarness of the resources you are exposing via APIs, organizing into coherent service tiers, applying meaningful rate limits on these resources, and evolving your detailed awareness of who is accessing your resources, how much they are using, and when.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An API key and its companion secret offer very litle security, but the awarness they bring when you have a modern API management layer in place, can bring huge security benefits to the table. Something that will not prevent every security breach, but with the right mechanisms in place you can be alerted of breaches in real-time, and dramatically limit the extent of their damage, when they do occur.</p>

<p>While there are numerous examples of APIs that successfully offer more than one option when it comes to the content types their API returns, the concept is missing from the large portion of the APIs I review. When I see good examples of this in the wild, I try to make time to showcase, and share, to help with the HTTP literacy of my readership.</p>
<p>One API which is rocking several fronts when it comes to API design for me, is the&nbsp;<a href="http://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System</a>, which interestingly is an alliance between government agencies, not something born out of Silicon Valley. When requesting resources from the GCIS API, the following HTTP accept headers are honored:</p>
<ul>
<li>application/json</li>
<li>application/x-turtle</li>
<li>text/turtle</li>
<li>application/n-triples</li>
<li>text/n3</li>
<li>text/rdf-n3</li>
<li>application/ld-json</li>
<li>application/rdf+xml</li>
<li>application/rdf+json</li>
</ul>
<p>When integrating with the GCIS API, it all begins with some&nbsp;basic JSON, but then look at all the other linked data goodness in there! JSON-LD, RDF, Turtle!! Discovering APIs that support robust content type negotiation like this can be hard to find, most APIs don't talk about it, so even if they do, there is no way to know about it. Thankfully the&nbsp;GCIS API shares it via email, as well as describes in the <a href="/admin/blog/view-source:http:/data.globalchange.gov/api_reference.json">GCIS Swagger definition</a>, which is how I learned about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content-Type negotiation is one of those HTTP literacy areas that need a lot of discussion, helping on-board API newbies to the power and possibilities that are present here, and that you can go beyond just plain ol JSON, and receive much richer API responses.</p>

<p>I'm immersing myself in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks">Data	Sharing	and	Open	Data	for	Banks</a>, published by&nbsp;the HM	Treasury	and	Cabinet	Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom,&nbsp;"to explore how competition and consumer outcomes in UK banking could be affected by banks, giving customers the ability to share their transaction data with third parties using external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)."</p>
<p>While I do not think an open API standard will ride into town like a white knight, saving England from all its banking problems, I do think there is a lot of good that will come from this effort. The banks have a lot of technical debt, corruption, and many other issues to deal with before APIs will even work, but I think there is enough pressure on them right now from consumers, and startups, that they will have to change at some point--or die.</p>
<p>As I look for evidence of movement around an open API standard online, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413766/PU1793_Open_data_response.pdf">I came across the response to the government proposal back in March</a>. I thought there was a lot to learn from in these responses, not just for banks, but for any company that is struggling with a coherent API strategy. You can read the document yourself--here are the specific responses.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits and risks of an open API standard&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.1 The first set of questions in the call for evidence invited views on the benefits and risks of an&nbsp;open API standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.2 The vast majority of the respondents supported the development of an open API standard,&nbsp;and respondents agreed that there are many potential benefits of an open API standard in UK&nbsp;banking. The most commonly cited benefits were increased competition and innovation in&nbsp;banking, a greater degree of consumer choice in financial services, and the development of new&nbsp;and better services tailored to customers that can enhance the overall efficiency of banking. The&nbsp;government also repeatedly heard that an open API standard would result in customers feeling&nbsp;more empowered to engage with their banking or financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.3 However, many respondents also recognised that there are risks that could arise from an&nbsp;open API standard. One concern that was raised was the risk that an individual (to whom the&nbsp;data belongs) may not have meaningful control over the exchange of the data between third&nbsp;parties and financial institutions. Respondents from the technology industry and the banking&nbsp;industry cited risks around privacy of customers&rsquo; data and the potential for fraudulent use of&nbsp;data. In line with this, the need for appropriate security and vetting systems for third parties was&nbsp;regularly mentioned in the submissions received. In addition, responses received from the&nbsp;payments and banking industries explained that an open API standard should avoid &lsquo;locking in&rsquo;&nbsp;a set of standards which cannot be enhanced or restrict banks from their own innovations, and&nbsp;that it should be compatible with European legislation.&nbsp;<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Development of an open API standard&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.4 The next set of questions in the call for evidence considered the process for the development&nbsp;of an open API standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.5 The government asked what it could do to facilitate the development and adoption of an&nbsp;open API standard. The majority of respondents said that that the government has a key role to&nbsp;play in coordinating between the banking industry and the fintech community, and driving&nbsp;forward the design of the open API standard, particularly in relation to the development of the&nbsp;standards around data security and confidentiality. Respondents predominantly from the fintech&nbsp;community also explained that government has a role in helping to educate customers to&nbsp;understand the privacy and security issues surrounding an open API standard, and the steps that&nbsp;can be taken to mitigate those risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.6 The government questioned who should play a role in the development of an open API&nbsp;standard, who should be able to make use of it and how it should be used. The government&nbsp;received responses suggesting various different institutions could be involved in the&nbsp;development of an open API standard. These include banks and other financial institutions; the&nbsp;British Standards Institute and International Standards Organisation; the Financial Conduct&nbsp;Authority; the Bank of England; the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office; the British Bankers&rsquo;&nbsp;Association; the Payments Council; the European Banking Authority; data security experts;&nbsp;software developers; fintech businesses and the government. Submissions from the fintech and&nbsp;technology business said that the open API standard should be available to be used by everyone,&nbsp;subject to the appropriate vetting procedures, and not restricted to those who banks have existing relationships with or can afford to pay for access. The banks agreed that appropriate&nbsp;security vetting procedures should be developed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.7 In response to the question on the cost of developing an open API standard, the&nbsp;government received a variety of estimates ranging from negligible costs to tens of millions of&nbsp;pounds. Several respondents from all industries explained that they were unsure of the cost of&nbsp;delivering an open API standard, or that it was difficult to predict how much it would cost,&nbsp;because much of the detail of the design of the open API standard remains to be agreed. Many&nbsp;respondents also highlighted that the costs were likely to vary greatly between institutions.&nbsp;Software and app developers, however, explained that costs may be lower than anticipated&nbsp;because some banks have already developed their own external APIs and so are not starting&nbsp;from a blank sheet of paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.8 The government asked questions on how long it would take to deliver an open API&nbsp;standard. While there was a degree of variation in the responses, broadly respondents were in&nbsp;agreement that 1 to 2 years was a reasonable timescale to develop and deliver an open API&nbsp;standard in UK banking, although more in depth responses explained that the timescale for&nbsp;delivery would be clearer once the design specification of the open API standard is more&nbsp;defined.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.9 The government also asked what issues would need to be considered in relation to data&nbsp;protection and security. Respondents highlighted that customers must at all times be in control&nbsp;of which third parties they grant access to their bank data and for how long, how that data can&nbsp;be used and the level of granularity of data that can be assessed. The banking industry and&nbsp;many technology firms said that third parties should be appropriately vetted before being able&nbsp;to access customer bank data, and a permissions list of authorisations and authentications&nbsp;should set out all approved third parties. One technology company added that the degree of&nbsp;access to customers&rsquo; bank data could be tiered according to the level of security standards met&nbsp;by the third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.10 The government invited views on the technical requirements an open API standard should&nbsp;meet and adhere to. Respondents put forward a number of recommendations, the most&nbsp;popular options involved such requirements as HTTP, JSON, XML, OAuth, REST5 and Cloud&nbsp;based architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also found the government responses to be equally valuable:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.1 It is clear from the vast majority of responses received during the call for evidence that the&nbsp;benefits of an open API standard are numerous and widely recognised. The key benefits that&nbsp;were identified by respondents were an increase in consumer choice, more competition in&nbsp;banking and an enhanced process, experience and outcome for consumers. Respondents&nbsp;strongly emphasised their support for the delivery of an open API standard in UK banking.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.2 While much of the detail of an open API standard is still to be agreed, it is evident that an&nbsp;open API standard can be designed in a way which meets requirements around data protection&nbsp;and security, and at reasonable cost. The majority of respondents also said that developing an&nbsp;open API standard to a timescale of 1 to 2 years would not be unreasonable.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.3 Respondents from the financial industry and the technology industry were aware of the risks&nbsp;that an open API standard could bring to consumers such as data privacy and the possibility of&nbsp;fraudulent use. It was made clear, however, that these risks are largely addressed through&nbsp;existing data protection laws, and can be mitigated through detailed planning and meticulous&nbsp;scoping of the open API standard design.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.4 Submissions to the call for evidence also made clear that the publication of more open data&nbsp;in banking can have benefits to customers and financial institutions, and help to boost&nbsp;competition. The government, however, notes that steps will need to be taken to ensure the&nbsp;appropriate degree of data security and protection to customers is maintained.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.5 The government is therefore committing to deliver an open API standard in UK banking, and&nbsp;will set out a detailed framework for the design of the open API standard by the end of 2015.&nbsp;The government will work closely with banks and financial technology firms to take the design&nbsp;work forward and, as part of those discussions, will also take forward ideas to introduce more&nbsp;open data in banking for the benefit of customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.6 Delivering an open API standard in UK banking will help to drive more competition in&nbsp;banking for the benefit of customers, and enable fintech firms to make use of bank data on&nbsp;behalf of customers in a variety of effective and creative ways. It will ensure that the UK remains&nbsp;a global hub and a world-leader for financial technology and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think 3.5 is the most important:&nbsp;<em><strong>The government is therefore committing to deliver an open API standard in UK banking, and&nbsp;will set out a detailed framework for the design of the open API standard by the end of 2015.</strong></em></p>
<p>Let's get to work. I'm setting up my monitoring to track on things as they roll out, and hopefully provide a blueprint that can be employed here in the U.S. I'd love to see similar work come out of our Department of Comerce, but I guess, as with other aspects of the open data and API movement here in the U.S., we will be following a UK lead.</p>

<p>Late in 2014, the HM	Treasury	and	Cabinet	Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks">published Data	Sharing	and	Open	Data	for	Banks</a>,&nbsp;"to explore how competition and consumer outcomes in UK banking could be affected by banks, giving customers the ability to share their transaction data with third parties using external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)."</p>
<p>Very similar to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Obama open data mandate in May of 2012</a>, &nbsp;I saw a lot of discussion shortly after the release of the document from the HM	Treasury, but not many details on how things are going so far. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413766/PU1793_Open_data_response.pdf">There was a response to the document published back in March</a>, which holds some interesting perspective, but not much else from the government, or banks, that I can find.</p>
<p>It is only August, I'm sure we'll see more activity this fall and into 2016, when it comes to standardizing banking APIs in the UK. I've tracked on efforts like the <a href="https://www.openbankproject.com/">Open Banking Project</a> for a while now, but I think what is potentially happening in the UK is worth me taking things up a notch or two. To help me, I will setup a banking research project, which will push up banking and related APIs in my daily and weekly monitoring, something I can review regularly, and maybe push back on some key players to get more information on where things are. Establishing an official research project really helps me find the key players, both individual and companies, which in turns increases the amount of information I gather as part of my research.</p>
<p>If you work for a bank that does business in the UK, or possibly for the government, I'd love to hear your thoughts, even if it is off the record. I'm hopeful for what can occur in the UK, but I'm also eyeballing the effort as a potential blueprint that the rest of the world could follow. I know the banking industry suffers from some crippling legacy technical debt, and are slowed by government regulations, but I'm pumped about the potential after reading through the Data Sharing and Open Data for Banks again--we will see a significant shift in the next five years, when it comes to how we manage our money.</p>

<p>I enjoy what I do, but when I embarked on my API Evangelist journey in 2010, I set myself on a mission to educate people about the business of APIs, and highlight that it isn't just the technology that makes APIs a thing. I have worked hard to distill down what it takes to execute an effective API management strategy into usable advice that anyone can run with when crafting an API strategy.</p>
<p>As I conduct my monitoring of the API space, It makes me feel accomplished, when I find my work cited, influencing important API related projects. This just occurred to me as I was taking a fresh look at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks">Data	Sharing	and	Open	Data	for	Banks</a>, published by&nbsp;the HM	Treasury	and	Cabinet	Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom. As I was reviewing the document I happened to search for apievangelist (I know, I'm vain)--I was pleased to find a single citation to my work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Reference 152 -&nbsp;</strong>Thirdly, making the most	out	of	external	APIs	involves	providing	on-going	support	to	the	developers	and	third	party	organisations	that	make	use	of	them.	Good	API management	can	involve	providing	samples	of	code,	a	curated	support	forum,	a	sandpit	with	dummy	data,	an	up	to	date	blog,	FAQs	and	more.</p>
<p>It isn't much, but it is a nod to my work, that helps validate what I've been studying for the last five years--the business of APIs. For me, this isn't about recognition, its about knowing I'm making an impact, and I'm influencing policy, and helping companies, institutions, and government agencies understand API best practices. Little mission accomplished, I'm contributing a small piece to potentially improving the UK banking system, which is something that will undoubtedly spread beyond just England.</p>
<p>Ok, celebration is over. Nice job Kin. Back to work. There is too much to be done.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-monetization.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm almost to the point with <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">my API stack</a>, where I can start plugging in new APIs I have planned. Up until now, the APIs i have deployed, are of little use to a wider commercial audience. However some of the APIs I have planned for the next year, I'm looking to monetize their usage, and operate as part of a larger commercially viable API stack. (practice what I preach baby!)</p>
<p>To run this stack, I need a plug and play way to define what an API is costing me, and potentially how much revenue I am generating from each API. With this in mind, here is my draft look at an API monetization framework, that I am employing across my API Stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition</strong> (One Time or Recurring)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<strong> </strong> 
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover - </strong>What did I spent to find this. I may have had to buy someone dinner or beer to find, as well as time on the Internet searching.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong> - What time to I have in actually getting access to something. Sometimes its time, and sometimes it costs me.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong> - There is a chance I would license a database from a company or institution, so I want to have this option in there. Even if this is open source, I want the license referenced.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> - Also the chance I may buy a database from someone outright, or pay them to put the database together, resulting in one-time fee.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Development</strong> (One Time or Recurring)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong> - What does it take me to cleanup, and normalize a dataset, or across content. This is usually he busy janitorial work necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> - What does it take me to generate a Swagger and API Blueprint, something that isn't just auto-generated, but also has a hand polish to it.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> - How much work am I putting into setting up the database. A lot of this I can automate, but there is always a setup cost.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Defining the amount of work I put into setting up, and configuring the server to run a new API, including where it goes in my operations plan.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> - How much work to I put into actually coding an API. I use the Slim PHP framework, and using automation scripts I can generate 75% of it usually.</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong> - What was the overhead in me defining, and configuring the DNS for any API, setting up endpoint domain, as well as potentially a portal URL.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Operation</strong></strong></strong> (Recurring)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> - What percentage of my AWS compute is dedicated to an API. Flat percentage of the server its one until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> - How much on disk storage am I using to operate an API? Could fluctuate from month to month, and exponentially increase for some.</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> - How much bandwidth in / out is an API using to get the job done.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - What percentage of API management resources is dedicated to the API. A flat percentage of API management overhead until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong> - How much energy do I put into evangelizing any single API? Did I write a blog post, or am I'm buying Twitter or Google Ads? How is word getting out?</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is surface area for monitoring?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Pricing </strong></strong></strong></strong>(Recurring)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tier(s) -</strong> Which of the 7 service tiers is an API available in, and which endpoint paths + verbs are accessible in the tier (api-pricing definition).</li>
<li><strong>Credit(s) -</strong> How many credits does an API use when any single endpoint is engaged, specified as entire endpoint or individual paths + verbs (api-credit definition).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong> 
</ul>
<p><strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Revenue </strong></strong></strong></strong>(Recurring)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong> - How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for a specific user, for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for a specific application,&nbsp;for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am looking for this framework to help me set pricing, and rate limits for any API I publish. My goal is to rapidly make available some valuable databases, and more functional APIs using common open source software, available for free, but also generate enough revenue from high volume users, to run the whole thing. To do this, I need to understand exactly what an API is costing, allowing me to set a price, with the intent of breaking even, and then generating some revenue where it makes sense.</p>
<p>As part of this work I will be generate an APIs.json type I am calling <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com">api-pricing</a>, which I am looking to help be balance out consumption across my API stack. Using my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a> I am able to easily add and subtract credits for API usage across users, and apps, then handle the billing based upon what pricing I have set for all my API usage.</p>
<p>My pricing will not just be about retail usage. Some of my APIs I will be deployed in other people's infrastructure, and letting them control the pricing, credits, and service composition. This is the wholesale layer to my strategy, allowing me to go beyond my own internal usage, by B2D usage, and open up new opportunities for API deployment and consumption.</p>
<p>As with most of my work, I'm going to be very transparent about my pricing, making sure it is indexed within each APIs.json file, and available alongside each APIs Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collection, and API Science monitor--encouraging wider consumption, and processing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-abstraction.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I walked around San Francisco with Jakub Nesetril (<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, Wednesday evening, talking about the API space. Eventually we sat down in Union Square, continuing our conversation, which is something I wanted to further process, and blend with some existing thoughts I'm working through. Much of our conversation centered around the need for an open abstraction layer for API design, which would reduce the focus on Swagger vs. API Blueprint vs. WADL vs. RAML vs. any other API definition, and make it just about defining and designing our APIs.</p>
<p>Jakub is right, I'm sure he'd love everyone to use API Blueprint (which thousands are), but it is more important to him that people just use API definitions, and commit to a healthy API design strategy. This line of thinking is in alignment with other thoughts I'm having around there being a&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">common open source API design editor,</a>&nbsp;which I'd like to use as vehicle to get us closer to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my vision of a perfect API design editor</a>.</p>
<p>I see an abstraction layer consisting of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Import</strong>&nbsp;- We need to be able to import ANY API definition format we desire.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong>&nbsp;- We need to be able to export ANY API definition format we desire.</li>
<li><strong>Viewer</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;We a code view for ANY API definition format we want to look at while working.</li>
<li><strong>Editor</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;We a visual, GUI editor that is all about visual API design, WYSIWG editor for APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>The import, export, and viewer should work as an API, and the API editor should be a simple, well design JavaScript tool that can be embedded anywhere. The back-end API stack should be available in PHP,Python,Ruby, Node.js, Go, C#, and Java flavors, with a docker image anyone can deploy within their own infrastructure. This should be all about abstracting away the complexities of each individual format, and focus on delivering a simple, yet robust API design editing experience.</p>
<p>API definition format owners should be able to maintain importing, exporting, and viewing layers via some sort of plug-in architecture--meaning the platform is about API definition, the WSDL, WADL, Swagger, API Blueprint, RADL, RAML, Postman Collection, and other formats should be owned by each respective owner. The Open API Abstraction project could provide a single architecture for everyone to plug into, with an emphasis on building the best possible API design editing experience possible.</p>
<p>The Open API Abstraction tooling could be baked into any API service or tooling in the space, allowing the next generation API service providers to focus on what they do best, and not having to build out their own API design editor, while &nbsp;also baking in compatibility for all API definition formats by default. Such a layer would allow API architects and designers to craft APIs in a consistent way, no matter what API definition format designers and developers might be speaking, opening up a wider world for communicating and collaborating through the API design process.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-postman.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was given an introduction to the Microsoft Graph&nbsp;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/develop-office-graph">A concept being applied to Office 365 APIs</a>, other Microsoft APIs, and potentially beyond, to map out segments of users and every day objects. As I learn more about this unifying, graph API effort, I will write more, but this particular story is about how we communicate around the first steps taken by developers when integrating with any API. As an API provider, how you talk about integration, and craft your on-boarding resources, can significantly impact how developers view your resources, something that I think still will always need some work across the space.</p>
<p>After being introduced to the Microsoft Graph APIs, we were given a list of code resources, that we could use to hack against the API. The API integration overview had all the modern elements of API integration, with C#, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, and other "coming soon" libraries. The resource toolkit, even had a sandbox account we could use, helping us on-board with less friction. While this approach is very progressive for the Microsoft world I've known, evolving us beyond the endless sea of C# focused WSDLs we all have seen historically, I would like to point what I think should be the next step in our evolution.</p>
<p>It makes me happy that we now speak in multiple programming languages, and provide sandbox or simulation environments. +1 What I'd like to see next, is that we also speak more HTTP, than just language specific clients. I'd like to see these types of API on-boarding toolkits start providing a Postman Collection for the API, or even better, a Swagger or API Blueprint definition that can allow me to not just on-board using the HTTP client of my choice, like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, <a href="https://luckymarmot.com/paw">PAW</a>, or <a href="http://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia REST</a>. I agree that we should be speaking the native language of the developers we are courting, but I like to nudge things forward, and encourage speaking a more generic language of HTTP, for those of us who program in many different languages.</p>
<p>Just like being multi-lingual with APIs has moved us out of our web service silos, I'm hopeful that if more developers speak HTTP, it will help move us into the future, where API developers are more HTTP literate, are are really leveraging the strengths of HTTP, or even better--HTTP/2 in their everyday worlds. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">I started including Postman collections, along with my Swagger definitions, for my APIs</a>.&nbsp;I'm also working to include API Blueprint, and other API definition formats, something that will allow potential API consumers to onboard using my language specific libraries, or the HTTP client of their choice.</p>

<p>I'm processing all of my thoughts from some travel to the big city of San Francisco. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/crafting-and-publishing-api-design-guide-shows-that-you-are-further-along-in-your-api-journey/">I was providing feedback on Microsoft's API design guide, as part of the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group</a>. As I was thinking about the journey Microsoft is on, the role of the API design guide, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">how many other companies like Paypal, and Cisco, are on the same journey</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In parallel to this, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I am on my own journey with my own API stack</a>, I've been looking at everything from a slightly different perspective than many other analysts and providers in the space. When I started in 2010, it was all about API management, then after folks kept asking me about options for deploying APIs I expanded my monitoring to API deployment. Then Jakub the CEO of Apiary, moved the dial back ruth on the life-cycle, and got me paying attention to the concept of API design.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2015, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">I am paying attention to almost 20 separate areas, as part of my core API research</a>. I tune into a number of other areas, but these research projects make up the heart of my API storytelling. On the trip back from San Francisco today I had a few thoughts, and needed to organize them in context of my core research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry, I don't mean to be a downer. But...we are just getting started with stabilizing how we do APIs. I feel like we are beginning to formalize how we manage or APIs (thanks Mashery, 3Scale, and APIgee), and we are getting a handle on API deploy (thanks Restlet, Amazon), and we are deep into understanding how we define (thanks Swagger and API Blueprint), and ultimately design (thanks Apiary, Restlet, and Apigee).</p>
<p>We are moving fast into testing, monitoring, performance, and virtualization (thanks Runscope, APITools, API Science, and SmartBear), but our security sucks, embeddability has stagnated, and evangelism and discovery really isn't improving. I'm working on APIs.json, and bringing together the Swagger and API Blueprint communities, but there is so much work left when it comes to discovery, and automating each of the areas listed above.</p>
<p>There really is no point to this post. It is my mental vomit, after a trip to San Francisco, and working on Microsoft's API design guide. Stay tuned for how any of this applies to anything.</p>

<p>I spent all day Wednesday, at Microsoft offices in San Francisco, providing feedback on the Microsoft API design guide, as part of the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group. The OneAPI team had already done most of the hard work in hammering out the API design guide, by working with the API leadership from groups across Microsoft--we were just brought in to provide outside perspectives.</p>
<p>A group of about 20 of us, spent the entire day walk through the high levels of the Microsoft API Design philosophy. The Microsoft OneAPI design guide is a draft, so they aren't ready for us to share it publicly, something we'll see in the near future. However, document being ready or not, the process showed me that Microsoft is really working hard to get their API design strategy house in order. They had worked hard to iterate through all the common areas of API design, with their various teams--even some of the more controversial areas like versioning.</p>
<p>I did not feel like I had a lot to contribute to the process. They have some really good API designers, and there was plenty of high quality API design talent in the room, to provide the feedback they wanted. When Microsoft is ready for more of the management, evangelism, and other areas more in the business and politics of APIs, I will have much more to bring to the table. I did however, provide some insight that I think could help the overall process, and will continue to provide feedback--which is why I'm gathering my thoughts in this series of posts.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design-guide.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Prior to me participating in the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">I had just published the API design guides for Cisco and Paypal, as part of my API design research</a>. Bringing the number of API design guides to 9, which is a good sign the space is getting more serious about standardizing how we do API design. For me, there are two important things going on here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company Journey </strong>- The companies own API journey, allowing them to collaborate and craft a single API design philosophy, with the intent of making it a company-wide initiative.</li>
<li><strong>Publicly Sharing </strong>- Declaring to the public, this is how we design APIs. Something that allows others to learn from, and merge with their own API design philosophy--benefiting the entire space, while also establishing leaders and followers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crafting a document that defines how a company builds software is nothing new. However, APIs aren't just about building software, they are about defining your companies resources, and when you work to standardize how you define your resources as APIs, you are focusing on the core of your business. Next comes the value when building websites, web and mobile applications, and potentially devices as well. Getting your API design house in order, is all about standardizing how you speak API across your company, something that touches every product and service, and is the foundation for your corporate digital strategy.</p>
<p>My participation in the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group gave me a unique glimpse at the API strategy unfolding at Microsoft. While there is still a lot of work to be done, the fact that they are working on a central API design strategy demonstrates to me they are further along in their API journey than I thought they were. Where are you in your own API journey? Does your organization have an API design guide? How do you share this knowledge across your organization, and with the public?</p>
<p>As I monitor the API space, I am always looking for the signals of a healthy API strategy, and I think, when I see a formal API design guide present for any company that I track on, I am going to tack on a couple extra points. A polished, publicly shared API design guide shows organizations are a further along in their overall API journey, than other companies in the space, who are still trying to figure things out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/warewolf-esb-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Making sure APIs that are available via the enterprise service bus, affectionately known as an ESB, more discoverable, accessible, and consumable via the open Internet, is one of the many challenges organizations will face along their API journey. Striking a balance between internal APIs, and public APIs, even if they aren&rsquo;t open to the wider public, and only partners, is proving to be a big challenge for many enterprise groups I am engaged in conversations with.</p>
<p>When Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I developed <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, an open API discovery format, we were focused on bringing solutions to the table that were focused on API discovery on the open Internet. We knew that the format could also assist in more controlled environments, like within the enterprise, but wanted to focus on the wider discussion first. Our primary focus is making indexing the current landscape of publicly available APIs, using APIs.json, so that we can make available via <a href="http://apis.io">our open source search engine APis.io.</a></p>
<p>We have been working with other <a href="http://wso2.com">API service providers like WSO2 to integrate into their enterprise offerings</a>, but pretty much leaving the enterprise landscape to craft its own APIs.json driven solutions. <a href="http://warewolf.io/ESB-blog/swagger-apisjson-support/">So it pleases me to see that Werewolf ESB has integrated not just Swagger into their open source ESB solution, but also APIs.json.</a> Any service you expose through the Warewolf ESB security layer, will automatically be published in an APIs.json file--additionally these services will also have a Swagger file generated, providing you a machine readable definition for the surface area of each exposed API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warewofl ESB's usage of APIs.json is exactly what we had envisioned when it comes to providing API discover solutions, for APIs that originate within the enterprise. In this scenarios, APIs.json is acting as a portable, machine readable, JSON definition of what APIs can be found via an company, or organization's ESB. The availablity of Swagger makes these services consumable, as soon as they are discovered via the APIs.json index--showing what is possible when you combine APIs.json with Swagger.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with exactly how Warewolf ESB manages the security layer for APIs on the bus, but I'd like to learn more, so I can help organizations craft not just single APIs.json indexes, but develop meaningful collections, and begin to broker the resources they are making available via any ESB on their network, in more intelligent ways. The Warewolf release has jump started me brainstorming more around the possibilities for API discovery when it comes to the enterprise, using APIs.json--thanks Warewolf, very nice work!</p>

<p><a>I am slowly making my way through defining of&nbsp;</a><a href="http://theapistack.com/">the APIs available in the API Stack</a>, beginning with <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the APIs that I depend on to operate API Evangelist</a>. The best way to understand any API in my opinion, is to create a <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger definition</a> for it, as well as an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json file</a>, indexing the overall API operations. Since my mission is all about understanding APIs, this is something I try to do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Creating an APIs.json file allows me to index each APIs operations from registration and documentation, to pricing and terms of service. Then I work to break down every possible unit of value represented by an API's endpoints, reducing it down to the minimum viable element possible--something that Swagger allows me to do nicely.</p>
<p>Here is what I ended up with for AngelList so far:</p>

<p>I depend on AngelList API to provide a vital lens for monitoring the companies I track on, who are doing interesting things with APIs. AngelList also provides me with an important discovery tool, that helps me find new people, and companies that are pushing the API conversation forward, as well as monitoring the existing players.</p>
<p>I have had an APIs.json file for the AngelList API for some time, but I only had a single, pretty useless Swagger definition. Now I have 16 separate resources, with each endpoint, verb, parameter, underlying data and security models defined. The process helped me better understand how I already use the search, and startups endpoints, but also opened up my eyes to the jobs, press, user, and tag APIs--which I am now working into my regular API monitoring workflow.</p>
<p>This process isn't just about creating complete profiles I can include in <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, and <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. It is about me better understanding the resources I already depend on, pushing me to better take advantage of them, ultimately improving upon my own API stack, as well as my operational efficiency using APIs.</p>

<p>I have been pulled into the conversation around the API for our National Park system information several times now. In October of 2014&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/">I asked for Help To Make Sure The Dept. of Agriculture Leads With APIs In Their Parks and Recreation RFP</a>, something <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/the-next-steps-for-the-the-recreation-information-database-ridb-api/">I saw some&nbsp;Next Steps For The The Recreation Information Database (RIDB) API</a> this January.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Topic:</strong><span> &nbsp;Addendum to Recreation One Stop Support Services Contract RFP for a Recreation Information Database API download cost recovery mechanism for high frequency, high-volume requests</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Issue:</strong><span> &nbsp;Questions and comments from prospective contractors for the R1S support services contract included significant concern about the costs associated with supporting a completely open API. &nbsp;There is an incremental cost for each instance that a third party &lsquo;calls&rsquo; the API. &nbsp;In private industry, the volume of calls is often managed by provisioning access to the API by requiring registration and agreeing to the volume of calls in advance. &nbsp;For third parties wishing to create an interface that will call the API frequently, private industry typically implements a tiered pricing approach where costs rise as volume increases. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In response to these concerns and to provide a mechanism for cost recovery for high frequency, high-volume requests, the R1S Program Management Team offered this solution by posting this statement to questions on FedBizOpps (FBO.gov). </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>Additionally, automated access to recreation data shall be free of charge for users making nominal data requests. The contractor may propose a fee structure applicable only to high volume data consumers. Such a fee structure shall be enforced through an agreement directly between the Contractor and the data consumer and shall be consistent with industry best practices and established market pricing. Should the contractor opt to propose such a fee structure, their proposal shall clearly state the applicable rates and details of the proposed fee structure.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A member of the open-data community quickly reacted to this provision indicating that it no longer meets the intent of the President&rsquo;s Open Government executive order. &nbsp;It is possible that media coverage will daylight dissatisfaction over this provision.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is important to note that it shall be the R1S contractor&rsquo;s responsibility to manage and control access to the API so that excessive calls from outside entities do not put unreasonable stress on the system that may be cause performance issues or be malicious in nature. &nbsp;To accomplish this, the R1S contractor will need to provide sufficient server capability and staff to manage and support the API and the consumers using it. &nbsp;The costs for the basic service are contained in the fee-per-transaction model, which will support free access to the API for all users, with a cost-recovery mechanism in place for high-use consumers. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To clarify the intent of the government, the RFP will be amended to state:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>The Government recognizes that high frequency, high-volume data requests may have a detrimental effect on the performance and security of R1S Reservation Services system and that the management and mitigation of such negative consequences drives costs to the contractor.&nbsp; Accordingly, automated access to recreation data shall be free of charge for users making nominal data requests, however, the contractor may propose a fee structure, or establish access limitations, applicable only to higher volume data consumers. &nbsp;Any proposed fee structure shall comply with OMB Circular A-130; Section 8 &ndash; Policy, which states, &ldquo;Agencies will &hellip; Set user charges for information dissemination products at a level sufficient to recover the cost of dissemination but no higher.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Summary/Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The RIDB API is now open and available to anyone to download free of charge.</li>
<li>Federal recreation data is and shall continue to be available in machine-readable formats and shall safeguard privacy, confidentiality, and security in compliance with the Open Data Executive Order.</li>
<li>The follow-on contract for R1S requires that in addition to more static recreation and inventory data, real-time availability data shall also be made available through an API.</li>
<li>The audiences we anticipate using the API is widely varied and includes those who may want to incorporate federal recreation data into tourism portals and travel planning applications. &nbsp;Others however include those who wish to produce new interfaces to the real-time availability data that could generate a very high volume of calls to the API.</li>
<li>We will continue to offer completely free access to the RIDB API for routine and reasonable requests in support of the President&rsquo;s Open Government Executive Order.</li>
<li>R1S is allowing offerors for the follow-on contract to propose a cost-recovery fee structure for high-volume data customers that exceed reasonable access in accordance with OMB Circular A-130; Section 8. &nbsp;These proposals will be considered as a provision within the new contract expected to be awarded in 2017.</li>
<li>The Recreation.gov API(s) will be funded entirely by recreation fee revenue generated through reservation transactions made by the general public. &nbsp;By following private industry standards, R1S will be able to continue to provide free and open access to nominal users of the API without passing on higher costs associated with high volume use to the general reservation making public. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:&nbsp;</strong>Charging fees for access to government APIs is a relatively new concept, however open-data evangelists and private industry all agree that there is a time and place for creating a reasonable tiered pricing structure which supports free open data and provides a framework for managing increased costs associated with higher end use.</p>

</ul>
<p>That concludes the briefing paper, but after I shared my thoughts with them, I received an update of what the language has evolved to, resulting in the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government seeks to encourage usage of the Recreation.gov API, especially for third parties that could use the API to initiate additional reservations. At the same time, the Government recognizes that it is difficult to predict the likely query volume on Recreation.gov&rsquo;s APIs, and that very high-frequency API requests from third parties that do not result in reservations on the system could have a detrimental effect on the performance or cost of the system, without providing associated benefits to the contractor or the Government.</em><br /><br /><em>Accordingly, the contractor may propose an API management plan that protects against extremely high-frequency usage of the API from third-parties that are not driving reservations to the system, while also encouraging widespread usage from third parties that are making a reasonable number and frequency of requests, and provides a mechanism for supporting and encouraging heavy API usage from third parties who demonstrate value and success in driving reservations on the R1S reservation system. Such plans may include establishing guidelines for third party interaction with the API (i.e., recommended best practices for caching API responses, implementing conditional requests, and defining &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; API usage that may be restricted), requiring users to register to receive a token or key to access the API and using techniques such as rate-limiting the number of API requests allowed from a given third party over a given period of time (i.e., XXXX requests per hour), or introducing &ldquo;tiers&rdquo; of access that limit high-frequency, high-volume API usage to those third parties who are successfully driving reservations on the system or are willing to pay a nominal fee that covers the incremental costs of serving non-reservation-generating high-frequency requests.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This is the first precedent I have seen, of a modern API driven monetization strategy in the federal government. There are many examples of private companies charging for access to federal government data, but this is the first example of applying modern API business models on top of government APIs and open data.</p>
<p>To me, this conversation also goes well beyond just charging for high volume access to government APIs, to cover the cost of delivering API driven resources reliably. It also introduces the concept of service composition into government APIs. We've had government APIs keyed up with <a href="http://apiumbrella.io/">API Umbrella</a> for some time now, an open source approach that is modeled after modern, commercial API management offerings. What the RIDB API approach does, is open up the ability to introduce different levels of access tiers, rate limit, and charge for commercial levels of usage around vital government resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When government follows the business model applied across the API sector, it will allow for the free, lower levels of access, while also charging for higher levels of access, that will keep critical APIs operating at scale, in a dependable way. I'm also hoping it opens up other approaches to service composition, like allowing developers to write and contribute to the evolution of government data. I'm just hoping the possibility of covering the cost of API operations, is enough of an incentive for government agencies, and the vendors that serve them, to explore other approaches to API service composition.</p>
<p>The trick in all of this will be teaching the agencies and vendors, about the transparency required to make all of this work. Agencies, and their vendors, will have to make sure and share the algorithm they use to establish service tiers, rate limits, and pricing levels. They will also have to be transparent about which API consumers / partners exist in which tiers, to eliminate speculation around favoritism. This transparency will be critical to all of this working smoothly, otherwise the whole approach will suffer from similar illnesses that existing government procurement practice suffer from. <em>APIs != Good by Default</em></p>
<p>The RIDB API approach, which allows vendors to add API service levels, rate limits, and a pricing layer, sets a precedent for generating much needed revenue that can cover the costs of API operations. While this may seem like a footnote on a single government RFP,&nbsp; as I mentioned in earlier posts on this subject, it represents how we will manage commercial usage of our virtual government resources in the future, in the same way we've done for our physical government resources for many years now.</p>

<p><em>This is a deep dive from one of my loyal readers, who doesn't just listen to what I write, he is pushing my own research in new directions, and reporting back to me. You have read his work before in&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/06/api-police-report-raw-thoughts-from-onboarding-with-your-api/">API Police Report: Raw Thoughts From On-Boarding With Your API</a>, and this time Bob Salita is building on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/parsing-charles-proxy-exports-to-generate-swagger-definitions-while-also-linking-them-to-each-path/">my own proxy work with Charles Proxy</a>. Guest posts isn't something I do on API Evangelist, but when you are pushing the conversation forward like Bob does, I can't help but share.</em></p>
<p>I'm a  multi-platform, multi-device developer. I wanted an easy way to inspect  HTTP(S) API traffic (requests, responses) from one of my many  development devices. Inspection can be achieved by using (reverse) proxy  software such as <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a>, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a>, <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">squid</a>, or <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a>. The usual  method is to make proxy changes to a device so traffic is forced to a  system running a reverse proxy. This process is inconvenient and error  prone in multi-device environments. For every device, one has to  discover how to make a proxy change, then manually effect the change,  and then manually reverse the change when inspection is done. I found  the process annoying and error-prone. There had to be a better way.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that  the ideal setup would be a router where the WAN's gateway was a system  running a transparent proxy. Thus simply by connecting the device to the  router, the transparent proxy software would capture HTTP and HTTPS  traffic. After weeks of research, testing of many configurations and  software, I am pleased to document a working configuration.</p>
<p>The first step is to install <a id="yui_3_16_0_1_1440232677015_9987" href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a>&nbsp;(Linux, OS/X), or&nbsp;<a id="yui_3_16_0_1_1440232677015_9541" href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmdump</a> (Linux, OS/X, Windows) on a system. I've tested mitm software on OS/X  and Windows only. The same software is known to run on Linux, I  personally haven't tested there yet. OS/X proved to be a better platform  than Windows because it can run the&nbsp;console UI program called  mitmproxy, whereas Windows users have to settle for the simplistic  screen scrolling text program called mitmdump. There actually is another  option, called mitmweb, but it's beta.&nbsp;mitmweb a fascinating variation  of proxy UI, I highly recommend giving it a try. It may become a killer  proxy UI.</p>
<p>The second step is to  configure a dedicated router, call it "PROXY", that gatways traffic to  the transparent proxy created in step 1. PROXY router eliminates the  need for the annoying proxy changes&nbsp;for every device. You simply connect  the device to PROXY and your traffic instantly becomes inspected. I  used a super cheap router (TP-Link WR841N $20), loaded dd-wrt, but I  think any router will probably work. Configure the router's WAN gateway  to point to the transparent proxy system (e.g. 192.168.1.27). You may  need to explicitly configure the WAN's DNS servers too, if so, I used  Google's DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Configure the LAN to be  some private IP, I used 192.168.3.1. When you connect a device, the  router will assign a private IP address (e.g. 192.168.3.50).</p>
<p>You're now done. Connect  any of your devices to PROXY router and the HTTP(S) traffic will appear  in mitm software on the transparent proxy (gateway'ed) system. When  finished inspecting, reconnect to your everyday router. No device  fiddling ever needed.</p>
<p>Although the above steps  are simple, it took considerable time to investigate all the  alternative configurations. In the end, I found no other working  software option, only mitm transparent proxy worked. Charles and Fiddler  are lacking a working transparent proxy feature. squid transparent  proxy likely works on Linux but I didn't test it. It's unfortunate that  Charles and Fiddler proxy software didn't work as a transparent proxy. I  âmuch prefer Fiddler over mitmproxy because of Fiddler's superior UI  and my personal preference for C# and .Net.</p>
<p><em>I am sharing Bob's instructions, so that you all can play with as well. I have an API setup to process any Charles Proxy file, and generate Swagger definitions from them, something I'd like to see occur from this implementation as well. Understanding how the web and mobile applications we depend on are using APIs, is becoming increasingly important. Thanks for your work Bob!</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-three.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While we wait for the next steps of the long drawn out Oracle v Google Java API copyright battle, I wanted to take some time and talk about what we can all be doing to actually make a difference. If you aren't familiar with the legal case,&nbsp;is a legal dispute related to Oracle's copyright and patent claims on Google's Android operating system. The court case started in California courts in 2012, with the rmost recent verdict coming in&nbsp;May, 2014, where the&nbsp;<a title="United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit" target="_blank">Federal Circuit</a>&nbsp;partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor on the copyright-ability issue, and&nbsp;<a title="Remand (court procedure)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remand_(court_procedure)" target="_blank">remanding</a>&nbsp;the issue of fair use to the district court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we wait for appeals, endure the continued discussion, and read the trickle of FUD that comes out from the tech press, what can the tech community actually do to make a difference? First, we can reduce our anxiety about this being hellfire and brimstone for the current web API movement. The Oracle v Google legal battle is &nbsp;focused on Java APIs, which are a different beast than a web API, and it would take another legal case to actually set a precedent that copyright applies to web APIs--when this happens, I will be showing up with my Internet of Things enabled pitchfork, and torch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to actually making a difference, you can openly license and share your existing API designs. If you think copyright applies to APIs, publish them&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">CC0</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">other Creative Commons license</a>--something you can link to using&nbsp;<a href="http://apicommons.org/" target="_blank">API Commons</a>. If you do not think copyright applies to APIs, apply whichever licensing stance you feel is relevant. The important part is that we share how our APIs licensed, accompanied with machine readable API definitions that can act as a representation of what is covered by a license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your web API definitions are the recipes for your digital resources, and machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint are how we describe our recipes in a machine readable way. This isn't your secret sauce--how you execute on this recipe is your secret sauce. The name, and ordering of your recipe is how you communicate on the menu that is your developer portal, where you will be cook'n up an assortment of API driven dishes. How you operate your business, and deliver on your recipes is what you should be protecting, not the way you define, and communicate what you do as an API driven business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Openly sharing the definitions of our APIs, that we operate on the Internet, is a meaningful action we can take in response to the Oracle v Java copyright case, but an action that goes so much further in helping also make the API space better. Sharing machine readable definitions of the recipes that are our APIs, using formats like&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger.io/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://apiblueprint.org/" target="_blank">API Blueprint</a>, embracing media types like&nbsp;<a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/" target="_blank">Collection+JSON</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren" target="_blank">Siren</a>, using common data formats like&nbsp;<a href="http://jsonapi.org/" target="_blank">JSON API</a>, and wrapping it all up as an&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/" target="_blank">APIs.json collection</a>, will help us evolve beyond the bespoke API space we currently have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copyright is lower down on the list of obstacles we face in the API economy. There are numerous interoperability, reusability, and scalability issues that are much bigger threats than a far off Java API copyright battle. We can take all of these challenges head on by using existing API definition formats, media types, and data models when designing, deploying, and managing our APIs. If we do this, any future API copyright battle will never even take root, in a world where open formats, source, and API patterns will rule.</p>
<p>Please work with me to contribute to this world, rather than giving fuel to one possible dystopian world suggested by Oracle.</p>

<p><em>This is one of several stories I am evolving as part of series I'm calling API fairy tales. With these tales I want to educate business leaders, technologists, and government about the importance of Application Programming Interfaces (API), and how they are being applied in almost every aspect of business occurring online today--providing simple examples that mainstream users can learn from, as well as retell in their circles.</em></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">Just two months after launching there new messaging startup in 2006, Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world. Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating rogue APIs, so Twitter exposed the Twitter API, returning machine readable JSON and XML that developers could put to use, building things beyond what Twitter could build.</p>
<p>In just four short years Twitter&rsquo;s API had become the center of countless desktop clients, mobile applications, web apps, and businesses -- even by Twitter itself, in its own mobile apps, and for its public website. The majority of what you know as Twitter today, came the API ecosystem. If Twitter is the nervous system of the world, the Twitter API is the nervous system of Twitter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In my opinion, Twitter is one of the most influential APIs operating today, showing what is possible when a dead simple platform does one thing well, then opens up access via an API and lets an open API ecosystem of almost a million 3rd party developers, build out the rest of the platform--establishing an external R&amp;D environment for the fast growing communication platform.</p>
<p>In addition to importance, Twitter is also one of the most complex APIs platforms in operation today showing us the difficulty in running large developer ecosystems, where you have a million developers building whatever they want, around your valuable companies assets. Sometimes this is a blessing, and sometimes this is a curse, and Twitter does pretty well at striking a balance between the two &mdash; acknowledging that APIs are more than just tech, they are also about business, and have a huge social and political aspect as well.</p>
<p>Not everyone loves Twitter, but you can&rsquo;t argue that it has made a huge impact on how we conduct global business, and even how the government and our larger society operates. When you look at the success Twitter has achieved, I can&rsquo;t help but see API driven success, allowing a simple startup to spread around the globe, using APIs to connect people, places, and conversations&mdash;becoming the nervous system for the coming API economy, which will always have that human, social layer that Twitter reflects so well.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/research-funding-using-apis.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending an increasing amount of time thinking about how you monetize data, content, and other digital resources via APIs. A couple of very compelling layers to all of this work, is pushing forward <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">my thoughts on how and when government should charge for access to public data</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/11/hdscores-one-potential-api-driven-business-model-aggregating-public-data/">the how and when private sector companies should charge for access to public data</a>--lots to think about here.</p>
<p>Another layer to this conversation that was introduced this week, centers around how we can keep data and content generated via publicly funded research, at publicly funded institutions, available, accessible, and moving forward, by applying the technology and business of the modern web API. I was contacted this week by a group at <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>, that is proposing a research to database hyperlinking project, which would provide one-click access from published biomedical research papers to authoritative biological databases such as WormBase (WB;&nbsp;<a href="http://wormbase.org">wormbase.org</a>), Flybase (FB;&nbsp;<a href="http://flybase.org">flybase.org</a>), the Saccharomyces Genome, and Database (SGD;&nbsp;<a href="http://yeastgenome.org">yeastgenome.org</a>).</p>
<p>The primary objective of the project is to make information around scientific research, and the resources you need to accomplish the research, more accessible at the time of research--not after the fact. The secondary objective is to identify monetization opportunities within the industry for the data, and apply modern API methodologies, to take advantage of these opportunities. In short, we are looking to build a viable business model on top of this highly valuable scientific data, to help keep these databases accessible, evolving, and living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">the API monetization discussions I've had in the past around generating revenue around public data</a>, come into play, but this time it is with publicly funded scientific research. It takes money to keep these databases up and running. It takes money to design, deploy, and manage APIs, and operate the API ecosystem that will arise around these databases. Where is the ethical line between providing access to this important data, and generating enough revenue to keep the important work alive?</p>
<p>I am most definitely biased, but this is where APIs really begin to shine for me. It isn't just that we have the technology to open up access to these databases, in a simple way that can be used in websites, web applications, browser add-ons, and mobile apps. We also have the ability to meter access, giving free access to those who need it, while charging for access from those who can afford it, in order to fund operations. The third aspect of a modern approach to APIs that makes this possible, is the transparency. We can strike this operational balance around monetizing this public data, in a transparent way, so ethical concerns can be minimized.</p>
<p>This represents the technology, business, and politics of APIs that you here me ranting about on a regular basis. I am not saying this formula will work for all scientific research, but I think if we can strike the right balance, we can uncover another revenue stream to keep important scientific research moving forward. I am just beginning these conversations, and in my own style, I'm working through my thoughts here on the blog. I would love to hear your thoughts, if you have any opinions in these areas.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more as this project evolves...</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-speak-api-definitions.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I play with a lot of services that target the API space each week, during my regular monitoring of the space. These are services from all along the API lifecycle that service this space, from design to integration, that target both API provider and API consumer. After I on-board with a service, there is one trend I see emerging that really puts service providers into two distinct buckets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The API focused services that stand out the most, are the ones that employ common API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>. After I've on-boarded with a service, if I can upload a machine readable definition of one or many of my own own, or public APIs I depend on, the quicker I will see a service in action--well on my way to understanding the value generated by a service provider, and becoming a customer.</p>
<p>Examples of this in the wild are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apimatic.io/">SDKs with APIMATIC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">Monitors with API Science</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Tests with Runscope</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Client with Postman</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gelato.io/">Documenetation with Gelato</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a service provider, focusing on the API space, if you do not speak Swagger, Postman Collection, or API Blueprint, the chances API providers (or consumers) will be on-boarding and using your service, goes significantly down. This works just like APIs themselves, in that you have to reduce any friction possible when on-boarding. If I can signup using my Github account, and fire up the service with a Swagger, or even better a collection of Swagger APIs using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, the chances I'll be a customer increase dramatically.</p>
<p>I am adding flags for the common API definition formats, to the system that I use to track on API service providers, and will be highlighting those that speak these formats. After that, I will find a way to showcase which formats these providers support, bringing front and center across my research, and storytelling.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io/pricing"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/APIMATIC-Pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the areas I focus on in the API space, is the business of APIs, and how companies actually make the rubber meet the road when it comes to pricing the API resources they are serving up, as well as the price that API service providers offer up to their customers. After security, monetization is the top question I get from the folks i am talking to about their API strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io/pricing">I've been watching the SDK service provider APIMATIC move from a company in beta, to announcing pricing for the valuable API service this last week</a>. I love watching any company break up their valuable resources and services, but feel APIMATICs pricing announcement is interesting enough to warrant a story, because it provides other API service providers with one possible blueprint they can use.</p>
<p>APIMATIC is somewhat unique, because they generate SDKs for your APIs, but the way they define their service and broke it up into units of measure valuable, can be universally applied. APIMATIC distilled their service down to a basic unit of value--line of code, or LOC:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>LOC stands for lines of code. KLOC is a short form for 1000 (1K) lines of code. We use KLOC to estimate the size of an API and charge accordingly. An average API would consume about 1 KLOC.</em></p>
<p><span>You get different amounts of KLOC, depending on what tier you are in, with a free, professional, and commercial levels of access, as well as a pay as you go option at each level. Even though APIMATIC are an API service provider, who provides services to API providers, APIMATIC's pricing reflects an API way of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span>The lessons here for other API service providers is not necessarily about a KLOC, but about the process of distilling down your service to its smallest possible unit of value. Then you attach a freemium doorway to the front, break down into reasonable priced, evenly scaled service tiers, with a pay as you go option along the way. The cherry on top, is provide spending calculator--which APIMATIC rocked.</span></p>
<p><span>This provides us with a model that other API service providers should be looking at. You can apply this thinking to multiple service area, and aren't limited to a single unit of value like KLOC, you can have an ala carte buffet of services, with different pricing levels, depending on where you are at in the service tiers. Think of it as a monetization framework for API service providers that also reflects how APIs are priced.</span></p>
<p><span>While the services you are offering to the space may be different than APIMATIC, the model is something you should think about as you craft your monetization strategy. I see many companies fail because they don't offer the freemium portion, don't have evenly spaced service tiers, or haven't actually distilled their service down into a meaningful unit of value. Hopefully the APIMATIC story can help you avoid stumbling blocks in your own monetization journey--which is what API Evangelist is all about.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/restlet-studio-screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I love the API design editors that have emerged from <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet as part of their design studio</a>, and from <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC as part of their SDK management service</a>, and if you haven't checked out <a href="https://gelato.io/">Gelato.io</a>, I highly recommend it. All of these solutions provide me with a well designed user interface for working with common API definitions, but even with these offerings, I feel like the overall API universe is very deficient in this area.</p>
<p>It is good that these providers are using common API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, but the UI itself is a one-off, and for API definitions to take their place, front-and-center throughout the API lifecycle, we are going to need some common API design tooling. Any successful solution needs to go well beyond just the JSON, YAML, and Markdown, and give us a powerful user interface to craft exactly the APIs we need.</p>
<p>There are several other API definition editors that let you directly edit JSON, YAML, and Markdown, but to move things forward, we need an easy to use, standardized, open source, API interface interface that will work across common API definition formats. Think of what the WYSIWYG editors did for web design--we need a similar, elegant and modern solution for API design.</p>
<p>I have had this conversation with several API service providers, but I wanted to expand the conversation, and see if I can stimulate the development (or release) of an open source API design editor. I am looking for a solution that any API service provider can deploy within their management solutions, encouraging them to not just speak in common API definition formats, but do it in a way that developers, and non-developers alike, can participate at every stage of the API design life-cycle.</p>
