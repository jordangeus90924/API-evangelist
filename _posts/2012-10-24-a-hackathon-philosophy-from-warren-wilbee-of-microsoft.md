{% include JB/setup %}<p>While doing the weekly hackathon roundup in September, I noticed an uptick in the number of Windows 8 hackathons that are going on.I decided to reach out to Microsoft and see if I can get more information on what they are trying to accomplish, and see what their perspective is on hackathons.After talking to several people I was directed to a gentleman by the name of Warren Wilbee (@wwilbee), Director of ISV Evangelism at Microsoft.Wilbee is a passionate evangelist, one that isnt just externally evangelizing, he is actively working to evolve internal culture and options about the value of hackathons at Microsoft.When I got on the phone with him, he said the reason I was directed to him is because he had recently circulated an internal memo regarding the makeup and value of hackathons.</p>
