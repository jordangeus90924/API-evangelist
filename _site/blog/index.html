			<p><em>17 Feb 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am pushing forward how Postman can be used for public data. I have a whole mess of different data sets I need available for different projects I am working on. For one project I am aggregating ten separate environmental data sources available as a mix of CSV, JSON, and excel files, as well as a couple of actual APIs. I am looking to build an embeddable dashboard widget using data across these ten sources, and I am looking to organize all of them via a single public workspace, helping normalize them all as simple APIs returning CSV or JSON. The project is just a POC, and once it moves toward production we’ll launch actual APIs, but for now I am able to mock them using Postman. The process got me thinking about how this approach can be used to make simple public datasets available via forkable Postman collections. Simple Data APIs Using Collections As I began aggregating the datasets into Postman, the first couple of datasets were pretty basic. Simple CSV or JSON files, and a couple basic APIs. I just created a collection, added a new request, and pasted the URL into the request and pulled the data from the source. Once I had the response from each API I would save the response as an example for the request. Then the entire CSV or JSON would be stored locally within the collection. For most of them I’d convert the data to, or from JSON or CSV, and add a parameter property so that each response could returned depending on what format the consumer desires for the visualizations. Now that I have an example stored for each dataset as part of the collection I can mock the collection, making the data available as a simple “mocked” API. This approach provides a public or private URL I can share with anyone who is building a prototype application-—in this case a widget. Going from dataset...[<a href="/2021/02/17/open-data-using-postman-collections/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Feb 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am working to load up all my API discovery experiences into my head for some upcoming conversations. So I sat down and pulled together a summary of my API discovery research to date to help refresh my memory of what has happened and how we got here. API discovery is the one of the few layers of the API space that I am personally committed to helping move things forward and being able to see all the moving parts together helps me keep doing this. Let’s take a stroll through my memory of the evolution of API discover over the last fifteen years so that I can speak more coherently about all of this with a variety of folks. ProgrammableWeb ProgrammableWeb was the first source of being able to discover API, and in 2020 it is still the place you go to find APIs. Really not much has changed in the last fifteen years with ProgrammableWeb except for the owners and operators, and the look and feel of the site. It is still where you go to look for new and existing APIs, and where you find APIs when Googling. I have fond memories of writing for ProgrammableWeb, and the site is still a great source of information for me, but I am left frustrated that PW hasn’t moved forward the API discovery conversation in any interesting ways over the years. I just think it is a missed opportunity, and reflects much about the API space that I think holds us all back. Mashape -> Rapid API After ProgrammableWeb, the next evolution in the API space when it came to API discovery was Mashape, which is now known as Rapid API. The API marketplace was born out of the age of API management and provides basic management capabilities alongside with API discovery services. Providing a pretty rich set of APIs you can search and onboard with using the Rapid API marketplace.

			<p><em>11 Feb 2021</em></p>
			<p>If you have followed my work you know that I like telling stories. Stories are the single most important tool in my Chief Evangelist and API Evangelist toolbox. None of the code matters in my opinion, and the stories surrounding the code is what makes the actual impact on our reality. The stories we tell each other, as well as the stories we tell ourselves. Everything in the world of technology and APIs is made up of stories. I am hovering around 5000 stories here on API Evangelist, which reflects everything I am when it comes to API Evangelist. Stories are how I make sense of the API world that has unfolded in the last twenty years. Storytelling is how I work through all of the things I do not understand, moving everything API from a very abstract realm into something that is more tangible, visible, and sometimes more meaningful to me in the real world. I couldn’t have done any of this without stories. Throughout my storytelling as the API Evangelist I have also taught myself to work through my own personal baggage over at kinlane.com. Applying the same methodology to my past and figuring out who I am today. API Evangelist has always been very much a performance, but the storytelling I engaged in as part of the performance went much deeper than being just a business production. Over the years, both of these streams of storytelling (apievangelist.com & kinlane.com) have influenced others in the world, having an impact on their storytelling, or help them embark on their own storytelling journey. I’ve learned a lot from these engagements, and made a lot of friends around the world because of a shared love for storytelling. This shared storytelling journey has recently manifested itself as a video conversation between Mike Amundsen (@mamund) and Aidan Cunniffe (@aidandcunniffe), which we are simply calling API Storytelling. We only have one discussion under our belt and we aren’t quite...[<a href="/2021/02/11/api-storytelling-with-mike-and-aidan/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Jan 2021</em></p>
			<p>I have to admit something. I don&rsquo;t fully grasp the entire landscape of API testing. I mean, I have a pretty decent awareness and experience in testing APIs, but I can&rsquo;t close my eyes and coherently break down each layer or type of testing, let alone competently navigate the many different types of services and tooling available on the market for API testing. Like most other dimensions of the API universe the content and guidance on the subject of API testing is all over the place. After a couple of hours Googling and making my way through my bookmarks, I uncovered a pretty expansive dictionary for what I&rsquo;d consider to be under the umbrella of API testing. First off, I have to talk about API testing in the most general sense before I get into the more and less formal API testing approaches. It was a dimension of API testing I hadn&rsquo;t considered before I began working at Postman, but API testing meaning that I am just kicking the tires on a API, learning what it is all about, and how you use it. This is what the majority of Postman&rsquo;s 13 million users are doing when they say they are testing an API with the Postman platform. THis experimental and curious approach to API testing provides a great onramp to the world of API publishing and consumption, but does little to help us articulate what API testing is or isn&rsquo;t. Beyond just &ldquo;testing out&rdquo; an API, from what I can gather across about 25 separate API testing articles, there are 25 different layers to the API testing onion: Validation Testing - I am guessing a general type of validation &mdash; seems pretty broad. Functional Testing - Adopted as part of code testing practices, applied to unit of code. Component Testing - Similar to functional, but testing based upon small unit of compute. User Interface Testing - Testing of the API in the context of...[<a href="/2021/01/30/making-sense-of-the-different-types-of-api-testing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Jan 2021</em></p>
			<p>I love the word entropy. It means so many things to so many different people. In means different things in the physical realm versus the informational or virtual realms. It is one of those big words you can say to confuse people, or actually get yourself in trouble being able to actually defend your position on what entropy means when around smart people. It is said that famed mathematician John Von Neumann had told fellow mathematician and creator of Information Theory that he should use the word entropy instead of information because that no one understands entropy and then you can win arguments about your theory. I also read that Shannon and Norbert Weiner also dueled over the meaning, seeing it in very opposite ways. I like the word for all of these reasons, but mostly because of its relationship to uncertainty.&nbsp; In the realm of physics entropy means, a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system In the more virtual realm of information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information, surprise, or uncertainty inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. While I could easily use entropy as a metaphor for APIs in the physical sense, it is really the appropriation of it for information theory that really brings it home for me. Entropy in Shannon&rsquo;s time was centered around noise or static in communication, but when you look at how APIs enable communication between systems, and allowing web, mobile, device, and network applications to communicate, this static or noise reveals itself as friction, errors, outages, instability, unreliability, and misaligned business and political priorities.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think about the level of information one encounters when it comes to putting APIs to work these days. Consider the surprise one encounters when seemingly similar API resources speak entirely different dialects or behave inconsistently.

			<p><em>29 Jan 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am preparing for the next version of APIs.json and I am taking another pass over what the specification is, but also taking a fresh look at why the specification exists. Part of this fresh look involves assessing what I consider to be the low bar for an APIs.json index, as well as what the entire scope might look like. To help me (and you) understand the scope of what APIs.json or APIs.yaml can do when it comes to indexing our API operations and making them discoverable in a machine readable way. The most important thing to remember about APIs.json is that it is all about indexing API operations in a way that acknowledges that there are two sides of this API integration game which need to be indexed and made discoverable across an organization. Human Readable - Providing URL references for the aspects of API Operations that human stakeholders will need to understand what is happening with APIs and how to put them to work in applications. Machine Readable - Providing URL references for aspects of API Operations that are system and applications can use to make sense of API Operations, accessing as a machine readable definition. APIs.json is about indexing all of these human and machine readable aspects of our API Operations with an emphasis on evolving human readable elements to also be machine readable so that as much of the surface area of our API operations is indexable by other systems and applications as possible. There is another dimension of APIs.json as a specification that is helpful to understand beyond the human and machine readable elements, by providing a vocabulary for describing two separate scopes of API operations, helping define the scope of information provided. API Specific Properties - References to details about a specific API, providing human and machine readable details about an API, so that consumers understand everything that is possible. Common Properties - References to details that support all...[<a href="/2021/01/29/examples-of-minimum-viable-and-complete-landscape-apis-json-index-files/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Jan 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am giving some much needed love to my APIs.yaml and API.json API discovery format while using the work to also just think about the wider API landscape. This is the original intent behind APIs.json&hellip;to help me make sense of the API landscape.&nbsp; Most folks are thinking about APIs as a producer, or as a consumer&mdash;hopefully both. However, there are fewer people who also pay attention to the entire API landscape, and APIs.json emerged out of this need for me in 2014. In 2020 I find myself totally immersed in the API landscape as part of my API Specification Toolbox project which grew out of Postman becoming a member of the OpenAPI Initiative, and I wanted toht spend why Saturday afternoon (I know I have a problem) thinking about the API landscape at the 250K.&nbsp; APIs.json API Property Types Using APIs.json or APIs.yaml you can define the properties of one or many APIs for a variety of purposes. Each API you describe can have an array of properties which can be common human readable elements like documentation or sign up, as well as machine readable properties like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or JSON Schema. APIs.json property types are intentionally human or machine readable with the intent on evolving every human readable element to have a machine readable element&mdash;think the relationship between documentation (Human) and OpenAPI (Machine) when understand the objective. I have several thousand API Providers and API service providers in my API Evangelist database. I track on the properties of all of these companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies that I come across. When I group the property types across the thousands of APIs I have indexed, I end up with this default set of building blocks for API providers, grouped by different areas of the API lifecycle. Onboarding These are the properties of any API operation that help consumers, or any other party onboard with the concept of an API, begin using the API, as...[<a href="/2021/01/23/evaluating-apis-json-api-property-types-alongside-openapi-extensions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Jan 2021</em></p>
			<p>The word &ldquo;open&rdquo; gets thrown around so much in the API space I find myself needing to regularly ground myself in what it actually means. It gets thrown around in so many different ways that I find eventually I start to believe the bullshit and regularly have to pause and recalibrate. It is one of those words that has been captured and used by people looking to manipulate the space so often it often means the exact opposite of what we all think it means, but it is also such an important word that I think we have to fight to keep it in our vocabulary. I feel like I am perpetually fighting with some invisible force over one of the front doors to the house we all live in, and I am determined for the door to not get completely shut, and I have to make sure the door actually ends up go where someone expects when they do open the door. Let&rsquo;s begin by actually taking inventory regarding the many different ways people use the word &ldquo;open&rdquo; to describe the world of APIs. Gathering all the ways it gets wielded in service of publishing and consuming APIs. Some of the ways in which it gets wielded are good, and some of them are bad. At this point I am just looking to be able to see the spectrum of use, and I am not looking to entirely pass judgement on anyone who uses it in specific ways. Here is the laundry list of ways &ldquo;open&rdquo; is wielded that impact the landscape I pay attention to on a daily basis, and have been helping shape for the last decade.&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicly Available - Open means something is available to anyone in the public, allowing them to use an API, and any resources around them. &nbsp;Access - An API or supporting resource is open for access by the public or the developer community in general, making...[<a href="/2021/01/11/what-does-open-mean-in-the-world-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>It has been a while since I looked at the 250K view of what is going on with APIs across federal government agencies in the United States. Since working for the Obama administration in 2013 I am perpetually on a quest to map out what is happening across federal agencies, helping drive the conversation forward. I belieive APIs can make the most impact when our federal government helps lead the way, and I am looking to help push things forward in the following ways. Keep mapping out the Federal Government API Landscape - I am determined to produce a map of the APIs that exist across federal agencies and keep the list alive and active. Establish Public API Workspaces for Federal Agencies - I am looking to establish public API workspaces for agencies who are implementing APIs--helping do some work from the outside-in. Refresh My Memory of What is Happening - I thrive on knowing what is going on across federal agencies, and doing these reviews pushes me to refresh my awarenss of APIs at this level. Fire Up new Conversations - These sotries always rise up in the SEO game and bring in new conversations with folks who are doing interesting things with APIs in government. I always learn a lot looking through the different government agencies. I learn even more wading through the different datasets, databases, and various incarnations of APIs. There is way too much work here than one person can handle, and much of what I come across labeled as an API really isn't an API, but could be with a little work. While doing these roundups I always reach a point where I feel like I am not doing enough, but ultimately I have to strike a balance between being comprehensive and just scratching the surface. Providing just enough information to allow me to plant seeds that might grow into new conversations down the road, while not spend all of...[<a href="/2020/12/27/taking-a-fresh-look-at-apis-across-all-the-united-states-federal-agencies/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>Sometimes I need to do bulk updates to Postman collections and there is no better way to automate this than to use a Postman Collection that uses the Postman API&mdash;inception level stuff, so be careful ;-). I have setup a dedicated public workspace where I am building out these utility type operational level collections&nbsp;that help me manage the API lifecycle out ahead of what the Postman GUI is capable of doing. Some of the things I am doing will eventually make its way to the Postman UI, but some of them will not. Either way, I am too impatient to wait, and one of the things I love about Postman is that I can hack my way forward through just about any situation using the Postman API. Building on my base collection for pulling and updating collections, I added two differents requests that will help me capitalize the first letter of each word in a folder or request name of a collection. Apply Title Case to All Folder Names in a Collection Apply Title Case to All Request Names in a Collection To run, all you have to do is make sure you&rsquo;ve entered a collection ID (pulled from URL or info tab), and hit run&mdash;it will loop through each folder and request and capitalize the words, and then save the collection using the Postman API. So you can immediately put to use the same collection with the changes you desired. If you have any questions on the collection for pulling a collection and making changes using the Postman API, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the collection workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other collection related collections within this workspace. You can also fork the collection and use in your workspaces, and submit back any enhancements you&rsquo;d like to see as a pull request.

			<p><em>12 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>The Federal Trade Commission is sueing Facebook, alleging that they are illegally maintaining a monopoly on the personal social network space using a continued series of anticompetitive behavior. The suit includes a coalition of attorneys general of 46 states, bringing the latest wave of regulatory scrutiny into the social media platform, highlighting three main dimensions of how Facebook has engaged in a systematic strategy of anticompetitive practices that has resulted in their current dominant position online. Instagram - Facebook purchased Instagram to remove what they saw as one of the biggest threats they faced, while also purchasing market dominance in the image and photos sharing space. WhatsApp - Fsacebook purchased WhatsApp to remove what they saw as one of the biggest threats they faced, while also purchasing market dominance in the messaging space. API - Facebook used their API to cut off access to applications they saw as a threat, and to generally suffocate anything else they saw as a threat to their business model. The anticompetitive nature of Facebook&rsquo;s Instagram and WhatsApp purchase isn't really in my wheelhouse, but how the API was used for anticompetitive activity most definitely is my speciality. I am happy to see the FTC finally elevate the abuse that has been going on at Facebook via it&rsquo;s APIs, not just because of the impact on the Facebook developer community, but more importantly the wider tech sector. Facebook&rsquo;s approach hurts wider competition across the tech sector, but also hurts the space API sector--ultimately giving APIs a bad reputation. To help me speak intelligently to what is occurring as part of the FTC&rsquo;s lawsuit, offer my advice on what a remedy might be, while also contributing to the future of regulation in the tech sector, I wanted to gather my thoughts in a post here on the blog.&nbsp; Anticompetitive Conditioning Using The Facebook API The acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook to neutralize threats in two keys areas are a...[<a href="/2020/12/12/apis-are-at-the-center-of-the-federal-trade-commission-ftc-lawsuit-against-facebook/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>I have been neck deep in the release of Postman public workspaces lately. So much so, I haven't had much time to gather my thoughts about what exactly they are, and why they matter. Time for a burst of storytelling to help me make sense of just what is a public APIi workspace. One of the most common responses I've heard from folks that I talk with about public workspaces is that they are most comparable to a public GitHub repository, but designed just for APIs. Fair enough. While I see Postman public workspaces as much more than a Github public repository, it provides a great place to start when it comes to helping folks understand the potential. To help me be more articulate when it comes to speaking about why public workspaces matter, let me compare them to public repositories, and speak of the impact that GitHub has had on my reality, as well as on the wider API community. GitHub Changed My Life I have been using Github since 2010, but beginning in 2014 I began operating a significant portion of my API operations via GitHub. I ran all of my public presence there from 2014 through 2020, and I still regularly use it as a base for many API projects, and for publishing JSON and YAML files. In the last year I have pulled back much of my web presence for API Evangelist back from Github, but I still depend on it for most of my projects for the following reasons.&nbsp; Free - It is free to publish repos to Github, making it a pretty sweet place to publish APIs, schema, JSON, YAML, code, and other artifacts. Network - The network effect of Github is huge. Developers get it, and the access and discoverability that comes with the platform are worth it.&nbsp; Social - The social layer GitHub added to Git is really what makes the platform as powerful as it is,...[<a href="/2020/12/05/gathering-my-thoughts-on-public-api-workspaces/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>I have long been fascinated by the Run in Postman Button. A Run in Postman button can be published from any Postman collection, organizing a single, or a series of API calls into collection of API requests, and then letting them be imported and ran locally by any consumer, as a cloud monitor, or via a pipeline. Run in Postman buttons are a common way for API providers to onboard new developers with their APIs, and stay engaged with active developers through collections they&rsquo;ve download via Run in Postman buttons. These embeddable goodies attached to Postman collections and potentially environments are very powerful unit of API execution, but I am finding that the label &ldquo;run&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t sufficient in articulating what is possible with each collection, and I a looking to get a little more precise when it comes to my vocabulary attached to each Postman button I publish. The Run in Postman Button Fundamentals A Postman collection is basically a portable folder of API requests. Using Postman, developers can define the parts of one of many API requests, including the URL, parameters, headers, body, and authentication, then roll them all up as a collection that can be shared with other developers, and published as documentation, as well as using a Run in Postman button. This embeddable HTML or markdown button can be published alongside documentation, or more dynamically as individual buttons on any HTML or markdown page, attaching each button to the following elements:&nbsp; Collections - Each button can execute a single collection of one or many API requests, complete with pre-request and post-request scripts. Environments - Each button can possess a single environment that can contain a variety of key / value pairs for authentication, and other purposes. You can find Run in Postman buttons sprinkled across Twitter API documentation, providing one click import of collections into each developers own workspace, where they can manually run, or automate using a monitors, or trigger via...[<a href="/2020/12/05/expanding-the-vocabulary-for-run-in-postman-buttons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Sometimes I need to do bulk updates to Postman collections and there is no better way to automate this than to use a Postman Collection that uses the Postman API&mdash;inception level stuff, so be careful ;-). I have setup a dedicated public workspace where I am building out these utility type operational level collections that help me manage the API lifecycle out ahead of what the Postman GUI is capable of doing. Some of the things I am doing will eventually make its way to the Postman UI, but some of them will not. Either way, I am too impatient to wait, and one of the things I love about Postman is that I can hack my way forward through just about any situation using the Postman API.&nbsp; Building on my base collection for pulling and updating collections, I added five specific requests that will help me conduct a find and replace on each API request host, path, and the query parameter key, value, and description. There are other dimensions I am looking to cover with future requests, but this gets me what I need right now. You simply add a value to the request for a find and replace value, make sure you&rsquo;ve entered a collection ID (pulled from URL or info tab), and hit run&mdash;it will conduct the appropriate find and replace, and then save the collection using the Postman API. So you can immediately put to use the same collection with the changes you desired. If you have any questions on the collection for pulling a collection and making changes using the Postman API, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the collection workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other collection related collections within this workspace. You can also fork the collection and use in your workspaces, and submit back any enhancements you&rsquo;d like to see as a pull request.

			<p>What is an API? An API is a digital interface for sharing data, content, and algorithms with web, mobile, and device applications using the Internet, building on web technologies to make digital resources available across many different applications. APIs have been around since computers and their networks first gained a foothold back in the 1960s, but with the rise of the web since 2000, a new breed of APIs have emerged which has changed how we build and use technology, and introduced entirely new ways of doing business, but sadly, they have also introduced entirely new ways of exploiting an destabilizing the physical world around us. APIs aren&rsquo;t the latest techno solutionism, although they are oftentimes billed as that, they are the digital currents that flow around us each day. APIs power the web and mobile applications we depend on each day, while also steadily working to redefine our physical worlds by connecting everything to the Internet&mdash;reshaping our virtual and physical worlds, while also remaking who we are as humans along the way. Websites Are for Humans The web as we know it has been evolving for over 50 years, but in the 1990s it became something we were able to access in our homes and businesses, laying the foundation for the ubiquitous web of applications we now access in our homes via laptops, televisions, and other appliances, as well as our cars, in our businesses, and across our communities in the form of security cameras, traffic infrastructure, digital signage and much more. Websites are hypertext markup language (HTML) that are designed to be rendered for humans in a browser, making the text, images, and other media consumable by humans using their eyes and ears, and navigated using our fingers via touch screens, keyboards, and increasingly voice controls. Websites provide us with a user interface that each person can put the web to use in their personal or professional worlds, connecting us with the digital...[<a href="/2020/11/27/helping-the-public-data-commons-drive-our-economy-using-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am using Postman to do more governance on my OpenAPI definitions as part of their API lifecycle. This is a top request of customers I am talking to, so I want to get better at make these individual API lifecycle capabilities much more modular and reusable as Postman collections. In Postman, the OpenAPI is the truth for each API contract throughout the API lifecycle, but each collection has become how you automate each stop along the API lifecycle. Resulting in me needing the OpenAPI for each API I am automating, and being able to pull the OpenAPI truth using the Postman API within each collection I am defining to mock, document, test, and govern each API. You can find a single collection for pulling the OpenAPI for an API from the Postman API using it&rsquo;s name (boy that is a mouthful). The collection is designed to abstract away three separate API calls into a single request. Ideally Postman will provide a similar API endpoint, but until that happens I have this collection to help make things easier. The documentation for the collection should provide you with everything you need to get up and running with the collection, pulling the API into a Postman environment for reuse. It is up to you to decide what you will do with the OpenAPI after that, possibly making multiple changes, and then saving back to Postman using the API. If you have any questions on the collection for pulling the OpenAPI as part of the API lifecycle, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the OpenAPI workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other OpenAPI related collections within this workspace.

			<p>I am managing more collections via hundreds of different workspaces lately. As part of my work I am needing to make bulk changes to collections based upon a variety of properties. Sometimes I need to find and replace variables, and other times I need to rewrite or append to the descriptions for each collection. Whil I am sure eventually there will be capabilities to do some of this via the Postman interface, I find creating maintenance collections that use the Postman API to do what I need is the quickest way to get what I want, without having to wait for the Postman road map to catch up to my work. I have a whole list of automated changes I want to make to Postman collections that I am generating from OpenAPI definitions, and to help me quickly work through this list I wanted to create a base collection that I could use to augment with common and some unique scripts for making changes to any collection, and then save the results back using the Postman API. You can find this collection in my public workspace for managing my collection work, where you can fork it and apply to the changes you need to make to collections.

			<p>I am having an increasing number of conversations around how the leading API specifications work together, and what the role of each are when it comes to various stops along the API lifecycle. To help drive conversations I wanted to create a single blog post I can link to, while also loading up all of my fresh thoughts about API specs into my old brain. All of these API specifications are continuing to see massive adoption across API providers and consumers, and they are all in forward motion being iterated upon by the specification owners, so it helps to pause once or twice a year and take a look at what is going on, and work to understand how all of these API specifications work together (or don&rsquo;t). What Are The Leading API Specifications There are a handful of API specifications that are relevant to delivering APIs in 2020, helping provide a vocabulary for stakeholders in the process to use when describing what each API does, so that a common definition can be applied through the API lifecycle, consistently delivering API infrasture across many teams. Here are the API specifications I am focusing on as part of my API Specification Toolbox conversations. OpenAPI - A specification for defining the surface area of HTTP 1.1 web APIs using JSON or YAML. AsyncAPI - A specification for defining the surface area of HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, TCP, MQTT, and AMQP APIs using JSON or YAML. JSON Schema - A specification for defining the underlying models in use for APIs, adopted by both OpenAPI and AsyncAPI. Postman Collections - A specification for defining executable collections of HTTP 1.1 web APIs for running in services and tooling Postman Environments -&nbsp;A specification for defining key / value pairs that get applied across collections at execute time.

			<p><em>18 Nov 2020</em></p>
			<p>Managing the size of an OpenAPI is a common challenge for API development teams. I have regular conversations with teams about the ways in which you can minimize the overall scope of an API, breaking things down into more manageable chunks, while also reducing redundancy&mdash;then encouraging reuse. Like other dimensions of the API space there are differing opinions on whether it is better to have one single OpenAPI for all of your APIs, or whether it makes more sense to break things down into well defined bounded contexts. You can see this debate occurring in Monolith vs Microservices, and MonoRepo vs Multi-Repo discussions across the API space. In this game, there are no right or wrong answers, just different approaches that work well for different organizations, teams, and individuals. My goal is to help folks understand the trade-offs by informing them enough to make their own decisions and set into motion API design practices that keep the API factory floor moving along. The size of your APIs matter. The size of your OpenAPI for your APIs matters. The scope, complexity, and consistency of your APIs will define how easy they are to maintain and put to work. Organizations that do not use OpenAPI struggle with being able to define the API landscape at all, let alone being able to define the scope of individual APIs or groups of APIs. It is common for API providers who are moving into the OpenAPI realm to slam into the brick wall of API scope right away, realizing their OpenAPI definitions are too big to work with in some services and tooling, and become a maze of complexity when it comes to maintenance and consumption. While there are many ways your API design practices can reduce or at least better define the scope of your APIs and resulting APIs, there are a handful of ways you can slice and dice your APIs up to make them easier to manage,...[<a href="/2020/11/18/managing-the-scope-of-your-openapi/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I owe an answer on my thoughts about mocking APIs to my coworker Andy, and I don&rsquo;t want to incur his wrath, so I figured I&rsquo;d write it up and share wider as I was getting back to him. I don&rsquo;t have the original question cause it was in a Zoom chat, but it was something to the effect of using mock APIs to move forward the design of an API versus using them to drive application development conversations as well as push testing forward. I&rsquo;d say that using a mock as part of an API-first design process reflects where I am pushing mocks to work for me more often. I still use them to demo, prototype applications, and as part of API testing, but using them to actually evolve the contract for an API is really where I feel that a mock server will really shine, and can shift how we are delivering APIs. However, there is also a lot of education and awareness needed before I get all the folks I am having conversations with on board with this concept&mdash;to help in these efforts I wanted to flesh out&nbsp;a little about what I mean when it comes to API-first usage of mock APIs. Mocking From Postman Collections The first part of this conversation involves the concept that you can generate a mock server from any Postman collection. There is a three step process involved with producing a mock API in Postman using a collection. First you create a collection with the path and parameters you would like to use as the definition of the API you are mocking. Once you have your path you can select examples up near the send button and add a new example for this request. It will take your path with parameters and map to a new example where you can add a JSON example to represent what should be returned by your mock server for an example....[<a href="/2020/11/17/using-api-mocks-as-part-of-an-apifirst-workflow/">Read More</a>]</p>

I remember back in 2011 folks asking me which of the API management providers would help them deploy their APIs, which at the time none of them would, being a pretty regular concern when it came to doing APIs at all, let alone doing them well. I have seen many &ldquo;API deployment&rdquo; solutions come and go, and after a decade I see some movements forward, but overall API deployment is still really difficult in ways that just doesn't make sense. Data APIs Making data available via simple APIs is the most common type of APIs you will come across out there, and the most common reason for providing as well as consuming APIs. Deploying data APIs are pretty straightforward to do, and there have been a wide variety of services and tooling made available to help developers deliver these types of APIs. Even with the simplicity of this type of APIs, I haven&rsquo;t seen too many platform successfully monetize a data API deployment solution, or deliver a dead simple, widely adopted, single push of a button solution to delivering data APIs. It really is one of those areas that should have been 100% solved by now, and would be if it was for the incentive models that exists behind most platforms, but also due to some pretty widespread unhealthy practices when it comes to managing and publishing data, making a lot of data pretty messy to work with when it comes to making available data APIs. Content APIs These types of APIs often overlap with the world of data APIs, but I want to highlight them separately because of content delivery network (CDN) considerations, as well as movements in the headless CMS world when it comes to enabling dead simple...[<a href="/2020/11/17/the-multiple-dimensions-of-api-deployment/">Read More</a>]</p>

The goal is to just identify ways in which we can drive more discussion and participation in API specifications, focusing on OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL, and Postman Collections. My goal is to help increase awareness of these specifications, but more importantly get more people sharing what they are working on and invest more time and resources into supporting the specifications. I conduct an hour of informal discussions from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM PST each Friday, and we record as many of our ideas and talking points on Github using issues. Some interesting ideas have emerged from the discussion, and I am taking some of the lowest hanging fruit from these ideas, organizing them, and working with the OAI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman team to try and bring some of these ideas to life.&nbsp; There are many other ideas that didn&rsquo;t make my starter list of project, but these are the ones I feel are the most important, would have the the greatest impact, and be achievable in small bursts of work, and to help drive some conversation I am having, I wanted to flesh out some of the top ideas here on the blog.

			<p>I have a single API request that is becoming the first call I make on a growing number of Postman ccollections. It is a call to the Postman API to pull the OpenAPI for any API I am managing using Postman. This gives me the OpenAPI contract for an API so that I can move forward as part of a variety of stops along the lifecycle, starting with mocking, documentation, and testing as part of an API-first approach, but then also potentially monitoring, securing, generate client code, or even deployment and management of an API. I am working with a number of API service providers to define Postman collections that go well beyond the common APIs you will find in the Postman API Network, helping develop entirely new categories of collections that are designed to deliver different stops along the API lifecycle, so I am looking to develop a playbook for how you create one of these new types of collections, baking your API services into the Postman platform. Publish a Team Page Any partnership with an API service provider and the Postman platform begins with publishing of a team profile to the Postman network. Providing a logo, name, and description for your company, creating your official team profile on the Postman platform&mdash;here is my reference API implementation team page from the Postman API network.&nbsp; You can manage your team profile under your team settings in your Postman dashboard. You can upload a logo, choose a name, and provide a description. When ready, you can choose to make your profile public, choosing a subdomain for your company on the Postman platform.&nbsp; This is the profile for your API services on the Postman platform, accessible by 13 million developers via their desktop application and on the web.

			<p><em>10 Nov 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am pushing forward a handful of conversations with enterprise organizations about how to better formalize their API lifecycle workflow. To help me load up my talking points in my head I wanted to publish a post here on the blog. Using Postman I am finally able to actually execute on my API lifecycle visions in the most tangible way since I started doing all of this in 2010. Postman is a Swiss Army Knife that allows me to approach the API lifecycle in a variety of ways depending on the situation I find myself in. While there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to doing APIs, there are also a lot of common patterns to use, and this is an exploration of these standardized approaches, allowing me to articulate them tomorrow during some discussions. Workspace It may seem obvious, but I am finding that having a well defined workspace to define, design, and manage APIs is essential to doing APIs well. Having a single place where you can find the contract and supporting artifacts that define each of the stops along the API lifecycle is needed to do all of this at scale, and consistently collaborate and move APIs forward. There are a handful of elements needed to define an API workspace when you are using Postman. Name - You'd be surprised at how important the name of an API can be when it comes to making it discoverable and usable by consumers--how you name your API will define a lot about it. Description - A well written description for an API is your first impression when it comes to onboarding consumers. They shouldn't be a novel, but it should provide enough information for a consumer to understand what it does. Administrative Team Members - Have your leadership team identified, make sure they are plugged in and know what needs to be done, giving them the control and observability they need.

			<p><em>28 Oct 2020</em></p>
			<p>When you sign up to access most APIs you will have to sign up for an account, create an application, and retrieve a set of keys and / or tokens before you will be able to use the API. This is standard practice that is baked into the home grown as well as Commercial API management solutions available across the landscape. This is a concept that was introduced back in 2005 by Mashery, and is something that hasn&rsquo;t changed much over the years, despite what we build on top of APIs, and use APIs for having changed significantly over the last decade. In 2020, this relic of API management past needs to evolve if API providers and consumers are going to use APIs to their fullest potential&mdash;something API management service providers are going to have to take the lead on, and get back to work innovating and not just being a commodity. When I sign up for Twitter&rsquo;s API I have to create an application before I can get the tokens I need to begin using the application. I have to provide a name, purpose, and other details about what that application is&mdash;even if I do not fully understand what that is. Most API provider&rsquo;s notion of an application means web or mobile application, but in reality it can be the &ldquo;application&rdquo; of the data, content, and algorithms being made available via an API in a variety of ways from just pulling data to integrating in real-time with other systems. As an API analyst and storyteller I rarely am building an application, but just looking to kick the tires and understand what is going on&mdash;being forced to define an application is nothing but a road block for me. I may be a small group of API consumers, but there are many other edge cases which are similar to my situation in that we represent the long tail of API consumption in the unknown unknown API...[<a href="/2020/10/28/shifting-how-api-providers-define-what-an-application-is-when-onboarding-and-integrating-with-their-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The COVID-19 API resource center we launched back in April at Postman was a success. It generated a lot of traffic and API usage, but also brought in about 75 API submissions from the community. One of the things we learned as part of this work is that more APIs doesn&rsquo;t always mean better outcomes. More APIs means they have to be properly described and tagged, making them more discoverable, but you also need to make they are all &ldquo;good&rdquo; APIs. Which, once you begin to dive in, you realize that it becomes quite a can of worms, but luckily we have the APIs.yaml specification to help us map things out in a way that allows to slowly evolve things from human to machine readable. When it came to the COVID-19 data APIs were were making available one key element of &ldquo;good&rdquo; was knowing a little more about provenance behind each of the APIs, helping us see the overlap between all of the APIs, as well as the unique outliers who were providing new and novel resources. First, to make sure everyone is up to speed, APIs.json / APIs.yaml is a simple machine readable index for defining collections of APIs, and mapping out API operations. In this scenario I am using APIs.json as the core of an API toolbox that runs 100% on GitHub using Jekyll and Github Pages. In addition to indexing the documentation and Postman collections for each API, I am adding a provenance property to help define where the data behind each API originate, producing YAML that looks like this. Right now the x-sources APIs.yaml property just provides an array of name and urls for each of the data sources behind each API. Mostly just providing a list of URL sources that can be displayed, but it is a property that could be evolved to provide more machine readable capabilities like grouped by domain, rating, public or private sector, and other things...[<a href="/2020/10/06/providing-source-metadata-as-part-of-the-api-json-index-for-data-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>One of the regular patrons of my weekly Friday open office hours around API specifications has been with API expert Marjukka Niinioja (@mniinioja), and a couple of weeks back we carved off 30 minutes to discuss the important of OpenAPI, other specifications, and the need for more education and awareness around specifications. I spend 30 minutes getting Marjukka&rsquo;s view of the landscape, and more insight into why she thinks API specifications are so important, take a listen for yourself.

What I like about chatting with Marjukka is that she gets APIs, especially OpenAPI, but more importantly she is passionate and motivate to contribute back to the community. I speak to many people about OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman Collections, and JSON Schema, but finding folks like Marjukka who are driven to help document, tell stories, and help move things forward. Thanks for your time Marjukka, and if any of you readers want to learn more about what she is working on you can join us for the regular API Specification Toolbox office hours each Friday.[<a href="/2020/10/05/talking-about-the-importance-of-api-specifications-with-marjukka-niinioja-mniinioja/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>This is a talk I gave Saturday this last morning to almost 100 students in India, helping demonstrate the potential of APIs when it comes to their career. It is easy for me to stay entrenched in a world where everyone knows what an API is, but these types of conversations help me break out of the API echo chamber and reach out to developers, would-be developers, and those are curious enough to pull back the curtains on how the web works a little bit. With this talk I am looking to convert a few more folks to my API religion. Not because APIs are always good, but because being aware of the API layer that exists beneath our digital, and increasingly physical world is important. You will be more successful in both your personal and professional lives if you are API aware, and with this talk I am looking to help lay the foundation for anyone, developer or non-developer to understand the importance of API in our digital world. What is an API?&nbsp; An API, or application programming interface is the current evolution of the web when it comes to making data, content, media, and algorithms available to different types of applications. Websites are written in HTML, and designed to be displayed to humans in our browsers. All you have to do is right click on any web page you visit and select view source to see the HTML behind any web page you are visiting. APIs provide access to the same data, content, and images used in websites, but instead of returning HTML, it returns XML or JSON which developers can render exactly as they wish in the application they are delivering. APIs are not some new software from one of the technology giants, it is just the next evolution in the web, making sure we can use deliver the same data, content, and algorithms across the applications we run on our laptops,...[<a href="/2020/09/20/why-apis-should-matter-to-you/">Read More</a>]</p>

You see, there are regular streams of people who attempt to define me based upon their view of the world, their belief system, and reduce me to a know series of transactions that compute in their version of reality. In the tech arena there are several variations of what I do for living, going by a handful of labels; evangelist, advocate, relations, ambassador, champion, or some other word. None of these disciplines possess a formal definition, and are perpetually defined by the people who fill these roles. I am not in the business of defining what people do when they wear these titles, or generalize any of them as good, bad, nor neutral.&nbsp;They are just like tech in my experience, and are only as a good or bad as the human beings they serve, and I&rsquo;m not really in a place where I give many fucks about policing any of this. However, when people say evangelists are doing bad things I tend to take offense, and sometimes feel compelled to put some words down within my domain (hrumph!). Technology and API evangelists existed before I came around in 2010, but after doing this a decade, and playing this part for enough time, I&rsquo;ve earned the right to push back, and call bullshit on the shade being thrown in my direction.&nbsp; First, I am an evangelist. I will even let my ego step up and say that I am The API Evangelist. I&rsquo;ve put down my mark. Paid my dues. I&rsquo;ve stayed the course for over ten years now, worked for the White House, with governments around the world, and most of the biggest names in tech in one capacity or another. Pure ego baby!

			<p>My partners in crime Metadata Technologies North America (MTNA) and I are working on identifying the best election data and API resources available today, and one of the gems out there, when it comes to what is available is out of the politics and sports data platform FiveThirtyEight. The data storytelling platform have made a name for themselves when it comes to predicting election outcomes, and possess some very interesting datasets around elections, which they public via a simple landing page, and on GitHub in a public repository. FiveThirtyEight Data Page - A simple page outlining all their data resources. FiveThirtyEight Data Repo - All the datasets they have in a single GitHub repo. FiveThirtyEight has general poll data, but also data for more precise questions like &ldquo;How Popular is Donald Trump?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Are Democrats or Republicans Winning the Race for Congress?&rdquo;. They provide data as CSV files via their data page and on GitHub, making it easy to get at the data behind polling and storytelling. I am working with MTNA to take things a step further, and ingesting the data files and publishing them as simple APIs, then generating collections that index all the APIs, making it easier to access all the election related files in a single collection, while also opening up the possibilities for using Postman visualizer to make sense of the data being returned. Providing self-contained API client for all the data, complete with charts, graphs, and other eye candy that make it easier to understand what is happening. I really like the&nbsp;happening approach to publishing the data via their dedicated page because it is dead simple, providing a title, more info, and a CSV download, as well as column saying how long it has been since it was updated&mdash;down to the minute.&nbsp;Providing everything you need to understand what is going on with each dataset.

Helping make it easier for developers to on-board with the Census API, but also provide a base collection I can use to develop additional workflow collections that help provide specific types of data easier to use in variety of use cases. Our data API partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA) is helping us deploy APIs on top of some valuable datasets as part of our COVID-19 resource center, and they offered to help us develop the OpenAPI and Postman collection for the U.S. Census API. Carson Hunter (@carrrson) from MTNA got to work crafting an OpenAPI 3.0 for the Census API, providing a pretty robust source of truth for the API, which we can then use to generate Postman collections to document, mock, test, and automate around the Census API, but also just use the collection as a client for running different queues and saving the results of API responses to files without having to write code. Carson did the extra work of also creating a Postman collection and publishing as documentation, helping make the API a little easier to navigate, while also making sure there is a &ldquo;Run in Postman" button available so that developers can quickly begin putting to work within their own Postman workspaces. Carson helped reduce the friction when it comes to onboarding with the Census API, while also helping me make it more discoverable as part of the various API projects I am working on. There is a lot more work we can do on these reference OpenAPI and Postman collection, but we wanted to just pause and put out there for others to comment on what they would like to see.

When I went into this work I expected serverless to play a significant role, but I have to admit I didn&rsquo;t anticipate the ways in which serverless would be used to reduce the steps it takes to actually deploy APIs. One of the tools I have been playing with for a couple of months now is Nimbella, which describes itself as &ldquo;the simplest way to build and run serverless applications&rdquo;. I spent significant amounts of time building collections for deploying APIs to AWS using Lambda earlier this year, so when I had an API deploying in just a couple of minutes with Nimbella, you can say I was pretty impressed with what they have done to serverless by making it easy, but also bringing in the critical ingredients you need to actually deliver meaningful apps. Nimbella is free to get started. Once you have logged in you can fire up your first project within 60 seconds, after installing the Nimbella CLI for Mac, Windows, or Linux. Once you have the CLI installed you can just execute: nim auth login [your token]&nbsp; This command, plus all three runtimes are available on the home page of you account once you have signed up--then you can choose to install a single one of their start projects with: nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/qrcode nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/visits nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/ocr nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/chat Or you can go ahead and clone all of their demo projects, which I recommend, because it allows you to reverser engineer a whole suite of simple serverless micro applications: git clone https://github.com/nimbella/demo-projects Within five minutes you can be reverse engineering what is possible when you deploy APIs and/or applications with Nimbella.

Nimbella is a dead simple way to deploy serverless APIs and applications, which also possesses a plugin infrastructure that lets you extend the platform, and one of the plugins the Nimbella team has developed allows you to design your APIs using a Postman collection, then generate your serverless API project in Go, Node.js, Typescript, Python, Java, Swift, or PHP.&nbsp; Once you have signed up and logged into Nimbella, and installed the CLI for the platform, you can add the Postman plugin at the command line using: nim plugins add postman You can find the Postman plugin for Nimbella on Github if you are looking to take things to the next level, but installing it is pretty dead simple with the one CLI statement. You can find all the usage options available for the Nimbella Postman CLI plugin on the GitHub README, but here is a basic command that will generate an API project from any of your Postman collections. nim project create -s postman -i Products --language js This creates a new local Nimbella API project for me using a Postman collection in one of my Postman workspaces simple named &ldquo;Products&rdquo; in JavaScript. As soon as I want this API to be available in the cloud, I simply run this command: nim project deploy . Now I have my API.

			<p>I am hung up (once again) on the fact that I can&rsquo;t post to my personal Facebook feed via the Graph API. Facebook removed the ability for you to add or update to your Facebook feed via the API in 2018. You can still post to pages via the API, but are out of luck via your personal profile. It drives me nuts because I queue, schedule, and automate a significant amount of my online presence. Honestly Facebook doesn&rsquo;t do much for my personal or professional online presence, but the fact that I can&rsquo;t do it is driving me nuts. I have an idea I want to implement around telling stories on Facebook, and without the ability to post via the API, the idea is a non-starter. I really bothers me when I can POST or PUT to any platform I depend on, and the fact that it is Facebook drives me even more nuts, making it something that I just can&rsquo;t seem to put down. Posting to My Facebook Wall Using Postman While you can&rsquo;t officially add to your feed via the official Facebook API, you can using Postman. You can install the Postman Interceptor Chrome extension, proxy traffic, and isolate the API call you need to post to your feed, including all the configuration and cookies you will need to make it work. I will write a separate post that walks through how to do this, but I just want to think through all of this before I move forward teaching other people how to do this. Like most everything with APIs, this isn&rsquo;t just technical, and there are numerous business and political considerations to flesh out before I just plow forward teaching everyone how to circumvent Facebooks limitations. I am not sure I want to me sharing this knowledge, let alone polishing the rough edges so that it is something that a wider audience can implement.

			<p>I am working on several demonstrations of what is possible when you use OpenAPI on the Postman platform, and as part of this storytelling I want to use the OpenAPI of leading API platforms to demonstrate what is possible. I am looking to showcase the potential of using an OpenAPI as a base of the API integration and development lifecycle, and today I wanted to showcase what you can quickly do when you put the OpenAPI for the Twitter API into a Postman workspace.

This OpenAPI can act as the truth for a variety of lifecycle activities, but to begin with I usually generate two collections. One for providing reference documentation for the entire API, and another to provide me with a mock representation of the entire surface area of the API, helping me articulate what the API does to team members, while also kicking the etires on it before I have to obtain a token or key.

This approach isn't unique to the Twitter API, and can be used by API providers to guide the development of APIs, or it can be done by API consumers to help localize documentation, mock servers, and other resources you will need to work with an API. If you want to see it in action you can walk through a short video, showing how you can do this in just a few minutes using Postman.

			<p><em>01 Sep 2020</em></p>
			<p>Like other successful API patterns REST and GraphQL have been in competition for mindshare since GraphQL emerged on the landscape. GraphQL folks love to say it is a replacement for REST, and the RESTafarians love to point out GraphQL&rsquo;s weaknesses. When in reality they are both very useful patterns that API providers and consumers should be aware of, and possess in their API toolboxes. In an effort to continue showcasing the importance of having a diverse API toolbox, I wanted to take a walk through my GitHub API workspace, which I use personally, but wanted to take a spin through it to help polish some of the rougher edges of my approach, before I invite some other team members to use my workspace. An OpenAPI and GraphQL Core While I have many orphan API collections laying around in workspaces, my more robust workspaces tend to leverage OpenAPI as the truth of each API, but with the GitHub API I have the opportunity to provide both an OpenAPI and GraphQL API side by side in a single workspace. Providing me with the base for all of the collections I am generating, evolving, and making work for me when integrating, automating, and orchestrating with the GitHub API. GitHub V3 OpenAPI - GitHub maintains an OpenAPI definition for their web API, allowing anyone to use as the base for generating docs, mocks, tests, and integrate, automate, and orchestrate across the API lifecycle. GotJib v4 GraphQL - I pulled the schema definition language (SDL) for the GitHub GraphQL, and published it as an API, which I can then use to generate collections&mdash;there is only a single endpoint, but still provides me with a base. These two API contracts provide me with a machine readable description of what is possible when it comes to working with the GitHub API. However, both of these require you to be fluent in OpenAPI and / or GraphQL to be able to get what...[<a href="/2020/09/01/a-diverse-api-workspace-example-using-openapi-and-graphql-from-github/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>One of the teams I work closely with at Postman is the group behind mocking APIs with Postman. The ability to statically mock APIs has received a lot of investment when it comes to recent releases, and in a couple of my Postman partner conversations I have been asked for more information about how to mock API using Postman. So, in an effort to reach the widest possible audience as I can, I wanted to write up an overview on the current state of mocking APIs using Postman, to help get everyone up to speed&mdash;including myself. ;-) Overview of Mocks Using Postman To get started with understanding the value of mocking APIs I recommend visiting the dedicated marketing page Postman has up for mocking APIs. This provides you with the meat of what you&rsquo;ll need to make the argument for mocks across your team, as well as your leadership. See Exactly How Your API will Run&mdash;Even Before It's in Production - API design is the key to building quality APIs that last. Postman's mock API servers simplify design and planning, support split-stack development, and help you ensure that your API will run the way it's supposed to in production. Shorten Time to Production - Work more efficiently with Postman's API mock servers. Postman mocks support split-stack development so front-end and back-end developers can work in parallel and view responses without spinning up the back end. Design Your API with Flexible Schema Support - Postman mock servers complement Postman's extended schema support. Write, edit, or import your API schema to define your API's data structure and generate a collection from your API schema. You can review API responses using mock servers so you can reliably build your API from the ground up&mdash;all in one central place. Simulate the Expected Behavior of Your API - Postman Mock Servers simulate API responses that applications and services can utilize even before the API is built.

			<p>One of the reason you always want to surround yourself with people who call bullshit on meaningless trends is that when you begin to fall under the spell of each wave of API blah blah blah, they will slap you upside the head and remind you what this is all about. This happened to me the other day when I mistakenly mentioned that the future of APIs is event-driven, and Fran Méndez (@fmvilas) from AsyncAPI slapped me upside the head and reminded that the future is about possessing a diverse API toolbox, allowing you to apply just the right approach to APIs for the job. Making sure we are equipped to deliver useful and meaningful APIs, not just the latest API blah blah blah because we heard it was cool somewhere. HTTP APIs, or as they are often referred to as REST APIs, are always the base layer for any API operation. This is where everyone should begin, but there are a number of other healthy patterns in use that teams should be aware of, and able to confidently implement. I began working working on this narrative back in March of 2017 with a Focus on Having a Robust and Diverse API Toolbox, which is something I kept expanding on in January of 2018 with My Evolving Definition of a Robust and Diverse API Toolbox, culminating in a talk that I gave at API Days Paris about APIs Not Just Being REST. I am thankful for Fran slapping me and reminding me that I shouldn’t fall under the spell of any single API design pattern, and that a diversity in learnings and implementations is critical to being successful in the API long game. REST, SOAP, Hypermedia, GraphQL, WebSub, Kafka, and many other successful API patterns dot the landscape.

			<p>The discovery of APIs has been the single most significant issue I&rsquo;ve tracked on and contributed to over my career as the API Evangelist. It is also one of the stops along the API lifecycle I have been very frustrated with due to a lack of things moving forward over the last decade. While there has been many failed attempts at folks trying to bring new API solutions to the table, the conversation really hasn&rsquo;t gone anywhere. That is, until the last couple of years, where we are seeing a new crop of interesting API service providers who are looking to address API discovery in new and interesting ways, bundling the discovery of APIs with other functions that help speak to the business bottom line, going well beyond just searching for APIs across the enterprise, or on the open web. I am tuned into a handful of new API focused startups who are coming at API discovery from a variety of angles, but one of them I have been meeting with weekly to discuss the importance of API discovery, but also API governance, is with the folks from TeejLab, who provide a view of the API discovery landscape through the enterprise risk management lens. TeejLab&rsquo;s API discovery solution isn&rsquo;t some API catalog or search engine, they help you discovery APIs across your existing operations, then evaluate and better manage how they are put work moving forward. Helping enterprise organizations find the existing internal, partner, and public APIs they already depend on is the #1 challenge enterprise organizations face right, and it is a problem that is only going to exponentially get worse in coming years. This is what makes TeejLab&rsquo;s so relevant, in that they don&rsquo;t just help you discover your APIs so you can use them, they help you assess the security, privacy, licensing, and other risks that come with unmanaged, ungoverned API chaos that exists across most enterprise organizations today.

I need a quick way to be able to flesh out a list of APIs, tooling, and specification that can be leveraged by developers when it comes to tackling a specific problem within an industry, issue, or conversation. This is an evolution in our strategy for shining a spotlight on the COVID-19, helping me better figure out how we can keep adding value to the COVID-19 discussion, but also quickly do the same in other areas. For the COVID-19 effort we threw up a landing page and GitHub repository back in March, and since then we&rsquo;ve seen some pretty interesting submissions and conversation come out of the community. Improving Upon the COVID-19 API Resource Center The COVID-19 API Resource Center is a listing of Postman API collection we&rsquo;ve developed, curated, and accepted from the community.&nbsp; We seed the resource center with 15 collections, and received 36 collections from the community, with 25 submission awaiting for a Postman collection to be developed so the API can be added to the list. For a total of 51 collections available on the COVID-19 resource center, providing a range of resources from data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to drugs and testing information. We successfully used GitHub to accept community submissions via issues, and evolve a pretty robust list of resources, but some of the APIs and resulting collections were of higher quality than others, and I wanted to understand why. To help me understand I went through all of them identifying the areas the could use more investment when it comes to helping individual collections, as well as the overall toolbox of collections, better serve the mission to help us in the COVID-19 fight.

			<p>I am getting more hands-on with my API governance guidance while working at Postman. It is one of the reasons I joined the company, so I could move more into the execution of my API lifecycle strategies, which also includes applying API governance. To showcase some of what I have been developing I am doing an API governance webinar this Wednesday. To help me polish the narrative around my talk, as well as my wider API governance guidance, I wanted to work through my current narrative here on the blog. What I am enjoying most about my narrative right now is that they are rooted in doing what I am talking about, allow me to get more hands-on with API governance, where for much of the last five years my stories have just been narratives without much meat on the bone. I am enjoying this shift from a more academic perspective to actually being able to deliver what I am talking about when I say API governance. An Intro API Governance Most people will go straight to API design governance when they begin talking about governance, but I prefer starting with the base of API governance that is already in motion across many API operations. Born out of an API-first approach to delivering infrastructure many teams are already delivering on governance, they just call it other names like versioning and contract testing. This is definitely the road to API governance, but it is lacking an overarching API governance strategy to effectively deliver across many different APIs developed by many different teams. To help paint the tactical API governance that is already occurring let&rsquo;s zoom in on a single API being developed using an API-first approach, and consider how it is laying the foundation for a wider and more strategic approach to governance how APIs are delivered.&nbsp; Workspace - Having a dedicated repository and / or workspace for an API provides the base for delivering APIs...[<a href="/2020/08/17/getting-more-handson-talking-about-api-governance/">Read More</a>]</p>

I am doing more workshops with students recently as part of Postman student outreach, and Ken&rsquo;s class is exactly the target audience we are interested in reaching. These are young minds who are just getting started in their careers and they should be aware of APIs, how to put them to work, but more importantly making sure they are fully tested and reliable for consumers, and the applications that are built on them. Ken&rsquo;s class is all about software quality and testing, so I figured I would take a look at how APIs can be defined, versioned, managed, and tested. I&rsquo;ll be showing them the process using Postman, which is a ubiquitous tool for developers within the enterprise but the concepts I'll demonstrate are universal an something the students can apply using different tooling, using any HTTP API. Here are the building blocks of what I&rsquo;ll be walking them through, with some links to help them get primed if they have the time.

			<p>I am working on profiling open specifications as part my work at Postman to help highlight how we can deploy APIs that use a common API and schema, reduce friction when on-boarding, while also increasing reusability across different industries. One of the open specifications on the table is from Beckn, who offers a suite of open source API specifications for things like food delivery, healthcare, and transportation--here is the description from the Beckn website describing the value they deliver. Beckn is an open protocol that enables location-aware, local commerce across industries to be discovered and engaged by any beckn-enabled application. Beckn, while being a minimal open source protocol specification, acts as a force multiplier for end-beneficiaries - customers, application developers, governments, and businesses by creating an interoperable open playground to unlock value and innovation I love to see these kinds of projects. My concern is always heldping ensure they get enough adoption to help sustain them, and contribute by helping evangelize the possibilities, which is why I am writing this post as I am working with the Beckn team to get the word out about their standard.

I have two collections I am moving forward as a proof of concept (POC), helping map out how collections can be used to not just provide and consume APIs, but also help make sure they are more consistent in how they operate. Governance (Design) - This is just the governance of the design of the API, and since this is what most folks think of when they talk about API governance, it is the place most people should start this conversation. Governance (Lifecycle) - This is for the governance of the entire API lifecycle from start to finish, really helping me push the boundaries of what a collection is for, but also how we provide guardrails for our APIs. The API design governance collection is interesting for me, but pushing myself to think about what API governance looks like for the entire lifecycle has helped me see things differently, and has allowed me to realize that you can't govern what you don't have defined, and aren't measuring.&nbsp; Some Initial Thoughts This is all still a work in progress, so I am still working to make more self-service, and something anyone can put to use as part of their operations. Here is my brain dump of thinking going into this work, which will hopefully articulate a little more about where I am at with the work and how you can help provide feedback and thoughts on where I should go next. Why Collections? - I am skeptical that any software should bake in "governance" features into their product as governance means different things to different folks, and while we can come up with a standard set of rules that will fit most enterprise organizations,...[<a href="/2020/08/03/postman-api-governance-collections/">Read More</a>]</p>

Establishing a Postman Workspace ssThis blueprint begins with establishing a team workspace in Postman for managing the OpenAPI, and any collections that are derived from the OpenAPI contract, as well as environments that will be used to abstract away tokens, secrets, and other key / value pairs needed for working with the API.&nbsp; The Postman workspace will become the source of truth for your APIs, which can then be used to power other stops along the API lifecycle. You can have a single API in a workspace, or have multiple APIs, it is up to you how you want to organize your workspaces. The goal is to just make sure there is one place you can go to find your APIs, and work with other internal stakeholders on our team to move an API forward. Leveraging the workspace, but also all the comments, history, change logs and other features, helping you get more organized about how APIs are being delivered.&nbsp; Adding OpenAPI to Postman Builder With a workspace you can now add your APIs using the Postman API builder. Each API allows you to publish an OpenAPI, establishing the central truth for each of your APIs, which we can then use to generate collections for powering stops along the API lifecycle, manage change with version, the change log, and history....[<a href="/2020/08/02/managing-your-openapi-and-postman-collection-publicly/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Aug 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am having this conversation with over five separate API providers right now, so I wanted to write it up, share it as part of these conversations, while also making it available for my wider audience here on API Evangelist. I just finished another piece on managing your OpenAPI and Postman collection publicly, laying the foundation for this post. I want these to be separate modules which people can follow and use independently, providing me with a single URL for different concepts I am discussing. While this isn&rsquo;t a a pattern everyone will want to follow, it is one possible pattern I&rsquo;ve been identifying for use by companies looking to get a handle on how APIs are being delivered across the enterprise using Postman. Building on an OpenAPI Foundation The foundation of this blueprint is all about having an OpenAPI definition within a workspace acting as the central contract for each API. Providing the cornerstone each API will need to be moved along its lifecycle, and iterated upon by all stakeholders who have access to the workspace. You can view the separate post I have on management of OpenAPI using both Postman and GitHub, but here are the moving parts of what I propose for one possible blueprint for how you want to manage your individual APIs. Workspace - Always having a dedicated workspace for each individual API or a bundle of APIs, providing a single place internal stakeholders can find whatever they need about each API to understand how it works, and influence the road map when it comes to the future iterations. Repository - Ensuring there is a GitHub repository in place to act as the partner (private) or public face of each API workspace, providing a single place that external stakeholders can can to find information on APIs, and provide feedback on each API being made available. OpenAPI - There is a versioned OpenAPI contract in place for each API, publishing one...[<a href="/2020/08/02/managing-the-api-lifecycle-using-openapi-and-postman/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am doing deep dives into each stop along the API lifecycle, beginning with deployment and management, to better understand how we can bring other features into Postman, without actually developing the features ourselves. There are two primary ways we are accomplishing this, by identifying open source solutions, and by partnering with services and tooling providers. Next up on my list is to flesh out is how we leverage the FastAPI framework as part of the Postman platform, helping developers deploy their API using the &ldquo;&nbsp;high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production&rdquo; FastAPI framework. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with FastAPI, it is one of the top open source API frameworks on Github. It is built in Python 3.6+, and based on standard Python type hints. Taken directly from the web page for FastAPI, the key features are: Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.&nbsp; Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. * Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging. Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs. Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs. Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation. Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema. I know that most Postman customers will care about all of those bullet points, but the one that really grabs my attention is the last one, and the fact that it is centered on the OpenAPI specification. As part of my OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) DemanGen efforts at Postman, and my work to flesh out different stops along the API lifecycle, I am interested in amplifying what FastAPI delivers, and work to further bake it into the Postman ecosystem.

			<p><em>30 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>This is a repost from the Postman community on a very slick COVID-19 data project with accompanying Postmn collection to actually work with the data and get back responses, and then view responses as a visualization using the Postman visualizer. Here is what was posted by Carson Hunter (@carrrson) from&nbsp;Metadata Technology North America (MTNA). We&rsquo;ve been hard at work building our&nbsp;Rich Data Services COVID-19 project&nbsp;4&nbsp;and are excited to finally be releasing it to the public and to have our API included in the Postman COVID-19 API Resource Center. The API includes a free-to-use and always-expanding catalog of curated COVID-19 data and metadata that&rsquo;s all set up to use with the Postman collection. (Docs are&nbsp;here&nbsp;2, or run it with the button below.) The API has a lot of great features for querying and packaging data, but maybe the coolest thing of interest to the Postman community is the ease of integration with charting libraries, so you can create visualizations quickly and easily. In this collection, we&rsquo;ve focused on using amCharts, but RDS also supports Plotly and Google Charts if that&rsquo;s your thing. By specifying one of these libraries in the request, the API returns the data in a format that&rsquo;s directly consumable by the library, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about manipulating the response. We&rsquo;ve included some visualization examples from the collection below, but the amCharts library is vast and there is a lot of COVID data out there, and we would love to see any creations the Postman community comes up with using the API. You can tweet us at&nbsp;@mtnaus. Cheers!

			<p>I am working to better understand the Moesif Analytics API so that I can define a new type of Postman collection I am calling an API management collection. You wouldn&rsquo;t use this collection to make calls to an API you operate, you would use it to automate and orchestrate the API management layer you use to operate your APIs. I am working with several API management providers, but Moesif came up in my queue of work, and I feel they represent a more progressive view of the API management landscape, so I got to work pushing this conversation forward. I recently worked to create an OpenAPI and Postman collection for the Moesif API, so that I can better understand what they offer, and now I want to learn how some of Moesif&rsquo;s customers are using their APIs, and ShipEngine was kind of enough to work with Moesif and me to help define an API management blueprint based upon how they manage their API infrastructure. ShipEngine uses both Postman and Moesif, so they provide a pretty compelling blueprint for modeling my API management collection after.&nbsp; I am looking to better understand which of the 12 Moesif resources they put to work using the Moesif API, so I can plan the next big of work on this partnership effort.

			<p>I am making my way through all of the partner conversation I am having, publishing stories for each of the conversations to help me move each one forward. Today I am focusing on API management providers because I am looking to define a baseline set of resources across all providers to consider for deeper integration, and of course storytelling. I&rsquo;ve been talking with the Mulesoft folks since last year, working to find some ways we can partner and provide value for both of our customers. As with every other partnership, and especially API lifecycle partners, everything begins as a collection. If I can&rsquo;t get at the APIs behind a service, create an OpenAPI and Postman collection for the API, then it isn&rsquo;t an API lifecycle capability I can think about for deeper integration, and further storytelling. But Mulesoft isn&rsquo;t messing around, and they have Swagger and RAML available for all of their API lifecycle services and tooling&nbsp; I downloaded the generated Swagger 2.0 definitions Mulesoft provides for their API manager and API platform. There are some other interesting APIs available there that I would like to see live as Postman collections. Honestly, I&rsquo;d like to see all of the APIs they have published via the Mulesoft // Dev catalog in the Postman API network, as well as Postman collection added to the dropdown list Mulesoft provides for each API, allowing it&rsquo;s definition to be downloaded as RAML, Swagger, or Postman Collection. As with the other API management service providers I am profiling as part of this work, I created a Postman workspace for managing Mulesoft APIs. With the Swagger 2.0 and Postman collections for the Mulesoft API Manager and API Platform I can begin to break down the individual capabilities that the API management solution provides.

			<p>I am working my way through profiling API analytics provider Moesif. I have a pile of partner related work accumulating and there is no better way to work through what is going on than just writing here on API Evangelist&mdash;it is what this blog is all about. I am interested in Moesif because they are a next generation API management provider that represents the ever expanding universe of what we need to manage our APIs at scale. With the consolidation and commodification of API management since 2015, we&rsquo;ve seen more specialized API service providers emerge like Moesif who are focused on just one aspect of management&mdash;like analytics. My review of any API service provider always begins with looking at their own developer area, and identifying whether or not they have an API (all API service providers should have APIs)&mdash;Moesif has one. Next, I need a machine readable API definition&mdash;either an OpenAPI or Postman, ideally both, as they have varied but overlapping purposes. Moesif is using Postman, which I will talk about more in a bit, but alas there wasn&rsquo;t an easy OpenAPI or Postman collection for me to put to work (shame shame). Luckily they use Slate for their docs, which always means there is some easy to scrape and parse markdown or HTML right behind things. I quickly generated an OpenAPI for the Moesif API analytics API. It isn&rsquo;t a complete OpenAPI, but it does give me the paths, summaries, and parameters in a machine readable format. I can use this to generate a Postman collection, then begin using it to certify each of the endpoints, saving examples, and making for a more robust definition for docs, mocks, testing, and other lifecycle stops. To continue working with my Moesif OpenAPI definition I will need to create a dedicated workspace in Postman for my work with this partner, and publish the OpenAPI in my Postman API Builder. With the entry level OpenAPI in Postman, I...[<a href="/2020/07/29/developing-a-reference-openapi-and-collection-for-the-moesif-analytics-api-so-that-i-can-build-an-api-management-collection/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am profiling a number of API management APIs right now and reaching out to each of their teams to discuss moving forward a set of official API management collections that I can have published to the API network, and use to flesh out more API lifecycle capabilities within the Postman platform. Postman isn&rsquo;t an API management service provider, so it make sense for us to expose existing API management and gateway solutions as integrations, rather than attempt to build anything on our own, partnering with the best of breed API management solutions already in use. This will be our approach to other stops along the API lifecycle, weighing the possibilities with each stop, based upon what already exists in the space, and what the opportunities are for us to build, partner, or a mix of both. Next up on my list of API service providers is to profile and assess as part of this work is WSO2. I&rsquo;ve worked with WSO2 since way back in 2012, so I am somewhat familiar with their product and services. As with all of the other API management providers I am profiling I am looking for an existing OpenAPI or Postman collection to help me understand what is possible with each API. It was pretty easy to find the Swagger file for each of the WSO2 publisher, store, and administrative APIs, but I couldn&rsquo;t easily find them for their tokens or analytics API, or their Microgateway&mdash;I will ping them to see if they have Swagger for these. I was able to upload three Swagger 2.0 definitions into a Postman workspace&mdash;I normally would upgrade to OpenAPI 3.0, but since these were provider managed specs I will keep them as is, in case I need to update. There are a wealth of resources available across these three WSO2 API, and having them available as Swagger definitions, and generated Postman collections helps me make sense of what is possible.

			<p>It can be difficult to understand exactly what OpenAPI is and what it isn&rsquo;t sometimes. I get a lot of questions from folks who don&rsquo;t entirely grasp what the OpenAPI specification is, and how it applies to the API lifecycle. It is alright to not fully get all the technical details of the specification, and I want to acknowledge this deficiency in the space, and help address the challenges by holding a 30 minute open office hours where I will introduce what OpenAPI is each week--helping on-board new people to the world of OpenAPI. These discussions will start out pretty free form, with me developing some curriculum to help introduce folks to the spec, but is something I would refine each week based upon the questions I get from the public. I am looking to begin with just walking through some of the most common elements of OpenAPI 3.1, helping lay the foundation for what OpenAPI is all about:s History - Quick recap of how we got here, including the difference between Swagger and OpenAPI. Purpose - A look at what OpenAPI is for and why it has become a standard for defining APIs. Objects - Walking through the core objects that are present as part of the OpenAPI spec. YAML / JSON - Talking about how you can use YAML or JSOn to define your OpenAPIs. Services - Looking at some of the services that have adopted the OpenAPI spec as standard. Tooling - Looking at some of the open source tooling that have embraced the OpenApI spec. I think that is all I will have time for when it comes to the 30 minutes. Initially I&rsquo;d like to just run through the basics of OpenAPI, and I can do 30 minutes sessions dedicated to other sections in future office hours.

			<p>OpenAPI has been around for five years now. There really is no reason for so many folks are still talking about Swagger 2.0, when there are more benefits associated with the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, and more modern services and tooling that utilizes the current version of the API specification. I want to open up a conversation about this, discuss the challenges that people face, and help folks understand what the difference is between Swagger and OpenAPI, and why they should be moving forward, and not staying in the past. This recurring session will start out exploring the divide and misconception that exists, and then evolve to be more formal about what enterprise organizations are needing to migrate: History - Quick recap of how we got here, including the difference between Swagger and OpenAPI. Differences - What are the key differences between Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0.  Services - Look at how API services providers are using each of the specifications. Tooling - Understand the diff between tooling in both areas, understanding where deficiencies are. Storytelling - How can we tell more stories about OpenAPI that help people understand the difference. The goal here is to develop some basic curriculum that helps teams make the switch from Swagger to OpenAPI. Part of this will be to understand how to help get the word out about the difference and why it matters that we move forward. There is a number of misconceptions that exist the prevent folks from moving forward, and I am looking to help clear things up, get people focusing on the future of the specification, and shift the conversation to services and tooling around OpenAPI 3.0.

			<p><em>21 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>One of the areas I am working on defining at Postman is how we partner with API providers, and API service providers. We are doing a lot of partnering right now, but we do not have a formal program for how we engage with our partners. Over the last couple of months I have been working to identify who all of our partners are, and define the common ways we partner with these various companies, non-profit organizations, institutions, and government agencies. I have a lot of people reaching out about partnering, and there are a lot of interesting APIs, services, and tooling providers I am looking to partner with, so we will need to get a little more formal about things if we are going to take things to the next level. One of the most obvious ways I can encourage folks to partner with Postman is to publish a collection for their API to the Postman public API network. Once Postman formalizes its partner strategy, this will become the lowest tier of partnership for the platform and community, providing a self-service way to engage with us (pssst! you don't have to wait). If you aren&rsquo;t familiar, the Postman network is a public directory of APIs. To join all you have to do is click n the dropdown menu for each of your API collections, and choose to publish as docs. &nbsp;As part of the process you are given the option to publish as part of the Postman API network&mdash;making your collection available on the web, and within the Postman desktop client. There are a bunch of settings as part of publishing documentation using Postman, and the collection discovery portion of the settings will allow you to control how things are published (or not). Once you hit publish the documentation and run in Postman button for your collection will show up under your user or team page, which is something you can repeat over and...[<a href="/2020/07/21/the-quickest-way-to-partner-with-postman-is-through-the-network/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am working my way through all of the partner work I have on my workbench, and there is no better way to work through it than to write it out as blog posts here on API Evangelist. I just talked about how the easiest way to partner with Postman is by adding your collections to the API network. This is no guarantee of partnership, because Postman doesn&rsquo;t have a formal partner program yet, but it is a quick way to get on the Postman community radar, and if your API and collection is interesting enough, we are likely to want to showcase more in other storytelling. Adding your collection to the Postman network is self-service and easy to do, you don&rsquo;t need to talk with Postman to do it, but there is also another way in which you can partner with Postman that is also self-service, and will also get our attention. You can bake collections into your platform, which we like to call &ldquo;runtime integrations&rdquo;, because API service providers are integrating the Postman runtime into their services, and adopting the Postman collection schema as a common way to define API requests and workflows on their platform. An example of a Postman runtime integration can be found with API monitoring provider APIMetrics, who allows their customers to import a Postman collection and fire up industrial grade API monitoring at scale. Postman does monitoring, but it makes sense to embrace other service providers who offer competing or more comprehensive services, and a Postman collection is the perfect unit of currency to define this relationship. APIMetrics benefits from the over 11 million users of Postman, and Postman benefits because our customers can scale the services they use with Postman, and with all of our partners. Beyond APIMetrics, here are a handful of other service providers who have baked the Postman collection into their platforms.

			<p>I recently harvested all of the open source tooling that is being built on the OpenAPI and Swagger specifications from GitHub. I am looking to better understand what people are doing with the specification, and parsing the words people use to describe their open source project is a good way for me to quickly pull together a list of what matters. If people are building a tool to solve a problem, and publish that on GitHub, it is a good sign that it is an itch needing scratching--here is the tag cloud from this list of what people are doing with both Swagger and OpenAPI.

Semantically they all don&rsquo;t jive, but it does paint an interesting picture of what is happening in the OpenAPI community. I am going to be working on this list to establish a more solid reference for the OpenAPI community. I am looking to profile all of these tools as part of the OAI demand generation work I am doing, but I am also interested in continuing to map the API lifecycle and keep mapping how open source OpenAPI tooling fits into the picture. We have built up a lot of momentum over the years, but this landscape is still pretty fractured and disorganized, making it difficult to navigate&mdash;I am looking to change that.[<a href="/2020/07/20/what-are-people-doing-with-swagger-and-openapi/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I conducted the first OAI Demand Generation Public Office Hours last Friday. On behalf of the OAI I am looking to generate more awareness and demand around the specification, helping bring together members and non-members in the community to tell more stories about what is happening around the specification. I pitched the idea as part of the OAI marketing meeting, and didn&rsquo;t want to waste any time in scheduling a meeting and getting the conversation going. We had a pretty small turnout for the first one, resulting me just talking about what I am already working on for over a half hour. However, we now have over 20 people added to the invite for the recurring meeting every Friday at 8:00 AM Pacific Time. Here are a few ways you can catch up on what is going on, and get involved: Head Over to GitHub - We are managing this effort out in the open on GitHub, using the README as a home page, and issues to help track ideas and projects that are moving forward. View Last Weeks Video - I am recording each session and publishing to YouTube for those who can&rsquo;t make it. This one isn&rsquo;t the highest quality, but I will get better at doing these in the future. Join the Conversation - Go ahead and email info@apievangelist.com if you&rsquo;d like to be added to the Google Calendar invite for the OAI DemandGen Public Office Hours, and get the meeting in your calendar. We are looking to gather ideas from across the community about how we can build awareness of the OpenAPI specification, and increase more demand for the services and tooling that is built on top of it. I am aggregating ideas via the issue for the projects GitHub repository, and moving forward projects as I have time. If there is an idea you have, or an existing idea you have time to help move forward please jump in.

			<p><em>20 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I like researching and thinking more about each of&nbsp;the 13 AsyncAPI protocol bindings. It paints a picture of the past, present, and future of APIs for me. Leveraging AsyncAPI to define your event and message driven APIs is the future of API development, but one of the things I really, really, really, love about AsyncAPI as a specification is that the definition for the HTTP binding is just OpenAPI. Similar to how OpenAPI and AsyncAPI have baked in JSON Schema, AsyncAPI has baked in OpenAPI. In my opinion, this is how API specifications should work. There shouldn&rsquo;t be one specification to rule them all, we let API specs compete on usefulness and the tooling that is built on top, and build on top of the specifications that already exist, preventing us from reinventing the wheel.&nbsp; This kind of extensibility and reuse is what APIs are all about. This isn&rsquo;t a question of OpenAPI vs. AsyncAPI, it is a question of AsyncAPI and OpenAPI. I know there is a lot of investment going into thinking about OpenAPI overlays for the next version, but as we have these thoughts I want to make sure this type of reuse gets considered. I am thinking very deeply about OpenAPI again, but I also find myself thinking very deeply about a number of API, data, and other operational level API specifications, and how they all work in concert. I am also thinking about where we need potentially new specifications, industry level specifications, and trying to find the bandwidth to continue talking about the future of APIs.json providing an index for all of API operations. OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman collections have come a long way over the years, and I feel pretty poised to radically move forward how the API factory floor operates within the enterprise. I learned a lot about the technology, business, and politics of APIs by participating in the evolution of API specs from 2010 through...[<a href="/2020/07/20/openapi-is-the-http-binding-in-asyncapi/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have been asked by more than 10 people in the last couple of weeks for more information for helping them make sense of the whole event-driven API landscape.

			<p><em>14 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am making my rounds with folks in the API community talking about the next generation of the OpenAPI specification, getting people to move beyond Swagger 2.0, tooling and service providers to adopt more of the spec, and generate more demand for the specification and the work going on around it. Demand generation is such a business term to describe what I envision, but it is a word that people in the sector get, and neatly sums up what we need to do, so to hell with it. The OpenAPI spec has continued to evolve and grow, but things have clearly plateaued when it comes to the narrative coming out of the OAI, and from people doing interesting things with the specification in the API space. There is lots of activity, but there isn&rsquo;t a clear overarching narrative about what is OpenAPI, why OpenAPI, and the tooling and service enablement that is occurring around it. I am looking to change this, gather ideas, turn up the volume, and get more people working with OpenAPI 3.1, and investing in the future of the spec. To help drive the demand generation discussion around OpenAPI I am going to be holding a recurring weekly demand generation discussion right after the regular OAI marketing meeting&mdash;here are the details if you want to join in the conversation.

			<p><em>13 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I started planning API Evangelist in July of 2010 after I saw what was happening with APIs being used in the cloud, and powering mobile applications. By September I had a plan in place, and I figured out a name, bought a domain, and had established my approach to researching what was going on with web APIs. Ten years later I am still doing the work, and even though I&rsquo;ve managed to burn out a couple of times, have had life get I&rsquo;m the way, and more recently joined Postman as their Chief Evangelist, I am still beating the drum after all these years. I have learned a lot over the last decade. I don&rsquo;t see APIs as good, nor bad, nor neutral anymore&mdash;they are as good or bad as whoever is wielding them, which with the lax security and ethics of most companies, it isn't always the API provider inflicting the most damage to the ecosystem. APIs leave me very concerned most days. I am not very keen on building and owning production APIs in the current online world, but I am happy to stay in tune with how the machine works, help evangelize for some ethics and sanity in how we use them, and hopefully be somewhat of a voice of reason in the space, even if I am still doing a significant amount of selling of the concept, and perpetuating of the myths.&nbsp; The Only Thing That Has Changed Is That There Are More APIs There really hasn&rsquo;t been any seismic shifts in the API landscape during my 10 years of studying what is going on. 80% of what occurs across the API lifecycle was going on in 2010. There are just more people doing it. Sure, there are a few new tricks and tools, but for the most part the APIs in 2020 are just like they were in 2010, it is just more mainstream companies doing them now, as well...[<a href="/2020/07/13/i-started-api-evangelist-10-years-ago/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jun 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am speaking tomorrow at 1PM Pacific time about using Postman collections and environments to define and power the API lifecycle at apidays INTERFACE. I am stoked that I get to have a dream job where I get paid to push forward ideas at this level, and wanted to share some of the ways I am using OpenAPI in conjunction with Postman collections and environments to define then execute across the API lifecycle for a variety of APIs. My talk is going to walk through the relationship between an OpenAPI and collections, but also begin pushing forward the notion of what collections are for, while also demonstrating that environments can be used for much more than just a place to put your API tokens and keys. Most developers know that you can use a Postman collection to store the details of an API you want to make requests to, helping you keep track of the all the details of each request and response. Developers have tons of these collections laying around, sometimes organized by personal and team workspaces. Developers are also using Postman environments to abstract away keys, tokens, and other key / values pairs that can be used across one or many collections. What most developers do not know is that you can use collections and environments to also deploy and manage your API across multiple stops along the API lifecycle, while also using them to measure and govern what is going with each API as it moves forward across a standardized API life cycle. My talk at APIdays INTERFACE is focused on this evolution in how Postman collections and environments can be applied to not just defining APIs, but also defining the API lifecycle. API Lifecycle Foundation To help ground each API I am developing I establish a strong foundation for moving each API forward, providing me with a layer I can use for delivering every other stop along the API lifecycle, consistently...[<a href="/2020/06/29/i-am-speaking-about-powering-the-api-lifecycle-with-collections-environments-tomorrow-at-apidaysglobal-interface/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>My head is swirling from a flurry of exciting meetings around what different Postman features are being worked on currently. I can&rsquo;t speak directly on the features until they are released, but I am keen on pushing forward my understanding of the stops along the API lifecycle being served so that I can be articulate in meetings, while also helping light the fire under my readers imagination about what is possible with APIs. Today my head is moving very rapidly across the types of APIs I am producing or seeing produced, as well as the variety of approaches employed to bring these APIs to life&mdash;spanning from simple mocking of an API to full blow deployment of APIs at scale across multiple platforms, frameworks, and languages. I am thinking the overlap between examples I used in my APIs, how I mock with these examples, then evolve them into more static, synthetic, and dynamic mock implementations, or even possibly how these APIs then become real world production deployments. Currently you can mock your APIs with a variety of services, including Postman. I have also played around with a variety of ways to deploy APIs from an OpenAPI using Postman. I am looking for ways to help better quantify, visualize, and understand the different types of data we are making available via APIs, how those APIs are defined, hardened, and scaled, as well as documented and immediately accessible via a client like Postman.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have the first clue in how to map this out as a single visualization or coherent narrative, but that won&rsquo;t stop me from trying. Here are the dimensions I am working within, trying to define some sort of Venn diagram regarding how they work in concert. I can&rsquo;t quite see it all yet, but this post is designed to help me bring it more into focus.

			<p>I spent the last week looking through open source tooling built around leading API specifications. If you are tuned into the RSS or Twitter feed from this blog you probably saw the exhaust from my research. People who don&rsquo;t understand what API Evangelist is about often see these as listicle posts, and are confused by my erratic scheduling and release of these posts. If you understand that API Evangelist isn&rsquo;t a tech blog in the normal sense, and that it is my professional API workbench, then you understand I am often times working towards some sort of research goal with each post. Well, this post is the next step in that research, taking me 12 separate research sprints to look through the API specification layer of our industry.&nbsp; I am very interested in the top open source tools developed on top of these API specifications. However, I am also very interested in understanding how each of these tools contribute value to different stops along the API life cycle. These are the essential building blocks I identify to help me understand what people on the ground within organizations are needing when it comes to delivering APIs. Resulting in a pretty interesting list of capabilities, which are ordered based upon the frequency they are mentioned across all to the tooling for each of these dimensions. The results of this research is all pulled from GitHub, so I recognize it is an incomplete snapshot, but I still see it as the most representative source we have from across the API industry of how people are investing across the API life cycle.&nbsp; Postman&nbsp;(See Open Source Tools) Collections, Testing, Data, Repos, Run,&nbsp; CRUD, CLI , Client, Database.

			<p><em>08 Jun 2020</em></p>
			<p>I had begun playing around with the concept of API brokers back in 2014, and it is something that is recurring and evolving in a handful of the conversations I am having in the Postman ecosystem lately. API brokering is the concept that instead of developers directly engaging with all of the public APIs they will ned for an application, that a professional API broker could discover, sign-up, setup applications, and aggregate documentation, client libraries, and other essential items for developers. So all an application developer has to do is fire up a workspace, and they have all the docs, code, keys, and other elements ready to go for them to just start building. Saving an organization time and money by outsourcing much of the tedious work involved with discovering APIs, on-boarding with them, and preparing to build an API, letting organizations focus on what they do best. &nbsp; Most of my talk in the past has been conceptual around being an API broker, but now with Postman I can actually do it for realz. I can take the many different workspaces of API collections I have and use them to populate client specific workspaces. Meaning I can setup a workspace specifically for companies I know that want quick access to a variety of APIs--without the friction of on-boarding themselves. Here are the building blocks I&rsquo;ve established for my own definition of the API broker / client relationship. &nbsp; User - I am on the business plan, so I add a new slot for each of my clients, paying for their team license as part of the overall value that I am delivering to them. They use this user account whenever they are engaging with the API I am maintaining for them. I can apply appropriate roles, and terminate access whenever the relationship ends.&nbsp; Workspace - I setup a single workspace for my client, allowing them to access only the API, collections, environments, tests, and...[<a href="/2020/06/08/setting-up-api-broker-workspaces/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Business is anything but usual these days. I have a lot of time on my hands when it comes to writing and working online, but the reality in the chair is anything but easy. When I sit down to tackle even the most basic of tasks I can usually make it through about 50% of the work before I feel drained, and left with a blank screen for a brain. In addition to COVID-19 and the #BlackLivesMatter uprising, we also lost the kid this month. Making for a swirling emotional mess of a reality that really isn&rsquo;t conducive to doing much beyond just reading a book or watching a movie. Looking through my notebook there are numerous half, or even complete stories about APIs I could be publishing, but my blank screen of a brain can&rsquo;t even properly edit them, let along grock and finish many of the API stories I was pushing forward. It is difficult for me on the best day to conjure up some storytelling about APIs here on the blog. With that said, it also can be useful to lose myself thinking about some technical topics if I can find ways to convince myself that they are meaningful in these times. Technology is no replacement for direct human action, but the forces we are up against are actively wielding API-driven technology against us, and pushing back on this has always been what API Evangelist is all about. It isn&rsquo;t about just saying the Twitter API can be used for social justice, it is also about demonstrating to folks that the Twitter API is also being used to surveil and manipulate us. Pulling back the curtain on how all of this works is the cornerstone of what API Evangelist does, and I&rsquo;m determined to find ways of doing this in service of the #BlackLivesMatter uprising. This is one of those &ldquo;getting back on the horse&rdquo; posts.

			<p>I am tasked with defining what sharing and collaboration means when it comes to API operations at work. I have never had a tool like Postman to help me define how we work as a team across an organization. Normally, I just do a lot of hand waving and say, &ldquo;you do it like this&rdquo;, and call it good. With Postman, I now have an opportunity to anchor what I am talking about using the current state of the Postman platform, as well as help shape the future by influencing the Postman road map.&nbsp; To help me prepare for more coherent storytelling on the Postman blog, and as part of other conversations, I want to work my way through what the core features of Postman are when it comes to sharing and collaboration. There are many levels to how you can share and collaborate within Postman, which will have different impacts on the ground within enterprise organizations. To help me map Postman functionality to the real world of API operations, I wanted to break down the different level of sharing and collaboration that exists within Postman. Team Level The essential ingredient of API sharing and collaboration is a team. You just can&rsquo;t effectively share and collaborate at the provider level without a team. You can share and collaborate in spontaneous ways amongst API provider stakeholders, as well as API consumer stakeholders, but with a well defined team of stakeholders you can take sharing and collaboration to new levels. Here are a couple of the core Postman features that facilitate sharing and collaboration across API operations. Create a Team - The act of creating a team in Postman, and upgrading your account to support the size and scope of your team is the first thing you can do to help lay a foundation that facilitates sharing and collaboration within a team, but also between teams.

			<p><em>22 May 2020</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;d say one of the most controversial aspects of the world of APIs involves the places where people are used to and prefer to deal with API complexity at. After you look at thousands of APIs you begin to better understand where people introduce complexity into the design of an API, and as more people become familiar with any single approach they are much more likely to stick with it over time, bake it into their APIs, and passionately believe it is the normal pattern that everyone else is and should be using. You can see what I am talking about at the heart of the microservices debate, where the API complexity is dealt with at the API level, or in the number of APIs you have&mdash;something many increasingly are finding to be unacceptable. Another way you can see the API complexity debate unfolding across the API space is within the graphQL, where the complexity is at the schema level, and believers truly think that this is where API complexity should live. I try to not be too prescriptive on where API complexity should lie because the reasons why you want to increase or decrease the scope and complexity of an API will vary widely depending on what you are delivering with the API, the organization where it is being produced, and who will be consuming it. First, What is API Complexity? I feel like it is important to set the stage with what is complex. To provide a complicated view of what complexity can be, the definition for the complexity is, &ldquo;the state or quality of being intricate or complicated&rdquo;, with the definition of complicated being, &ldquo;consisting of many interconnecting parts or elements; intricate.&rdquo;, and the definition of intricate being, &ldquo;very complicated or detailed&rdquo;. ;-)&nbsp; Here are some of the questions that nag me as I think about API complexity. Is complexity in each individual API instance necessary? Is complexity in each individual API...[<a href="/2020/05/22/what-layer-are-you-used-to-api-complexity-being-at/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I had some thoughts bouncing around in my head the last couple days about where the value in this whole API game actually resides. When it comes to the types of APIs I am seeing be deployed, and where I see things head in the near future, I wanted to try and map out where the different moving parts of an API are, and assigning value to each component. At first I just wanted to think more deeply about how Claude Shannon the father of information theory would see (or not see) the value in APIs. In 1948 Claude Shanno wrote in his&nbsp;Mathematical Theory of Communication: The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. In 2020, I feel like the message is still the center of value, but I would disagree about the meaning of those messages being irrelevant, but that is another post. However I would say that other dimensions have emerged in the 70+ years since Shannon wrote his theory. I would argue that Shannon's view of the message still hold true in 2020, but I just think he couldn't have imagined the many ways in which protocols, connections, formats, channels, and the network, performance, and volume of messages would influence the purpose, meaning, and ultimately value of each message, and messages in bulk.

			<p><em>07 May 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am fleshing out ideas from a couple of recent conversations around API life cycle religion and philosophy. We&rsquo;ve made our way through several lofty ideologies around how you should or shouldn&rsquo;t do APIs, and next up in the queue is API specification first, or API spec first development. I like the phrase. I like it a lot. However, I am afraid if we aren&rsquo;t being precise in what we mean by it we might be sacrificing a more meaningful usage of it for delivering a certain class of API that is meant for reuse. This is another one of my pedantic API definition stories, but since it is meant to help me use my words better in these conversations I am having, and secondarily for a wider reading here on the blog, you are going to have to bear with me as I work through my feels about API spec first development (should there be any dashes in there?) To help guide me in my work, I am using my API reference implementation &ldquo;Union Fashion&rdquo; as a foundation for this narrative. I&rsquo;ve been calling what I am doing with Union Fashion API-first, but honestly I&rsquo;m just looking to build out the best reference implementation that I can showing how to do APIs thoughtfully&mdash;I am not trying be prescriptive about there being one way do APIs, or one phrase to describe it. It just doesn&rsquo;t exist. However, I do like peeling back the layers on the onion until I cry. When it comes to Union Fashion I might be agreeable to calling what we are doing API spec first development, if we are using it in two possible ways. Let&rsquo;s use the Union Fashion products API to help break things down and see if we can&rsquo;t help flesh out what we mean by API spec first development.

			<p>I am working up towards a loftier piece on the importance of RBAC to the API life cycle, and as part of my research I was going through all of the documentation postman has for roles and permission at the team, workspace, api, and collection levels. RBAC is one of those layers of the API discussion that touches on almost every other layer, making it an area you have to not just think about at the microscopic levels within workspaces, but also at the macro level thinking about organizational and team level impact. I&rsquo;m feeling like I am going to need to flesh out several dimensions of what is RBAC here on the blog, as well as the other critical factors of what influences RBAC across operations. The Basic Building Blocks of Postman RBAC To get a handle on things I wanted to think deeply about the core building blocks of Postman RBAC, and consider the roles, as well as the objects in which access is being controlled, but also the downstream effects of how RBAC gets applied or not. When you browse the Postman Learning Center under roles and permissions&nbsp;you get the following breakdown: Team Role Admin: manage team members and team settings Billing: manage team plan and payments Developer: access team resources and workspaces Workspace Roles Admin: manage workspace details and members Collaborator: work on team resources in a workspace API Roles Editor: edit APIs directly Viewer: view, fork, and export APIs Collection Roles Editor: edit collections directly Viewer: view, fork, and export collections That represents nine individual roles defined by the API resources in which they are applied. Postman does a good job of breaking out the control each role has in each of the respective areas, but the overall effectiveness of RBAC will be determined by how solid of a strategy you have for defining and managing each of these areas&mdash;meaning you are going to to have a strategy in place,...[<a href="/2020/05/05/the-basics-of-postman-role-based-access-control-rbac/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was playing around with my co-worker Sue Smith&rsquo;s Learn by API project today, and found it to be a pretty powerful usage of Postman for not just teaching users about Postman, but also teach them about healthy practices when it comes to API design. The Learn by API Postman collection provides an interesting building block for development of other introductory API concepts, but also API design concepts in service of a formal API governance strategy across an organization. I recommend you just click on the Run in Postman button for the Learn by API to collection to better understand the potential, but I&rsquo;d also like to break down what she did to help illustrate how it could be used as an API education and training blueprint. Learning Collection The Learn by API collection is a single request wrapped in a portable Postman collection, allowing anyone (with Postman installed) download into their desktop client and execute. Teaching anyone (developers or non-developers) about the fundamentals of Postman, API design, as well as how the web works in general. To begin learning, all you do is click send in Postman once you have imported the collection, and you&rsquo;ll will be introduced to the next step. The collection introduces each user to how Postman makes requests, how APIs are designed by showing the mechanics of how the web is working behind our web and mobile applications. It also really shows how Postman is all about helping you understand APIs by peeling back the layers of HTTP requests and responses in a hands on way. Visualizer Experience Once you have clicked send you see the response body as JSON, however if you click on the Visualize tab. Here you are given an HTML view of the tutorial you have initiated.

			<p>I have had a pretty massive API story in my notebook for a couple of weeks now that I just didn&rsquo;t have the emotional bandwidth to process, but eventually I&rsquo;m finding the energy to think about APIs at this scope. The TL;DR is that the US Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) finalized a historic rule to provide patients more control of their health care using APIs--from the HHS announcement: &ldquo;ONC&rsquo;s final rule establishes secure, standards-based application programming interface (API) requirements to support a patient&rsquo;s access and control of their electronic health information. APIs are the foundation of smartphone applications (apps). As a result of this rule, patients will be able to securely and easily obtain and use their electronic health information from their provider&rsquo;s medical record for free, using the smartphone app of their choice.&rdquo; I wanted to understand what this means for healthcare APIs. I&rsquo;ve gone down the Blue Button API rabbit hole several times before, and I have an intimate awareness of how much time is involved with just loading all the moving parts into your head. However, this is why I write on API Evangelist, to help me process big ideas like this through ongoing API storytelling, and whittle away at projects I may not have time for in waves. I finally made time to do a first dive into this monumental precedent in the US federal government directing healthcare providers to deploy APIs, loading it all up in my head so I can chew on for a bit. The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule The technical meat of this can be found within the CMS interoperability and patient access final rule. Helping me better understand what is being asked of healthcare providers, and who the providers even are. At this point the rule sounds promising because of its scope, but really the devil is in the details--the CMS interoperability and patient access final rule document(s) provide: &nbsp;Information and tools...[<a href="/2020/05/05/hhs-and-cms-finalizes-rules-to-provide-patients-more-control-of-their-health-data-using-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

Most people think my blog is for them, and it is, but first and foremost it is about me working through my ideas and projects. I haven&rsquo;t been feeling like writing much during the current situation we find ourselves in, but this morning I was needing some help getting to some items on my task list that have been sitting a little to long. Resulting in three posts here on the blog, and me remember why I do this, which always helps me find renewed energy in my work. I have about 10 different items I was looking to accomplish today, but three of them made for pretty worthy stories that helped me better understand what is going on while also pushing me to articulate my ideas to other people. Here is the result of me clearing three items from my task list today: Learn by API - I was impressed by a new type of collection my co-worker at Postman came up with, making learning about APIs and Postman a hands-on experience. I am going to adopt her approach for my Union Fashion API reference project.

			<p>I have used Postman in a handful of webinars and takes recently to demonstrate how you can quickly go from idea to a tangible usable API. My goal is to equip myself with a way to I can quickly demonstrate an API I have in my head to someone else in five minutes or less. This is a walkthrough of that process, hopefully showing you a quick way to be more effective in how you share and collaborate around APIs. Allowing anyone, even non-developers to make their abstract ideas a little more tangible and real for others. Oakland Restaurants JSON To demonstrate how you can quickly deploy an API using Postman I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of some of the restaurants in Oakland (where I live) that are still open for take-out and delivery. To demonstrate what is possible I have added four restaurants to a JSON file, providing me with what I&rsquo;d like to see for my API response. This JSON will become the response for me new API, providing a list of restaurants for Oakland. However, with an eye for the future I will be looking to create separate JSON responses for Berkeley and other surrounding cities, breaking up my API into more usable chunks. New API Request in Postman To launch my new restaurants API I am opening up Postman, creating a new request for the API I am wanting to share with others. Adding a path resource named restaurants with a city parameter with a value of Oakland, allowing me to break things up by city in the near future. Save Request as a Collection Before I can actually put my new imaginary API to work I will need to save the request as part of a collection.

			<p><em>01 May 2020</em></p>
			<p>I find that it helps to have defined boundaries for your APIs. If you have the resources and interest I recommend studying subjects like domain driven design. Investment in properly defining the boundaries of your organization and lines of business is a very worthy endeavor&mdash;if you have the time. However, if you already have a lot on your plate, and are just looking for incremental changes that can help make your life easier when it comes to the API sprawl we&rsquo;ve introduced into our worlds, I recommend just spending a few moments thinking about how you can better use Postman workspaces to dive and conquer your API landscape. I have begun using Postman workspaces in similar ways that I use GitHub repositories. The GitHub repository has long represented a unit of API value in my world, but with the introduction of GitHub two-way sync into Postman I now have a one for one matchup between workspace and repository when it comes to moving each API forward. For my API-first e-commerce reference implementation Union Fashion I am currently developing five separate APIs, which each have their own Postman workspace and GitHub repository pairing. Products&nbsp;- (Workspace) (Repo) (Docs) - Defining all of the products that Union Fashion offers. Orders&nbsp;- (Workspace) (Repo) (Docs) - Allows for the ordering of Union Fashion products online.

Postman workspaces and GitHub repositories accomplish many overlapping concerns along the API life cycle, however I am finding that Postman workspaces are better suited for establishing a tighter team level definition of who should have access and voice in moving an API forward, but GitHub is better for a more organizational-wide, or a public level of engagement.

			<p><em>01 May 2020</em></p>
			<p>This is the narrative from one of the last webinars I did for Postman oin my API-first e-commerce reference implementation Union Fashion. I always try to write what I am going to be saying furing a webinar so that it is loaded up in my brain in a natural way---think Neo learning Kung Fu before sparring with Morpheus. Anyways, here is the narrative, with accompanying video embedded below, helping share the narrative behind how I am building Union Fashion, trying to learn, grow, and expand how I use APIs out in the open, so that others can learn along the way. Jeff Jones the VP of Engineering at Union Fashion has been working to get more organized about how they deliver applications using APIs at the company. In our last webinar episode we looked at how Union Fashion was building and testing APIs, moving their operations towards an API first way of delivering application infrastructure. The build and test planning session was all about ensuring Jeff could lay the foundation for organizational change at Union Fashion by making sure his teams had the proper planning, and everyone was in agreement on an API-first way of delivering APIs behind the web and mobile applications they were needing to run their business&mdash;investing in the following areas to help define how they build and test APIs before actually building them: Organizational - Making sure the team was well defined, including having dedicated workspaces for each API. APIs - We are making sure that common API definitions at the center of the conversation for each API being developed. Collections - Being very structured in how collections are define and used to power different stops along the API life cycle. Environments - We made sure secrets and some key value pairs were abstracted away from each of the API collections. Mocks - Mock servers are published from all APIs, using a specific collection, making each API being developed more tangible....[<a href="/2020/05/01/an-api-deployment-narrative/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Apr 2020</em></p>
			<p>After over a decade of API evolution, API deployment is still much more of a dark art than it is something that ever sees the light of day. Sure you can setup a pipeline for an API, making a known pattern a repeatable process, but there isn&rsquo;t much consistency out there when it comes to repeatable patterns for use across many different APIs. Certain vendors are working on optimizing the API deployment cycle within the context of their platforms, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see more open blueprints for how APIs can be deployed, designed for applying across a mix of APIs which are defined using OpenAPI. To push this conversation forward I began exploring what the common patterns for API deployment on the leading cloud providers would look like, and if it was something I could accomplish using API infrastructure, which mean that I can do using Postman. One API deployment blueprint I had on my list to develops was using AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS. Providing me with a quick way to consistent and repeatable way of deploying APIs that I could define as a Postman collection that can be shared and used by others. The results is a first draft of a Postman API deployment collection, which can be used to deploy an API to AWS using Postman, taking an existing OpenAPI and bringing it to life using common AWS solutions. Rather than outlining what I did as I normally would, I am going to play around with producing content in other mediums, and publish a video walk through of how my new AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS API deployment Postman collection works&mdash;let me know what you think.

			<p><em>20 Apr 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am auto-generating and manually producing a number of Postman collection lately. I am creating a Postman collection that autogenerates AWS Lambdas from an OpenAPI stored in the Postman API builder, as well as a handful of infrastructure AWS Lambdas that accomplish bigger picture items like creating a database in RDS, or zipping up AWS Lambda packages to deploy APIs. So, I have a lot more AWS Lambdas laying around that I am needing to organize and put to use. I find the first rule of AWS Lambda club is remembering you created the thing in the first place and remember to actually put the thing to use—when you have so many of them laying around, you need a way to make them more discoverable, browsable, and usable in your everyday lives, something Postman excels at. When it comes to deploying APIs with AWS infrastructure using a Postman collection, there were two things I couldn’t do purely with AWS APIs, which pushed me to create AWS Lambda functions that would get the job done. Demonstrating that I was going to be creating a growing number of Lambda functions that I was going to need to organize, retrieve, and execute regularly as part of my manual work, but also automated process, beginning with these two functions: Create AWS RDS Aurora SQL Table - There is no way to create a table using the AWS RDS API, so I created an AWS Lambda function that would let me pass in the table name and fields using environment variables, mounting the database and creating the table I needed. Generate AWS Lambda Deployment Package - I was dynamically generating a lot of the code powering Lambdas, as well as the layers of Node.js dependencies they were using, so I created a Lambda script that would take files from an AWS S3 bucket and folder and generate a zipped up AWS Lambda deployment package. I then created myself a Postman...[<a href="/2020/04/20/running-and-organizing-aws-lambdas-with-postman-collections/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Apr 2020</em></p>
			<p>I struggle with using the right words in my API storytelling. Striking a blend between what people are saying across the sector, and what people should be saying. There are many words and phrases in the space that help describe what it is they do, while there are others that confuse more than they describe anything in particular. Mostly I struggle because all of this API stuff can be complicated and very abstract, but also because I can be a little dyslexic at times, seeing some words as interchangeable, depending on what day it is. To help me (once again) think through the world of API definitions, I wanted to riff off of my talk from AsyncAPI virtual conference this week and peel back the layers of the API specifications, definitions and schema onion. The words API specifications, definition, or schema are often used interchangeably as part of API discussions, but there are some realities on the ground when working with these artifacts that can increase the friction across operations if we allow them to be used interchangeably. It is pedantic as hell to want to write a story about the nuance of these terms, but if it helps me be more precise in my work, I&rsquo;ll do it. To help illustrate the dimensions here, I wanted to highlight the artifacts around the Slack API that I am using for my talk next week. Slack Web API&nbsp; OpenAPI - The OpenAPI for the Slack Web API defines the surface area of this single HTTP API instance. Slack Events API AsyncAPI - The AsyncAPI for the Slack Events API defines the surface of this real time HTTP API instance. These two artifacts describe the surface area of specific APIs, leveraging two open source API specification formats, but also adopting a third API specification format that these two specifications use to describe the underlying schema being used as part of the structure for request and response, message,...[<a href="/2020/04/18/the-layers-of-the-api-specifications-definitions-and-schema-onion/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Apr 2020</em></p>
			<p>It has been a while since I wrote a simple breakdown of why APIs matter, but also why API-First matters. I went down the API-First rabbit hole with API-First [Design || Code] and API-First [Business], but I haven’t just made the basic case of why we should have built an API in the first place. It really isn’t a concept you full grasp until you’ve made the very costly mistake of being API-Last several times over, so it makes sense to break things down into a single blog post to help folks [hopefully] learn from without going down the same paths I’ve been in my application development career. To help on-board folks with what I mean when I say API-First, let’s recap how we got here with a simple finctional product API story. One Product Catalog With Multiple Destinations Products are a ubiquitous resource in an online world. By 2000, if we were selling products in the real world, we also began needing to publish products to a website, which by 2005 would morph more into a mix of database-driven web applications. However by 2010, we also needed to have the same products available in our mobile applications., resulting in a handful of channels we need our products available on. Websites - Public websites that a product catalog need to be published to for consumption. Web Applications - Specific web applications that need access to our product clog. Mobile Applications - Making sure the product catalog is available via iPhone and Android phones. In 2020, these channels are morphing iton a suite of single page and static applications that work across web and mobile properties, but the need for a single set of content or data for making available across these channels hasn’t changed. By 2010, most companies were realizing that HTTP APIs were the most effective way to deliver content and data across applications, and by 2020 this has emerged as the reality for...[<a href="/2020/04/15/we-should-have-built-an-api-first/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Apr 2020</em></p>
			<p>There are surprisingly few meaningful API numbers to showcase across the API sector. There are few API or API service providers who have a view of the landscape that can produce meaningful numbers, and most prefer to keep their numbers close to their chests for a variety of reasons. Over the last decade we've all grown accustom to the Programmable Web hockey stock chart showing the number of public APIs added to the PW directory, due to the ubiquitous graphic being used in conference talks and blog posts since before 2010. I've always been a big advocate of API service providers developing and sharing their data, something that hasn't diminished at Postman. Postman has a pretty unique view of the API landscape, possessing many interesting data points. The company is working on a strategy for compiling, organizing, publishing, and sharing the data it has in a thoughtful way, something that you can see trickling out through a variety of slides from recent events like the Postman Galaxy Tour, and Postcon last year. Like this one showing the growth in API collections, topping at 34.9M collections published in 2020. The important thing with this visual is it reflects both private and public APIs. This graphis is just one of many data points Postman possesses that I am working to encourage packing up, so that others can reference and use, much like the ProgrammableWeb public API chart over the last decade. Visuals like this are important all of us making sense of what is going on, and be able to truly see the scope of what is happening. I'd love to see other API service providers share their numbers, but like Postman, I understand it is difficult to do in a meaningful way that respects the privacy of your users, and the interests of your investors. I will keep pushing for more observability into the API community through the Postman lens, and hopefully produce some interesting visuals...[<a href="/2020/04/15/growth-in-the-number-of-api-collections-over-the-last-five-years/">Read More</a>]</p>
