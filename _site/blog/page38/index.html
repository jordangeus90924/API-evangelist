			<h3><a href="/2010/10/23/bit-ly-api-contest-building-block-showcase/">bit.ly API contest - Building Block Showcase</a></h3>
			<p><em>23 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>Holding an API contest is a great way to spur innovation around your API and its community.
bit.ly is a popular URL shortening service that offers an API as part of its core software-as-a-service.
In January 2009 it held a successful API contest and is looking to do it again with a new bit.ly API contest.
The prizes offered::

	1st prize - Makerbot Thing-O-Matic 3D Printer
	2nd prize - 1TB USB hard drive enclosed in a vintage nintendo game (Zelda, Metroid, etc)
	3rd prize - Set of BuckyBalls magnetic building spheres

bit.ly encourages developer to be creative and come up with unexpected uses, but it also plants a few ideas that the company woul'd like to see developers work on.
There are a lot of developers that may know about your API, but not actively involved.  Your developers may need a little bit of motivation to get them working.
An API contest is a great way to light the fire under your development community, stimulate innovative uses of your API, and generate some buzz around your API community.

			<h3><a href="/2010/10/15/linkedin-labs-building-block-showcase/">LinkedIn Labs - Building Block Showcase</a></h3>
			<p><em>15 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>LinkedIn has released an API labs to showcase various internal projects using the LinkedIn API.
LinkedIn Labs hosts a small set of projects and experimental features built by the employees of LinkedIn. They are published demonstrations and intended to be low-maintenance experiments and may be added and removed over time based on popularity and support.
Four projects the Labs showcases are:

	NewIn - This application shows new members joining LinkedIn from around the world.
	ChromeIn - Integrate LinkedIn directly into Google Chrome. Easy access to your LinkedIn updates, anytime.
	Instant Search - A sample application to search LinkedIn, built over the new Linkedin Javascript APIs.
	Signal - Signal is aimed at making it easy for all professionals to glean the most relevant insights from the never-ending stream of status updates and news.
An API Labs is a great way to showcase experimental and innovative projects that utilize your API.
Encouraging your internal staff to spend time on Labs projects and showcasing on site can improve internal understanding of challenges faced by developers when integrating with your API.
An API Labs environment can be extended to your API developers and partners as well.  This is a great way to encourage innovation and building community around your API.

			<p><em>13 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>If you provide an API, one of the things you will want to avoid is having someone's blog post condemning your company for not caring about developers hit the front page of Hacker News.  Because even if you are a giant like Facebook, you really cannot afford to have your API be an excruciating experience (although, yes, Facebook can probably afford it more than others).
Seth Call recently wrote a blog post called The Facebook API:  A Case Study in Not Caring About Developers.  And while the post is directed at Facebook, Call's observations about how to (mis)treat your developer community offer important insights that any company should pay attention to.
The post lays out several reasons why working with the Facebook API is, in his words, "one of the worst experiences as a developer I have ever had."

	Poor Documentation
	Poor Testability
	No Response to Serious Issues
	Constantly Changing API

Call's post is interesting as it chronicles (in great detail) how he has had to struggle (unnecessarily) at almost every stage of working with the Facebook API -- a struggle that could easily be addressed with better documentation and better customer service.
And the latter is an important reminder that while you might not view third-party developers as such, they are your customers.

			<h3><a href="/2010/10/12/google-apps-supports-oauth/">Google Apps Supports OAuth</a></h3>
			<p><em>12 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>Google Apps recently began supporting OAuth authorization when connecting to the Google Apps API.
OAuth will make integration with the Google Apps platform much more secure by not requiring administrators to share their username and password with third party applications.
The advantages to using OAuth are:

	OAuth is more secure: OAuth tokens can be scoped and set to expire by a certain date, making them more secure than using the ClientLogin mechanism.
	OAuth is customizable: Using OAuth, you can create tokens that scripts may only use to access data of a particular scope when calling Google Apps APIs. For instance, a token set to call the Email Migration API would not be able to use your login credentials to access the Google Apps Provisioning API.
	OAuth is an open standard: OAuth is an open source standard, making it a familiar choice for developers to work with.

The Google Apps API services that support OAuth are:

	Provisioning API
	Email Migration API
	Admin Settings API
	Calendar Resource API
	Email Settings API
	Audit API

OAuth for authentication is more accepted by developers, and it makes many IT administrators much more comfortable with allowing third party integration with their Google Apps Premier, Education and Government editions.
To learn more about the OAuth standard, visit http://oauth.net.

			<p><em>09 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>There are a lot of things I weigh when deciding to write about a company: is the product interesting, is the technology innovative, is the company's story compelling. Some days, it's "news" when a very small feature change occurs at a very big company. And some days, it's "news" when very big things are afoot at very small companies. Most days, it's not quite so clear cut as that, and I have to wade through hundreds of email pitches in order to decide which stories to tell. And as I do my research and conduct my product reviews and my phone briefings, one of the things I look for is an API. Although yes, I want to hear that your product has traction. I want to see that customers and investors like you. I want to hear about the problem your company addresses, the technology you've developed, your business model, your background, your domain expertise. But I also want to hear about your API. Why? An API demonstrates you recognize your product does not exist in a vacuum. You are not simply concerned with how you interact with your customer, but how your product interacts with others your customer utilizes Having an API points to a business development strategy that relies not just on marketing to these customers but on cultivating business partnerships. Having an API is, as Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake argues, "Biz Dev 2.0." A quick look via the link on your website to your API (you do have a link to your API, right?) can give a sense of the strength of your developer community. Do you make it easy and desirable for other developers and companies to use your API? I don't expect every company, particularly startups, to have a robust API upon launch. But I will often ask what the company's plans for an API entail. It's a question that gives me a glimpse into potential partnerships, data portability, mobile...[<a href="/2010/10/09/why-a-tech-journalist-cares-about-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

While it's important to be able to explain to potential business partners and customers about the problems your API solves, at the end of the day it is crucial that you be able to provide them with the tools -- and the documentation -- to actually do it.
The importance of documentation -- samples, training materials, guides, docs -- can't be understated.  Quality documentation and reference material for your Application Programming Interface (API) can be the difference between a developer adopting your API or moving on to another vendor.  And yet these can be difficult documents to collect and/or to write.

	API Documentation
	Sample code and tutorials
	Highly technical copywriting

	Technology classes for youth

These services can be a critical piece of delivering your API.  SDK Bridge says that it is a bridge between people and technology.  So very true.
SDK Bridge provides a set of services that any business looking to deliver an API should evaluate.  Even though you many be able to generate your own marketing materials, SDK and other supporting API documents, you may find more value bring in an outside perspective to make sure you explain how your API solves problems, adds value, and can be successfully integrated to customers systems.

			<p><em>07 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>Salesforce is gearing up for the upcoming release of their REST API on October 26, with a REST API Developer Preview Webinar.

The release of the a RESTful API for the developerforce platform is a major sign of upcoming growth for the cloud computing platform.
REST APIs enjoy lmuch larger acceptance in the developer community compared to SOAP APIs.  SOAP is a favorite amongst the enterprise and hard-core development communities, but REST is easier to understand and have lower barriers of entry for more web 2.0 oriented programmers.
As cloud computing is gaining acceptance with the masses, and the smoke is clearing around how to actually make the cloud work,  SalesForce is making a major move to woo more businesses and developers to their platform.
I think this is just a first of many moves by the proven cloud platform to not only defend their position as the leader in Platform as a Service, but grow significantly in the next couple of years.

			<p><em>07 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>
Online storage and collaboration tool OpenBox Developer area for those working with the API.
The developer area offers the following pieces:

	Introduction to OpenBox Actions
	Getting Started Guide for API
	Easy Signup
	Project Setup Page

And Box.net provides several flavors to its API:

	 REST
	 SOAP
	 XML-RPC

It also provide ssome some great code samples and libraries in all the top programming languages.
There is a list of of all the API functions on the left hand menu, broken down into categories:

	Authentication
	File and Folder Operations
	Sharing
	Tagging
	Commenting
	Download and Upload

Box.net supports its API with a developer blog and also provides an email address to contact Box.net directly.
There is also a mobile API offering.
While I think Box.net offers a solid API, the API developer community or ecosystem is lacking.  Its pretty evident the API came solely out of the Box.net development team.
The API community lacks consistency and seems to be spread between developers.box.net and box.net/developers.  The overall approach lacks community and even has some broken links.
Box.net talks about some partners and API implementations on its blog, but doesn't showcase its developers or partners.   In some ways this makes the API look like an after thought, and could give people pause before integrating it as they might fear they won't get much attention as part of the community..
Without actual experience in integration of course, this is all speculation.  Although I think this reflects a common approach to delivering an API.  Companies come out with a strong product, but without a solid business, marketing and management approach it can prompt people to explore other API solutions.

			<h3><a href="/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a></h3>
			<p><em>07 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>Several years ago, Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase "Biz Dev 2.0" in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached FLickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature.

She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to "feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API."
"Biz Dev 2.0," she called it.
Fake describes the traditional sorts of business development processes -- "spending a lot of money on dry cleaning, animating your powerpoint, drinking stale coffee in windowless conference rooms and scouring the thesaurus looking for synonyms for "synergy". Not to mention trying to get hopelessly overbooked people to return your email. And then after the deal was done, squabbling over who dealt with the customer service."
While a Web 1.0 world made partnerships and integration challenging, a Web 2.0 world has the advantage of the API, something that removes many of the bureaucratic, legal, and technical obstacles.
So by developing and marketing your API, your company can take advantage of new technologies and new business development practices.

			<p><em>06 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>One of the keys to YouTube's success as a video sharing platform is its successful API that allows developers and site owners to embed, share and distribute YouTube content across the Intertubes.

As with many of its other products, Google starts with the essential API ecosystem building blocks:

	Dashboard
	Quickstart
	Docs
	Sample Code
	Forum
	Articles
	Blog

In addition, YouTube really support its partner and developers with:

	Partners Showcase
	App Gallery
	Widgets
	White Label Player

Google also enforces brand integrity with a few tools:

	Branding Guidelines
	Compatibility
	Terms

Google definitely has a solid formula for replicating its API ecosystems in its different products, and the YouTube developer area is an excellent example of this formula being applied to a media API.
Like Google's other projects, YouTube utilizes Google Code as the repository for its API community and code.

			<p><em>06 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>Change happens. With technology, change seems to be accelerating, or at least the waves of change seem to come more frequently. I feel I've developed a certain rhythm for riding these waves. Part of this rhythm is a regular evaluation of where I stand, a sort of agile career methodology. I'm in one of those evaluation periods right now. What wave is next? In January 2007 I found myself jumping on the social media wave, in which I still ride to some degree. In Spring of 2008 I found myself jumping on the cloud computing wave, in which I'm still totally drowning in. What wave is next? Mobile? Big Data? Semantics? There are many things I consider when evaluating what I will focus my attention on. I want to make sure I will be investing in learning that will benefit my professional development. One thing I look for are constants within all the waves I ride. One constant I've seen between Social media and Cloud Computing are APIs. If you take a deeper look: Social Media - YouTube API and Flickr API are at the heart of the social media movement. Social Networking - Facebook API Platform and the Twitter API play a big part in the growth and adoption of social networking. Cloud Computing - The two undisputed kings of cloud computing, Amazon Web Services and Google both depend on API to deliver their services APIs are playing a monumental role in delivering the Internet today. What is next? Mobile - APIs make mobile applications possible and help drive innovation in the mobile space. Big Data - APIs allow data to be gathered, shared, and available for visualizations and mashups. Semantics - APIs will drive discovery and meaning around links, documents, and other objects. Pick most any area of business today and you can see APIs either driving or emerging as a major player within that industry.

			<p><em>06 Oct 2010</em></p>
			<p>As a journalist, I get a lot of pitches from startups trying to convince me to write about their product or service.  And I also attend a lot of pitch events, where entrepreneurs try to convince a panel of judges (typically investors) to write them a check.  Often there are a lot of missing pieces in these pitches -- no compelling technology, no compelling market, no compelling story, and most damning, no actual product.
Sure. You can have slides.  You can boast about how awesome your product will be.  You can talk, talk, talk.
Or, you can actually show it off, show how it works.  And I do mean, literally, how it works, by coding your way through a demo.
And this is what John Britton, Twilio's developer evangelist, does in this video, taken at a NY Tech Meetup.  In it, he not only makes the case for the Twilio product -- the Twilio API integrates phone and message actions into your app.  But by coding the demo live onstage, Britton also makes the case for and to the developer community, which is particularly important for having a vibrant and robust API.

Flickr offers a solid API with very traditional building blocks:

	API Overview
	Account Manager
	App Manager
	API / SDK Kits
	Email Listserve

Recently Flickr evolved its API area (App Garden) and took a more ecosystem approach by creating code.flickr.com by bringing together several old and new building blocks:

	Dashboard
	Forums (3 separate forums: API Forum, Hacking Uploadr, and Yahoo Forum)
	Developer Feature
	Developer Blog
Jobs Listing (For Flickr, not for ecoystem)
Flickr's API is a solid example of a simple, yet successful RESTful approach to an API.  A very early mover in building an API, Flickr's offerings may be missing many of the more sophisticated API building blocks we are seeing with the new generation of APIs.    Nevertheless, you can't argue with success.   I believe Flickr's dead simple approach to solving one problem -- photo sharing -- has helped the company deliver a successful API even without a robust API ecosystem.

			<h3><a href="/2010/09/25/the-api-economy/">The API Economy</a></h3>
			<p><em>25 Sep 2010</em></p>
			<p>
Application Programming Interfaces (API) are a driving the Internet and our economy. They drive our online experience:

Developers rely on API for key data and functionality in their applications
Businesses exchange data and services using API
Media and press are using them for real-time analysis

API's come in many flavors: XML-RPC, SOAP, and REST, although REST is king when it comes to next generation of web applications.
In  2000 businesses were still working to understand the importance of  having a web site.
In 2010 businesses are now faced with the growing  importance of their API.
If you don't already have an API developed in-house you need to talk with Mashery or 3Scale.
If you have an API, but need to take it to the next level. You need an API Evangelist.
