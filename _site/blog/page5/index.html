			<p><em>04 Sep 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m working to break down the moving parts of API efforts over at the VA, and work to provide as much relevant feedback as I possibly can. One of the components I’m wanting to think about more is the feedback loop for the VA API efforts. The feedback loop is one of the most essential aspects of doing an API, and is quickly can become one of the most debilitating, paralyzing, and nutrient starving aspects of operating an API platform if done wrong, or non-existent. However, the feedback loop is also one of the most valuable reasons for wanting to do APIs in the first place, providing the essential feedback you will need from consumers, and the entire API ecosystem to move the API forward in a meaningful way. Current Seeds Of The VA API Feedback Loop Current the VA is supporting the VA API developer portal using GitHub Issues and email. I mentioned in my previous review of the VA API developer portal that the personal email addresses provided for email support should be generalized, sharing the load when it comes to email support for the platform. Next, I’d like to address the usage of GitHub issues for support, along with email, and step back to look at how this contributes to, or could possibly take away from the overall feedback loop for the VAPI API effort. Defining what the basics of an API feedback loop for the VA might be. Expanding Upon The VA Usage Of GitHub Issues I support the usage of GitHub issues for public support of any API related project. It provides a simple, observable way for anyone to get support around the VA APIs. While I’m guessing it was accidental, I like the specialization of the current repo, and usage of GitHub issues, and that it being dedicated to VA API clients and their needs. I’d encourage this type of continued focus when it comes to establishing additional feedback...[<a href="/2018/09/04/the-basics-of-the-va-api-feedback-loop/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Sep 2018</em></p>
			<p>This is our regular reminder that APIs are not good, nor bad, nor neutral. They are simply a tool in our technological toolbox, and something that is often used for very dark reasons, and occasionally for good. One of the most dangerous things I’ve found about APIs is just the general thought process that goes along with them, regarding how all roads lead to reducing, and distilling things down to a single transaction. APIs, REST, microservices, and other design patterns are all about taking something from our physical world, and redefining it as something that can be transmitted back and forth using the low cost request and response infrastructure of the web. No matter what you are designing your API for, your mission is to reduce everything to a simple transaction that can be exchanged between your server, and any other system, web, mobile, device, or network application. This digital resource could be a photo of your kids, a message to your mother, the balance of your bank account, your personal thoughts going into your notebook, the latest song you listened to, your DNA, your test results for cancer, or any other piece of relevant data, content, media, object, or other resource that is being sent or received online. APIs are all about reducing all of our meaningful digital bits to the smallest possible transaction, and then daisy chaining them together to produce some desired set of results. This API-ification of everything can be a good thing. It can make our lives better, but one of the negative side effects of this reducing of everything to a transaction, is that now that transaction can be bought and sold. The digitization of everything in our lives is rarely ever about making our lives better and whatever the reasons we are told up front, and almost always are about reducing that little piece of our lives to a transaction that can be quantified, have a value place...[<a href="/2018/09/04/remembering-that-apis-are-used-to-reduce-everything-down-to-a-transaction/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I have been working on API and open data efforts at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for five years now. I’m passionate about pushing forward the API conversation at the federal agency because I want to see the agency deliver on its mission to take care of veterans. My father, and my step-father were both vets, and I lived through the fallout from my step-fathers two tours in Vietnam, exposure to the VA healthcare and benefits bureaucracy, and ultimately his passing away from cancer which he acquired from to his exposure to Agent Orange. I truly want to see the VA streamline as many of its veteran facing programs as they possibly can. I’ve been evangelizing for API change and leadership at the VA since I worked there in 2013. I’m regularly investing unpaid time to craft stories that help influence people I know who are working at the VA, and who are potentially reading my work. Resulting in posts like my response to the VA’s RFI for the Lighthouse API management platform, which included a round two response a few months later. Influence through storytelling is the most powerful tool I got in my API evangelist toolbox. This Is An Amazon Web Services Opportunity The most popular story on my blog is, “The Secret to Amazon’s Success–Internal APIs”. Which tells a story of the mythical transition of Amazon from an online commerce website to the cloud giant, who is now powering a significant portion of the web. The story is mostly fiction, but continues to be the top performing story on my blog six years later. I’ve heard endless conference talks about this subject, I’ve seen my own story framed on the wall in enterprise organizations in Europe and Australia, and as a feature link on internal IT portals. This is one of the most important stories we have in the API sector, and what is happening at the VA right now will...[<a href="/2018/08/30/why-i-feel-the-department-of-veterans-affairs-api-effort-is-so-significant/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am always fascinated when I get push back from people about API management, the authentication, service composition, logging, analysis, and billing layer on the world of APIs. I seem to be find more people who are skeptical that it is even necessary anymore, and that it is a relic of the past. When I first started coming across the people making these claims earlier this year I was confused, but as I’ve pondered on the subject more, I’m convinced their position is more about the world of venture capital, and investment in APIs, that it is about APIs. People who feel like you do not need to measure the value being exchanged at the API layer aren’t considering the technology or business of delivering APIs. They are simply focused on the investment cycles that are occurring, and see API management as something that has been done, it is baked into the cloud, and really isn’t central to API-driven businesses. They perceive that the age of API management as being over, it is something the cloud giants are doing now, thus it isn’t needed. I feel like this is a symptom of tech startup culture being so closely aligned with investment cycles, and the road map being about investment size and opportunity, and rarely the actual delivery of the thing that brings value to companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. I feel this perception is primarily rooted in the influence of investors, but it is also based upon a limited understanding of API management, and seeing APIs being a about delivering public APIs, maybe with a complimenting a SaaS offering, and a free, pro, and enterprise tiers of access. When in reality API management is about measuring, quantifying, reporting upon, and in some cases billing for the value that is exchanged at the system integration, web, mobile, device, and network application levels. However, to think API operators shouldn’t be measuring, quantifying, reporting, and generating revenue...[<a href="/2018/08/29/understanding-where-folks-are-coming-from-when-they-say-api-management-is/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been working a couple organizations who are struggling with providing information within their API developer portal intended for API publishers, pushing their API portal beyond just being for their API consumers. Some of the folks I’ve been working with haven’t thought about their API developer portals being for both API publishers and consumers, and asked me to weigh in on the pros and cons of doing this. Helping them understand how they can continue their journey towards not just being an API platform, but also an API marketplace. Some of the conversations we were having about providing API lifecycle materials to API developers, helping them deliver APIs consistently across all stops along lifecycle, focused on creating a separate portal for API publishers, decoupling them from where the APIs would be discovered and consumed. After some discussion, and consideration, it feels like it would be an unnecessary disconnect, to have API publishers going to a different location than where their APIs would end up being discovered, and integrated with. That having them actively involved in the publishing, presentation, and even support of, and engagement with consumers would benefit everyone involved. Think of it being like Rapid API, but a large company, organization, institution, or government agency. You can find APIs, and integrate with existing APIs, or you can also become an API publisher, and be someone who helps publish and manage APIs as well. You will have one account, but you can find documentation, usage information and other resources for the APIs you consume, but then you will also access information, and usage data on the APIs you’ve published. Pushing API developers within an organization to actively think about both sides of the API coin, and learn how to be both provider and consumer. Helping add to the catalog of APIs, but also helping evolve and grow the army of API people across an organization. We still have a lot of work ahead of us...[<a href="/2018/08/29/api-portals-designed-for-api-provider-and-api-consumers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am trying to develop a base base API pricing formula for determining what my hard costs are for each API I’m publishing using Amazon RDS, EC2, and AWS API Gateway. I also have some APIs I am deploying using Amazon RDS, Lambda, and AWS API Gateway, but for now I want to get a default base for determining what operating my APIs will cost me, so I can mark up and reliably generate profit on top of the APIs I’m making available to my partners. AWS has all the data for me to figure out my hard costs, I just need a formula that helps me accurately determine what my AWS bill will be per API. Math isn’t one of my strengths, so I’m going to have to break this down, and simmer on things for a while, before I will be able to come up with some sort of working formula. Here are my hard costs for what my AWS resources will cost me, for three APIs I have running currently in this stack: AWS RDS - I am running a db.r3.large instance which costs me $0.29 per hour or 211.70 per month, with the bandwidth free to my Amazon EC2 instances in the same availability zone. I do not have any public access, so I don’t have any incoming or outgoing traffic, except from the EC2 instance. AWS EC2 - I am running a t2.large instance which costs me $0.0928 per hour or $67.74 per month with bandwidth out costing me $0.155 per GB. I’m curious if they have an Amazon EC2 to AWS API Gateway data consideration? I couldn’t find anything currently. AWS API Gateway - Overall using AWS API Gateway costs me $3.50 per million API calls received, with the first 1GB costing me $0.00/GB, and costing me $0.09/GB for the next 9.999 TB. Across these three APIs, I am seeing an average of 5KB per responses, which is an...[<a href="/2018/08/28/trying-to-define-an-algorithm-for-my-aws-api-cost-calculations-across-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I wanted to take a moment and review the Department Of Veterans Affairs (VA) new developer portal. Spending some time considering at how far they’ve come, what they published so far, and brainstorm on what the future might hold. Let me open by saying that I am working directly and indirectly with the VA on a variety of paid projects, but I’m not being paid to write about their API effort–that is something I’ve done since I worked there in 2013. I will craft a disclosure to this effect that I put at the bottom of each story I write about the VA, but I wanted to put out there in general, as I work through my thoughts on what is happening over at the VA. The VA Has Come A Long Way I wanted to open up this review with a nod towards how far the VA has come. There have been other publicly available APIs at the VA, as well as a variety of open data efforts, but the VA is clearly going all in on APIs with this wave. The temperature at VA in 2013 when it came to APIs was lukewarm at best. With the activity I’m seeing at the moment, I can tell that the temperature of the water has gone way up. Sure, the agency still has a long way to go, but from what I can tell, the leadership is committed to the agencies API journey–something I have not seen before. Developer.VA.Gov Sends The Right Signal It may not seem like much, but providing a public API portal at developer.va.gov sends a strong signal that the VA is seriously investing in their API effort. I see a lot of API programs, and companies who have a dedicated domain, or subdomain for their API operations are always more committed than people who make it just a subsection of their existing website, or existing as a help entry in a...[<a href="/2018/08/28/reviewing-the-department-of-veterans-affairs-new-developer-portal/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve learned a lot in eight years of operating API Evangelist. One of the most important things I’ve learned to do is separate my personal belief and interest in technology from the realities of the business world. I’ve learned that not all businesses are ready for the change that doing APIs bring, and that many businesses really aren’t interested in the interoperability, portability, and observability that APIs bring to the table. Despite what I may believe, APIs in the real world often have a very different outcome. I see the potential of having a public API developer portal where you publish all the digital resources your company offers. Providing self-service registration to access these digital resources at a fair, transparent, and pay for what you use pricing model. I get what this can do for companies when it comes to attracting developer talent to help deliver the applications that are needed for any platform to thrive. I’ve seen the benefits to the end-users of these applications when it comes to giving them control over their data, the ability to leverage 3rd party applications, while also better understanding, managing, and ultimately owning the digital resources they generate each day. I also regularly see how this all can be a serious threat to how some businesses operate, and work to reveal the illnesses that exist within many businesses, and the shady things the occur behind the firewall each day. I regularly see businesses pay lip service to the concept of APIs, but in reality, are more about locking things up, and slowing things down to their benefit, instead of opening up access, and streamlining anything. I’m not saying that businesses do this by default, and are always being led from the top down to behave this way, I am saying it gets baked into the fabric of how teams, groups, and individuals cells in the overall organizational organism. These cells learn to resist, fight back, appear like...[<a href="/2018/08/28/not-all-companies-are-interested-in-the-interoperability-that-apis-bring/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>Nobody likes to be told that their APIs are unreliable, and unavailable on a regular basis. However, it is one of those pills that ALL APIs have to swallow, and EVERY API provider should be paying for an external monitoring service to tell us when are APIs are up or down. Having a monitoring service to tell us when our APIs are having problems, complete with a status dashboard, and history of our API's availability are essential building blocks of any API provider. If you expect consumers to use your API, and bake it into their systems and applications, you should committed to a certain level of availability, and offering a service level agreement if possible. My friends over at APImetrics monitor APIs across multiple industries, but we've been partnering to keep an eye on federal government APIs, in support of my work in DC. They've recently [shared an informative dashboard tracking on the performance of federal government APIs](https://apimetrics.io/us-government-api-performance-dashboard/), providing an interesting view of the government API landscape, and the overall reliability of APIs they provide. They continue by breaking down the performance of federal government APIs, including how the APIs perform across multiple North American regions across four of the leading cloud providers: Helping us visualize the availability of federal government APIs for the last seven days, by applying their APImetrics CASC score to each of the federal government APIs, and ranking their overall uptime and availability: I know it sucks being labeled as one of the worst performing APIs, but you also have the opportunity to be named one the best performing APIs. ;-) This is a subject that many private sector companies struggle with, and the federal government has an extremely poor track record for monitoring their APIs, let alone sharing the information publicly. Facing up to this stuff sucks, and you are forced to answer some difficult questions about your operations, but it is also something can't be ignored away when...[<a href="/2018/08/28/helping-the-federal-government-get-in-tune-with-their-api-uptime-and/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I responded about how teams should be documenting their APIs when they have both legacy and new APIs the other day. I wanted to keep the conversation thread going with an example of one possible API documentation implementation. The best way to deliver API documentation guidance in any organization is to provide a forkable, downloadable example of whatever you are talking about. To help illustrate what I am talking about, I wanted to take one documentation solution, and publish it as a GitHub repository. I chose to go with a simple OpenAPI 3.0 defined API contract, driving a Swagger UI driven API documentation, hosted using GitHub Pages, and managed as a GitHub repository. In my story about how teams should be documenting their APIs, I provided several API definition formations, and API documentation options–for this walk-through I wanted to narrow it down to a single combination, providing the minimum(alist) viable options possible using OpenAPI 3.0 and SwaggerUI. Of course, any federal agency implementing such a solution should wrap the documentation with their own branding, similar to the City Pairs API prototype out of GSA, which originated over at CFPB. I used the VA Facilities API definition from the developer.va.gov portal for this sample. Mostly because it was ready to go, and relevant to the VA efforts, but also because it was using OpenAPI 3.0–I think it is worth making sure all API documentation moving forward supports is supporting the latest version of OpenAPI. The API documentation is here, the OpenAPI definition is here, and the Github repository is here, showing what is possible. There are plenty of other things I’d like to see in a baseline API documentation template, but this provides a good first draft for a true minimum viable definition. The goal with this project is to provide a basic seed that any team could use. Next, I will add in some other building blocks, and implementation a ReDoc, DapperDox, or WSDLDoc version....[<a href="/2018/08/27/provide-your-api-developers-with-a-forkable-example-of-api-documentation-in/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>After providing some guidance the other day on how teams should be documenting their APIs, one of the follow up comments was: “Now we just have to figure out how to get the developers to follow the guidance!” Something that any API leadership and governance team is going to face as they work to implement new policies across their organization. You can craft the best possible guidance for API design, deployment, management, and documentation, but it doesn’t mean anyone is actually going to follow your guidance. Moving forward API governance within any organization represents the cultural frontline of API operations. Getting teams to learn about, understand, and implement sensible API practices is always easier said than done. You may think your vision of the organizations API future is the right one, but getting other internal groups to buy into that vision will take a significant amount of work. It is something that will take time, resources, and be something that will always be shifting and evolving over time. Lead By Example The best way to get developers to follow the minimum viable API documentation guidance being set forth is to do the work for them. Provide templates and blueprints of what you want them to do. Develop, provide, and evolve forkable and downloadable API documentation examples, with simple README checklists of what is expected of them. I’ve published a simple example using the VA Facilities API definition published as OpenAPI 3.0 and Swagger UI to Github Pages, with the entire thing forkable via the Github repository. It is very bare bones example of providing API documentation guidance is a package that can be reused, providing API developers with a working example of what is expected of them. Make It A Group Effort To help get API developers on board with the minimum viable API documentation guidance being set forth, I recommend making it a group effort.

We are getting closer to the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th. The schedule for the conference is up, along with the first lineup of keynote speakers, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is “Do Not Miss Internal Developer Portals: Developer Engagement Behind the Firewall” by Kristof Van Tomme (@kvantomme), Pronovix (@pronovix) on September 25th.

Here is Kristof’s abstract for the API session:

While there are a lot of talks and blogposts about APIs and the importance of an APIs Developer eXperience, most are about public API products. And while a lot of the best practices for API products are also applicable to private APIs, there are significant differences in the circumstances and trade-offs they need to make.
The most important difference is probably in their budgets: as potential profit centers, API products can afford to invest a lot more money in documentation and UX driven developer portal improvements. Internal APIs rarely have that luxury.

In this talk I will explain the differences between public and private APIs, introduce upstream DX, and explain how it can improve downstream DX. Introduce experience design (a.k.a. gamification) and Innersourcing (open sourcing practices behind the firewall) and describe how they could be used on internal developer portals.

Kristof is an expert in delivering developer portals and API documentation, making his talk a must attend session. You can register for the event here, and there are still sponsorship opportunities available. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!

We are getting closer to the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th. The schedule for the conference is up, along with the first lineup of keynote speakers, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is “May Contain Nuts: The Case for API Labeling“ by Erik Wilde (@dret), API Academy (@apiacademy) on September 25th.

I’ll let Erik’s bio set the stage for what he’ll be talking about at APIStrat:

Erik is a frequent speaker at both industry and academia events. In his current role at the API Academy, his work revolves around API strategy, design, and management, and how to help organizations with their digital transformation. Based on his extensive background in Web architecture and technologies, Erik combines deep expertise in protocols and representations with insights into API practices at today’s organizations.

Before joining API Academy and working in the API space full-time, Erik spent time at Siemens and EMC, in both cases working at ways how APIs could be used for their internal service ecosystems, as well as for better ways for customers to use services and products. Before that, Erik spent most of his life in academia, working at UC Berkeley and ETH Zürich. Erik received his Ph.D. in computer science from ETH Zürich, and his diploma in computer science from TU Berlin.

Erik nows his stuff, and can be found on the road with the CA API Academy, making this stop in Nashville, TN a pretty special opportunity. You can register for the event here, and there are still sponsorship opportunities available. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

			<p><em>24 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>While Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will always have a place in my history of APIs, I feel like we are entering a post Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram API world. All three platforms are going through serious evolutions, which includes tightening down the controls on API access, and shuttering of many APIs. These platforms are tightening things down for a variety of reasons, which are more about their business goals, than it is about the community. I’m not saying these APIs will go away entirely, but the era where where these API platforms ruled is coming to a close. The other day I articulated that these platform only needed us for a while, and now that they’ve grown to a certain size do not need us anymore. While this is true, I know there is more to the story of why we are moving on in the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram story. We can’t understand the transformation that is occurring without considering that these platform’s business models are playing out, and they (we) are reaping what they’ve sown with their free and open platform business models. It isn’t so much that they are looking to screw over their developers, they are just making another decision, in a long line of decisions to keep generating revenue from their user generated realities, and advertising fueled perception. I don’t fault Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for fully opening their APIs, then closing them off over time. I fault us consumers for falling for it. I do fault Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram a little for not managing their APIs better along the way, but when your business model is out of alignment with proper API management, it is only natural that you look the other way when bad things are happening, or you are just distracted with other priorities. This is ultimately why you should avoid platforms who don’t have an API, or a clear business model for their platform.

			<p><em>24 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m continuing my work to help the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) move forward their API strategy. One area I’m happy to help the federal agency with, is just being available to answer questions, which I also find make for great stories here on the blog–helping other federal agencies also learn along the way. One question I got from the agency recently, is regarding how the teams should be documenting their APIs, taking into consideration that many of them are supporting legacy services like SOAP. From my vantage point, minimum viable API documentation should always include a machine readable definition, and some autogenerated documentation within a portal at a known location. If it is a SOAP service, WSDL is the format. If it is REST, OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is the format. If its XML RPC, you can bend OpenAPI to work. If it is GraphQL, it should come with its own definitions. All of these machine readable definitions should exist within a known location, and used as the central definition for the documentation user interface. Documentation should not be hand generated anymore with the wealth of open source API documentation available. Each service should have its own GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab repository with the following: README - Providing a concise title and description for the service, as well as links to all documentation, definitions, and other resources. Definitions - Machine readable API definitions for the APIs underlying schema, and the surface area of the API. Documentation - Autogenerated documentation for the API, driven by its machine readable definition. Depending on the type of API being deployed and managed, there should be one or more of these definition formats in place: Web Services Description Language (WSDL) - The XML-based interface definition used for describing the functionality offered by the service. OpenAPI - The YAML or JSON based OpenAPI specification format managed by the OpenAPI Initiative as part of the Linux Foundation. JSON Schema - The vocabulary that allows for...[<a href="/2018/08/24/how-should-teams-be-documenting-their-apis-when-you-have-both-legacy-and-new-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m a big fan of Postman, and the power of their development environment, as well as their Postman Collection format. I think their approach to not just integrating with APIs, but also enabling the development and delivery of APIs has shifted the conversation around APIs in the last couple of years–not too many API service providers accomplish this in my experience. There are several dimensions to what Postman does that I think are pushing the API conversation forward, but one that has been capturing my attention lately are Postman Environment Files. Using Postman, you can manage many different environments used for working with APIs, and if you are a pro or enterprise customer, you can export a file that represents an environment, making each of these API definitions more portable and collaborative. Managing the variety of environments for the hundreds of APIs I use is one of the biggest pain points I have. Postman has significantly helped me get a handle on the tokens and keys I use across the internal, as well as partner and public APIs that I depend on each day to operate API Evangelist. Postman environments allows me to define environments within the Postman application, and then share them as part of the pro / enterprise team experience. You can also manage your environments through the Postman API, if you need to more deeply integrate with your operations. The Postman Environment File makes all of this portable, sharable, and used across environments. It is one of the reasons that makes Postman Collections more valuable to some users, in specific contexts, because it has that run time aspect to what it does. Postman let’s you communicate effectively around the APIs you are deploying and integrating with, and solves relevant pain points like API environment management, that can stand in the way of integration. There aren’t many features of API service providers I get very excited about, but the potential of Postman as...[<a href="/2018/08/23/the-importance-of-postman-api-environment-files/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I do not like email. I do not have a good relationship with my inbox. However, it is one of those ubiquitous tools I have to use, and understand the value it can bring to my world. The goal is to not let my inbox control me too much, as my it is is often a task list that other people think they can control. With all that said, I’m finding renewed value in email newsletters, on several fronts. While I’d prefer to get updates via Atom, I’m warming up to receiving updates from API providers, and API service providers in my inbox. I am an active subscriber to the REST API Notes Newsletter, API Developer Weekly, and other relative newsletters. I’m also finding myself opening up more emails from the API providers, and service providers I’m registered with. Historically, I often see email as a nuisance, but I’m beginning to see emails from the companies I’m paying attention to as a healthy signal. Increasingly, it is a signal that I’m using to understand the overall health of a platform, and yet another signal that will go silent when a platform isn’t supporting their user base, and potentially running out of funding for their operations. I recently wrote a script that harvests emails from my inbox, and tracks on the communications occurring with API providers and service providers I am monitoring. At it’s most basic, it is a heartbeat that I can use to tell when an API provider or service provider is still alive. After that, I’m looking at harvest URLs, and other data, and use the signals to float an API provider or service provider up on my list. It can be tough to remember to tune into what is going on across hundreds and thousands of APIs, and any signal I can harvest to help companies float up is a positive thing. Hopefully it is something that will also incentivize API provider...[<a href="/2018/08/23/getting-email-updates-from-the-api-providers-i-care-about-is-one-way-to-stay/">Read More</a>]</p>

Next up in our session lineup is “Any Way You Want It: Extending Swagger UI for Fun and Profit” by Kyle Shockey (@kyshoc) of SmartBear Software (@SmartBear) on September 25th.

Here is Kyle’s abstract for the session:

Your APIs are tailored to your needs - shouldn’t your tools be as well? In this talk, we’ll explore how Swagger UI 3 makes it easier than ever to create custom functionality, and common use cases for the power that the UI’s plugin system provides.

Learn how to:

- Create plugins that extend existing features and define new functionality
- Integrate Swagger UI seamlessly by defining a custom layout
- Package and share plugins that can be reused by the community (or your organization)

Swagger UI has changed the conversation around how we document our APIs, and being able to extend the interface is an important part of keeping the API documentation conversation evolving, and APIStrat is where this type of discussion is happening. You can register for the event here, and there are still sponsorship opportunities available. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

Here is Laura’s abstract for the session:

Laura will be talking about tooling for mocking microservice endpoints in a meaningful way using Open API specifications. She will cover how to set up microservice deployments processes so that with each versioned microservice deployed a mock of the service with up to date contracts will also be deployed. Laura will also show how to use tooling she and her team built to consume these lightweight mocks in unit tests and either get default mock responses or mock out custom responses for different test cases.

In an era where many API development groups are working to move to a design and mock first approach, this session will be key to our journey, and APIStrat is where we all need to be.

			<p><em>22 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m evolving the search for the Streamdata.io API Gallery I’ve been working on lately. I’m looking to move the basic keywords search that searches the API name and description, as well as the API path, summary, and description using a key word or phrase, to also be about searching parameters in a meaningful way. Each of the APIs in the Streamdata.io API have an OpenAPI definition. It is how I render each of the individual API paths using Jekyll and Github Pages. These parameters give me another dimension of data in which I can index, and use as a facet in my API gallery search. I am developing different sets of vocabulary to help me search against the parameters used across APIs, with one of them being focused on company related information. I’m trying to find APIs that provide the ability to add, update, and search against company related data, content, and execute algorithms that help make sense of company resources. There is no perfect way to search for API parameters that touch on company resources, but right now I’m looking for a handful of fields: company, organization, business, enterprise, agency, ticker, corporate, and employer. Returning APIs that have a parameter with any of those words in the path or summary, and weighting differently if it is in the description or tags for each API path. Next, I’m also tagging each API path that has a URL field, because this will allow me to connect the dot to a company, organization, or other entity via the domain. This is all I’m trying to do, is connect the dots using the parameter structure of an API. I find that there is an important story being told at the API design layer, and API search and discovery is how we are going to bring this story out. Connecting the dots at the corporate level is just one of many interesting stories out there, just waiting to be...[<a href="/2018/08/22/searching-for-apis-that-possess-relevant-company-information/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>Last year I started saying API define first, instead of API design first. In response to many of the conversations out there about designing, then mocking, and eventually deploying your APIs into a production environment. I agree that you should design and iterate before writing code, but I feel like we should be defining our APIs even before we get to the API design phase. Without the proper definitions on the table, our design phase is going to be a lot more deficient in standards, common patterns, goals, and objectives, making it important to invest some energy in defining what is happening first–then iterate on the API definitions throughout the API lifecycle, not just design. I prefer to have a handful of API definitions drafted, before I move onto to the API design phase: Title - A simple, concise title for my API. Description - A simple, concise description for my API. JSON Schema - A set of JSON schema for my APIs OpenAPI - An OpenAPI for the surface area of my API. Assertions - A list of what my API should be delivering. Standards - What standards are being applied with this API. Patterns - What common web patterns will be used with this API. Goals - What are the goals for this particular API. I like having all of this in a GitHub repository before I get to work, actually designing my APIs. It provides me with the base set of definitions I need to go to be as effective as I can in my API design phase. Of course, each of these definitions will be iterated, added to, and evolved as part of the API design phase, and beyond. The goal is to just get a base set of building blocks on the workbench, properly setting the tone for what my API will be doing. Grounding my API work early on in the API lifecycle, in a consistent way that I...[<a href="/2018/08/22/it-is-hard-to-go-api-define-first/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>APIs come in many shapes and sizes. Even when APIs may share a common resource, the likelihood that they are similar in functional, will be slim. Even after eight years of studying APIs, I still struggle with understanding the differences, and putting APIs into common buckets. Think of the differences between two image APIs like Flickr and Instagram, but then also think about the difference between Twitter and Twilio–the differences are many, and a challenge to articulate. I’m pushing forward my API Stack, and API Gallery work, and I’m needing to better organize APIs into meaningful groups that I can add to the search functionality for each of API discovery services. To help me establish a handful of new buckets, I’m thinking more critically about the different types of API functionality I’m coming across, establishing seven new buckets: General Data - You can get at data across the platform, users, and resources. Relative Data - You can get at data that is relative to a user, company, or specific account. Static Data - The data doesn’t change too often, and will always remain fairly constant. Evolving Data - The data changes on a regular basis, providing a reason to come back often. Historical Data - Provides access to historical data, going back an X number of. years. Service - The API is offered as a service, or is provided to extend a specific service. Algorithmic - The API provides some sort of algorithmic functionality like ML, or otherwise. Understanding the type of data an API provides is important to the work I’m doing. Streamdata.io caters to the needs of financial organizations, and they are looking for data to help them with their investment portfolio, but also have very particular opinions around the type of data they want.

We are getting closer to the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th. The schedule for the conference is up, along with the first lineup of keynote speakers, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is “Describing Your API with OpenAPI 3.0” by Anthony Eden (@aeden), DNSimple (@dnsimple) on September 25th.

Here is Christian’s abstract for the session:

For the last 10 years, DNSimple has operated a comprehensive web API for buying, connecting, and operating domain names. After hearing about OpenAPI at APIStrat 2017, we decided to describe the DNSimple API using the OpenAPI v3 specification - this is the story of why we did it, how we did it, and where we are today.

By the end of this presentation you will have the tools you’ll need to evaluate your own API and decide if implementing OpenAPI makes sense for you, and if so, how you can get started. You’ll have a better understanding of the tools available to you to help write your OpenAPI 3 definition, as well the basics on how to write your own definition for your APIs.

We are all still working to make the switch from OpenAPI 2.0 to 3.0, and with APIStrat being owned and operated by the OpenAPI Initiative, it will definitely be the place to have face to face discussions that influence the road map for the API specification. You can register for the event here, and there are still sponsorship opportunities available. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!

			<p><em>21 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I was working on a serverless app for Streamdata.io that takes posts to Hacker News and streams them into an Amazon S3 data lake, and I came across the Algolia powered Hacker News search API. After being somewhat frustrated with the simplicity of the official Hacker News API, I was pleased to find the search kindly provided by Algolia. There is no search API available for the core Hacker News API, and the design leaves a lot to be desired, so the simplicity of Algolia’s API solution was refreshing. There is a lot of data flowing into Hacker News on a regular day, so providing a search API is pretty critical. Additionally, Algolia’s ability to deliver such a simple, usable, yet powerful API on top of a relevant data source like Hacker News demonstrates the utility of what Algolia offers as a search solution–something I wanted to take a moment to point out here on the blog. I consider search to be an essential ingredient for any API. Every API should have a search element to their stack, allowing the indexing and searching of all API resources through a single path. Making Algolia a relevant API service provider in this area, enabling API providers to outsource the indexing and searching of their resources, and the delivery of a dead simple API for your consumers to tap into. This path forward is probably not for every API, as many weave specialized search throughout their API design, but for teams who are lacking in resources, and can afford to outsource this element–Algolia makes sense. Seeing Algolia in action, for a specific API I was integrating with helped bring their service front and center for me. I tend to showcase Elastic for deploying API search solutions, but it is a good to receive a regular reminder that Algolia does the same thing as a service. Their work on the Hacker News Search API provides a good example of...[<a href="/2018/08/21/algolia-kindly-provides-a-hacker-news-search-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m watching several fronts along the API landscape evolve right now, with large API providers shifting, shutting down, and changing how they do business with their APIs–now that they don’t need their ecosystem of developers as much. It is easy to point the finger at Facebook, Twitter, Google, and the other giants, but it really is a wider systemic, business of APIs illness that will continue to negatively impact the API universe. While this behavior is very prominent with the leading API providers right now, it is something we’ll see various waves of it’s influence on the tone of the entire API sector further on down the road. How API providers treat their consumers vary from industry to industry, and is different depending on the types of resources being made available. However, the issue of API providers treating their developers differently when they are just getting started versus once they grow to a certain size, is something that will continue to plague all areas of the API space. Companies change as they mature, and their priorities will no doubt evolve, but almost all will feel compelled to exploit developers early on so that they can grow their numbers–taking advantage of the goodwill and curiosity of the developer personality. The polarization of the API management layer is difficult to predict from the outside. I want to help new API providers out early on, but after eight years of doing this, and seeing many API providers and service providers evolve, and go away–I am left very skeptical of EVERYONE. I think many developers in the API space are feeling the same, and are weary of kicking the tires on new APIs, unless they have a specific project and purpose. I think the days of developers working for free within an API ecosystem are over. It is a concept that will still exist in some form, but along with each wave of new API startups taking advantage of...[<a href="/2018/08/20/we-need-you-api-developers-until-we-have-grown-to-a-certain-size/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am setting up different APIs using the AWS API Gateway and then publishing them to the AWS Marketplace, as part of my work with Streamdata.io. I’m getting a feel for what the process is all about, and how small I can distill an API product to be, as part of the AWS Marketplace process. My goal is to be able to quickly define APIs using OpenAPI, then publish them to AWS API Gateway, and leverage the gateway to help me manage the entire business of the service from signup to discovery. As I was adding one of my first couple of APIs to the AWS Marketplace, and I found the instructions regarding the redirect URL for each API to be a good template. Each individual API service I’m offering will have its own subscription confirmation URL with the AWS API marketplace, with the relevant variables present I will need to scale the technical and business of delivering my APIs: AWS Marketplace Confirmation Redirect URL: https://YOUR_DEVELOPER_PORTAL_API_ID.execute-api.[REGION].amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace-confirm/[USAGE_PLAN_ID] This URL is what my retail customers will be given after they click to subscribe to one of my APIs. Each API has its specific portal (present in URL), as well as being associated with a specific API usage plan within AWS API Gateway. Also notice that they have a variable for region, allowing me to deliver services by region, and scale up the technical side of delivering the various APIs I’m deploying–another important consideration when delivering reliable and performant services. Pointing out the URL for a signup process might seem like a small thing. However, because of AWS’s first mover advantage in the cloud, and their experience as an API pioneer, I feel like they are in a unique position to be defining the business layer of delivering APIs at scale in the cloud. The business opportunities available at the API management and marketplace layers within the AWS ecosystem are untapped, and represent the next generation of API...[<a href="/2018/08/20/the-redirect-url-to-confirm-selling-your-api-in-aws-marketplace-provides-us-with-a-positive/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
We are getting closer to the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th. The schedule for the conference is up, along with the first lineup of keynote speakers, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is “Microservice’ing Like a Unicorn With Envoy, Istio and Kubernetes” by Christian Posta (@christianposta), Red Hat @RedHat on September 25th.

Here is Christian’s abstract for the session:

The exciting parts of APIs, unfortunately, happen when services actually try communicating and working together to accomplish some business function. The service-mesh approach has emerged to help make service communication boring. In particular, a project named Istio.io has garnered attention in the open-source community as a way of implementing the service mesh capabilities. These capabilities include pushing application-networking concerns down into the infrastructure: things like retries, load balancing, timeouts, deadlines, circuit breaking, mutual TLS, service discovery, distributed tracing and others.

As Istio becomes more popular and widely used, we’re going to see a lot of people put it into production for their API use cases. This talk will walk attendees through the Istio architecture, and more importantly, help them understand how it all works.

API delivery, integration, orchestration, and development of mesh networks all represent the next generation of doing APIs, and APIStrat is where we are having these discussions. You can register for the event here, and there are still sponsorship opportunities available. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!

			<p><em>20 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>The API providers I talk to regularly are rarely proactive when it comes to addressing API deprecation. Most API providers aren’t thinking about shutting down any service they deliver until they’ve actually encountered the need down the road. Many just begin their API journey, assuming their APIs will be a success, and they will have to support every version forever. However, once they encounter what it will take to support older versions, they begin to change their tune, something that often comes as an unexpected surprise to consumers. Shutting down old APIs will never be easy, but the process can be made easier with a little proactive communication. One example of this practice in action can be found over at the Internet of Things provider Evrythng, with their API deprecation page. Which provides a pretty simple layout for an API deprecation page, beyond just a title and description of what the future might hold. API Status The following status labels are applicable to APIs, features, or SDK versions depending on their current support status: _- Preview - May change at any time. Stable - Fully released and stable. Will not change at short notice. Deprecated - No longer supported (and may have been replaced), and may be removed in the future at an announced date. Use not encouraged. Removed - Removed, and no longer supported or available._ Communication When a deprecation is announced, the details and any relevant migration information will be available on the following channels: _- The Developer Blog. The @evrythngdev Twitter account. The relevant feature page on the Developer Hub. Enterprise customers may receive information by email to their specified EVRYTHNG contact, if applicable._ Customers using one our SLAs can read the General section for more information. Evrythng provides us with some important building blocks for using as part of our overall API deprecation strategy. Something that EVERY API provide should be considering as they prepare to launch a new API. API...[<a href="/2018/08/20/having-an-api-deprecation-page-like-evrythng-does/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I look at a lot of APIs. I can tell a lot about a company, and the people behind an API from looking at their developer portal, documentation, and other building blocks of their presence. One of the more egregious sins I feel an API provider can make when operating their API is publishing their API documentation as a PDF. This is something that was acceptable up until about 2006, but over a decade after it shows that the organization behind an API hasn’t done their homework. The crime really isn’t the fact that an API provider is using a PDF for their documentation. I’m fine with API providers publishing a PDF version of their API, to provide a portable version of it. Where a PDF version of the documentation becomes a problem is when it is the primary version of the documentation, which demonstrates that the creators don’t get out much and haven’t used many other APIs. If an API team has done their homework, actually put other 3rd party APIs to work, they would know that PDF documentation for APIs is not the norm out in the real world. One of the strongest characteristics an API provider can possess, is an awareness of what other API providers are doing. The leading API providers demonstrate that they’ve used other APIs, and are aware of what API consumers in the mainstream are used to. Most mainstream API consumers will simply close the tab when they encounter an API that has a PDF document for their API. Unless you have some sort of mandate to use that particular API, you are going to look elsewhere. If an API provider isn’t up to speed on what the norms are for API documentation, and are outwardly facing, the chance they’ll actively support their API is always diminished. PDF API documentation may not seem like too big of a mistake to many enterprise, institutional, and government API providers, but...[<a href="/2018/08/13/it-isnt-just-that-you-have-a-pdf-for-your-api-docs-it-is-because-it-demonstrates-that-you-do-not-use-other-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I spend time reviewing each wave of data API marketplaces as they emerge on the landscape every couple of years. There are a number of reasons why these data marketplaces exist, ranging from supporting government agencies, NGOs, or for commercial purposes. One of the most common elements of API-driven data marketplaces that frustrates me is when they don’t do the hard work to expose the meta data around the databases, datasets, spreadsheets, and the raw data they are providing access to–making it very difficult to actually discover anything of interest. You can see a couple examples of this with mLab, World Health Organization, Data.World, and others. While these platforms provide (sometimes) impressive ability to manage data stores, but they don’t always do a good job exposing the meta data of their catalogs as part of the available APIs. Dynamically generating API endpoints, documentation, and other resources based upon the data that is being published to their platforms. Leaving developers to do the digging, and making the investment to understand what is available on a platform. Some of the platforms I encounter obfuscate their data metadata on purpose, requiring developers to qualified before they get access to valuable resources. Most I think, just do not put themselves in the position of an API consumer who lands on their developer page, and doesn’t know anything about an API. They understand the database, and the API, so it all makes sense to them, and they don’t have any empathy for anyone else who isn’t in the know. Which is a common trait of database centered people who speak in acronyms, and schema that they assume other people know, and do not spend much time thinking outside of that bubble. I could make a career out of deploying APIs on top of other data marketplace APIs. Autogenerating a more accessible, indexable, intuitive layer on top of what they’ve already deployed.

			<p><em>07 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m deploying three new APIs right now, using a new experimental serverless approach I’m evolving. One is a location API, another providing API access to companies, and the third involves working with patents. I will be evolving these three simple web APIs to meet the specific needs of some applications I’m building, but then I will also be selling retail and wholesale access to each API once they’ve matured enough. With all three APIs of these APIs, I began with a simple JSON schema from the data source, which I used to generate three rough OpenAPI definitions that will acts the contract seed for my three services. Once I had three separate OpenAPI contracts for the services I was delivering, I wanted to spend some time hand designing each of the APIs before I imported into AWS API Gateway, generating Lambda functions, loading in Postman, and used to support other stops along the API lifecycle. I still use a localized version of Swagger Editor for my OpenAPI design space, but I’m working to migrate to OpenAPI-GUI as soon as I can. I still very much enjoy the side by side design experience in Swagger Editor, but I want to push forward the GUI side of the conversation, while still retaining quick access to the RAW OpenAPI for editing. One of the reasons why I still use Swagger Editor is because of the schema validation it does behind the scenes. Which is one of the reasons I need to learn more about Speccy, as it is going to help me decouple validation from my editor, and all me to use it as part of my wider governance strategy, not just at design time. However, for now I am highly dependent on my OpenAPI editor helping me standardize and stabilize my OpenAPI definitions, before I use them along other stops along the API lifecycle.

			<p>We are kicking it into overdrive now that the schedule is up for APIStrat in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th. From now until the event at the end of September you are going to hear me talk about all the amazing speakers we have, the companies they work for, and the interesting things they are all doing with APIs. One of the perks of being a speaker or a sponsor at APIStrat–you get coverage on API Evangelist, a become part of the buzz around the 9th edition of the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference (APIStrat), now operated by the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) and the Linux Foundation. Today’s post is about my friends over at the digital solutions and API management agency Vanick Digital. With APIStrat coming to their backyard, and their ability to capture the attention of the APIStrat program committee, Vanick Digital has two separate talks this year: Securing the Full API Stack by Patrick Chipman - APIs open up new channels for sharing and consuming data, but whenever you open a new channel, new security risks emerge. Additionally, APIs often involve a variety of new components, such as API gateways, in-memory databases, edge caches, facade layers, and microservice-aligned data stores that can complicate the security landscape. How and where do you apply the right controls to ensure your API and your data are secure? In this session, we’ll answer that question by identifying the different components commonly used in the delivery of API products. For each layer, we’ll discuss the security risks that can and should be mitigated there, along with best practice approaches (including ABAC, OAuth2, and more) to implement those mitigations. What Do You Mean By “API as a Product”? by Lou Powell - You may have heard the term “API Product.” But what does it mean?

			<p>I’m heading to Washington D.C. this Monday to speak on the API life cycle as part of the Blue Button 2.0 Developer Conference. We’ll be coming together in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, within the west wing complex of the White House, to better understand how we can, “bring together developers to learn and share insights on how we can leverage claims data to serve the Medicare population.” The gathering will hear from CMS Administrator Seema Verma and other Administrator Leadership about Blue Button 2.0 and the MyHealthEData initiative, while also hosting a series of break sessions, which I’m part of: Blue Button 2.0 and FHIR (where it’s all heading) with Mark Scrimshire and Cat Greim MyHealthEData and Interoperability with Alex Mugge and Joy Day Overview of Medicare Claims Data with Karl Davis Medicare Beneficiary User Research with Allyssa Allen Sync for Science with Josh Mandel and Andrew Bjonnes API Design with Kin Lane Registration for the gathering is now closed, but if you are a federal govy, I’m sure you can find someone to get you in. I’m looking forward to seeing the CMS, HHS, and USDS folks again, as they are doing some amazing stuff with the Blue Button API, as well as hang out with some of the VA people I know will be there. The Blue Button API is one of the more important API blueprints we have out there in the healthcare space, as well as the federal government. I’ve been a champion on Blue Button since I contributed to the project back when I worked in DC back in 2013, and will continue to invest in its success in coming years.

			<p><em>06 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been having regular meetings with the SAPI API team lately, talking through their presence in the API space, and throwing out ideas for what the future might hold. This isn’t a paid engagement, it is just something I’m interested in investing in on my own, but like many other API service providers in the space, we are exploring what partnership opportunities might there might be. Last week, I wrote about their API Business Hub, which I’ll keep exploring, but first I wanted to address perceptions in the industry that SAP is a little late to the game, when it comes to going all in on APIs. For me, the SAP API journey begins in 2010, when I left my role as VP of Technology at WebEvents Global, who runs all of SAP Events. By 2010, I had found success in my role by scaling up infrastructure using the AWS cloud, which was orchestrated using APIs, and I was beginning to get a taste of where things were going when it came to delivering digital resources to mobile applications using APIs. I helped lead the technology around SAPPHIRE, SAP’s flagship conference, as well as many other lesser events, and meetings. I had also gotten in trouble by SAP IT leadership for using the cloud, which they labeled a “hobby toy”, and told me I shouldn’t be using. However, I was delivering applications more quickly and cost effectively, so my leadership really couldn’t dismiss my usage of the cloud, and more specifically web APIs. Convincing me that web APIs were going to be more successful than the current web services strategy I was working under.

			<p><em>06 Aug 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am publishing a new API for locations. I am tired of needing some of the same location based resources across projects, and not having a simple, standardized API I can depend on. So I got to work finding the most accurate and complete data set I could find of cities, regions, and countries. I settled on using the complete, and easy to use countries-regions-cities project by David Graham–providing a straightforward SQL script I can use as the seed for my locations API database. After crafting an API for this database using AWS API Gateway and Lambda, and working my way down my API checklist, it occurred to me that I wanted to include David Graham’s work as one of the project dependencies. Giving him attribution, while honestly acknowledging my project’s dependency on the data he provided. I’m working hard to include all dependencies within each of the microservices that I’m publishing, being mindful of every data, code, and human dependency that exists behind each service I deliver. Even if I don’t rely on regular updates from them, I still want to acknowledge their contribution, and consider attribution as one layer of my API dependency discussion. Having a dependency section of my API checklist has helped me evolve how I think about defining the dependencies my services have. I initially began tracking all other services that my microservices were dependent on, but then I quickly began adding details about the other software, data, and people the service depends on as well. I’m also pulling together a machine readable definition for tracking on my microservice dependencies. It will be something I include in the API discovery (APIs.json) document for each service, alongside the OpenAPI, and other specifications. Allowing me to track on the dependencies (and attribution) for all of my APIs, and API related artifacts that I am producing on a regular basis.

			<p>As we prepare for APIStrat in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th, I asked my partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) to write a post on the significance of Virginia Eubanks, the author of Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor keynoting the conference–she shared this story, of why her work is so significant, and why it is important for the API community to tune in. Repeatable tasks can and should be automated – that’s an assertion that you’ll hear all the time in computing. Sometimes the rationale is efficiency – it’s cheaper, faster, “labor-saving.” Automation will free up time; it will make our lives easier. Or so we’re told. Sometimes automation is encouraged in order to eliminate human error or bias. Increasingly, automation is eliminating human decision-making altogether. And in doing so, let’s be clear, neither bias nor error are removed; rather they are often re-inscribed. Automation – algorithmic decision-making – can obscure error; it can obscure bias. This push for more automated decision-making works hand-in-hand with the push for more data collection, itself a process that is already shaped by precedent and by politics. And all this, of course, is facilitated by APIs. APIs are commonly referred to as a “glue” of sorts – the implication, more often than not, is that APIs are simply a neutral technology holding larger technical systems together. But none of this is neutral – not the APIs and not the algorithms and not the databases. These technologies are never neutral in their design, development, or implementation. The systems that technologies exist in – organizationally, economically, politically, culturally – are never neutral either. It seems imperative that those building digital technologies begin to think much more critically about the implications of their work, recognizing that the existing inequalities in the analog systems are readily being ported to the digital sphere. This makes the work of one of the keynote speakers at this fall’s...[<a href="/2018/08/06/automating-inequality-and-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>We need your help moving the AsyncAPI specification forward. Ok, first, what is the AsyncAPI specification? “The AsyncAPI Specification is a project used to describe and document Asynchronous APIs. The AsyncAPI Specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API. These files can then be used to create utilities, such as documentation, integration and/or testing tools.” AsyncAPI is a sister specification to OpenAPI, but instead of describing the request and response HTTP API landscape, AsyncAPI is describing the message, topic, event, and streaming API landscape across the HTTP and TCP landscape. It is how we are going to continue to ensure there is machine readable descriptions of this portion of the API landscape, for use in tooling and services. My friend Fran Mendez (@fmvilas) is the creator and maintainer of the specification, and he is doing way too much of the work on this important specification and he needs our help. Here is Fran’s request for our help to contribute: AsyncAPI is an open source project that’s currently maintained by me, with no company or funds behind. More and more companies are using AsyncAPI and the work needed is becoming too much work for a single person working in his spare time. E.g., for each release of the specification, tooling and documentation should be updated. One could argue that I should be dedicating full time to the project, but it’s in this point where it’s too much for spare time and very little to get enough money to live. I want to keep everything for free, because I firmly believe that engineering must be democratized. Also, don’t get me wrong, this is not a complaint. I’m going to continue running the project either with or without contributors, because I love it. This is just a call-out to you, the AsyncAPI lover. I’d be very grateful if you could lend a hand, or even raise your hand and become a co-maintainer.

			<p><em>31 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>We are gearing up for the next edition of APIStrat in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th. With the conference less than two months away, and the schedule up, I’m building momentum with my usual drumbeat about the speakers, and companies involved. So you’ll be reading a lot of stories related to APIStrat in coming weeks, where I’m looking to build awareness and attendance of the conference, but more importantly showcasing the individuals and companies who are supporting it and helping making the 9th edition of APIStrat amazing. One of innovative startups I’m partnering with right now, and who you will find speaking and sponsoring APIStrat is 42Crunch. Full disclosure, I’m regularly talking with 42Crunch regarding their road map, and I consider them an API Evangelist partner, however, this is because I find them to be one of the more progressive, and important API startups out there right now. 42Crunch is important in my opinion, because they are focusing on API security, a critical stop along the API lifecycle, and also because of the OpenAPI-driven, awareness building approach to delivering API security. 42Crunch isn’t just bringing API security solutions to the table for you to purchase as a service, they bring API security solutions to the table that help you invest in your internal API security practices–which is the most critical aspect of what they do in my opinion. 42Crunch is focused on API security, but they are what I consider to be a full API lifecycle solution. Meaning they play nicely as one of the tools in your API lifecycle toolbox. Which begins with being OpenAPI-driven, and treating your API’s definition as a contract, but with 42Crunch it is about using this contract to empower your API team to make API security a first-class citizen across all stops along the API lifecycle. Not just at the API management layer, or as an after thought later on when you scan your infrastructure–42Crunch is baking...[<a href="/2018/07/31/practical-secdevops-for-apis-from-42crunch-at-apistrat-in-nashville-this-fall/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m currently learning more about SLA4OAI, an open source standard for describing SLA in APIs, which is based on the standards proposed by the OAI, adding an optional profile for defining SLA (Service Level Agreements) for APIs. “This SLA definition in a neutral vendor flavor will allow to foster innovation in the area where APIs expose and documents its SLA, API Management tools can import and measure such key metrics and composed SLAs for composed services aggregated way in a standard way.” Providing not just a needed standard for the API sector, but more importantly one that is built on top of an existing standard. SLA4OAI, provides an interesting way to define the SLA for any API, providing a set of objects that augment and can be paired with an OpenAPI definition using an x-sla vendor extension: Context - Holds the main information of the SLA context. Infrastructure - Required Provides information about tooling used for SLA storage, calculation, governance, etc. Pricing - Global pricing data. Metrics - A list of metrics to use in the context of the SLA. Plans - A set of plans to define different service levels per plan. Quotas - Global quotas, these are the default quotas, but they could be overridden by each plan later. Rates - Global rates, these are the default rates, but they could be overridden by each plan later. Guarantees - Global guarantees, these are the default guarantees, but they could be overridden by each plan later. Configuration - Define the default configurations, later each plan can be override it. These objects provide all the details you will need to quantify the SLA for any OpenAPI defined API. In order to validate each of the SLAs, a separate Basic SLA Management Services is provided to implement the services that control, manage, report and track SLAs. Providing the reporting output you will need to understand whether or not each individual API is meeting its SLA.

			<p><em>26 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am deploying a patent review API for a client, using data from the Patent Examination Data System (PEDS). You can download complete JSON or XML data from the United States Patent Office (USPTO), and they even have an API. So, why would I be launching yet another API? Well, because what they have is so cryptic, complex, and lacking in any schema or API design, there is value in me pushing the API conversation forward a bit by thinking deeply about how other people will potentially be using these resources–something the USPTO clearly hasn’t done. The USPTO PEDS API (that is more acronyms than you can shake a stick at) is a great example of how much database people, and developers take for granted as they operate within their little bubbles, without much concern for how the rest of the world views their work–take a look at the screenshot of thee USPTO PEDS API. There is only one telling sign on this page regarding what this API does–the email address for the contact, which has a uspto.gov address. Beyond that there is not a single sign of the resources available within this API, or the value they bring to the table. Even if you can extrapolate that this is a patent API, there is nothing to tell you that you can’t actually get patent data from this, you can only get meta data about the patents, reviewers, inventors, and the activity around the patent. For me, the API reflects many of the challenges developers and database people face when it comes to thinking out of their box, and effectively communicating with external consumers–which is the whole reason we do web APIs. I’m pretty well versed consuming patent data, and it took me several hours to get up to speed with this set of resources. I opted to not deal with the API, which is just an ElasticSearch index on top of a patent file...[<a href="/2018/07/26/thinking-deeply-about-other-people-using-your-api-is-the-most-valuable-lesson/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>While writing about the discussions I’ve been having with folks around using monorepos to manage microservices, I came across this post about whether or not people should be using a single monolithic Lambda function or multiple lambda functions with the AWS API Gateway. Again, surprising me about how lazy people are, and how difficult it is for people to think about things in a decoupled way. Which I think is the reason many people will go back to doing monolithic applications, and fail at microservices, not because it technically won’t work, it is just because it will be perceived as more work, and with a lack of imagination around how to work in a distributed way, people will give up. First, I do not think microservices is a good idea for all applications. Second, I don’t always subscribe to microservices meaning small or micro. I think a service mindset is good, and it is healthy to decouple, and reduce the surface area of your services, minimizing dependencies, but there are many situations where a super small microservice will be a bad idea. However, if you are going to do serverless microservices with Lambda and AWS API Gateway, I do not understand why you’d want a single monolithic function behind many different API paths. I’m guessing that people who think you should do monolithic serverless haven’t thought about sensible organization of their functions, and orchestration of them using the AWS CLI or API. They are managing them through the AWS dashboard and are thinking, “man this is a lot of work, let’s just do a single function, with the routing built in.” Similar to folks thinking a monorepo is a good idea over many different repos, without ever thinking about organizations using Github organizations, and orchestration using Git and the Github API, people aren’t getting creative with their Lamdba functions. People seem to be in love with brainstorming and dreaming about decoupled approaches to doing APIs,...[<a href="/2018/07/26/monolithic-serverless-wtf/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I told the folks over at SAP that I would take a look at their API Business Hub. It isn’t paid work, just helping provide feedback on another addition to the API discovery front, something I’m pretty committed to helping push forward in any way that I can. They’ve pulled together a pretty clean, OpenAPI driven catalog of useful APIs for the enterprise, so I wanted to make sure I kick the tires and size it up alongside the other API discovery work I am doing. The SAP API Business Hub is a pretty simple and clean catalog for searching and browsing applications, integrations, as well as APIs–I am going to focus in on the API section. Which at first glance looks to have about 70 separate APIs, but then you notice each of them are just umbrellas for each API platform, and some of them contain many different API endpoints. Some of the APIs are simple language translation and text extraction resources, while others provide robust access to the SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Ariba, and other SAP systems. You see a lot of SAP focused solutions, but then you also see a handful of partner solutions added via their platform partner program. I see the beginnings of a useful API catalog getting going on over at the SAP API Business Hub. Each API is well documented, and provides an OpenAPI definition for each API, complete with interactive documentation you can play within a sandbox environment. More than most API catalogs, marketplaces, and directories I profile have available. Allowing you to kick the tires and see what is going on, before working with the production version. They also provide you with a Java SDK to download for each API, something that could easily be expanded to support many different platforms, programming languages, and continuous integration cycles with solutions like APIMATIC. Making it more of a discovery, as well as integration marketplace. Like any API marketplace...[<a href="/2018/07/26/kicking-the-tires-on-the-sap-api-business-hub/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I read a lot of API documentation, and help review API portals for clients, and one of the most common rookie mistakes I see made, is people pointing out the obvious, and writing a bunch of fluffy, meaningless content that gets in the way of people actually using an API. When the obvious API industry stuff is combined with the assumed elements of what a company does, you end up with a meaningless set of obstacles that slow API integration down. Here is the most common thing I read when entering an API portal: “This is an API for querying data from the [Company X] platform, to get access to JSON from our system which allows you to get data from our system into yours using the web. You will need to write code to make calls to our APIs documented here on the page below. Our API uses REST to accept request and provide responses in a JSON format.” I’ve read API after API that never tells you what the API does. It just assumes you know what the company does, and then goes into verbose explanations of what API, REST, JSON, and other things that should be intuitive if an API is well designed, and immediately accessible via an API. People tend to make to many assumptions about API consumers already knowing what a company does, while also assuming they known absolutely nothing about APIs, and burying actual API documentation behind a bunch of API blah blah blah, instead of just doing and being the API. It is another side effect of developers, database, and IT folk not being very good at thinking outside of their bubble. It goes beyond techies not having social skills, and is more about them not having to think about other people at all. They just don’t have the ability to put themselves in the shoes of someone landing on the home page of their developer portal, and...[<a href="/2018/07/26/avoid-being-captain-obvious-when-documenting-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>About 60% of my work these days is building upon the last five years of my API Stack research, with a focus on building out the Streamdata.io API Gallery. We are fine tuning our approach for discovering new API-driven resources from across the landscape, while also profiling, quantifying, ranking, and publishing to the Streamdata.io API Gallery, The API Stack, and potentially other locations like the Postman Network, APIs.Guru, and other API discovery destinations I am working with. Helping us make sense of the increasingly noisy API landscape, while identifying the most valuable resources, and then profiling them to help reduce friction when it comes to potentially on-boarding and streaming data from each resource. Discover New API-Driven Resources Finding new APIs isn’t too difficult, you just have to Google for them. Finding new APIs in an automated way, with minimum human interaction becomes a little more difficult, but there are some proven ways to get the job done. There is no single place to go find new APIs, so I’ve refined a list of common place I use to discover new APIs: Search Engines - Using search engine APIs to look for APIs based upon the vocabulary we’ve developed. Github - Github provides a wealth of signals when it comes to APIs, and we use the Github API to discover interesting sources using our vocabulary. Stack Overflow - Using the Stack Exchange API, we are able to keep an eye out for developers talking about different types of interesting APIs. Twitter - The social network still provides some interesting signals when it comes to discussions about interesting APis. Reddit - There are many developers who still use Reddit to discuss technical topics, and ask questions about the APIs they are using. Using the topic and entity vocabulary we’ve been developing, we can automate the discovery of new APIs across these sources using their APIs.

Providing an overview of API governance to help the VA, “understand, with the intention to adopt, best practices from the private and public sector, specifically for prioritizing APIs to build, standards to which to build APIs, and making the APIs usable by external consumers.” Pulling together several years of research conducted by industry analyst API Evangelist, as well as phone interviews with API practitioners from large enterprise organizations who are implementing API governance on the ground across the public and private sector, conducted by Skylight Digital. We’ve assembled this report to reflect the interview conversations we had with leaders from the space, helping provide a walk through of the types or roles and software architecture being employed to implement governance at large organizations. Then we walk through governance as it pertains to identifying possible APIs, developing standards around the delivery of APIs, how organizations are moving APIs into production, as well as presenting them to their consumers. Wrapping up with an overview of formal API governance details, as well as an acknowledgement that most API governance is rarely ever a fully formed initiative at this point in time.

			<p>
One of the layers of the API universe where I come across an increased number Hypermedia APIs is in the movie, television, and entertainment space. Where having a more flowing API experience makes a lot of sense, and the extra investment in link relations will pay off. One example of this I recently came across was over at TVMaze, who has a pretty robust hypermedia API, where they opted for using HAL as their media type.

Like any good hypermedia should, TVMaze begins with its root URL: http://api.tvmaze.com, and provides a robust set of endpoints from there:

The TVMaze API isn’t an overly complex hypermedia API. I think it is simple, elegant, and shows how you can use link relations to establish a more meaningful experience for API consumers. Allowing you to navigate the large, ever-changing catalog of television shows, allowing the API client to do the heavy lifting of navigating the shows, schedules, and people involved with each production.

There hasn’t been enough showcasing of the hypermedia APIs available out there. Usually once a year I remember to give the subject some attention, or when I come across interesting ones like TVMaze. Hypermedia isn’t just an academic idea anymore, and is something that has gotten traction in a number of sectors, and I keep seeing signs of growth and adoption. I don’t think it will be the API solution most hypermedia believers envisioned it, but I do think it is a viable tool in our API toolbox, and for the right projects it makes a lot of sense.

			<p><em>16 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>While profiling any company, a couple of the Google searches I will execute right away are for “[Company Name] Swagger” and “[Company Name] OpenAPI”, hoping that a provide is progressive enough to have published an OpenAPI definition–saving me hours of work understanding what their API does. I’ve added a third search to my toolbox, if these other two searches do not yield results, searching for “[Company Name] Postman”, revealing whether or not a company has published a Postman Collection for their API–another sign of a progressive, outward thinking API provider in my book. A machine readable definition for an API tells me more about what a company, organization, institution, or government agency does, than anything else I can dig up on their website, or social media profiles. An OpenAPI definition or Postman Collection is a much more honest view of what an organization does, than the marketing blah blah that is often available on a website. Making machine readable definitions something I look for almost immediately, and prioritize profiling, reviewing, and understanding the entities I come across with a machine readable definition, over those that do not. I only have so much time in a day, and I will prioritize an entity with an OpenAPI or Postman, over those who do not. The presence of an OpenAPI and / or Postman Collection isn’t just about believing in the tooling benefits these definitions provide. It is about API providers thinking externally about their API consumers. I’ve met a lot of API providers who are dismissive of these machine readable definitions as trends, which demonstrates they aren’t paying attention to the wider API space, and aren’t thinking about how they can make their API consumers lives easier–they are focused on doing what they do. In my experience these API programs tend to not grow as fast, focus on the needs of their integrators and consumers, and often get shut down after they don’t get the results they...[<a href="/2018/07/16/if-a-search-for-swagger-or-openapi-doesnt-yield-results-i-try-for-a-postman/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>It is interesting for me to still regularly come across so many API providers who have a public API portals, but insist on keeping most of their documentation behind a login. Stating that they are concerned with competitors getting access to the design of their API and the underlying schema. Revealing some indefensible API business models, and general paranoia around doing business on the web. Something that usually is a sign for me of a business that is working really hard to maintain a competitive grip within an industry, without actually having to do the hard work of innovating and moving the conversation forward. Confident API providers know that you can put your API documentation out in the open, complete with schema, without giving away the farm. If your competition can take your API design, and underlying schema, and recreate your business–you should probably go back to the drawing board, and come up with a new business idea. Your API and schema definition is not your business. I’ve used this comparison may times–your API docs are like a restaurant menu. Can you imagine restaurants that kept them hidden until they were sure you are going to be a customer? If you think that your competition can read your menu and recreate all your dishes, then you won’t be in business very long, because your dishes probably weren’t that special to begin with. For every competitor you keep out of your API documentation, you are keeping twenty new customers out as well. I’m guessing that your savvy competitors are going to be able to get in anyways with a fake account, or otherwise. Don’t waste your time on hiding your API and keeping it out of the view of your potential customers–invest your energy in making sure your APIs kick ass. To use the restaurant analogy again, make sure ingredients are the best, and your processes, and your service are top notch. Don’t make your menu...[<a href="/2018/07/16/for-every-competitor-you-keep-out-of-your-api-docs-you-are-keeping-twenty-new/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’m regularly fascinated with API development teams I work with expressing their concern with working with many Github repositories. With all of the complexity I watch teams embrace when it comes to frameworks, scaffolding, continuous integration, deployment, and orchestration solutions, I’m lost on why many Github repositories suddenly become such a challenge. A Github organization is a folder, and a Github repository is a folder, that you can check out locally, on your server, or work with via an API, or Git. It is a distributed file store, that you can orchestrate with programmatically, and can be as logical or illogical as you design it to be. I work really hard to keep technical complexity to a minimum in my world, but this means limiting unnecessary vendor lock-in, and tech just because it is the latest trend. For me, Git is just a distributed file system, with version control built in, with Github providing a nice API and network effect layer that makes it compelling. Referencing a Github folder is just a matter of using its org and repo name, checking it out, and working with the standardized layout of information I have published there. Allowing me to work with, and orchestrate thousands of separate folders (repos), across almost 50 organizations (folders), in a consistent way, as a one person team. Something that has taken me about four years to setup, and fine tune, but has become essential to what I do on a daily basis. I’m not saying working with hundreds or thousands of individual Github repositories can’t be complex, or doesn’t take a significant amount of work. I’m just saying I’m intrigued by how technologists who manage large systems, adopt complex frameworks for delivering simple web solutions, and regularly make other complex technological investments, draw the line here. I see Github as a robust file store, with two doorways, 1) Git, and 2) API.

			<p>You don’t usually find me writing about API acquisitions unless I have a relationship with the company, or there are other interesting aspects of the acquisition that makes it noteworthy. This acquisition of Elastic Beam by Ping Identity has a little of both for me, as I’ve been working with the Elastic Beam team for over a year now, and I’ve been interested in what Ping Identity is up to because of some research I am doing around open banking in the UK, and the concept of an industry level API identity and access management, as well as API management layer. All of which makes for an interesting enough mix for me to want to quantify here on the blog and load up in my brain, and share with my readers. From the press release, “Ping Identity, the leader in Identity Defined Security, today announced the acquisition of API cybersecurity provider Elastic Beam and the launch of PingIntelligence for APIs.” Which I think reflects some of the evolution of API security I’ve been seeing in the space, moving being just API management, and also being about security from the outside-in. The newly combined security solution, PingIntelligence for APIs, focuses in on automated API discovery, threat detection &amp; blocking, API deception &amp; honeypot, traffic visibility &amp; reporting, and self-learning–merging the IAM, API management, and API security realms for me, into a single approach to addressing security that is focused on the world of APIs. While I find this an interesting intersection for the world of APIs in general, where I’m really intrigued by the potential is when it comes to the pioneering open banking API efforts coming out of the UK, and the role Ping Identity has played. “Ping’s IAM solution suite, the Ping Identity Platform, will provide the hub for Open Banking, where all UK banks and financial services organizations, and third-party providers (TPPs) wanting to participate in the open banking ecosystem, will need to...[<a href="/2018/07/11/ping-identity-acquires-elasticbeam-to-establish-new-api-security-solution/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>There are a lot of people making money off of the acquisition, organization, and providing access to data in our digital world. While I quietly tune into what the data monetization trends are, I am also actively looking for interesting approaches to generating revenue from data, but specifically with an eye on revenue sharing opportunities for the owners or stewards of that data. You know as opposed to just the exploitation of people’s data, and generating of revenue without them knowing, or including them in the conversation. To help counteract this negative aspect of the data economy, I’m always looking to highlight (potentially) more positive outcomes when it comes to making money from data. I was recently profiling the API of the people intelligence platform LotaData, and I came across their data monetization program, which provides an interesting look at how platforms can help data stewards generate revenue from data, but in a way that makes it accessible to individuals looking to monetize their own data as well. “LotaData’s AI platform transforms raw location signals into ‘People Intelligence’ for monetization, usually based upon the follow key attributes: latitude, longitude, timestamp, deviceID, and accuracy.” Representing activity at a location and/or point in time, allowing LotaData’s to understand what is happening at specific places at scale, and develop meaningful insights and behavioral segments that other companies and government agencies will want to buy into. Some of the examples they provide are: Commuting daily on CalTrain from Palo Alto to San Francisco Mid-week date night at Nopa on the way back from work Sweating it out at Soul Cycle on Saturday mornings Taking the dog out for a walk on Sunday afternoons Season ticket holder for Warriors games at the Oakland Arena LotaData’s location-based insights and segments are entirely inferred from raw location signals, emphasizing that they do not access or collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from mobile phones–stating that they “do not and never will collect...[<a href="/2018/07/11/monetizing-your-device-location-data-with-lotadata/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>It is funny work with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes, and learn all the weird practices they have, and the strange belief systems they’ve established. One day I will be talking to a 3 person startup, the next day I’ll be talking with a large bank, and after that I’ll be working with a group at a massive government agency. I have to be mindful of my time, make sure I’m meeting my mission, having an impact, as well as paying my bills, but for the most part I don’t have any entrenched rules about who I will talk to, or who I will share my knowledge with. One thing I chuckle at regularly is when I come across large organizations who will gladly talk with me, and tap my knowledge, but won’t work with some of the startups I work with, or the conferences I produce, because they are “too small”. They can’t waste their time working with small startups because it won’t bring the scope of revenue they need to justify the relationships, but they’ll gladly talk to me and welcome the exposure and knowledge I might bring. Sometimes I feel like telling organizations, “sorry you are just to large to work with, you are almost guaranteed to fail at this whole API thing, why should I bother?” I think I’ll say it sometimes jokingly, but not really interested in truly being a dick at that level. Most large organizations can’t figure out how to work with me in any long term anyway, because they are too bureaucratic and slow moving. Other large organizations have no problem figuring out how to get me past legal, and getting me paid, but some just can’t figure it out.

			<p><em>10 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m doing a lot of thinking regarding how JSON PATCH can be applied because of my work with Streamdata.io. When you proxy an existing JSON API with Streamdata.io, after the initial response, every update sent over the wire is articulated as a JSON PATCH update, showing only what has changed. It is an efficient, and useful way to show what has changed with any JSON API response, while being very efficient about what you transmit with each API response, reducing polling, and taking advantage of HTTP caching. As I’m writing an OpenAPI diff solution, helping understand the differences between OpenAPI definitions I’m importing, and allowing me to understand what has changed over time, I can’t help but think that JSON PATCH would be a great way to articulate change of the surface area of an API over time–that is, if everyone loyally used OpenAPI as their API contract. Providing an OpenAPI diff using JSON PATCH would be a great way to articulate an API road map, and tooling could be developed around it to help API providers publish their road map to their portal, and push out communications with API consumers. Helping everyone understand exactly what is changing in way that could be integrated into existing services, tooling, and systems–making change management a more real time, “pipelinable” (making this word up) affair. I feel like this could help API providers better understand and articulate what might be breaking changes. There could be tooling and services that help quantify the scope of changes during the road map planning process, and teams could submit OpenAPI definitions before they ever get to work writing code, helping them better see how changes to the API contract will impact the road map. Then the same tooling and services could be used to articulate the road map to consumers, as the road map becomes approved, developed, and ultimately rolled out.

			<p><em>10 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>I import and work with a number of OpenAPI definitions that I come across in the wild. When I come across a version 1.2, 2.0, 3.0 OpenAPI, I import them into my API monitoring system for publishing as part of my research. After the initial import of any OpenAPI definition, the first thing I look for is the consistent in the naming of paths, the availability of summary, descriptions, as well as tags. The naming conventions used is paths is all over the place, some are cleaner than others. Most have a summary, with fewer having descriptions, but I’d say about 80% of them do not have any tags available for each API path. Tags for each API path are essential to labeling the value a resource delivers. I’m surprised that API providers don’t see the need for applying these tags. I’m guessing it is because they don’t have to work with many external APIs, and really haven’t put much thought into other people working with their OpenAPI definition beyond it just driving their own documentation. Many people still see OpenAPI as simply a driver of API documentation on their portal, and not as an API discovery, or complete lifecycle solution that is portable beyond their platform. Not considering how tags applied to each API resource will help others index, categorize, and organize APIs based upon the value in delivers. I have a couple of algorithms that help me parse the path, summary, and description to generate tags for each path, but it is something I’d love for API providers to think more deeply about. It goes beyond just the resources available via each path, and the tags should reflect the overall value an API delivers. If it is a product, event, messaging, or other resource, I can extract a tag from the path, but the path doesn’t always provide a full picture, and I regularly find myself adding more tags to each API(if I...[<a href="/2018/07/10/people-do-not-use-tags-in-their-openapi-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am shifting my long running API operations from a PHP / EC2 based implementation to a more efficient Node.js / Lambda based solution, and I promised James Higginbotham (@launchany) that I’d share a breakdown of my process with him a month or so back. I’m running 100+, to bursts of 1000+ long running API requests for a variety of purposes, and it helps me to tell the narrative behind my code, introducing some coherence into the why and how of what I’m doing, while also sharing with others along the way. I had covered my earlier process a little bit in a story a few months ago, but as I was migrating the process, I wanted to further flesh out, and make sure I wasn’t mad. The base building block of each long running API request I am making is HTTP. The only difference between these API requests, and any others I am making on a daily basis, is that they are long running–I am keeping them alive for seconds, minutes, and historically hours. My previous version of this work ran as long running server side jobs using PHP, which I monitored and kept alive as long as I possibly could. My next generation scripts will have a limit of 5 minutes per API request, because of constraints imposed by Lambda, but I am actually find this to be a positive constraint, and something that will be helping me orchestrate my long running API requests more efficiently–making them work on a schedule, and respond to events. Ok, so why am I running these API calls? A variety of reasons. I’m monitoring a Github repository, waiting for changes. I’m monitoring someone’s Twitter account, or a specific Tweet, looking for a change, like a follow, favorite, or retweet. Maybe I’m wanting to know when someone asks a new question about Kafka on Stack Overflow, or Reddit.

			<p>It is tough to help developers think outside of the world they operate within. Most software is still developed and managed within silos, knowing it’s inner workings will never be seen by anyone outside of the team. This mode of operation is a rich environment for poor code quality, and teams with port communication. This is one of the reasons I’ve embraced web APIs, after running software development teams since the 1990s, I’ve been put in charge of some pretty dysfunctional teams, and some pretty unwieldy legacy codebases, so once I started working out in the open using web APIs, I did’t want to go back. Web APIs aren’t the cure for all of our technology problems, but it does begin to let some sunlight in on some messed up ways of doing things. One common illness I still see trickling out of API operations are developers not using plain language. Speaking in acronyms, code, and other cryptic ways of articulating the resources they are exposing. I came across a set of API resources for managing a DEG the other day. You could add, updated, delete and get DEGs. You can also pull analytics, history, and other elements of a DEG. I spent about 10-15 minutes looking around their developer portal, documentation, and even Googling, but never could figure out what a DEG was. Nowhere in their documentation did they ever tell consumers what a DEG was, you just had to be in the know I guess. The API designer (if that occurred) and developer had never stopped to consider that maybe someone would stumble across their very public API and not know what a DEG was. Demonstrating how us developers have trouble thinking outside our silos, and thinking about what others will need. There is no reason that your API paths shouldn’t be plain language, using common words.

			<p><em>09 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>When you operate your application within the API ecosystem of a large platform, depending on the platform, you might have to worry about the platform operator copying, and emulating what you do. Twitter has long been accused of sharecropping within their ecosystem, and other larger platforms have come out with similar features to what you can find within their API communities. Not all providers take the ideas, it is also very common for API platforms to acquire talent, features, and applications from their ecosystems–something that Twitter has done regularly. Either way, API ecosystems are the R&amp;D, and innovation labs for many platforms, where the latest features get proven. As the technology playing field has consolidated across three major cloud providers, AWS, Azure, and Google, this R&amp;D and innovation zone, has become more of a cloud kill zone for API providers. Where the cloud giants can see the traction you are getting, and decide whether or not they want to launch a competing solution behind the scenes. Investors are tuning into this new cloud kill zone, and in many cases opting not to invest in startups who operate on a cloud platform, afraid that the cloud giant will just come along and copy a service, and begin directly competing with companies operating within their own ecosystem. Making it a kill zone for API providers, who can easily be assimilated into the AWS, Azure, or Google stack, and left helpless do anything but wither on the vine, and die. Much like other API ecosystems, AWS, Azure, and Google all have the stats on who is performing across their platforms, and they know which solutions developers are demanding. Factoring in the latest growth trends into their own road maps, and making the calculations around whether they will be investing in their own solutions, or working to partner, and eventually acquire a company operating with this new kill zone.

			<p><em>09 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>I was profiling the volume of API from the Internet of Things platform Predix this last week. Luckily they have OpenAPI definitions for each of the APIs, something that makes my life a lot easier. As, they have a wealth of APIs available, doing an amazing amount of work when it comes to connecting devices to the Internet–I love their enthusiasm for putting out APIs. My only critical feedback for them after working my way through their API definitions, is they should invest some time to develop an API design guide, and distribute across their teams. The wild variances in definition and design of their APIs made me stumble a number of times while learning about what they do. While looking through the definitions for the Predix APIs, I found many inconsistent patterns between them, and you could tell that they had different teams (or individuals) working across the suite of APIs. The inconsistencies ranged from the naming, description, and how the meta data was provided for each API, all the way to acronyms used in API paths, and other things that prevented me from understand what an API did all together. While I am stoked they provide OpenAPI definitions for all of their APIs, I still struggled to understand what was possible with many of their APIs. It kind of feels like they need an external editor to review each API definition before it leaves the door, as well as some sort of automated validation using JSON schema, that would work against a common set of API design standards. I can tell that Predix has an extremely powerful stack of Internet of Things API resources. They have insight, predictive, and event-driven layers, and a wealth of resources for device operators to put to work. They just need another layer of API design polish on their APIs, as well as ensuring their API documentation reflects this design polish, helping bring it all home.

			<p><em>09 Jul 2018</em></p>
			<p>About half of the teams I work with on microservices strategy are beginning to freak out about the number repositories they have, and someone is regularly bringing up the subject of having a mono repo. Which is usually a sign for me that a group is not ready for doing the hard work involved with microservices, but also shows a lack of ability to think, act, and respond to things in a distributed way. It can be a challenge to manage many different repositories, but with a decoupled awareness of the sprawl that can exist, and some adjustments and aggregation to your strategy it can be doable, even for a small team. The most import part of sticking to multiple repositories is for the sake of the code. Keeping services decoupled in reality, not just name is extremely important. Allowing the code behind each service to have its own repository, and build a pipeline that keeps things more efficient, nimble, and fast. Each service you layer into a mono repo will be one more chunk of time needed when it comes to builds, and understanding what is going on with the codebase. I know there are a growing number of strategies for managing mono repos efficiently, but it is something that will begin to work against your overall decoupling efforts, and you are better off having a distributed strategy in place, because code is only the first place you’ll have to battle centralization, in the name of a more distributed reality. Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket all have an API, which makes all of your repositories accessible in a programmatic way. If you are building microservices, and working towards a distributed way of doing things, it seems like you should be using APIs to aggregate and automate your reality. It is pretty easy to setup an organization for each grouping of microservices, and setup a single master or control repository where you can aggregate information, and...[<a href="/2018/07/09/concerns-around-managing-many-microservice-repositories-and-going-with-a-mono/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>It has been a fascinating and eye opening experience sitting at the intersection of tech startups and the web, mobile, and device applications they’ve built over the last decade. In 2010 I was captivated by the power of APIs to deliver resources to developers, and end-users. In 2018, I’m captivated by the power of APIs to mine end-users like they are just a resource, with the assistance of the developer class. A dominant white male class of people who are more than willing to look the other way when exploitation occurs, and make for the perfect “tools” to be exploited by the wealthy investor class. While I do not have much hope for diversity efforts in tech, or the bro culture waking up, I do have hope for city and state/provincial lawmakers to wake up to the exploitation that is going on. I’ve seen hints of cities waking up to the mining that has been occurring by Facebook and Google over the last decade. The open exploitation and monetization of a city’s and state’s most precious resources–their constituents. While some cities are still swooning over having Amazon set up shop, or Facebook to build a data center, these company’s web, mobile, and device applications have infiltrated their districts been probing, mining, extracting, and shipping value back to offshore corporate headquarters. You can see this occurring with Google Maps, which has long been a darling of the API community. We were all amazed at the power of this new mapping resource, something us developers could never have built on our own. We all integrated it into our websites, and embedded it into our mobile applications. We could use it to navigate and find where we were going, completely unaware of the power of the application to mine data from our local transit authorities, businesses, as well as track the location of all of us at each moment.

			<p><em>29 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>We are building up to the 9th edition of API Strategy &amp; Practice (APIStrat) happening in Nashville, Tennessee this September 24th through 26th. As part of the build up we are looking for sponsors to help make the event happen, bringing the API community together once again to share stories from the trenches, and discuss healthy practices that are allowing companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies make an impact when it comes to their API operations. The 2017 edition of APIStrat in Portland, OR was a huge success, and help complete the transition of APIStrat to be part of the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI). After seven editions, and four years of operation exclusively by 3Scale and API Evangelist, the event has matured and will continue growing under the guidance of the OAI, and the community that has evolved around the OpenAPI specification. Presenting an opportunity for other API providers, and API service providers to get involved by joining as an OAI member and / or sponsoring APIStrat, and joining the conversation that has been going on in the community since early 2013. You can download the APIStrat conference prospectus from the Linux Foundation / OAI event website, and there is a form to submit to learn more about sponsoring. You can also email [email&#160;protected] if you’d like to get plugged in. Feel free to also reach out to me as well, as I’m in charge of trying to drum up sponsors, and expand our base beyond just the OAI membership, and the companies who stepped up last year. Helping API providers and service providers understand what a community event APIStrat is, and help it differentiate from the other API, and tech-focused conferences that are happening. I’m definitely biased, as I help start and grow the conference, but after running tech events for over a decade, it was important to me that APIStrat grow into a community event about ideas, and less about vendors and product pitches....[<a href="/2018/06/29/looking-for-sponsors-for-apistrat-2018-in-nashville-tn-this-september/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>GraphQL folks keep on with the GraphQL vs REST narratives, rather than a REST and / or GraphQL narrative lately with a recent burger meme/narrative. Continuing to demonstrate their narrow view of the landscape, and revealing the short lived power of an adversarial approach to community building. I get why people do this, because they feel they are being clever, and that the click response from the echo chamber re-enforces it, but ultimately it is something that won’t move the conversation forward, but it does get them kudos within their community–which is what many of them live for. I’ll start with the usual disclaimer. I actually like GraphQL, and prescribe it as part of my API toolbox. However, rather than a REST vs GraphQL approach, I sell it as REST and GraphQL, depending on the developer audience we are trying to reach with our efforts. Whether or not you use GraphQL on your platform is completely based upon knowing your developers, and working with a group that understands the resources before offered–something the GraphQL community continues their failure to see. Also their adversarial marketing tactics has lost me several GraphQL projects in government because it comes off as being a trend, and not something that will be around very long. With that said, I think this meme tells a great story about GraphQL, and demonstrates the illnesses of not the technology, but the ideology and beliefs of the community. I had a couple of thoughts after seeing the Tweet, and reviewing the replies: 1) I thought it was an anti-GraphQL meme at first. Demonstrating that you can build a horrible burger with some very well known ingredients. Spoofing on the burger emoji drama that has been going on in recent years.. I mean, is the lettuce the plate in the GraphQL burger? 2) Like GraphQL, the food choices demonstrate that GraphQL works well in very controlled environments.

			<p><em>26 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>API versioning is almost always one of the top attended discussions at conferences I help organize, and one of the first questions I get in the QA sessions at workshops I conduct. People want to understand the “right way” to version, when it my experience there is rarely ever a “right way” to version your APIs. There are commonly held practices regarding sensible ways to version your APIs, as well as dominant patterns for how you version APIs, but there isn’t any 100% solid answer to the question, despite what many folks might say. In my experience, the most commonly held approach to properly versioning your APIs (if you are going to), is to put the major and minor version in your header and / or combine it with content-type negotiation via your header. However, even with this knowledge being widely held, the most dominant pattern for versioning your APIs is sticking it in the URL of your API. I know many API providers who put the version in the header, despite many on their team fully being aware that it is something that should be put in the header. So, why is this? Why do people still do it the “wrong way”, even though then know how to do it the “right way”? I feel like this phenomenon reflects the wider API space, and how upside down many API belief systems are. People put the version in the URL because it is easier for them, and it is easier for their developers to understand. While headers are a native aspect of developing using the web, they are still very foreign and unknown to most developers. While this shows the lack of web literacy that is rampant amongst developers, it also demonstrates why simple web APIs have dominated the landscape–they are easy for a wide segment of developers to understand. An aspect of why this whole API thing has worked that many technologists overlook, and...[<a href="/2018/06/26/why-is-api-versioning-in-the-path-still-the-dominant-pattern/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>People love to hate in the API space. Ok, I guess its not exclusive to the API space, but it is a significant aspect of the community. I receive a regular amount of people hating on my work, for no reason at all. I also see people doing it to others in the API space on a regular basis. It always makes me sad to see, and have always worked to try to be as nice as I can to counteract the male negativity and competitive tone that often exists. While I feel bad for the people on the receiving end of all of this, I often times feel bad for the people on the giving end of things, as they are often not the most informed and up to speed folks, who seem to enjoy opening their mouth before they understand what is happening. One thing I notice regularly, is that these same people like to bash on is OpenAPI (fka Swagger). I regularly see people (still) say how bad of an idea it is, and how it has done nothing for the API space. One common thread I see with these folks, which prevents me from saying anything to them, is that it is clear they really don’t have an informed view of what OpenAPI is. Most people spend a few minutes looking it, maybe read a few blog posts, and then establish their opinions about what it is, or what it isn’t. I regularly find people who are using it as part of their work, and don’t actually understand the scope of the specification and tooling, so when someone is being vocal about it and doesn’t use actually it, it is usually pretty clear pretty quickly how uninformed they are about the specification, tooling, and scope of the community.

			<p><em>26 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to providing data, content, and even ML and AI models via APIs, having a public platform will become a competitive advantage. I know that many companies see it as giving away something, especially when your resources and business model are not defensible, but in reality having a publicly available, 24/7 operational, self-service solution will give you an edge over your more proprietary approaches to making resources available on the web. Sure, your competition will be able to often get in there without friction, but so will your customers–how many customers vs. competitors do you have? I know many companies believe in the power of a sales team to be able to squeeze every last penny out of would be customers, but a sales only approach leaves a significant amount of self-service revenue on the table. Throughout the course of our busy days, many IT decision makers just do not have the time for the phone calls and lunches involved with the traditional sales process. Sure, there are some IT decision makers who fill their schedule with these types of conversations, but there are a growing number who depend on self-service, SaaS approaches to getting business done on a daily basis–look at the growth of Amazon Web Services over the last decade if you need a reference point. If you think a public API platform involves giving away your intellectual property in 2018, you are severely behind the times on where the sector has been headed for about a decade. Far enough behind that you may not be able to play catch up at the speed in which things are shifting. A public portal, documentation, and other resources does not mean you are giving anything away. Even having a free tier doesn’t mean that you are giving away the farm. Modern API management solutions allow you to generate leads, let developers kick the tires, while also still being able to charge what the...[<a href="/2018/06/26/a-public-selfservice-api-platform-as-a-competitive-advantage/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>My friend James Higginbotham (@launchany) was sharing his frustration with being able to stay in tune with changes to a variety of APIs. Like me, James works to stay in tune with a variety of signals available via platforms like Twitter, Github, and other commonly used services. These platforms don’t always properly signal when things are updated, changed, or advanced, making it difficult to understand the granular changes that occur like likes, votes, edits, and other common events that occur via highly active platforms. This challenge is why the evolution towards a more event-driven approach to operating an API platform is not just more efficient, it gives users what they need. Using event-driven architectural approaches like Webhooks, and real times streams. This is one of the reasons I’m interested in what Streamdata.io does, beyond them helping support me financially, is that they allow me to focus on the event-driven shift that is occurring with many leading API providers, and needs to be brought to the attention of other platforms. Helping API providers be more efficient in what they are doing, while also meeting the needs of the most demanding customers like James and myself. It is easy to think Streamdata.io is just about streaming real time data. This is definitely a large aspect of what the SaaS solution does, but the approach to using Server-Sent Events (SSE), with incremental updates using JSON Patch adds another useful dimension when it comes to understanding what has changed. You can proxy an existing HTTP API that returns a JSON response using Streamdata.io, and the first response will look just like any other, but every pushed response after that will be a JSON Patch of just what has changed. Doing the heavy lifting of figuring out what has changed in each API response and only sending you the difference, and allowing you to focus only on what has changed, and not having to rely on timestamps, and other signals...[<a href="/2018/06/22/staying-informed-of-api-changes-using-streamdata-io/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’m fascinated by the dominating power of programming languages. There are many ideological forces at play in the technology sector, but the dogma that exists within each programming language community continues to amaze me. The potential absence of programming language dogma within the world of APIs is one of the reasons I feel it has been successful, but alas, other forms of dogma tends to creep in around specific API approaches and philosophies, making API evangelism and adoption always a challenge. The absence of programming languages in the API design, management, and testing discussion is why they have been so successful. People in these disciplines have ben focused on the language agnostic aspects of just doing business with APIs. It is also one of the reasons the API deployment conversation still is still so fragmented, with so many ways of getting things done. When it comes to API deployment, everyone likes to bring their programming language beliefs to the table, and let it affect how we actually deliver this API, and in my opinion, why API gateways have the potential to make a comeback, and even excel when it comes to playing the role of API intermediary, proxy, and gateway. Programming language dogma is why many groups have so much trouble going API first. They see APIs as code, and have trouble transcending the constraints of their development environment. I’ve seen many web or HTTP APIs called Java API, Python APIs, or reflect a specific language style. It is hard for developers to transcend their primary programming language, and learn multiple languages, or think in a language agnostic way. It is not easy for us to think out of our boxes, and consider external views, and empathize with people who operate within other programming or platform dimensions. It is just easier to see the world through our lenses, making the world of APIs either illogical, or something we need to bend to our way of...[<a href="/2018/06/21/working-to-keep-programming-language-dogma-at-edges-of-the-api-conversation/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>One thing I see a lot from API service providers who are selling their services to the API sector, is that once they find success servicing one stop along the API lifecycle, they often want to service other additional stops. I don’t have a problem with API service providers delivering across multiple stops along the API lifecycle, however I do caution of trying to expand across too many stops, and potentially doing any of them poorly, rather than partnering with other more specialized API service providers to help you focus on what you do best. I’m a big advocate for encouraging API providers to service one to five stops along the API lifecycle well, and then partner for helping deliver the rest of the stops. I know that all your investors are encouraging to take as many pieces of the puzzle as you possibly can, but there is more money in doing a handful of things really well, over doing many things poorly. Try to be an expert in a handful of specialized areas, over being a generalist. Then make sure your platform is as interoperable as possible, while investing in your partner program to attract the best of breed API service providers to your platform. This balance between focusing on a handful of stops and partnering is why I emphasize and study common approaches to delivering plugins. All platforms should invest in plugin infrastructure, to allow for extending their reach beyond the stops that a platform services. Feature creep, and platform bloat is a real challenge, especially when you have investors whispering in your ear to keep building, and a very vocal, but often long-tail group of users demanding solutions to their unique problems. Plugin and connector architecture is how you help manage this reality, and provide a relief valve for delivering too many features as part of your platform, while also bringing in potential partners who can help extend what your platforms in...[<a href="/2018/06/21/do-not-try-to-service-all-the-stops-along-the-api-lifecycle-as-an-api-service/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I spend a lot of time talking about the SalesForce API, using it as a reference for where the API evolution began 18 years ago, but it has been a long time since I’ve actually worked with the SalesForce API. Getting up and running with any API, especially iconic APIs that we all should be familiar with, is always an enlightening experience for me. Going from zero to understanding what is going on and actually achieving the API call(s) you want, is really what this game is all about. As part of some work I’m doing with Streamdata.io I needed to be able to add new leads into SalesForce, and I thought it would be a good time for me to get back into the saddle with the SalesForce REST API–so I volunteered to tackle the integration. The SalesForce API wasn’t as easy to get up and running as many simpler APIs I onboard with is, as the API docs isn’t as modern as I’d expect, and what you need is buried behind multiple clicks. Once you find what you are looking for, and click numerous times, you begin to get a feel for what is going on, and the object model in use becomes a little more accessible. In addition to finding what you need with the SalesForce REST API, you have to make sure you have a handle on the object structure and nuance of SalesForce itself. For this story, I am just working with one object–Leads. I’m using PHP to work with the API, and to begin I wanted to be able to get leads, to be able to see which leads I currently have in the system: I will add pagination, and other elements in the future. For now, I just wanted to be able to get the latest leads I have in the system to help with with some checks on what is being added.

			<p><em>18 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>This report summarizes Skylight’s evaluation of the VA’s public datasets, which exist within the va.gov web domain, as well as an analysis of what types of data representatives of the Veteran community expressed would be most useful and valuable to Veterans and their supporters if made more digitally accessible and available by the VA. This report also outlines potential resources that can be turned into application programming interfaces (APIs) as part of the VA’s Lighthouse platform initiative, and actions the VA should consider to move forward successfully. Landscape analysis The purpose APIs are the next evolution in the web, and shouldn’t be thought of as the latest tech trend or vendor solution. The first phase of the web was about delivering data and content to humans using a browser. The second phase of the web is about delivering that same data and content to other applications and algorithms using APIs. With that said, the purpose of this landscape analysis is, in effect, to assist the VA in evaluating the data and content that they’ve made available during the first phase of the web. This, in turn, will help set the stage for the VA to make smart investments in phase two of their web presence. The VA has already signaled they’re committed to investing in the second phase of their web presence with the announcement of the Lighthouse API platform initiative. Our landscape analysis will help ensure that the Lighthouse program is aware of what types of data and content that the VA has already identified as important to serving the Veteran community. This visibility will allow the Lighthouse program to bring these resources into alignment with the development and operation of their API platform. The process To help the VA evaluate the landscape that defines their web presence, we employed a “low-hanging-fruit” process that involved identifying the resources that exist across their web properties. That process relied on a spidering script, which we ran...[<a href="/2018/06/18/va-api-landscape-analysis-and-roadmapping-project-report/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>In my world, OpenAPI is always a primary actor, and the tooling and services that put it to work are always secondary. However, I’d say that 80% of the people I talk with are the opposite, putting OpenAPI tooling in a primary role, and the OpenAPI specification in a secondary role. This is the primary reason that many still see Swagger tooling as the value, and haven’t made the switch to the concept of OpenAPI, or understand the separation between the specification and the tooling. Another way in which you can see the importance of OpenAPI tooling is the slow migration of OpenAPI 2.0 to 3.0 users. Many folks I’ve talked to about OpenAPI 3.0 tell me that they haven’t made the jump because of the lack of tooling available for the specification. This isn’t always about the external services and tooling that supports OpenAPI 3.0, it is also about the internal tooling that supports it. It demonstrates the importance of tooling when it comes to the evolution, and adoption of OpenAPI. It demonstrates the need for the OAI community to keep investing in the development and evangelism of tooling for the latest version. I am going to work to invest more time into rounding up OpenAPI tooling, and getting to know the developers behind them, as I prepare APIStrat in Nashville, TN. I’m also going to invest in my own migration to OpenAPI 3.0. The reason I haven’t evolved isn’t because of lack tooling, it is because of a lack of time, and the cognitive load involved with thinking new ways. I fully grasp the differences between 2.0 and 3.0, but I just don’t have intuitive knowledge of 3.0 in the way I do for 2.0. I’ve spent hundreds of hours developing around 2.0, and I just don’t have the time in my schedule to make similar investment in 3.0–soon! If you need to get up to speed on the latest when it comes...[<a href="/2018/06/18/the-importance-of-openapi-tooling/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>After eight years of educating people about sensible API security and management, I’m always amazed at how many people I come across who still think public web APIs are about giving away access to your data, content, and algorithms for free. I regularly come across very smart people who say they’d be doing APIs, but they depend on revenue from selling their data and content, and wouldn’t benefit from just putting it online for everyone to download for free. I wonder when we stopped thinking the web was not about giving everything away for free? It is something I’m going to have to investigate a little more. For me, it shows how much education we still have ahead of us when it comes to informing people about what APIs are, and how to properly manage them. Which is a problem, when many of the companies I’m talking to are most likely doing APIs to drive internal systems, and public mobile applications. They are either unaware of the APIs that already exist across their organization, or think that because they don’t have a public developer portal showcasing their APIs, that they are much more private and secure than if they were openly offering them to partners and the public. Web API management has been around for over a decade now. Requiring ALL developers to authenticate when accessing any APIs, and the ability to put APIs into different access tiers, limit that the rate of consumption, while logging and billing for all API consumption isn’t anything new. Amazon has been extremely public about their AWS efforts, and the cloud isn’t a secret. The fact that smart business leaders see all of this and do not see that APIs are driving it all represents a disconnect amongst business leadership. It is something I’m going to be testing out a little bit more to see what levels of knowledge exist across many fortune 1000 companies, helping paint of picture...[<a href="/2018/06/08/people-still-think-apis-are-about-giving-away-your-data-for-free/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been evaluating API management providers, and this important stop along the API lifecycle in which they serve for eight years now. It is a space that I’m very familiar with, and have enjoyed watching it mature, evolve, and become something that is more standardized, and lately more commoditized. I’ve enjoyed watching the old guard (3Scale, Apigee, and Mashery) be acquired, and API management be baked into the cloud with AWS, Azure, and Google. I’ve also had fun learning about Kong, Tyk, and the next generation API management providers as they grow and evolve, as well as some of the older players like Axway as they work to retool so that they can compete and even lead the charge in the current environment. I am renewing efforts to study what each of the API management solutions provide, pushing forward my ongoing API management research, understanding what the current capacity of the active providers are, and potentially they are pushing forward the conversation. One of the things I’m extremely interested in learning more about is the connector, plugin, and extensibility opportunities that exist with each solution. Functionality that allows other 3rd party API service providers to inject their valuable services into the management layer of APIs, bringing other stops along the API lifecycle into management layer, allowing API providers to do more than just what their API management solution delivers. Turning the API management layer into much more than just authentication, service plan management, logging, analytics, and billing. Over the last year I’ve been working with API security provider ElasticBeam to help make sense of what is possible at the API management layer when it comes to securing our APIs. ElasticBeam can analyze the surface area of an API, as well as the DNS, web, API management, web server, and database logs for potential threats, and apply their machine learning models in real time. Without direct access at the API management layer, ElasticBeam is still valuable...[<a href="/2018/06/04/making-connections-at-the-api-management-layer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jun 2018</em></p>
			<p>
I’m kicking off a busy week of travel and talks this week in DC with a discussion about delivering microservices at federal agencies at DevNation Federal on Tuesday, June 5th, 2018. I was invited by Red Hat to come speak about the work I’m doing as API Evangelist across federal agencies. You can find me in the afternoon lineup, sharing my stories title “The Tech, Business, and Politics of APIs In Federal Government”. Focusing on information gathered as part of my research, workshops, and consulting across the public and private sector.

My talk reflects my work to motivate federal agencies to do APIs over the last five years, and help pollinate the ideas and practices I gather from across the private sector, and understand which ones will work in the public sphere. Not everything about doing APIs at startups and in the enterprise translates perfectly to delivering APIs in the federal government, but there are many practices that will help agencies better serve the people. My goal is to open up discussion with government employees and contractors, to help figure out what works and what doesn’t–sharing stories along the way.

Let me know if you are going to be at DevNation Federal let me know. I am happy to make some time to talk, and hear what you are up to with APIs. I depend on these hallway conversations to populate my blog with stories. I’ll be in town around noon, and there until around 5 or so until I head over to the DC API Meetup for my second talk of the day. Thanks to Red Hat for having me out. I enjoy doing talks for Red Hat events, as they tend to reflect more of the audience I’m looking for, with a focus on more open source, and a little less proprietary focus when it comes to delivering government technology. I’ll see you in Washington D.C. on Tuesday!

			<p>After I speak at DevNation Federal in Washington DC this Tuesday, I am going to give a similar talk at the DC API API User Group that evening. I love going to the Meetups in DC, partly because my good friend Gray Brooks runs the event, but also because I’ve been working to jumpstart API conversations in Washington DC since 2012 when I held the first DC edition of API Craft. I was on a mission to jumpstart API Craft gatherings around the country that year, and it makes me happy to see the API Meetup culture continuing to thrive in DC, where other places it has died out. At the DC API Meetup I’ll be giving a variation of my talk that I’m giving earlier that day at DevNation Federal. Talking about the technology, business, and politics of doing APIs, with an emphasis on a consistent and repeatable API lifecycle. I’ll be reworking my regular material in light of current projects I’m working on at the federal level including with the VA, FDIC, HHS, and beyond. Sharing stories about how a microservice approach can help make government services more agile, flexible, and delivered in smaller more bite sized chunks–helping move the IT conversation forward across federal agencies. If you can’t make it to DevNation Federal, I recommend you head out to the DC API User Group later that evening. I’d love to get a chance to hang out with you and talk about APIs. I’m always impressed with the folks who turn out for the DC API Meetup, consistently providing a fresh opportunity to discuss APIs and the impact they are making across the federal government. Organizer Gray Brooks has his finger on the pulse of what is going on across agencies, way beyond what I am capable of from the outside-in. I look forward to hanging out in DC, and hope you can make it out Tuesday to talk some APIs with me....[<a href="/2018/06/04/catch-me-at-the-dc-api-user-group-in-washington-dc-this-tuesday-evening/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I conducted an API workshop at Genscape in Boston yesterday. I thoroughly enjoyed the conversation with the technical folks there, and found their pragmatic, yet educated views on APIs refreshing. I spent the day going through the usual stops along the API lifecycle, but found some of our breakout conversations during the API design section to be what has stuck with me on my train ride back to New York. Specifically the discussions around versioning, content negotiation and the overall design of paths, parameters, and potentially providing query language layers on top of APIs. After going through much of my textbook API design patterns for paths, and parameters, then working my through content negotiation and headers, we kept finding ourselves talking about what their clients were capable of. Bringing the API design discussion back around to why REST is still dominate in my opinion–simplicity, and lowering the bar for consumers. Time after time we found ourselves talking about their target consumers, the spreadsheet wielding data analyst, and how the bar needed to be kept low to make sure their needs were being met. Sure, we can quickly get academic and theoretical with the design practices, but if they fall on deaf ears, and API consumers do not adopt and use the API-driven tools, does it matter? I know that all of us API “thawt liters” would rather folks just do things the right way, but this isn’t always the reality on the ground. Most people within real world businesses don’t have the time or luxury to learn the right way of doing things, and take the time to disrupt their flow with new ways of doing things. Most of the time we need to just get people the data and other resources they need, in the tooling they are comfortable with (spreadsheet cough cough), and get out of their way. Sure, we should still be introducing people to new concepts, and working to strike a...[<a href="/2018/05/31/when-the-right-api-solution-is-not-always-the-sensible-one/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>A question I get regularly in my API workshops is, “how should we be organizing all of our microservices?” To which I always recommend they tune into what the API Academy team is up to, and then I dance around give a long winded answer about how hard it is for me to answer that. I think in response, I’m going to start asking for a complete org chart for their operations, list of all their database schema, and a list of all their clients and the industries they are operating in. It will still be a journey for them, or me to answer that question, but maybe this response will help them understand the scope of what they are asking. I wish I could provide simple answers for folks when it came to how they should be naming, grouping, and organizing their microservices. I just don’t have enough knowledge about their organization, clients, and the domains in which they operate to provide a simple answer. It is another one of those API journeys an organization will have to embark on, and find their own way forward. It would take so much time for me to get to know an organization, its culture, resources, and how they are being put to use, I hesitate to even provide any advice, short of pointing them to what the API Academy team publishes books, and provides talks on. They are the only guidance I know that goes beyond the hyped of definition of microservices, and actually gets at the root of how you do it within specific domains, and tackle the cultural side of the conversation. A significant portion of my workshops lately have been about helping groups think about delivering services using a consistent API lifecycle, and showing them the potential for API governance if they can achieve this consistency.

			<p>I know, time flies and we are all very busy, but have you submitted your talk for APIStrat Nashville? The call for papers closes next Friday, June 8, 2018 at 11:59 PM PST! This is the second edition of the conference being run by the OpenAPI community, and is something you aren’t going to want to miss. We are bringing together the usual API community suspects, but also working to build upon the work that is going on in the fast growing OpenAPI community. The conference continues to be its usual voice of the API community, and won’t be all about the OpenAPI specification, but it it will definitely be where you want to be showcasing any groundbreaking work you are doing around the specification. The CFP process for APIStrat Nashville asks three main questions: How will the audience benefit from your presentation? Why should YOU be the one to give this talk? You have a unique story. Tell it. Be prepared to explain how this fits into the API ecosystem. After answering these questions we are looking for talks in the following areas of doing APIs: API Design, API For the Greater Good, API Management, API SDKs &amp; Clients, API Security, API Success Stories, API Transformations, API Testing, API Usability, At The Protocol Level, Digital Transformation, GraphQL, Hypermedia, Machine Learning, Microservices, REST, RPC systems, and Standards &amp; Definitions. However, don’t let these topics put you in a box. We want you to think about whatever you think will make the biggest impact on the audience, and hopefully the wider API community. Do not wait until the last moment to get your talk submitted! Last year, as the program chair I spoke with a number of people who had waited too long, and didn’t get their talk in front of the program committee early on. As soon as the submission are close they will begin spending time reviewing the talks, and while we may consider...[<a href="/2018/05/30/apistrat-nashville-call-for-papers-closes-at-the-end-of-next-week/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>
Most of this API stuff isn’t technical. For APIs to work at scale within a single company, a wider industry, or across government agencies, you need people who are committed to evangelism, coaching, and communication around everything that is occurring across API ecosystems. We often times get caught up in our work, and operating within our silos and forget to email, call, and just walk next door sometimes to share stories of what is going on. If you are a regular reader of my work you know how I feel about storytelling, and just how important it is to all of this working or not. Which is why I like to make sure that I showcase the storyelling of other evangelists who are working their magic, and spreading API knowledge within their domains.

I’m a big fan of what the GSA is up to with APIs across the federal government, and specifically what my hero Gray Brooks does to support API efforts acorss multiple federal agencies. He does a lot of legwork, but one thing that has stood out for me is his work to establish an API community of practice, and share relevant API stories on the US Government APIs Google Group. To help highlight what he is up to, and hep amplify the knowledge he puts out there, I wanted to share his latest post from the Google Group in it’s entirety because it is, well, beautiful.

			<p>I’m kicking off a micro-procurement project with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) this week. I’m going to to be conducting one of my API low hanging fruit campaigns for them, where I help them identify the best possible data sets available across their public websites for turning into APIs. The project is one of many small projects the federal agency is putting out there to begin working on their agency wide API platform they are calling Lighthouse. Laying the groundwork for better serving veterans through a robust stack of microservices that each do one thing really well, but can be used in concert to deliver the applications the agency needs to meet their mission. While not specifically a project to develop a microservice. The landscape analysis project is an API focused research project, that is testing a new procurement model called microprocurement. At my government consulting agency partnership Skylight Digital, my partner in crime Chris Cairns has been pushing for a shift in how government tackles technology projects, pushing them to do in smaller chunks that essentially can be put on the credit card in less than 10K increments. So far we’ve been doing consulting, research, and training related projects like how to create a bug bounty program, and internal evangelism strategies. Now we are kicking our campaign into high gear and pushing more agencies to think about microprocurement for microservices–the VA was the first agency to buy into this new way of thinking about how government IT gets delivered. I am working with all of my partners to help me craft potential services that would fit into the definition of a microprocurement project. I’ve been working to educate people about the process so that more API experts are on hand to respond when agencies publish microprocurement RFPs on Github like the VA did, but I also want to make sure and have a suite of microprocurement packages that federal agencies can choose from...[<a href="/2018/05/29/a-microprocurement-package-for-api-monitoring-and-testing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was on a call for a federal government API platform project with my partner in crime Chris Cairns (@cscairns) of Skylight.Digital. We were back channeling in our Slack channel during the call, when he said, “I always imagine you participating in these things, finding topics you haven’t covered or emphasized from a certain angle, and then writing a blog post in real time.” He was right, I had taken notes on a couple of new angles regarding the testing, monitoring, and understanding performance of APIs involved with federal government projects. The single conference call resulted in about seven potential stories in my notebook. I’m guessing that only four of them will actually end up being published. However, the conversation does a good job at highlighting my style for generating stories on the blog, which is something that allows me to publish 3-5 posts a day–keeping things as active as I possibly can, generating traffic, and bringing attention to my work. If you’ve ever worked closely with me, you know that I can turn anything into a story, even a story like this, about how I create stories. ;-) Think of API Evangelist as my public workbench where I work through the projects I’m tackling each day. It is how I make sense of my research, the projects I am working on, and the conversations I am having. All of which generates SEO exhaust, which brings more attention to my work, extends its reach, and ultimately brings in more work. It is a cycle that helps me work through my ideas in a way that forces me to make them more coherent (hopefully) along the way, while also making them immediately available to my partners, customers, and readers. Chris has been pushing this concept forward and advocating that we be public with as many of the Skylight.Digital responses and proposals as we possibly can, which resulted in me publishing both of our responses to the...[<a href="/2018/05/16/every-moment-is-potentially-an-api-story/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I have been intrigued by the people who reached out after I published a story about my partner program. One of the companies that reached out was the API integration agency Bridge Software, who reflects the next generation of software development groups who are emerging to focus exclusively on API integration. I’ve had several calls with the Bridge Software team this week, discussing the possible ways in which we can work together. I’m regularly in need of software development resources that I can refer projects to, and I’m also interested in hearing more interesting stories about how businesses are integrating with APIs. Of course, Bridge Software is looking for more customers, which is something I can definitely help with. So we started brainstorming more about how they can regularly feed me stories that I can develop into posts for API Evangelist, and I can help send new business their way. One of the most valuable resources I possess as the API Evangelist, is access to real world stories from the trenches of API providers and integrators. These sources of stories have been the bread and butter for API Evangelist for eight years. I have depended on the stories that businesses share with me to generate the 3,276 posts I have published on the blog since 2010. So I am stoked to have a new source of fresh stories, from a team who is neck deep in API integrations each day, and will be actively gathering stories from their regular developer team meetings. I’m looking forward to working with the Bridge Software team, and getting new stories from the API integration trenches. I’m also looking forward to assisting them with finding new customers, and helping them with deliver on their API integration needs. If you are looking for help with API integrations, Bridge Software has a pretty sophisticated approach to delivering integrations that has test driven development at its core.

			<p><em>15 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been on five separate government reflated projects lately where finding modular OpenAPI-driven open source tooling has been a top priority. All of these projects are microservice-focused and OpenAPI-driven, and are investing significant amounts of time looking open source tools that will help with design governance, monitoring, testing, and security, and interact with the Jenkins pipeline. Helping government agencies find success as their API journey picks up speed, and the number of APIs grows exponentially. Selling to the federal government can be a long journey in itself. They can’t always use the SaaS solutions many of us fire up to get the job done in our startup or enterprise lives. Increasingly government agencies are depending on open source solutions to help them move projects forward. Every agency I’m working with is using OpenAPI (Swagger) to drive their API lifecycle. While not all have gone design (define) first, they are using them as the contract for mocking, documentation, testing, monitoring, and security. The teams I’m working with are investing a lot of energy looking for, vetting, and testing out different open source modules on Github–with varying degrees of success. Ideally, there was an OpenAPI-driven marketplace, or federated set of marketplaces like OpenAPI.Tools. I’ve had one for a while, but haven’t kept up to date–I will invest some time / resources into it soon. My definition of an OpenAPI tool marketplace would be that it is OpenAPI-driven, and open source. I’m fine with there being other marketplaces of OpenAPI-driven services, but I want a way to get at just the actively maintained open source tools. When it comes to serving government this is an important, and meaningful distinction. I’d also like to encourage many of the project owners to ensure there is CI/CD integration, as well as make sure their projects are actively supported, and they are willing to entertain commercial implementations.

			<p><em>15 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) has an open call for help to test the new FedBizOpps API. Setting a pretty compelling precedent for releasing APIs in the federal government, slowly bringing federal agencies out of their shell, and moving the API conversation forward in government. Hopefully it will be something that other federal agencies, and other levels of government will consider as they move forward on their API journeys. It is good to see federal agencies reaching out to ask for help in making sure APIs are well designed, deliver value, and operate as expected. In my experience, most government agencies are gun-shy when it comes to seeking outside help, and accepting criticism when it comes to their work. The GSA is definitely the most progressive on this front, but they are leading by example, showing other agencies what is possible, and something that hopefully will spread. Something I am always keen to support with my storytelling here on API Evangelist. One thing I’d caution federal agencies on when seeking outside feedback in this area, is to be mindful of fatigue in the private sector when it comes to working for free. API providers have been encouraging developers to document, test, develop code libraries, and other essential aspects of operating APIs for years now, and many developers are growing weary of this exploitation by companies who can afford to pay, but choose not to. While it is good that government is getting on the API bandwagon here, but be aware that you are about 5+ years behind, and the tides are shifting. I’d recommend thinking about how micro-procurement models emerging at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and other agencies can be applied to testing, performance, security, and other needs agencies will have. Think about how you can create $500, $1,000, and other opportunities for professional testers to make money. Of course, you are going to have to establish a way of vetting developers, but...[<a href="/2018/05/15/general-services-administration-gsa-needs-help-testing-their-fedbizopps-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m working to define APIs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on several fronts right now. I’ve provided not just one, but two detailed reponses to their Lighthouse API platform RFIs. Additionally, I’m providing guidance to different teams who are working on a variety of projects occurring simultaneously to serve veterans who receive support from the agency. As I do this work, I am hyper aware of the privatization machinations of the current administration, and the potential for APIs to serve these desires. APIs aren’t good, bad, nor are they neutral. APIs reflect the desires of their owners, and the good or bad they can inflict is determined by their consumers. Because APIs are so abstract, and are often buried within web and mobile applications, it can be difficult to see what they are truly doing on a day to day basis. This is why we have API management solutions in place to help paint a picture of activity in real time, but as we’ve seen with the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica, it requires the API provider to be paying attention, and to possess incentives that ensure they will actually care about paying attention, and responding to negative events. By re-defining existing VA internal systems as APIs, we are opening up the possibility that digital resources can be extracted, and transferred externally. Of course, if these systems remain the sources of data, VA power and control can be retained, but it also opens up the possibilities for power to eventually be transferred externally–reversing the polarities of government power and putting it into private hands. Depending on your politics, this could be good, or it could be bad. Personally, I’m a fan of a balance being struck, allowing government to do what it does best, and allowing private, commercial entities to help fuel and participate in what is happening–both with proper oversight. This reflects the potential benefits APIs can bring, but this good isn’t present...[<a href="/2018/05/15/cautiously-aware-of-how-apis-can-be-used-to-feed-government-privatization/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’ve had a huge demand for putting on API seminars for a variety of enterprise groups lately. Helping bring my API 101, history, lifecycle, and governance knowledge to the table. I’ve conducted seminars in the UK and France in April, and have more in Virginia, Massachusetts, and California in May. I’ve been working with a variety of companies, institutions, and government agencies to plan even more internal seminars, which is something that is proving to be challenging for some groups who are just getting started on their API journey. While groups are keen on me coming visit to share my API knowledge, some of them are having trouble getting me through legal, get me into their payment systems, and making everyone’s schedules work. Some of them don’t have a problem figuring it out, while others are facing significant amounts of bureaucracy and friction due to the size, complexity, and legacy of their organizations. To help simplify the process for organizations to participate in my seminars I am going to begin planning a rolling schedule of seminars beginning in New York City. Every two weeks, on Tuesday and Wednesday I’ll be planning to do a 2-day API lifecycle seminars in NYC. I’m going to be focusing on delivering 12 stops along the API lifecycle, targeting my readers and customers who have already embarked on their API journey: Day One: Definition - The basics of OpenAPI, Postman, and using Github to manage API definitions. Design - Entry level API design, including touching on API governance and guidance. Deployment - Looking at the big world of how APIs can deployed on-premise, and the clouds. Virtualization - Understanding mocking, and API, as well as data virtualization. Authentication - Thinking about the common patterns of authentication for API consumption. Management - Covering the services, tools, and approaches to managing APIs in operation. Discussion - Open discussion about anything covered throughout the day, and beyond.

			<p><em>14 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been evaluating microservices at scale, using their OpenAPI definitions to provide API design guidance to each team using Github. I just finished a round of work where I took 20 microservices, and evaluated each OpenAPI definition individually, and made design suggestions via an updated OpenAPI definition that I submitted as a Github issue. I was going to submit as a pull request, but I really want the API design guidance to be a suggestions, as well as a learning experience, so I didn’t want them to feel like they had to merge all my suggestions. After going through all 20 OpenAPI definitions, I took all of them and dumped them into a single local repository where I was running Jekyll via localhost. Then using Liquid I created a handful of web pages for looking at the APIs across all microservices in a single page–publishing two separate reports: API Paths - An alphabetical list of the APIs for all 20 services, listing the paths, verbs, parameters, and headers in a single bulleted list for evaluation. API Schema - An alphabetical list of the APIs for all 20 services, listing the schema definitions, properties, descriptions, and types in a single bulleted list for evaluation. While each service lives in its own Github repository, and operates independently of each other, I wanted to see them all together, to be able to evaluate their purpose and design patterns from the 100K level. I wanted to see if there was any redundancy in purpose, and if any services overlapped in functionality, as well as trying to see the potential when all API resources were laid out on a single page. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees when working with microservices, and publishing everything as a single document helps flatten things out, and is the equivalent of climbing to the top of the local mountain to get a better view of things.

			<p>I’m a big fan of API sandboxes, labs, and other virtualization environments. API sandboxes should be default in heavily regulated industries like banking. I also support the virtualization of schema and data used across API operations, like I am doing at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), with synthetic healthcare data. I’m very interested in anything that moves forward the API virtualization conversation, so I found the live sporting API simulations over at SportRadar very interesting. SportRadar’s “live simulations give you the opportunity to test your code against a simulation of live data before the preseason starts or any time! Our simulation system replays select completed games allowing you to view our API feeds as if they were happening live.” Here are the details of their NFL Official API simulations that run every day: 11:00 am - Data is reset for the day’s simulations. 1:00 pm - PST week 1 games will run – Oakland at Houston, Detroit at Seattle, Miami at Pittsburgh, and New York at Green Bay 2:00 pm – PST week 2 games will run - Seattle at Atlanta, Houston at New England, Green Bay at Dallas, and Pittsburgh at Kansas City 3:00 pm – PST week 3 games will run – Green Bay at Atlanta and Pittsburgh at New England 4:00 pm – PST week 4 games will run – New England vs Atlanta Providing a pretty compelling evolution in the concept API virtualization when it comes to event data, or data that will happen on a schedule. I wanted to write up this story to make sure I bookmarked this as part of my API virtualization research. If I don’t write about it, it doesn’t happen. As I’m working to include API sandboxes, lab environments, and other API virtualization approaches in my consulting, I’m keen to add new dimensions like API simulation, which provide great material for workshops, presentations, and talks.

			<p>I’ve written about how the startup community has driven the value exchange that occurs at the API management layer down a two lane road with API monetizatin and plans. To generate the value that investors have been looking for, we have ended up with a free, pro, enterprise approach to measuring value exchanged with API integration, when in reality there is so much more going on here. Something that really becomes evident when you begin evaluating the API conversations going on across government at all levels. In conversation after conversation I have with government API folk I hear that they don’t need API management reporting, analysis, and billing features. There is a perception that government isn’t selling access to APIs, so API management measurement isn’t really needed. Missing out on a huge opportunity to be measuring, analyzing, and reporting upon API usage, and requiring a huge amount of re-education on my part to help API providers within government to understand how they need to be measuring value exchange at the API management level. Honestly, I’d love to see government agencies actually invoicing API consumers at all levels for their usage. Even if the invoices aren’t in dollars. Measuring API usage, reporting, quantifying, and sending an invoice for usage each month would help bring awareness to how government digital resources are being put to use (or not). If all data, content, and algorithms in use across federal, state, and municipal government were available via APIs, then measured, rate limited, and reported upon across all internal, partner, and public consumers–the awareness around the value of government digital assets would increase significantly. I’m not saying we should charge for all access to government data. I’m saying we should be measuring and reporting upon all access to government data. The APIs, and a modern API management layer is how you do this.

			<p>I checked out the Github repositories for twenty microservices of one of my clients recently, looking understand what is being accomplished across all these services as they work independently to accomplish a single collective objective. I’m being contracted with to help come in blindly and provide feedback on the design of the APIs being exposed across services, and help provide guidance on their API lifecycle, as well as eventually API governance when things have matured to that level. Right now we are addressing pretty fundamental definition and design issues, but eventually we’ll hopefully graduate to the next level. A complete and up to date README for each microservice is essential to understanding what is going on with a service, and a robust OpenAPI definition is critical to breaking down the details of what each API delivers. When you aren’t part of each service’s development team it can be difficult to understand what each service does, but with an up to date README and OpenAPI, you can get up to speed pretty quickly. If an service is well documented via its README, and the API is well designed, and the surface area is reflected in it’s OpenAPI, you can go from not knowing what a service does to, understanding its value within hopefully minutes, not hours. When each service possesses an OpenAPI it becomes possible to evaluate what they deliver at scale. You can take all APIs, their paths, headers, parameters, and schema and out them in different ways so that you can begin to paint a picture of what they deliver in aggregate. Bringing all the disparate services back together to perform together in a sort of monolith concert, while still acknowledging they all do their own thing independently. Allowing us to look at how many different service can be used in concert to deliver a single application, or potentially a variety of application instances.

			<p><em>10 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>The topic of API discovery has been picking up momentum in 2018. It is something I’ve worked on for years, but with the number of microservices emerging out there, it is something I’m seeing become a concern amongst providers. It is also something I’m seeing more potential vendor chatter, looking to provide more services and tooling to help alleviate API discovery pain. Even with all this movement, there is still a lot of education and discussion to occur on the subject to help bring people up to speed on what is API discovery. The most common view of what is API discovery, is when you need to find an API for developing an application. You have a need for a resource in your application, and you need to look across your internal and partner resources to find what you are looking for. Beyond that, you will need to search for publicly available API resources, using Google, Github, ProgrammableWeb, and other common ways to find popular APIs. This is definitely the most prominent perspective when it comes to API discovery, but it isn’t the only dimension of this problem. There are several dimensions to this stop along the API lifecycle, that I’d like to flesh out further, so that I can better articulate across conversations I am having. Another area that gets lumped in with API discovery is the concept of service discovery, or how your APIs will find their backend services that they use to make the magic happen. Service discovery focuses on the initial discovery, connectivity, routing, and circuit breaker patterns involved with making sure an API is able to communicate with any service it depends on. With the growth of microservices there are a number of solutions like Consul that have emerged, and cloud providers like AWS are evolving their own service discovery mechanisms. Providing one dimension to the API discovery conversation, but different from, and often confused with front-end API discovery and...[<a href="/2018/05/10/api-discovery-is-for-internal-or-external-services/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The more I study where the API management, gateway, and proxy layer is headed, the less I’m seeing a front-end or a backend, I’m seeing just a node. A node that can connect to existing databases, or what is traditionally considered a backend system, but also can just as easily proxy and be a gateway to any existing API. A lot has been talked about when it comes to API gateways deploying APIs from an existing database. There has also been considerable discussion around proxying existing internal APIs or web services, so that we can deploy newer APIs. However, I don’t think there has been near as much discussion around proxying other 3rd party public APIs–which flips the backend and frontend discuss on its head for me. After profiling the connector and plugin marketplaces for a handful of the leading API management providers I am seeing a number of API deployment opportunities for Twilio, Twitter, SendGrid, etc. Allowing API providers to publish API facades for commonly used public APIs, and obfuscate away the 3rd party provider, and make the API your own. Allowing providers to build a stack of APIs from existing backend systems, private APIs and services, as well as 3rd party public APIs. Shifting gateways and proxies from being API deployment and management gatekeepers for backend systems, to being nodes of connectivity for any system, service, and API that you can get your hand on. Changing how we think about designing, deploying, and managing APIs at scale. I feel like this conversation is why API deployment is such a hard thing to discuss. It can mean so many different things, and be accomplished in so many ways. It can be driven by a databases, or strictly using code, or be just taking an existing API and turning it into something new. I don’t think it is something that is well understood amongst developer circles, let alone in the business world.

			<p>I was in a conference session about an API design tool today, and someone asked if you could get at the OpenAPI definition behind the solution. They said yes, but quickly also said that the definition is boring and that you don’t want to be in there, you want to be in the interface. I get that service providers want you to focus on their interface, but we shouldn’t be burying, or abstracting away the API contract for APIs, we should always be educating people about it, an bringing it front and center in any service, tooling, or conversation. Technology folks burying or devaluing the OpenAPI definition with business users is common, but I also see technology folks doing it to each other. Reducing OpenAPI to be just another machine readable artifact alongside other components of delivering API infrastructure today. I think this begins with people not understanding what OpenAPI is, but I think it is sustained by people’s view of what is technological magic and should remain in the hands of the wizards, and what should be accessible to a wider audience. If you limit who has access and knowledge, you can usually maintain a higher level of control, so they use your interface in the case of a vendor, or they come to you develop and build an API in the case of a developer. There is nothing in a YAML OpenAPI definition that business users won’t be able to understand. OpenAPIs aren’t anymore boring than a Word document or Spreadsheet. If you are a stakeholder in the service, you should be able to read, understand, and engage with the OpenAPI contract. If we teach people to be afraid of the OpenAPI definitions we are repeating the past, and maintaining the canyon that can exist between business and IT/Developer groups. If you are in the business of burying the OpenAPI definition, I’m guessing you don’t understand the portable API lifecycle potential of this...[<a href="/2018/05/08/making-the-openapi-contract-friendlier-for-developers-and-business/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve had a few API groups contact me lately regarding the challenges they are facing when it comes to supporting organizational, or industry-wide API definitions and schema. They were eager to support common definitions and schema that have been standardized, but were getting frustrated by not being able to do everything they wanted, and having to live within the constraints introduced by the standardized definitions. Which is something that doesn’t get much discussion by those of use who are advocating for standardization of APIs and schema. Web APIs Come With Their Own Constraints We all want more developers to use our APIs. However, with more usage, comes more responsibility. Also, to get more usage our APIs need to speak to a wider audience, something that common API definitions and schema will help with. This is why web APIs are working, because they speak to a wider audience, however with this architectural decision we are making some tradeoffs, and accepting some constraints in how we do our APIs. This is why REST is just one tool in our toolbox, so we can use the right tool, establish the right set of constraints, to allow our APIs to be successful. The wider our API toolbox, the wider the number options we will have available when it comes to how we design our APIs, and what schema we can employ Allowing For Content Negotiation By Consumers One way I’ve encouraged folks to help alleviate some of the pain around the adoption of common API definitions and schema is to provide content negotiation to consumers, allowing them to obtain the response they are looking for. If people want the standardized approaches they can choose those, and if they want something more precise, or custom they can choose that. This also allows API providers to work around the API standards that have become bottlenecks, while still supporting them where they matter. Having the best of both worlds, where you are...[<a href="/2018/05/08/constraints-introduced-by-supporting-standardized-api-definitions-and-schema/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m always fascinated by the API design debate, and how many entrenched positions there are when it comes to the right way of doing it. Personally, I don’t see any right way of doing it, I just see many different ways to put the responsibility on the provider or the consumer shoulders, or sharing the load between them. I spend a lot of time profiling APIs, crafting OpenAPI definitions that try to capture 100% of the surface area of an API. Something that is pretty difficult to do when you aren’t the provider, and you are just working from existing static documentation. It is just hard to find every parameter and potential value, exhaustively detailing what is possible when you use an API. When designing APIs I tend to lean towards exposing the surface area of an API in the path. This is my personal preference for when I’m using an API, but I also do this to try and make APIs more accessible to non-developers. However, I regularly get folks who freak out at how many API paths I have, preferring to have the complexity at the parameter level. This conversation continues with the GraphQL and other query language folks who prefer to craft more complex queries that can be passed in the body, to define exactly what is desired. I do not feel there is a right way of doing this, but it does reflect what I said early about balancing the load between provider and consumer. The burden for defining and designing the surface area of an API resides in the providers court–only the provider truly knows the entire surface area. Then I’d add that when you offload the responsibility to the consumer using GraphQL, you are limiting who will be able to craft a query, putting API access beyond the reach of business users, and many developers. I feel that exposing the surface area of an API in the URL makes...[<a href="/2018/05/08/api-design-either-the-provider-does-the-work-or-the-consumer-will-have-to/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 May 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m turning different APIs into topical streams using Streamdata.io. I have been profiling hundreds of different APIs as part of my work to build out the Streamdata.io API Gallery, and as I’m creating OpenAPI definitions for each API, I’m realizing the potential for event and topical driven streams across many existing web APIs. One thing I am doing after profiling each API is that I benchmark them to see how often the data changes, applying what we are calling StreamRank to each API path. Then I try to make sure all the parameters, and even enum values for each parameter are represented for each API definition, helping me see the ENTIRE surface area of an API. Which is something that really illuminates the possibilities surrounding each API. After profiling the Stack Exchange Questions API, I began to see how much functionality and data is buried within a single API endpoint, and was something I wanted to expose and make much easier to access. Taking a single OpenAPI definition for the Stack Exchange Questions API: Then exploding it into 25 separate tech topic streaming APIs. Taking the top 25 enum value for the tags parameter for the Stack Overflow site, and exploding into 25 separate streaming API resources. To do this, I’m taking each OpenAPI definition, and generating an AsyncAPI definition to represent each possible stream: I’m not 100% sure I’m properly generating the AsyncAPI currently, as I’m still learning about how to use the topics and streams collections properly. However, the OpenAPI definition above is meant to represent the web API resource, and the AsyncAPI definition is meant to represent the streaming edition of the same resource. Something that can be replicated for any tag, or any site that is available via the Stack Exchange API. Turning the existing Stack Exchange API into streaming topic APIs, that people can subscribe to only the topics they are interested in receiving updates. At this point I’m just...[<a href="/2018/05/07/turning-the-stack-exchange-questions-api-into-25-separate-tech-topic-streaming/">Read More</a>]</p>
