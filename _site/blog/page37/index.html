        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-enterprise.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I would say the enterprise space fleet has successfully shifted their course, heading in the general direction of everything API. SAP, Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, and the rest of the usual suspects have pledged their faith to APIs, mobile, and IoT, all in a very public way. For those of us who jumped off the SOA bandwagon a while back (getting on the API bandwagon, yeehaw), this can be amusing to watch, cause the API bandwagon is better y'know?. ;-)</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that these large companies can make a shift towards an API way of life, or a microservice devops way of operating, or whatever the cool enterprise kids are calling it these days. Some companies will find success in these areas, while many, many others will just talk about it, and buy a wide range of vendor services that will help them talk about it&mdash;there will be a lot of money to be made (and spent).</p>
<p>The thing I fear, is that many of the core principles of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">why this whole thing is working</a> will go right over the heads of many technologies and business leaders in the enterprise. Elements like simplicity, transparency, openness, and functioning in a decoupled, decentralized way. You are the enterprise, many of the essential ingredients of API, are just fundamentally at odds with what you are. You are a big, complex, powerful, and political corporate presence&mdash;a beast that does not like being taken apart, reinvented over and over, and being forced to work in concert with other internal, partner, and public resources, in an open way.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that some enterprise entities won&rsquo;t be successful&mdash;some will. I will be carefully watching the waves of enterprise organizations, for these tech savvy few, who internalize the core philosophy around APIs, successfully uploading their corporate soul to the API singularity. However, I predict I will have to work very hard to find these companies amidst the wreckage of the enterprise organizations that make the same mistakes they did with SOA, because APIs are just not compatible with their DNA, and ultimately will be rejected for reasons that are more enterprise than they are API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm immersed in deep thoughts about the implications of machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collections,</a> which are being applied to APIs, in some very different, but overlapping, and complementary ways. Currently I&rsquo;m working to define the overlap between APIs.json and Postman Collections, and how they work together.</p>
<p>For me, any good API starts with a Swagger definition, or API Blueprint, which is the single, machine readable truth of what is the surface area of any API, which I consider fingerprint for what is possible with any API or micro service. Additionally when I am working with any API, or stack of APIs, I am using APis.json to organize them into a single coherent set of APIs, then rely on each APIs properties to point to essential resources like Swagger, terms of service, pricing, and anything else I feel is essential to operations.</p>
<p>In addition to providing links to Swagger definitions for each APIs.json API entry, I&rsquo;m also experimenting with adding a property that point to any Postman Collection for each API, and microservice.  I&rsquo;ll start by just calling the type &ldquo;x-postman-collection&rdquo;, and provide a URL to a Postman Collection I&rsquo;ve generated around the API call, providing a link between what an API is, and a measurement of the transaction an API produces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that Swagger is the promise of value an API delivers, and Postman is a machine readable representation of the value, ready for execution&mdash;which acts as machine readable unit you can then load into Postman, or any other system, and actually experience the result. When this unit is sitting in your Postman client, you can see the value behind a single collection, but when you see a couple hundred of these collections in your Postman, you start seeing the important role they can play in the overall API economy, as portable a unit of measurement for API transactions.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-feedback-loop.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you are following some of my recent stories, I&rsquo;m heavily focused on <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, as <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">I work to organize my own stack of microservices</a>, using APIs.son and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. I&rsquo;m working hard to define additional, machine readable layers to my microservices index that answer as many of the questions that I have about the microservices and APIs that I depend on.</p>
<p>The first machine readable definition I include in any <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">APIs.json collection</a> I&rsquo;m building is Swagger, which provides a JSON or YAML definition of the surface area for any microservice or API that I depend on. The second thing I put to work for my own APIs, is <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, which provides a JSON definition for the licensing of my APIs. Beyond that I&rsquo;m pushing forward a couple of other machine readable definitions, that help me make sense of not just a handful of APIs in my own collections, but potentially thousands of APIs in the public space.</p>
<p>I just published two potential new machine readable definitions to add to my stack of APIs.json properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">api-pricing</a></strong> - My quest to understand the API pricing across the API space, from providers like Amazon to Twilio, there are some healthy patterns to follow when crafting API pricing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">api-questions</a></strong> - My realization that nobody would give a shit about a machine readable terms of service, so I created a simple JSON list of questions and answers that can be applied to APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are two areas that I am trying to better understand, as I build my machine readable index of the APIs, that I call <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, which also helps fuel <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Another area I&rsquo;m struggling to get a handle on, is the message layer around APIs, and more widely what I&rsquo;d consider the feedback look around APIs. So, what the heck do I mean by this? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure it out in real-time--which is why I'm writing this post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an API is one of my internal APIs, the messaging, communication, and feedback loop starts with issue management in Github. Each API has its own Github repo as its home base, and any communication around its design, deployment, and management, happens there. However there may be other references to the API made on Twitter, Stack Overflow, or other channel, and I am looking for a way to aggregate them all in a single machine readable away, that is connected to the API.</p>
<p>To do this, I&rsquo;m employing the same approach I&rsquo;m using to get a handle on pricing, and other questions I have around API operations, and creating a new APIs.json API property type, which I&rsquo;m going to call <span style="text-decoration: underline;">api-conversations</span>. Right now I&rsquo;m just going to include message entries for Github issues, but work to make as inclusive as I can, to include any possible channel. We&rsquo;ll see where I go with api-conversations, right now I&rsquo;m going to use it to manage the feedback loop within my own microservices stack, but then I&rsquo;m also going to apply to the API Stack, and see what it looks like when I try and aggregate the feedback loop around public APIs.</p>

<p>I've said it before, and I will say it again &mdash; <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">Excel and spreadsheets</a>&nbsp;will continue to be super critical for the growth of the API industry. There are an increasing number of solutions like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark for deploying and managing APIs using spreadsheets</a>, something that will get easier over time, but so far I'm not seeing equal acknowledgment of the potential of Microsoft Excel as an API client.</p>
<p>The majority of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and CSV files. Something I learned during my short time in Washington DC, is that the API community is going to have to court the legions of data stewards who spend their days in spreadsheets at the companies, and government agencies around the world, if we are going to be successful. The tooling for deploying APIs from spreadsheets has emerged, but we have a lot of work ahead to make them simpler and easier to use.</p>
<p>With the majority of the worlds data locked up in spreadsheets, this also means many of the business decision makers have their head in the spreadsheet on a daily basis, depending on the data, calculations, and visualizations that influence their daily decision-making. I&rsquo;m seeing only light efforts around delivering API driven services in the spreadsheet, something that is going to have to grow significantly before the API industry can reach the scale we would like.</p>
<p>I know that the spreadsheet does not excite API providers, and API integrators, but they are a comfortable tool for many of the business ranks, and if we are going to get them to buy into API economy, and play nicely, we are going to have to accommodate their world. When thinking of spreadsheets and APIs, don't just think delivering content and data to APIs, but also how APIs can deliver vital content and data back to spreadsheets users&mdash;acknowledging the ubiquitous tool can provide huge benefits as an API client, as well as data source.</p>

<p>My API hero of the day is <a href="https://twitter.com/adelevie">Alan deLevie</a> (@adelevie) over at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. I was tweeting out my story "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/going-beyond-excel-as-a-data-source-for-api-deployment-and-focusing-on-it-as-an-api-client/">Going Beyond Excel As A Data Source For API Deployment And Focusing On It As An API Client</a>&rdquo; today, and he tweeted me back his <a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83">slick usage of the ImportXML function to get Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Electronic Comment Filing System data into a Google Spreadsheet.</a></p>
<p>When you visit&nbsp;<a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83">ecfa.link</a>, and scroll to the bottom of the page you will see simple instructions on how to get the data into your Google Spreadsheet:</p>
<p><a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ecfs-link-google-spreadsheet-importxml.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>This is what we need more of, something that should be default for all data APIs. There are some other RSS, JSON, and XML goodies on the page too, but that is another story. Providing a simple copy / paste option for taking API driven data and making available in Google Spreadsheets is what I'd consider fundamental building block, getting us towards what I talk about in my post. Spreadsheet users need a wealth of simple, copy and paste resources like this that they can tap, from both public, and private data sources.</p>
<p>You rock Alan! I think his approach to providing a copy / paste ImportXML standard should be standard for all data APIs. We can start simple, by building a library of simple data sources like cities, states, postal codes, but then graduate up to more advanced data sources, or even subscriptions to valuable, curated, premium data--the trick is going to be keeping it as dead simple as Alan made it.</p>
<p>I will have to think about adding the ImportXML copy / paste as a standard building block, along with RSS, XML, and JSON. It feeds nicely into my <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com">wider spreadsheet and API research</a> nicely. Thanks Alan for this story, keep up good work!</p>

<p>I use many types of APIs. Some are public APIs, operated by other people, and then there are the APIs I have designed, operate, and consume on my own. As I design, redesign, deploy, and manage my APIs, I'm in a fortunate place that I get to push the boundaries of API operations, without much of the friction of normal API platforms. I'm the only one providing and consuming many of my APIs, essentially running an API dictatorship.</p>
<p>Over time I have built quite a few APIs that are still up, active, but nobody is using them. I have built them during some specific research, or to support a prototype, which once I was done with core work, I do not need the API to actually be alive and running. At some point in the future when I revisit the research, I may want to fire back up the APIs, but for now its ok if they are down, with a dormant Docker image, and server-side code living within its requisite Github repo.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how I&rsquo;m building APIs that could possibly go away at anytime. It is an area that, as I think about more, the more use cases I come up with. It is helping me rethink some of my architecture, and workflow. Another potential approach I am contemplating involves having a single UI that may use one or many APIs, but those APIs aren't even live until I load the screen&mdash;which triggers the containerized deployment of the last known snapshot of each of the dependent microservices.</p>
<p>If nothing else I&rsquo;m having fun. I&rsquo;m not sure if all these scenarios are viable in the real world, but it makes for an interesting exercise, and provides me with a kind of fire drill approach to my workflow that lets me rethink my APIs, and the workflow around them, with each drill. For me, it shines a whole new light on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">the old APIs can go away at any time, no wait you have to support them forever argument</a>. Docker and containerized deployment of my APIs are really warping how I see the services I depend on&mdash;fun, fun!</p>

<p>I was listening the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsâUncensored podcast last weekend</a>, where Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>), and Lorinda Brandon (<a href="/admin/blog/lindybrandon">@lindybrandon</a>) sat down for a conversation with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>), the creator of API definition format Swagger. There are a lot of interesting API informational nuggets throughout the podcast, some of which I'll be writing about, but this one is about something Tony mentioned&mdash;called <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#vendorExtensions">Swagger vendor extensions</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using Swagger for a while, and specifically Swagger 2.0 since its release, and Swagger vendor extensions was new thing to me&mdash;most likly user error. I don't ever sweat things I miss, because I consume so much information each day, things are bound to get past me. Anyways, Swagger vendor extensions are simply the ability to add any property to an API definition by using the &ldquo;x-&ldquo; prefix&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is something we do with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as well, and is something that I think becomes the R&amp;D layer for any specification. Since I just learned about this ability, I do not have many examples of what has been done with these extensions.<a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/tutorial_using_apigee_127_to_build_apis_in_nodejs_swagger_20"> I found a post from Apigee</a> demonstrating how you can add "capabilities such as caching, quota, OAuth, and analytics to your API with Swagger vendor extensions via a <a href="https://github.com/apigee-127/volos)">project we call Volos.js</a>&rdquo;, and I came across <a href="http://rest.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/v1/?spec">Wikimedia using a "x-subspecs&rdquo; in the API definition for Wikipedia</a>&mdash;now that I&rsquo;m tracking on Swagger vendor extensions I will look for them in Swagger specs I come across.</p>
<p>I've come across blog posts about Swagger, where people outline how they don&rsquo;t use it because they can&rsquo;t define something they want. Maybe they just didn't know about Swagger vendor extensions like me, IDK. Regardless I will be tracking on how people are extending Swagger using the vendor extensions, and begin brainstorming some of my own ideas on how they can be used to craft exactly the API definition you need.</p>

<p>I am revisiting some work that I started when I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow(PIF). Actually there are several things going on here, a sort of perfect storm of API design thoughts. After reviewing hundreds of APIs, including APIs in the federal government, you start to want to either go mad, or start making changes to the API designs you are exposed to.</p>
<p>This leads me to the other layer to this story, a common question I get regularly, regarding <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/02/using-machine-readable-api-definitions-to-solve-a-persistent-question-are-there-any-write-apis-in-federal-government/">whether or not there are any write APIs in the federal government</a>&mdash;meaning, can you POST, or PUT to a common government resources. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">Write APIs are important in government</a>, and their scarcity reflect some of the systemic illnesses I feel exists in government IT. With that in mind, bundled with the regular process of reviewing an API implementation out of government&mdash;you get this late night API Evangelist story. Enjoy. ;-)</p>
<p>I was profiling the <a href="https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest">data.usajobs.gov jobs API</a>, which included crafting a machine readable Swagger API definition:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7bccc3d914aae35003a0.js"></script>
<p>After crafting this machine readable definition of the surface area of data.usajobs.gov, I am once again reminded of the lack of write APIs in government--as the data.usajobs.gov API is GET only, which only provides a single search endpoint. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I am thankful for the work they&rsquo;ve done with the data.usajobs.gov jobs API, it is just my nature to study, then push and iterate on API designs anywhere I possibly can. Sorry, I have an addiction. ;-(</p>
<p>As I was profiling data.usajobs.gov, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/25/github-can-be-the-post-and-put-layer-for-federal-government-apis/">I remembered of the work I did as a PIF in DC, and how after the government shutdown, I wanted to see more APIs, have an augmented layer to their operations</a>&mdash;eliminating the ability to turn off the switch for government APIs. Meaning I would like read only APIs like data.usajobs.gov to have one or many other APIs that sync, and augment API functionality, beyond what the original government agency intended. It may sound radical, but I think it is how we are going to get this stuff done.</p>
<p>To help understand what I&rsquo;m talking about, I generated a basic evolution of the data.usajobs.gov jobs API design, allowing for potential POST, PUT, and DELETE capabilities, opening up the federal jobs API for community input:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/b5100f01f293cad858ea.js"></script>
<p>Of course, this API isn&rsquo;t a real API--It is just a Swagger representation of one possible API that could exist to augment the read only API provided by data.usajobs.gov. My goal is to just think through how we might be able to help iterate on existing API resources being provided by government agencies. Allowing for extending, building upon, and potentially crowdsourced assistance in the management public data. I&rsquo;m not saying this should be a fully open API, available to anyone, but the idea of a well managed, or possibly multiple well managed resources for the same public data is an interesting thought.</p>
<p>This approach would allow for the evolution of public data, beyond what the government can do on its own. External entities could build upon government data, like the jobs data from data.usajobs.gov, and then data.usajobs.gov could decide if any 3rd party resources becomes worthy of paying attention to. I&rsquo;m thinking about applying this type of model in other areas of government I am working through like with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/15/free-application-for-federal-student-aid-fafsa-api/">FAFSA API</a>, and some of the API efforts I&rsquo;m seeing out of Department of Interior and Department of Energy.</p>
<p>In the end this post is primarily about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform-/">potential in augmenting existing read only APIs, with an external POST, PUT, and DELETE</a>. I&rsquo;m not saying the data.usajobs.gov jobs API needs this, it just happen to be the API I was profiling when this story came up, and it seemed as good of an API as any to leverage as part of this story.</p>
<p>Not much else will happen for me on this topic. I am not going to develop this API. <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">I just wanted to add the data.usajobs.gov job API to my federal API stack,</a> and along the way I got sidetracked with adding the POST, PUT, and DELETE layer of this story--damn ADD! ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find a couple of other federal government data sources to possibly push this idea forward, and eventually I&rsquo;d like to see a single API, developed on top of a government resources, surpass its original source in quality, and value, resulting in the original agency accepting the data back into their interanal systems. When it comes to data stewardship, open data, and APIs in government it is all about trust&mdash;without trust, any external, outside-in effort around open data and APis in the federal government, will be rejected.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/10/frontline-systems-rason-modeling-language-and-rest-api-make-advanced-analytics-easy-in-web-and-mobile-applications/">an interesting piece of technology today while doing new curation for API.Report</a>. <a href="https://rason.com/">RASON</a>,&nbsp;an interesting approach to API driven analytics and potential UI and visualization, that kind of resembles what I have been envisioning for one possible future. The analytics tool is created by a company called Frontline Systems, and I&rsquo;ll let them articulate what it is:</p>
<blockquote><em>RASON&trade; software is designed to make it much easier to create, test and deploy analytic models that use optimization, simulation, and data mining. RASON stands for Restful Analytic Solver&trade; Object Notation.</em></blockquote>
<p>RASON targets analytical professionals, excel power users, and web app developers, but here is where it gets over my head, "Problems you can solve with the RASON service include linear programming and mixed-integer programming problems, quadratic programming and second-order cone problems, nonlinear and global optimization problems, problems requiring genetic algorithm and tabu search methods -- from small to very large." &mdash; sounds impressive to me!</p>
<p>I signed up and played with RASON a little bit, but it wasn't as intuitive as I hoped. I think I have a little more to learn about RASON. <a href="https://rason.com/Home/About#rason_models">The RASON models are very cool, I like the airport hub</a>, I just don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge to make it work right now, however I&rsquo;m digging the idea, and it reflects what I&rsquo;ve been seeing in my head when it comes to defining <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com">API driven analysis</a>--when you connecting that with <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com">API generated visualizations</a>, <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a>, <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com">spreadsheets</a>, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a>, and more&mdash;I start to get a little too excited.</p>
<p>Anyhoo. Just sharing a new technology that I found. Once I learn more about RASON, hopefully I will be able to see where RASON fits into the bigger API life-cycle, and share a little more.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/alps-io-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was watching an <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/api-craft/mSFq__019ik">open thread around ALPS over at API Craft</a>, something that is on my working list to better understand, apply more in my world, and tell the story all along the way. ALPS author, and API visionary (;-) Mike Amundsen (<a href="/admin/blog/mamund">@mamund</a>) responded to the thread with a nice overview, which I wantd to repost and share with you.</p>
<p>So, what is <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>?</p>
<ul>
<li>ALPS is not a runtime format like HTML or HAL</li>
<li>ALPS is not a designtime format like RAML or Swagger</li>
</ul>
<p>ALPS is a Profile format for describing the bounded context of a service.  ALPS can be used as source material for designtime formats like RAML, WADL, Swagger, WSDL, etc. on the server side.</p>
<p>ALPS can also be used as source material for client-side frameworks like Ember.js, Angular, etc on the client side.</p>
<p>ALPS describes the operations (actions) and data elements of a service. that's all. that description is the same no matter the designtime tooling, protocol, or message format used. that description is the same whether you are implementing code on the client-side or server-side.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Hence state is maintained SERVER SIDE by mapping the URL's when it is implemented... correct?"</em></blockquote>
<p>ALPS has nothing to say about how or where state is maintained. You can do whatever you wish when you implement the bounded context ALPS describes.</p>
<p>ALPS tells you the WHAT of the service, not the HOW.</p>
<p>For example, you can use the ALPS document to implement a services that employs your API Chaining on the server side. Or you can use the same ALPS document to implement a classic hypermedia-driven service using Cj or some other hypermedia-rich format. You can also use the same ALPS document to implement a simple JSON-object CRUD-style service.</p>
<p>When you use ALPS as the "shared bounded context" you can be confident that each of the services, regardless of their local implementation choices are supporting the same bounded context. this is especially handy when you want to provide the same operations using different implementations (e.g. JSON-object CRUD for mobile, HTML for browser, etc.).</p>

<p>There are lots of good visualization stories recently, or maybe I&rsquo;m more focused on API driven visualizations. Who knows? This particular post is an API story because <a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a>, the company at the center is using APIs to accomplish their &ldquo;vision&rdquo;, not because they have an API&mdash;which actually would be a nice way to pay it forward, but that is another story. Regardless, I think what <a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a> is up to, is interesting on a lot of levels, bur primarily because in coming years we need to be able to better understand this new, cloud-based world we are  creating for ourselves.</p>
<p>Why am I blogging about this? Because Mohiomap is driven with APIs, and if done right, it can make a big difference in how we see our virtual selves, whether the business or brand personas we are crafting online, or our personal self that is spread across Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, and other API driven platforms. We currently can easily see our personas within each silo, like Facebook profile, Twitter profile, or Github profile, but understanding ourselves across the places we frequent online is much more difficult&mdash;something only possible when you begin using APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a visualization research project on my radar for some time now, but I think its time that I start publishing it for everyone to enjoy. API driven visualization is an important layer to my overall API economy research, and whether its for the meta layer of APIs, or for the valuable resources they are serving up, like wall posts, messages, photos, videos, or business documents--visualizations will continue to drive how we evolve our understanding of the digital world that is unfolding at a breakneck speed.</p>
<p>With the addition of Mohiomap, I&rsquo;m starting to develop quite a list of API driven visualization services and tooling. Enough to warrant its own research area, and be given a certain amount of attention each week. Ultimately it will depend on what the community delivers, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that visualizations will dominate the stories here on API Evangelist for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>As I look through more APIs, and I don&rsquo;t just play around in their developer portal, and look at documentation, I am actually get my hands dirty generating Swagger definitions, and authenticating and making calls to an API. There is no better way to get to know an API, that generating a Swagger definition, and integrating with it&mdash;something when done, you always walk away with a new perspective.</p>
<p>Once I get more of the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">APIs profiled in my API Stack</a>, I&rsquo;m going to see if I can configure my API editor to let me iterate on other people&rsquo;s API designs a little bit. As an API consumer, you don&rsquo;t always get a voice in the design of the next version of an API, but with API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, you can actually make edits, and then share them back with a provider. Of course it is still up to a provider to decide on what they accept, but there is not better way to make suggestions than a machine readable API definition, that is ready to go.</p>
<p>When I get around to doing some housecleaning on these API designs I generated, and possibly make some design iterations, I&rsquo;ll focus on some of the smaller operations, leaving the bigger teams to do their own heavy lifting. Also, my goal isn&rsquo;t just to iterate on API designs to help the original provider improve on their design, my goal is to iterative and improve on the API designs in my stack. The more designs I play with, more designs I have in my library, and the more I get a feel for what I think API designs could, or should look like.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fix all the APIs in the world, but I can improve on the hard work that has already occurred, and who knows, maybe some providers will see it for the compliment that it is, and listen to some of my API designing that is occurring out loud.</p>

<p>While processing the news today over at <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, I came across a <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/10/broadcom-open-switch-apis-drive-innovation-in-network-infrastructure/">story about Broadcom delivering an API for managing their latest network infrastructure</a>. The intersection of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Application Programming Interface (API) is something I&rsquo;m paying closer attention to lately. Hmmm. SDN + API = Brand New Bullshit Acronym? Meh. Onward, I just can&rsquo;t slow down to care--{"packet keep moving"}.</p>
<p>At the networking level, I&rsquo;m hearing <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom</a> making a classic API infrastructure argument, "With the OpenNSL software platform, Broadcom is publishing APIs that map Broadcom's Software Development Kit (SDK) to an open north bound interface, enabling the integration of new applications and the ability to optimize switch hardware platforms.&rdquo;, with examples of what you could build including "network monitoring, load balancing, service chaining, workload optimization and traffic engineering."</p>
<p>This new API driven approach to networking is available in the Broadcom Tomahawk and Trident II switches, looking to build up a developer community who can help deliver networking solutions, with Broadcom interested in giving, "users the freedom to control their technology, share their designs and boost application innovation.&rdquo; Everything Broadcom is up to is in alignment with other valid Internet of Things (IoT) efforts I&rsquo;m seeing across not just the networking arena, but almost any other physical object being connected to the Internet in 2015.</p>
<p>I think what Broadcom is doing, is very forward leaning effort, and providing native API support at the device level is definitely how you support &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; around your networking infrastructure. To keep in sync with the leading edge of the current API evolution as I'm seeing it, I would also recommend adding virtualized container support at the device level. As a developer I am thankful for the APIs that you are exposing, allowing me to develop custom solutions using your hardware, but I need you to take it one level further--I need to be able to deploy my own APIs using Docker, as well as working with your APIs, all running on your infrastructure.</p>
<p>I need your devices to support not just the web and mobile apps I will build around your around your hardware, and the API surface area you are providing with the new Tomahawk and Trident II switches, I need to also plugin my own microservice stack, and the microservices that vendors will be delivering to me. I need the next generation of switches to be API driven, but I also need to guarantee it is exactly the stack I need to achieve my networking objectives.</p>
<p>That concludes my intrusion into your road-map. I appreciate you even entertaining my ideas. I cannot share much more details on what I intend to do with your new SDN &amp; API driven goodness, but if you work with me to let me innovate on your virtual and physical API stack&mdash;I feel that you will be surprised with what what the overall community around your hardware will deliver.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of private APIs, and all for keeping API access tailored to meaningful groups of users vs. just opening up data to the public, without first thinking critically about the possible pros and cons. With that said, I always encourage API providers to seriously consider the outside-in effect, when APIs are designed to be as accessible as possible, allowing unintended things to occur around your API resources.</p>
<p>It isn't just about the developers who are directly working with your API, it is also the entire API industry, and service providers that serve it. A number of companies exist across the API space, providing valuable products, services, and tooling that is derived from one or many API platforms. The API space is big enough now, it isn't just about the handful of strongest players, it is about the entire community.</p>
<p>An example of this is with <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API ChangeLog</a>, a monitoring service for API documentation. The API ChangeLog keeps an eye on 68 of the leading APIs, and tracks on whether or not they have updated their API documentation, and keeps developers informed of the changes. These types of services benefit both API providers, and consumers, making for a healthier space overall. While some API provider are good at keeping developers in tune with documentation changes, not all of us are able keep up, and sometimes developers just aren't tuned in, and the API ChangeLog helps fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Without outside access to API resources (like your docs), services like API ChangeLog do not exist, leaving developers to fend for themselves, and not providing valuable industry data that can be used by anyone. Services like API ChangeLog will be the lifeblood of the API economy, and provide valuable exhaust that informs API driven markets as they grow, and help give these markets som e of the positive forces they are so well known for.</p>
<p>Keep your APIs, and much of their supporting building blocks as accessible as possible, and while you are at it, <a href="http://apisjson.org">make sure and index them using APIs.json</a>, helping services like <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API ChangeLog</a> provide vital data to developers, and the wider API economy.</p>

<p>A short, concise, portable description of what your API does, is one of the most critical building blocks of API management, and is essential to reducing friction when new users are on-boarding with any API. It can be easy to design, and populate your API developer portal from a perspective that is very much in the know. I do it all the time, structuring your portal to reach the widest possible audience can be hard&mdash;it is why I&rsquo;m here! ;-)</p>
<p>Here is a great example of providing all the right elements, but leaving out the essential detail that new API consumers will need. View the <a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/">Dailymotion developer area</a>, land on home page, and without clicking, tell me what Dailymotion does.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/dailymotion-dev-portal-screenshot.png" alt="" width="98%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The portal has all the right moves, except it neglects to say anything about videos, or show a video picture. I guess you could argue that anyone landing here will probably be getting there via the main Dailymotion site, with the proper knowledge of what is going on. This is probably true, but there will always be people landing on the API developer portal page, without any clue of what Dailymotion does&mdash;do not make them click to find out.</p>
<p>This really isn&rsquo;t that big of a mistake, and something that only someone like me, who looks at numerous developer portals would think about. For Dailymotion, all they have to do is update the FMA area, put video in the title, short description, and maybe include as an image in the background. Boom, within seconds everyone understands the value offered by Dailymotion in 2 seconds or less.</p>
<p>The description you provide on your API portal landing page is your first impression, make it count. It is also likely, that the press, bloggers, and  other 3rd parties will copy / paste the description to describe what you do, on remote websites&mdash;so make it good!</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <div style="background-color:#ff4c4c; width:100%; height: 40px; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><p align="center"><strong>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a></strong></p></div>

<p>This is the third week in a row I've managed to do this weekly report, something that took me about 9 hours of work, so I can see that the amount of work will vary pretty dramatically each week. Doesn't matter, I'm in for the long haul now, butI'm guessing Monday morning is going to be the common release date, as I start wrapping up on Saturday, but often can't do all the heavy lifting until Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>You don't often see me lead into a story with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accounting</span></strong>, but Xero is pushing forward with their world domination plan, worthy of highlighting:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xero.com/blog/2015/03/new-zealand-payroll/">Introducing New Zealand Payroll in Xero</a> - Xero is definitely the one to watch, with their expansion.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.xero.com/blog/2015/03/uk-payroll/">Introducing UK Payroll in Xero</a> - I think I will have to do an account API roundup, profile the strongest players, and get a better handle on this.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>There were a number of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>acquisitions</strong></span>, that were worth enough of showcasing this week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.report/2015/03/06/ibm-acquires-alchemyapi-enhancing-watsons-deep-learning-capabilities/">IBM Acquires AlchemyAPI, Enhancing Watson's Deep Learning Capabilities</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/03/04/ibm-acquires-alchemyapi/">IBM Acquires AlchemyAPI</a> - IBM has been beating their API drum lately, and the Watson team has been a significant portion of this drumbeat--interesting to see them making API related acquisitions. I use AlchemyAPI, so this impacts me.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-powers-up-watson-with-alchemyapi-acquisition/">IBM powers up Watson with AlchemyAPI acquisition</a> - Mentioned already, but I always like to include one outside view in the conversation.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.docker.com/2015/03/socketplane-excited-to-be-joining-docker-to-collaborate-with-networking-ecosystem/">SocketPlane Excited to Be Joining Docker to Collaborate with Networking Ecosystem</a> - This is an interesting move by Docker. Networking related API and container related stories seem to be popping up more. Usually they are just SDN API stories, but this acquisition is an interesting sign of whats to come.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/03/box-buys-subspace-to-court-more-risk-averse-clients/">Box buys small security startup to court more risk-averse clients</a> - Using security acquisitions to boost your street cred is a worthy investment in the current landscape. You can just do it, but buying a company to add to stack, sends a good message to your consumers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OrgsyncBlog/~3/iLYd6GFA1Mg/orgsync_is_acquired_by_imodules">OrgSync Acquired by iModules Software</a> - An interesting education related acquisition. I will have to learn more about iModules, and keep an eye on what they are doing in the higher education constituent management API space.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2015/press-030215.html">Akamai Acquires Xerocole</a> - Like security, DNS related investments are wise. Especially if your doing things at Internet scale like Akamai.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/02/paypal-acquires-paydiant-puts-nfc-into-its-here-readers/">PayPal acquires Paydiant, puts NFC into its Here readers</a> - At some point I will have to connect the dots on all the payment space moves, lots of action. Almost too much to keep track of.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advertising</strong></span> is not something usually here, but at the intersection of gaming, I'm a little more interested:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.amazon.com/post/TxRVIU79H0XNDZ/Get-Started-with-the-Amazon-Mobile-Ads-API-in-Your-iOS-App-or-Game">Get Started with the Amazon Mobile Ads API in Your iOS App or Game</a> - I will have to do more research on how big the mobile advertising space is, and see what portion of that is gaming. I'm not usually big on paying attention to advertising, but monetization for a vertical like gaming is interesting enough to track on.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am working to pull together <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>analytics</strong></span> specific research project over the next week. It is one of those areas I'm carving off of data:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2015/03/lightning-components-analytics-api.html">Build Reporting Apps Using Lightning Components and the Salesforce Analytics API</a> - I'd like to see more stories about building dynamic reporting solutions from API providers. There is a lot of opportunity to build simple tools for end-users here.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/04/what-is-the-digital-analytics-program-dap/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=what-is-the-digital-analytics-program-dap">What is the Digital Analytics Program (DAP)?</a> - I got a sneak peek of this in action while i was working in Washington DC. I think this type of analytics in aggregate across government, institutions and other aspects of our public world makes sense. I'd like to see APIs that provide access to anyone looking to better understand how government operates (or doesn't).&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2015/03/02/google-launches-player-analytics-and-custom-native-ads-tools-for-gaming-developers/">Google launches Player Analytics and custom native ads tools for game developers</a> - More gaming news. At some point I'm going to start a gaming research site, as I see more API, and API adjacent stories in this space.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am moving <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API definitions</span></strong> out of the API design realm, where I can showcase the benefits of machine readable formats:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_product_highlight_video_smartdocs">Apigee Product Highlight Video: SmartDocs</a> - I thought was an introducing highlight of SmartDocs on the Apigee platform, or as I call them interactive docs. I like seeing how each of the API providers view the benefits of machine readable API definitions like Swagger--Apigee is definitely invested in Swagger.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are my thoughts on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API deployment</strong></span> for the week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/we-need-an-open-library-of-the-most-common-utility-api-implementations">We Need An Open Library Of The Most Common Utility API Implementations &middot;</a> - This seems like a no brainer to me. Someone should step up and build a platform to house these, and figure out some way of generating revenue around this, in a way that you can offer the open source designs for free. Maybe premium services, or custom deployments could be enough to pay for it? It is another area that if someone doesn't step up I may start creating and publishing to a Github repo.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Some interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API design</strong></span> discussions this week, from the pragmatic, to the restafarian:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">Making Sure My API Roundup Stories Are Machine Readable By Designing Them As APIs.json Collections &middot;</a> - A look into how I'm using APIs.json to build collections of APIs. As I research specific areas of the industry, I am trying to create these machine readable definitions, that eventually can turn into something so much more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/post-effyouthisistherighturl-restful-api-design/">POST /eff/you/this/is/the/right/url &ndash; RESTful API Design</a> - I love creative, pragmatic stories on API design. This one made me laugh, and definitely made me reflect on some of the whacky shit I do when it comes to API design, and you know, that is ok!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/dropbox-sparks-controversy-api-design-decision/analysis/2015/03/03">Dropbox Sparks Controversy With API Design Decision</a> - I really do not get all worked up about design decisions like this. Whatever. It is their choice, as long as they communicate it out effectively, it doesn't really change the game to much. I prefer to just showcase the decisions API designers make, and why, and let you decide the best path forward for you.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/my-api-design-research">My API Design Research</a> - Rewriting the home page for my API research, while I spend some time pondering what is the current state, and what might be next for my work in this area.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/02/meta-design-the-intersection-of-art-design-and-computation.html">Meta-design: The intersection of art, design, and computation - O'Reilly Radar</a> - This is way beyond API, but of course is where my mind went as I was reading. Some really interesting concepts to weave into API design practice here.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps-01">Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS)</a> - Shit is getting real for ALPS. I keep meaning to add it to my wheelhouse of API design knowledge, but haven't had the time. Looks I better prioritize, as they are getting real with it.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://nordicapis.com/common-cases-when-using-soap-makes-sense/">Common Cases When Using SOAP Makes Sense</a> - It is ok to use SOAP, especially if you work with the enterprise, or take showers every day like I do! ;-)&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://evertpot.com/dropbox-post-api/">Dropbox starts using POST, and why this is poor API design.</a> - While I may not have an opinion directly about this, I do love hearing what everyone else has to say.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As usual, I'm leading the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API discovery</strong></span> conversation:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/a-breakdown-of-my-dream-apisjson-file/">A Breakdown Of My Dream APIs.json File &middot;</a> - It could happen! If I believe hard enough, or maybe work hard enough and create enough APIs.json for other people to reach the tipping point.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/three-ways-i-am-putting-apisjson-to-work/">Three Ways I Am Putting APIs.json To Work &middot;</a> - Some thoughts from a conversation I had this week about APIs.json. I thought I articulated it simply enough, to share as blog post and make part of my regular storytelling repertoire.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/02/using-machine-readable-api-definitions-to-solve-a-persistent-question-are-there-any-write-apis-in-federal-government/">Using Machine Readable API Definitions To Solve A Persistent Question: Are There Any Write APIs In Federal Government? &middot;</a> - Taking a question I get regularly and show how with a little hard work, and the APIs.json format we can provide real-time answer, that will keep on giving.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A handful of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API evangelism</strong></span> discussions throughout the week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-promoting-developer-ecosystem-strengthens-api/analysis/2015/03/06">How Promoting a Developer Ecosystem Strengthens an API</a> - Great story from Mark over at PW.

</ul>
</div>
<p>The event season is warming up, with lots of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API events</strong></span> to attend:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>I predict <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API integration</strong></span> conversation will keep dominating the landscape:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/sharing-http-requests">Sharing HTTP Requests Publicly or Privately When You Need Help Debugging an API Call</a> - I'm really digging how Runscope is opening up this layer of API integration, and making it more conversational and social.

This is music to my ears, as I'm spending a lot of time defining my API stack as Postman Collections, and it is reassuring to know there is sync now.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2015/02/27/why-api-monitoring-matters-to-every-business/">Why API Monitoring Matters To Every Business</a> - Not a big fan of linking to Forbes articles (cause their shitty ads), but an interesting story about my API homie John Musser.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Lots to learn in the area of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API management</strong></span> this week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.postmarkapp.com/post/112888047898/a-little-care-package-for-php-developers#_=_">A Little Care Package for PHP Developers</a> - A pretty straightforward code library story, which I usually do not share as part of weekly update, but I like well told stories, that show API providers care about their devs.&nbsp;</li>

I'm using 3Scale to drive the base definition, as I use them for my own infrastructure.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://keenio.tumblr.com/post/112649338271/a-note-about-rate-limits#_=_">A note about rate limits</a> - A nice, transparent look into API rate limits over at Keen.io. I love it when platforms break down their limits, and the logic that goes into that. It goes a long way to building trust.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2015/03/03/top-20-intuit-developer-questions">Top 20 Intuit Developer Questions</a> - I like the idea of doing a top X FAQ blog post regularly. As an API provider you should also have a dedicated FAQ page, but grabbing the top questions, and publishing on the blog regularly can help get the word out!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am hoping that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API podcasts</strong></span> that have emerged keep it up, and new one's continue to emerge:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apisuncensored.io/">APIs Uncensored</a> - Another episode from SmartBear on their APIs Uncensored podcast. They had Tony Tam over from Swagger, for a very interesting conversation.&nbsp;</li>

<li><a href="http://www.wspa.com/story/28256240/online-billing-service-hiveage-launches-a-comprehensive-api">Online Billing Service Hiveage Launches a Comprehensive API</a> - Anice online billing API that I profiled this week. You won't find me showcasing new APIs too often, only when they are clean, well done efforts, that are worthy of profiling and learning more.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>One area I will profile deeper in coming weeks is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>calendaring</strong></span>:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/liquidspace-api-connects-workspaces-calendars-systems-and-services/2015/03/06">LiquidSpace API Connects Workspaces with Calendars, Systems, and Services</a> - Definitely a service I will dive in and learn more about.

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-journey.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Tony Hirst (<a href="https://twitter.com/psychemedia">@psychemedia</a>) wrote an interesting story about what I would consider <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the API journey</span>, which he called, &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2015/03/09/whats-the-point-of-an-api/">What&rsquo;s The Point Of An API?</a>&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m the first to call bullshit on the term API, which is more storytelling magic than it ever was technical, for me. In my opinion, the point of an API is rarely ever the actual technical implementation&mdash;sorry devs. ;-( The point of the API is the journey, for the API provider, and the API consumer (both dev and end-user).</p>
<p>The point of the API is about the API provider reducing friction, when it comes to understanding, and put to work, valuable digital assets from data, content, to more programmatic, algorithmic elements like image filtering or video encoding, to more physical elements like a Nest thermostat, webcam access, or drone controls. An API does not automatically equal success, it take so much more than just launching an API to establish something that delivers value, and is sustainable--something that can be easier said than done, in todays volatile, digital environment.</p>
<p>The point of an API is about the API consumers having the freedom to discover, access, explore, and put to use valuable digital resources that they couldn&rsquo;t deliver on their own, in new and interesting ways. Developers need to be part of a feedback loop with API providers that helps iterate APIs, and evolve APIs towards being more experience based beyond their resource oriented roots, and integrate them in meaningful ways into the systems, apps, and devices end-users depend on the most.</p>
<p>The point of an API is about empowering the end-user with applications that deliver value, all while opening up as much of the backend, and the pipes that are delivering valuable API driven resources, giving end-users a voice throughout the supply chain, using open formats like oAuth&mdash;bringing much needed transparency to the process. This isn&rsquo;t just about tech, it is also about developing sustainable businesses built around applications that are truly deliver value, which along a way also protect the interests, security, and privacy of the end-user.</p>
<p>The API is not purely the technical elements, it is made up of the technical, business, and political building blocks, which includes the documentation, SDK, terms of service, pricing, and the many other essential aspects of API operations. APIs are definitely made up of the API projections into the users environment, and back-again, facilitating a real-time journey, that if done right, can benefit the API platform, developers who build upon it, and the end-users who ultimately define what the point of any API is.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dancing.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm adding a new layer to my monitoring of the API space, what I consider to be the people layer of the API Evangelist network--the actual people who are executing on much of what I talk about, across my research, and storytelling. This is all born out of the network of people I already talk to regularly, to get the stories, and details for the research that I publish regularly.</p>
<p>I have been tracking on many of the doers of the space for a while, behind the scenes, and this is just about exposing a select handful of individuals who can help you with some of the areas I discuss in my research and storytelling.</p>
<p>Up until now, my research has been about showcasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>News </li>
<li>Companies </li>
<li>Tools </li>
</ul>
<p>All I&rsquo;m doing now is exposing some of the people who are doing interesting things as well, and are open to being contacted about their work, and discuss how you can potentially tap their expertise to help you achieve your API objectives. Over the next couple weeks, you will see me start listing individuals who are open to helping out in the core areas I research:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Design</li>
<li>API Deployment</li>
<li>API Management</li>
<li>API Discovery</li>
<li>API Integration</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>API Monetization</li>
<li>API Security</li>
</ul>
<p>I already showcase companies in many of these areas, and track on the features, or building blocks employed to deliver products and services they offer, all I&rsquo;m going to do now is provide more information on individuals who can help execute in these areas as well. Along the way you will also find me showcasing specific companies and tooling as well--API Evangelist partners like 3Scale, WSO2, and Restlet, but also other products I&rsquo;m personally invested in like APIs.json, and the companies, and tools I use daily like Swagger, API Blueprint, APITools, API Science, and Runscope.</p>
<p>After five years of doing this, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/scaling-what-i-do-at-api-evangelist/">I&rsquo;m trying to understand what scale looks like for API Evangelist</a>. My objective is to keep funding my research, producing the short form (blog), and long form (guides, white papers, and blueprints), while keeping it all rooted in what the leading API providers, and ultimately the people behind them are doing on the ground. With this in mind, you will find more areas of my research, providing links to people actually doing these things in the field, and you will also hear more about the conversations I am having with these people as they execute their craft.</p>
<p>As always, if you, or your company is doing something interesting in these areas, let me know&mdash;if you are an individual looking to freelance in these ares, or build a consultancy delivering services in these areas, let me know. I can&rsquo;t guarantee I&rsquo;ll include you in my research, but if you are doing interesting things, you&rsquo;ll stand out, and I&rsquo;m sure I can find some way to showcase your work in a way that helps you, me, and the wider API space. Also, if you need help with a project in one of these areas, feel free to reach out, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to point you in the right direction.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you are an API developer, it is likely you have used <a href="http://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP">Postman</a>, the simple tool for building, testing, and documenting your APIs. I have <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop">Postman open as a Google Chrome App</a>, which allows me to make API calls as I&rsquo;m designing, developing, and integrating with the APIs across my world. Something which opens up the response and requests of API calls that I&rsquo;m making, giving me more insight into how things are actually working (or not).</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">key aspects of Postman, are the collections</a>, which:</p>
<blockquote><em>A collection lets you group individual requests together. These requests can be further organized into sub-collections/folders to completely mirror your API. Requests can also store variations and responses when saved in a collection. You can add metadata like name and description too so that all the information that a developer needs to use your API is available right where he(she) needs it. Collections are listed in the sidebar alphabetically. You can search through collection requests using the search form for quick access.</em></blockquote>
<p>To me, Postman Collections are <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> at the API transaction level. Allowing you to define a single unit of currency in the API economy, save, and organize them, and execute them at any point in your API lifecycle. Postman Collections measure not just an API transaction that happens, it is a measure of future transactions that can happen, complete with any relevant meta data that will be needed along the way.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="http://bitly.com/1tnYxV8">Swagger</a>, and <a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>, I&rsquo;m working to better understand how Postman Collections impact, and fuel the API lifecycle, including conversations with Abhinav Asthana (<a href="https://twitter.com/a85">@a85</a>), Founder and CEO of Postman, about their roadmap. Postman Collections are not just about defining, organizing, and executing your API calls in the Postman client as a solo API developer, they are also about collaborating with other key players involved throughout the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> as Postman Collections, to help me understand how I can use the format to improve my API own API workflows. My goal is to ensure Postman works seamless with all stops along my own API and micro service lifecycle, from design to evangelism, and is plug and play as a machine readable element of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>

<p>I was profiling the <a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com">video sharing API Dailymotion</a> the other day, going through their developer area and profiling their API operations. One of the things I<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/"> do as part of the profiling of any company</a>, is checkout how they execute their support.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/support">Dailymotion employs two very common building blocks for their platform support</a>, including an API specific Twitter handle, and good ol fashion email&mdash;both pretty proven approaches. However Dailymotion also employs a third aspect to thier API support, by recommending you head over to Stack Overflow for some community support.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> in this way is not that original, I see numerous API providers doing this, the part I found interesting was their reference to getting Dailymotion API support via Stack Overflow as, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"ask the stack!"</span> I like that, I think it reflects what Stack Overflow is to the API developer community, and was an elegant way to send API developers off your site, to get the support they need.</p>

<p>I was spending time profiling APIs late last night while putting back a couple of IPAs. Yes this is what I do on a Friday night, you have a problem with that? Anyways, I was crafting Swagger definitions for the <a href="http://developer.7digital.com/">7digital music APIs</a>, and the I came across <a href="http://developer.7digital.com/resources/api-docs/territories-api">their territories API</a>. "The Territories API serves data about countries that 7digital operates in, data about those counties, and a one or more languages with shop urls in each country&rdquo;, something that I could see being pretty useful to developers when building music apps on top of the platform.</p>
<p>There has been numerous APIs I&rsquo;ve developed in the past, where the need for some supporting, utility APIs, such as a list of states, zip codes, counties, or other resources was called for. Two layers to doing this: 1) Acknowledging the little things developers need goes a long way in building trust with them, letting them know you actually care, and get what they are facing 2) You want devs to achieve integration as quickly as possible, provide them with the little things that they will have to go hunt for, and possibly prevent them from achieving their objectives. &mdash; Reduce any friction possible!</p>
<p>I'd like to see an open source library of utility API design, complete with a variety of server side code, and data stores emerge, that help API providers deliver a more complete stacks of API resources. If you need a state / province API, or a language API, you could just grab one off the shelf and install it seamlessly into your API stack. This is just one of those little areas, that I think could be slowing the overall advancement of APis (just a wee bit), and with a little community effort, could really grease the wheels in API adoption, and fuel more meaningful integrations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm continuing my work, to help people understand what APIs.json is, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/three-ways-i-am-putting-apisjson-to-work/">varying ways that it can be put to use</a>.  My post the other week, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file is a good example of where to get started</a>, and as a follow-up I wanted to help further set the bar for what a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">minimum viable APIs.json</a>&nbsp;looks like, and today, I am going in the other direction--toward my dream APis.json file.</p>
<p>APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions for who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection.</li>
<li><strong>created</strong> - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created.</li>
<li><strong>modified</strong> - the last date in which an APIs.json file created.</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain like Twilio.com, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, that is part of specific project or application.</p>
<p>The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - the name of the API.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of the value an API delivers.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe the API itself.</li>
<li><strong>humanURL</strong> - The url any human should visit to learn more about an API.</li>
<li><strong>baseURL</strong> - The base url any machine should follow to start using an API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears-soft-round.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Each API should have at least this information, at a minimum. I could stay here, with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">minimum viable APIs.json definition</a>, but I encourage you to take one more step, and put the properties collection to use for each API. You can provide any other URL you want for an APIs properties, but I recommend starting with the basic properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TermsOfService</strong> - where do I find your terms of service page.</li>
<li><strong>StatusPage</strong> - where is the url of the status page, where I can get platform update.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - point me directly to where your pricing page is, so I can make a decision on price.</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong> - where is the community forum located for a platform, even if this is Stack Overflow.</li>
<li><strong>AlertsTwitterHandle</strong> - what is the primary Twitter handle for the API itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are meant to satisfy the common needs of anyone learning about API operations, however they are just URLs meant for the human API consumer. In my dream APIs.json file, there will be a robust amount of machine readable properties available for each API, beginning with the two most important:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> &nbsp;- a machine readable JSON or YAML file describing your API surface area</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint</strong> - a machine readable markdown file describing your API surface area</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with providing machine readable definitions of the API surface area, establishing a central truth or fingerprint for any API interface, it is just as important to provide a machine readable license for the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>InterfaceLicense</strong> - a machine readable pointer to the licensing for the API interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with making sure the interface of an API matches your application objectives, consumers need to understand the licensing restrictions, or the freedom that comes with deeply integrating an API resource into any system or app.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m talking about my dream APIs.json file, I&rsquo;m going to talk about two added property formats I&rsquo;m currently working on behind the scenes, adding to the stack of machine readable API definition formats..  These new areas, represent two areas I&rsquo;m working hard to define and understand, right after I hand-craft Swagger definitions for my APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">API Pricing</a></strong> - taking pricing to the next level and making it machine readable.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">API Questions</a> </strong>- answering the important questions I need to know about each API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine if API pricing was machine readable by default? Think of the options for building in a broker or market layer within the index of API platforms, and API collections, or even via an IDE. These two definitions are in an <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha stage</a>, but are based upon data I've been gathering behind the scenes, so a lot of thought has gone into settling on these buckets.</p>
<p>After that, I&rsquo;d say there are a handful custom properties I&rsquo;d like to see applied to each API indexed within an APIs.json:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>x-blog -</strong> where do I find your blog. (machine-readable below)</li>
<li><strong>x-blogrss - </strong>where can I just get an RSS of your blog stream.</li>
<li><strong>b-github -</strong> what is the primary Github account for the API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-circuit-paths.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>That concludes my list of elements I&rsquo;d like to see available in my dream APIs.json file. You can see examples of this in action, with the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">700+ companies I've generated APIs.json files for, over at my API Stack Github repo</a>. There is a lot of work left to do, but this dream APIs.json file resembles a vision I have for the future of API discovery&mdash;which I see as the engine for the API economy.</p>
<p>My goal is to get there I need the most important aspects of API operations machine readable. We aren't there yet, but I can see it. Taste it. Imagine what we can do when you can program against:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface Area (Swagger, Blueprint)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blog (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Status (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forum (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Twitter (Twitter API)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Github (Github API)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pricing (api-pricing)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Licensing (API Commons)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Questions (api-questions)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been staying in tune with the API space using RSS feeds, and the Twitter and Github APIs for a couple years. I&rsquo;m just now developing a deeper understanding of the overall API space through the generation of machine readable API definitions for popular APIs. I can&rsquo;t do much on the API licensing front beyond launching <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, but I am working to define pricing with my <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com">api-pricing</a> definition work, and also trying to capture the vital meta-data I need about API operations using <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com">api-questions</a>.</p>
<p>This post ended up being longer than I anticipated, but it is helping me beter understand what some of the next steps are for not just APIs.json, but also my own monitoring of the space. My goal is to not just push forward the APIs.json definition, but push forward my understanding along the way. Who knows maybe I'll drag you along too! ;-)</p>
<p>Ok, back to work. I just needed to wrap up these two posts about APis.json that were lingering in my outgoing story and idea queue.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had a conversation with some folks who are building a wikipedia of API definitions the other day, looking to employ formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to make an open, authoritative directory of machine readable API designs&mdash;something I can get behind 100%. I can even contribute the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">700+ APIs.json files, and the 250+ Swagger files I have generated</a>&nbsp;as part of my research.</p>
<p>When I have discussions about APIs.json folks, I always find it helpful to summarize the vision we have for the API discovery format, and described it in a short, concise way. This time around I was able to clarify the vision, in a way I hadn&rsquo;t fully been able to articulate before. To help me remember what I said, I wanted to capture it here on the blog.Many people who have heard about APIs.json as a sitemap for your APIs, but in reality there are three distinct ways I'm putting APIs.json to work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Providing A Sitemap -</strong> This is the simplest approach to using API.json, is to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">create a simple index of the APIs that exist within a domain</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Defining API Collection -</strong> Defining a portable, machine readable collection of common, or disparate APIs, like I&rsquo;ve done with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">SMS messaging API stack</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Establishing New Definitions - </strong>A place to define the next generation of API definitions that support Swagger, Blueprint, adding licensing layer with <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, or maybe pricing, and the ability to answer service related questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be easy to call APIs.json a sitemap for APIs, but it is much more. It has a lot of potential for defining API collections while also making them portable, and machine readable by default. Where I really get excited for the potential is when it comes to defining new definitions that can work in conjunction with existing definitions, like Swagger and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to leave you thinking about when it comes to APIs.json, is that it is designed to map out the world of public APIs we have, and the even larger layers of private APIs that exist behind the firewall, and make sense of this mess we&rsquo;ve created. Then with a rough blueprint, we can all work to define some new definition formats that help us bridge where we are currently at, to the next step of where we should be.</p>
<p>In the near fture, I'm focused on educating API providers on how to use APIs.json as a sitemap, and help API evangelists, brokers, and tech bloggers understand the potential that arises when you define API collections using APIs.json. When it comes to establishing new definitions, I think this will take longer to play out. I&rsquo;m working to help folks understand the importance of licensing their API using API Commons, and I&rsquo;m also playing around with some alpha formats for identifying some of the common questions that arise around API operations, and how companies are monetizing their APIs, but there is a lot of work to be done before this bears fruit.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rolodex-card.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I come across a new company, during the course of my monitoring and information gathering across the API space, I enter them into my company API. Once a company is in there, and I&rsquo;ve deemed it worthy enough for a closer look, I profile their operations.</p>
<p>For my own organization, and in the spirit of transparency and collaboration, I wanted to breakdown what I mean by profiling. First I start with the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The official name for any company or project. APis aren&rsquo;t always clearly defined corporate entities.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what a company does. You&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - A clean, simple, medium resolution logo for company. Again, you&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I dive into the common URLs that I care about, that provide me with the best signals possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - The heartbeat of any company, and API operations. In my opinion, the blog is one of the most important aspects of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS</strong> - A simple, machine readable blog stream &mdash; blown away by how many companies don&rsquo;t have.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active, engaged Twitter account, providing me easy access via the Twitter API.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - A complete, active Github user or organization, where I can access code, and other aspects of API operations via Github API.</li>
<li><strong>Crunchbase</strong> - A business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Crunchable API.</li>
<li><strong>Angelist</strong> - Similar to Crunchbase a business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Angelist API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I tackle the API, or APIs, and profile each API they have by gathering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - A clean, portable name that describes the API, but keeps context of company or organization running it.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what an API does &mdash; this is another pain in the ass to find most of the time.</li>
<li><strong>BaseURL</strong> - The base url for API calls. The process of finding this, will often determine for me, whether or not an API is worth monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Doing the deep dive on an API, and generating a machine readable definition of at least the API surface area, and include underlying data model, and authentication when I can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I sweep through the rest of the API program looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management Building Blocks - </strong>Run through my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common API management building blocks</a>, and record if any are present.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Building Blocks - </strong>Track what type of authentication is available for the API, including supporting building blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Definition -</strong> Profile how money is made around an API, even if their are indirect benefits when possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, I have everything I need to establish a robust profile of an API provider, and add them to my monitoring. To assist me in my profiling, I then generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> for the company, providing a machine readable version of all the information I&rsquo;ve gathered in my profiling. This doesn&rsquo;t always happen all at once, the companies usually queue up, then I go through and do full profiles in controlled sprints.</p>
<p>As with all of my research, y<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">ou can find the resulting APIs.son files on Github</a>, and as my monitoring continues, I will aggregate more companies doing interesting things with APIs, and as I have the time I will generate full profiles for each one.</p>
<p>If there is a specific company you&rsquo;d like profiled, please let me know.</p>

<p><em>I am giving each of my primary API research sites a refresh, and first up is the home page of my&nbsp;<a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery research</a>. As I update each home page, I'm going to publish here on API Evangelist to help bring more awareness to each of the main areas I'm studying.</em></p>
<p>This is one of my API research sites, focused specifically on API discovery. My name is <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, and I am the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, working as hard as I can to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, widely called an API. This network of API research projects all run on Github, and is my real-time workbench, which means there is a lot of finished work present, but occasionally you will also come across areas projects that are unfinished--you have stumbled in my API discovery research, you will find the main <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist site over here</a>, with other links to my work.</p>
<p>This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API discovery. Finding APIs, and having your APIs found is a pretty significant pain point, and in the last ten years, little has been done to provide adequate solutions. API discovery is an area I've been monitoring, ultimately have been unsatisfied with what I've seen, I've take matters into my own hands, and created <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, a machine readable API discovery format, any API provider can use to describe their APIs.</p>
<p>There are several API management companies, including Apigee, Mashery, and Mashape who have put forth API discovery solutions, and while these offerings are valuable, I feel they lack the openness necessary to truly move the API space, and the API discovery conversation forward. APIs.json was created to help make sense of the API space, in partnership with 3Scale API management infrastructure, CEO Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>). Together we are working to define as much of the public APIs space as possible using APIs.json, and encourage the development of open tooling around the format, with the first major addition being an open source API search engine called, <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a></p>
<p>Next I am working with other providers like Socrata, WSO2, and others to develop additional tooling, to serve all levels of the API sector. I do not feel API discovery is something that simply happens via an <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">API directory like ProgrammableWeb</a>, or even via <a href="http://apis.io">API search engines like APIs.io</a>--in the future API discovery will also occur in the browser, via our IDEs, and seamlessly within modern clients. In 2015, you'll see many more APIs.json driven efforts to help alleviate API discovery pain, and we hope the format, and supporting open tooling will stimulate other complimentary, or even competing efforts. API discovery is long overdue for some investment by the community, helping us get past some of our PTSD of the SOA era--we can do it!</p>
<p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">All my research is openly licensed CC-BY</a>, and is meant to help grow the awareness around healthy API discovery practices. I try to be as fair as I can when covering companies, individuals, and the tools they provide, but ultimately you will notice I have my favorites, and there are some areas I only touch on lightly, for a variety of personal reasons. I try to stay as neutral as I can when it comes to technological dogma, and company allegiance, but after almost five years, I have some pretty strong opinions, and can&rsquo;t help but try and steer, and influence things in my own unique way. ;-)</p>

Their implementation grabs my attention on several fronts, but their focus on delivering their API within your own infrastructure via a Heroku button, is one of the most relevant aspects.</p>
<p>This approach reflects a seismic shift occurring in how we deploy APIs, and how we deploy architecture overall.  You need a <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">data visualization API</a>, let me deploy my API into your cloud, or on-premise infrastructure using popular approaches to virtualization&mdash;developers do not need to go to the API, the API will now come to you, and live within your existing infrastructure stack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/a-wholesale-onpremise-version-of-my-api-for-sale/">wholesale APIs a lot lately,</a> showcasing the<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/"> white label approach by some API providers</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/blog/">exploring within the evolution of my own infrastructure</a>, and as more savvy API providers jump in on this opportunity, you&rsquo;ll see more stories emerge trying to understand the shift going on. <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a> is accomplishing this with Heroku, and their embeddable button, but companies who embrace a containerized micro-service centered approach to API deployment, will have a wide open playing field for buying and selling of the wholesale API driven technology being deployed across the emerging API economy.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/05/api-evangelist-call-thursday-summary-for-march-5th-2015/">API Evangelist Call Thursday Summary For March 5th, 2015</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-headset.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I work to isolate all of my calls on Thursdays, leaving other days of the week to more asynchronous forms of communication, and deep dives into coding, research, and storytelling efforts. Last Thursday was interesting, but this weeks conversations has spurred me to summarize some of the conversations that occurred on this busy day. This isn't something I'll do every thursday, and not all conversations will make it in, but I figured it would help me process, as well as share some insight into the types of conversations I'm having being the scene.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the conversations I&rsquo;ve had today, anonymized to protect the lives of those involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Evangelist at Major Media Company </strong>- I usually dodge recruiter calls early on in the process, but this one got through because it came in as a referral from someone I knew. This was regarding a lead role at a major media company you all know, a position I&rsquo;m not interested in, but willing to help talk through what is next for companies who can&rsquo;t find the right person for the role of lead API Evangelist! </li>
<li><strong>Available API Deployment Resources -</strong> I&rsquo;ve had a lot of trouble finding competent resources for any stage of the API lifecycle, but when it comes to API deployment, it has been impossible to establish relationships development shops I can refer work to. I had a very promising conversation about scaling an existing team I&rsquo;ve work with to successfully deploy APIs at scale in the past, opening up the opportunities for a scalable resource I can tap for designing, developing, deploying, and even the ongoing management of API resources. #fingerscrossed</li>
<li><strong>Developing a Wikipedia for API Definitions -</strong> I&rsquo;m working hard to develop a public catalog of open API designs via <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> and the <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> using the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> format, and I had an interesting conversation with a group that is working on the "Wikipedia for APIs", using machine readable formats like Swagger, and APIs.son. We'll see where this goes, but I&rsquo;m excited about the number of conversations I&rsquo;m having in the area of API discovery, and design. </li>
<li><strong>Containerized Micro-Service Orchestration - </strong>I've been immersed in my own version of micro-service orchestration, using Docker, but today I got a look into other approaches, helping me better understand the bigger picture, and how I can apply existing practices, and tooling to better orchestrate this new world I&rsquo;m creating. </li>
<li><strong>An APIs and IPAs Podcast -</strong> Three of my favorite letters, rearranged into a single podcast conversation. <a href="http://readme.io">Readme.io</a> has asked me to participate in a beer fueled conversation about the API space. Talk about being privileged, I couldn't think of a better career where I get to talk about publicly, what I do for a living, while drinking the best quality beer possible. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the APIs and IPAs podcast yet, that is up next&mdash;so I need to get ready. I'll have to consider more about how my Thursday conversations compare with the other, asynchronous conversations I&rsquo;m having through the week. At first glance, they seem very similar, but as I continue to get into the groove having my phone conversations only on Thursdays, and do these summaries&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll begin to see other patterns emerge.</p>
<p>Anyway you look at it, being in the center of the API economy is pretty exciting in 2015. I thought the buzz in 2010 was significant, but I had no idea of what it would be like in 2015. Lots going on, lots of important technological shifts, and lots of important industries, and companies turning their focus to the world of APIs. Sometimes it can make my head swim, but at the end of the day I&rsquo;m stoked to be where I am, as all of this moves forward--no matter how fast.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><em>I am giving each of my primary API research sites a refresh, and first up is the home page of my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>. As I update each home page, I'm going to publish here on API Evangelist to help bring more awareness to each of the main areas I'm studying.</em></p>
<p>This is one of my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API research sites, focused specifically on API design</a>. My name is <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, and I am the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, working as hard as I can to understand the world of the Application Programming Interface, widely called an API. This network of API research projects all run on Github, and is my real-time workbench, which means there is a lot of finished work present, but occasionally you will also come across areas projects that are unfinished--you have stumbled in my API design research, you will find the main <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist site over here</a>, with other links to my work.</p>
<p>This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API design space. I&rsquo;m in the middle of carving off a couple individual projects from this API design research including <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/">hypermedia</a>, and a soon API definition specific projects. As with my other research projects, there can be a great deal of overlap with other projects, when it comes to defining exactly what is API design. This research isn&rsquo;t about being complete, or finished, it is about maintaining a liquid understanding of what API design is, and be as comprehensive as a one man operation can be.</p>
<p>I execute on my API research by focusing in on specific areas like API design, getting to work understanding who the key actors are, which may include individual personalities, or corporate, government, or institutional entities. I profile each actor, and establish monitoring streams using Github, Twitter, RSS, Stack Exchange, and any other relevant channels. Throughout my monitoring I keep an eye out for interesting articles, white papers, announcements, and tooling that contribute to, and expands upon my definition of what is API design.</p>
<p>The more I research an area like API design, the more I&rsquo;m able to identify common building blocks, that make up the space. For API design, this can be as fundamental as API definitions, or as specific as publishing and sharing interactive documentation. My interpretation of these building blocks change over time, and sometimes I will link up these building blocks with other research projects, or spin off as independent projects, allowing me to dive even deeper&mdash;for example, Swagger began as a building block on API management, and is now its own research area entirely.</p>
<p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">All my research is openly licensed CC-BY</a>, and is meant to help grow the awareness around healthy API design practices. I try to be as fair as I can when covering companies, individuals, and the tools they provide, but ultimately you will notice I have my favorites, and there are some areas I only touch on lightly, for a variety of personal reasons. I try to stay as neutral as I can when it comes to technological dogma, and company allegiance, but after almost five years, I have some pretty strong opinions, and can&rsquo;t help but try and steer, and influence things in my own unique way. ;-)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-collection.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>Making a list of valuable APIs has been a staple of my tech blogging for 10 years now, and as I work to find even more meaningful ways of defining the API space, I&rsquo;m pushing the envelope on how I do API roundup stories. Instead of just finding a handful of valuable APIs, and providing an HTML list of them, I'm going to use <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, to make sure all of my collections are machine readable by default.</p>
<p>For each API I profile, it is valuable to have a nice logo, name, short description, and a link to the developer portal. However I want to also make sure other valuable, machine readable resources are also present like Twitter, Github, and Blog RSS. This is just the start, I want each API to also have a machine readable API definition using Swagger and API Blueprint as well--all indexed using an APIs.json file.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APIs.json in two ways, as an index for each API, as well as an index for the overall collection I&rsquo;m building--you will find the overall collection using the big {A} below, and each API has its own little {A}. To show you this in action, here is an <a href="http://sms.apievangelist.com/">SMS API collection</a> I've built:</p>

<p>This is all rendered using APIs.json, and provides all of the relevant links you will need to potentially get up and running with each API. You can use the APIs.json to further pull activity for each API using the Twitter and Github APIs, as well as via RSS. You can also programmatically evaluate, compare, and generate client-side code, documentation, testing, monitoring, and other essential elements using the machine readable Swagger definitions I&rsquo;ve included.</p>
<p>In the future, each time I post a roundup of APIs blog post, I will publish the list of APIs, using this APIs.json approach. There is a lot of work still to be done in, identifying, and indexing APIs in this format, as well as clarifying more detail about each API, like underlying data models, authentication, and pricing, but having a standard approach is a damn a good start.  This is the standard format I will be using for all my API Stack profiling--<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">you can find a complete list of APIs.json files, and Swagger definitions over on the Github repository for the work</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as I finish my API Blueprint tooling, I will also be providing each API in the API Blueprint format, as well as in Swagger, offering some variety, when it comes to understanding the surface area for each API. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/looking-beyond-the-number-of-apis-or-just-new-apis-and-working-harder-to-find-only-the-most-important-apis/">Instead of tracking on the number of APIs across the industry</a>, I&rsquo;m going to be tracking on the number of APIs that are fully defined, using APIs.json, providing full access to each API operations, as well as providing machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks-design.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am adding four new building blocks, to my list of suggested <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that API providers should consider when crafting their API management strategy</a>. These four building blocks, are based upon several things I&rsquo;ve seen in the space, and how some current deficiencies I&rsquo;ve identified that could slow things, and hold us back.</p>
<p>These new building blocks are all about API providers practicing what they preach, and making the account for API consumers, and developers, programmatic through an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API management API</span>. As I was profiling the <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/">Maijet API</a> as part of my <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email API research</a>, I noticed <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">they had an API for their developer accounts</a>, and with the growth in the number of APIs being consumed, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">the need for account automation is only going to incease</a>, something that is only getting even more critical when you think about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">API service composition overhead needed to support the containerization and micro-services movement.</a> To help stimulate this area, and encourage API providers to automate their API accounts, I&rsquo;m adding these four separate APIs building blocks, providing an overall blueprint for how API providers can launch a developer account API for their own API.</p>
<p>I used Mailjet&rsquo;s approach as a base model, but quickly began looking at <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">3Scale own API design</a>. 1) I use 3Scale, so I&rsquo;m familiar with their approach to user management 2) Their API was simple, robust, and clearly a proven approach that was working.  I broke 3Scale&rsquo;s own endpoints down into four logical groups for v1 of this API management API blueprint. There were a number of features they had, that I wanted in there, but figured it was better to start out simple, and meet most of the common needs I'm seeing from my own experiences.</p>
<p>Here is what I came up with, after taking a look at 3Scale&rsquo;s active docs.</p>
<p><strong>API Management API - User Management<br /></strong>Allow API API consumers to manage their own accounts via an API management API, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete information associated with their account--fields may vary, depending on what information each API requires for user accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>User Create</li>
<li>User Read</li>
<li>User Update</li>
<li>User Delete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Account Management</strong><br />Beyond the user profile, allow API consumers to manage the billing related account information, enable the programmatic adjustment of credit cards, and being able to check in on invoices, and payments through the API management API.</p>
<ul>
<li>Account Set Credit Card</li>
<li>Account Delete Credit Card</li>
<li>Invoice By Account</li>
<li>Invoice Line Item List</li>
<li>Invoice Payment Transaction List</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Service Management</strong><br />Enable API consumers to retrieve information about plans available for a specific API, or stack of APIs. Allow for listing of plans, and the features available for each plan. Also recommend considering the ability to set default plan for an account, enabling smooth application management.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>API Management API - Application Management</strong><br />Ideally each user can have multiple applications, consuming API resources at various rates. This allows for the most flexibility in API consumption, but may vary depending on what API management infrastructure employed. This API should allow for management of all applications, with secure control over application keys. Additionally, there should be analytics available, with a short, simple, but robust list of metrics.</p>

<li>Application Plan List (per isolated service)</li>
<li>Application List</li>
<li>Application Create</li>

<p>This represents the v1 stack I&rsquo;d like to see every API provider offer, as well for my own portable stack of API management APIs. I don't just want my core APIs to have these features, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">I want every wholesale API I deploy in other companies infrastructure to be equipped with the same basic stack</a>. I can add in more features later, but I think this represents the minimum viable stack for automating API consumption at this point.</p>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll build a docker image for deploying this API management infrastructure, alongside other APIs as a single virtual stack of loosely coupled micro-services, when bundled with the service composition 3Scale affords me, it will give me an unprecedented ability to orchestrate my API infrastructure.  Hopefully it can also provide a blueprint for others to use, and evolve beyond what I can do on my own.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.</em></p>

        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/keranm"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/myob/keran-mckenzie-myob.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of finally meeting someone in person, that I feel like I&rsquo;ve known for years, while I was over in Australia, for <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days Sydney</a>&mdash;Keran McKenzie (<a href="https://twitter.com/keranm">@keranm</a>), API Evangelist for <a href="http://developer.myob.com/">MYOBapi</a>. I got to drink, and talk with Keran (finally), but more importantly I got to listen to him talk about his approach to evangelism at the accounting API.</p>
<p>I have given, and listened to more talks on evangelism and advocacy than I care to remember. I always work hard to make sure I sit and list to as many evangelism talks as I can&mdash;there is always something to learn. Keran's talk was informative, thorough, and most importantly it was genuine. Keran discussed many of the proven areas of evangelism we all share, but not in a robotic or corporate way, he shared his, and MYOB&rsquo;s philosophy, and told the honest story about the challenges and triumphs.</p>
<p>Keran gives an energetic talk, but it wasn&rsquo;t just the high energy that sold it for me, it was demonstrating that he actually gives a shit about how to do it right, admitting he doesn&rsquo;t know everything, or nails it in all categories, and he gives an honest, friendly, approachable, and genuine story of what is API evangelism at MYOB.</p>
<p>This approach to API evangelism is critical to success. You won&rsquo;t last long as an evangelist if you are full of shit, or the company behind you is, sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been in this position too many times. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, every API evangelist role is difficult, and full of compromises, challenges, and things that are out of your control&mdash;even in my world. In the end, the only thing you can do is be honest, genuine, and as transparent as you can, and never be afraid to tell you story like Keran does.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/press-release.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time wading through press releases at the number of the dominate aggregate news outlets, looking for API news. I also have a number of scripts running, keeping an automated eye on the press sections for some of the companies I track on. The number of press releases available in corporate press areas vs. the number of press releases submitted by PR outlets, is much larger--which is a missed opportunity in my book.</p>
<p>Each day I look through PRWeb, PR Newswire, Business Wire and others trying to find the latest API stories. This is a process that will always be partially a manual process, as you just can&rsquo;t look for API news without getting petroleum, education, pharmaceutical, and other API news&mdash;which has nothing to with my beloved application programming interface. In short, these sites suck. Their UI is crap, and their search mechanisms are shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest problem with these news outlets do not usually even have RSS, let alone an API, requiring me to go to each site, each day, and sift through the search results.  The world of press releases is like many other industries I engage with&mdash;needs a dead simple API driven solution. I want a press release API that allows any company to submit for free, but the problem is nobody will in the beginning, so it also needs to go out and find the direct corporate press sources as well, and scrape this long tail of the PR world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d pay a monthly fee to be able to search this vast PR database via an API, and be able to integrate directly into my API monitoring system. It is something I could build, but I just do not have time, and as I do with my other ideas, I am putting out there for someone else to do. The API would be a very simple design, but the legwork to make it truly a rich, and valuable source of press, would take a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>This is one of the ideas I hope someone does not do, thinking it is a VC level start-up idea. It really is something that a handful of folks could bootstrap, and do very well in monetizing premium services, but if you go get VC money you will probably fuck it all up, and have to chase some unnecessary approaches to making money. If someone doesn&rsquo;t do soon, I&rsquo;m going to have to build an API focused version, because I am spending about 1-2 hours a day on this each day.</p>

<p>So many areas of my research are interesting, and the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">data center</span></strong> has central role:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>A few stories involving <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">databases</span></strong>, and the potential for deploying APis from common data connections:</p>

<p>Interesting to better understand <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API discovery</strong></span> from Microsoft, around their office suite:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.planetsharepoint.org/page/social/9f12">Understanding the Office 365 API&rsquo;s Discovery Service</a></li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Education</strong></span> related API stories always make me happy--there just aren't enough:</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>As I did last week, I'm walking away with a better awareness of what is happening across the space. It isn't enough for me to read all of this API news in isolation, it helps to see it side by side with other news, allowing me to see and understand patterns that I may have missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm just getting started exploring the ways to use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;when it comes organize my new Docker fueled, micro services stack. I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">using APIs.son to describe each micro service</a>, as well as define the overall collection of almost 20 micro services. I&rsquo;m using the include collection, as a <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">navigation for the loosely coupled stack of micro-services</a>, and my friend <span>Chris Spiliotopoulos (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/chefarchitect">@chefarchitect</a><span>)</span>, has done some more work with <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">his Swagger.ed</a>, delivering some <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> goodness that is in alignment with where I want to take all of this.</p>
<p>Adding to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">discovery and visualization work he did for Swagger</a>, Chris enabled Swagger.ed to look for valid APIs.son files as well, so when you browse to any APIs.son, like the one I have for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master">micro services stack</a>, you see the little APIs.son search icon in the address bar.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-in-browser.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>When you click on the APIs.son search icon in the address bar, you get a very cool visualization. Its pretty basic at the moment, just a visual catalog of the APIs available in the include collection of my stack, but when you connect up with the Swagger visualization work he's already done, we could have a pretty cool API catalog for managing and exploring microservices.</p>

<p>I have almost 20 micro-services listed, and Swagger.ed gives me the ability to navigate it in a very interactive way.  Whats next? We don&rsquo;t know&hellip;it is about exploration, and finding out the most meaningful way of exploring the APIs I deploy and aggregate into APIs.son collections.</p>
<p>I can see having a visual catalog of all of my API design that I collect, then deploy, and evolve them as needed for various parts of my infrastructure or for my clients, into other sub-collections? Disconnected collections? Loosely coupled collections? Not sure how tight I want things, part of <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">the micro service definition for me</a> is the size of the network connecting the services, as well as the services theselves.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/03/significance-of-the-we-the-people-api-being-first-modern-read--write-web-api-in-government/">A topic I've written about before</a>, and one that I answer regularly on forums, via email, and on Twitter is, &ldquo;Are there any write APIs in the federal government?&rdquo; It is a valid question, and as I said in my <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">strategy suggestions for the federal government,</a> write APIs are a critical aspect of all of this moving forward in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Rebecca Williams (<a href="https://twitter.com/internetrebecca">@internetrebecca</a>) pointed me to a <a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/4466/are-there-good-examples-of-open-read-write-apis-in-federal-government">recent discussion on this topic</a> earlier today, to which I added a couple of suggestions, but ultimately it is something I would like to see a more progressive solution emerge, something that can answer it real-time, and change as the API inventory in the federal government changes and evolves. Keeping a list, <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes">like 18F is doing</a>, is a start, but we need more.</p>
<p>One of the side projects that I work on a couple of hours each week, is the profiling of federal government APIs using APIs.json, and Swagger, for use in my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/stack.html">federal API stack</a>. I only have a handful of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">120+ APIs that I&rsquo;m profiling</a> completed, but once done, you will be able to search for APIs based upon whether or not an API uses the verbs GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE&mdash;giving you a much more detailed picture of how government APIs function.</p>
<p>Generating machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint are time consuming, but once you tie it together using a discovery format like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, it opens up a lot more opportunity to answer questions about government APIs. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of the heavy lifting currently, to establish a critical mass of API definitions in federal government, then I am hoping that each agency will take ownership over maintaining their own definitions--if not, I think it can just as easily be done from the outside-in, by the community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for the potential, when all of the meta-layer of APIs and open data in government is rich, well defined, and machine readable by default. The continuing data.json work out of the government, and our own APIs.json format is looking to help with this over time. There is a lot of work ahead, as well as education to occur, before the meta data layer for government APIs is machine readable by default, but once it is, we&rsquo;ll be able to answer questions like this in a much more efficient way.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of attending a gathering at <a href="http://www.heavybit.com/">Heavybit Industries</a>&nbsp;last week, a community for developer-focused entrepreneurs, where one of the headlining speakers was Nike CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissatchell">Chris Satchel</a>l. I wish I had taken better notes, but the one thing that stuck with me from his talk was his story about moving beyond their love affair with almost any software vendor that came along, and diligentlywork towards a micro-service oriented environment.</p>
<p>As the CTO, Satchell was working to clean up the message of legacy applications used across the enterprise, which was the result of years of, as he put it, saying yes to almost any software vendor that came along. Music to the ears of the San Francisco audience, he was now working to move the company out of a single data center, into the cloud, redefining operations as micro-services, and instituting a devops mindset along the way. They are a long way away from achieving their goal, but I found the change in their mindset about how they acquire software, was extremely relevant to all the API talk in 2015.</p>
<p>While i&rsquo;m sure there will still be plenty of opportunities for old school software vendors to hock their wares, I think this was a pretty clear sign of the API-centric approach that is changing not just how we develop and deploy software, but also how we buy software. If you are looking to sell software solutions to the enterprise in the future, you are going to need more than just yesterdays software, and a sales team&mdash;you are going to need the most agile, flexible, stack of micro-services possible, and let companies choose exactly the resources that they need.</p>

<p>This post has been open for almost two weeks now in Evernote. It began as a simple story about the possibility for generating code samples and libraries using Swagger. The longer it stays open, the wider the definition becomes, so I have to post something, just to draw a line in the sand. I&rsquo;m not talking about generating code that runs on the server, this post is all about everything on the API consumption side of things.</p>
<p>Shortly after Wordnik launched the machine readable API definition format&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, they launched a <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">library for generating client side code samples in a variety of languages</a>. This was something that was evolved upon by <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, with the launch of their API design platform, and introduction of <a href="http://bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>. Even with these advances forward, there were still many shortcomings, and debate around what you could actually auto-generate on the client-side using a machine readable API definition continued. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many random Tweets I get from people saying, &ldquo;Oh is auto-generation of code cool again?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t auto-generate client code or SDKs ;-)"</p>
<p>Amidst the debate about what is really possible, and the jokes about our SOA past, new players have emerged like <a href="http://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> that are looking to raise the bar when it comes to generation of not just simple code samples, libraries or stubs, but sophisticated API SDKs. I am sure the jokes about automating client code will still occurs, but there is no denying that the overall conversation is moving forward.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m exploring my own limitations of what is possible when generating client-side code with Swagger, I also come across new players like <a href="http://bit.ly/1DwAaXo">Lucybot</a>, who are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/24/driving-your-single-page-applications-and-api-cookbooks-using-api-definition-formats-like-swagger-and-api-blueprint/">moving the conversation forward with API cookbooks, and Single Page App (SPA) generated from Swagger definitions</a>. I&rsquo;m not in denial that there is a lot of work ahead, but in the two weeks that I&rsquo;ve been crafting this post, I&rsquo;d say I have gotten a glimpse of what is next. When you bundle the latest movements in virtualization and containerization, and using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint to auto-generate client side code, I feel like the current potential is unlimited, and things are just heating up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">talking about the possibilities around wholesale APIs for a while now</a>, something that is only going to become more prevalent with the popularity of micro services and containers. I thought <a href="http://www.rechargkit.com/white-label-api">this company's approach to white label APIs</a> was pretty basic, but worth showcasing, providing a glimpse of what is possible when you are talking about B2B APIs.</p>
<p>Recharge kit provides 15 separate APIs for wholesale usage. I thought it was a telco stack of APIs when I first landed, but it is an interesting mix of telco, utility, travel, and more. I predict companies will emerge with a much more nuanced stacks of micro-services than Recharge Kit, but their approach shows some of the thinking occuring in the space.</p>
<p>As part of the Recharge Kit white label package you also get a handful of API management tools, ranging from user management, and advertising, to billing, and support. The overall presentation is not that professional, but a lot of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">essential API management building blocks</a> are present.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">Delivering API management resources in this portable, and flexible way is reflected in my recent exploration with my 3Scale API management infrastructure on Alpha API Evangelist</a>. I'm looking to understand how not to just manage my B2D or B2C API consumption, but also allow me to deliver on a new wholesale side of my operations. Wholesale APIs deployed as micro services via Docker containers adds a whole new dimension to API management, opening up more B2B, wholesale, and white label API opportunities like this.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist network</a> is my open workbench, and I understand for many, it can be confusing to see some of my half-baked ideas alongside some of my more hardened API 101, business of APIs, and politics of APIs work. I try to keep the API Evangelist blog containing information for the API newbie, as well as my more advanced API leader crew--something that is tough to do.</p>
<p>I have a lot of ideas coming off the assembly line around my own infrastructure, Docker, microservices, and other more forward leaning areas. Normally I dump a lot of this mundane exhaust from my world over on <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, but that site gets picked up by DZone, due to historical connections, and that audience is pretty trollish, second only to Hacker News. I'm not looking to get into petty fights over choice I made around my own infrastructure.</p>
<p>To support my newer ideas, I launched&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">Alpha API Evangelist</a>, which will act as a kind of staging ground for many of the ideas you may eventually see here on API Evangelist. I do not want to alienate my just getting going audience, with rants about Docker and microservice orchestration, and I definitely do not want some of my unproven thoughts to getting taken out of context alongside some of my rants around important API topics in the business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>I know some of you are like WTF, another blog, you are diluting your brand, blah blah. If you saw the API Evangelist Network like I do, as this open workshop for API research, and storytelling, you&rsquo;d understand. Anyhoo&hellip;.long story short&hellip;90% of the Docker, microservices, orchestration, Github API blah blah blah, is now over at <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha.apievangelist.com</a>.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/lucybot/lucybot-full-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>During my monitoring of the API space this last week I had one of those rare discoveries, amongst thousands of misses, and around a hundred slightly interesting nuggets, a simple move forward called <a href="https://lucybot.com/">Lucybot</a> emerges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to walk you through what I experienced as I had the tab open in my Chrome browser for the last week, in Lucybot's own words:</p>
<blockquote><em>LucyBot is a tool for on-boarding new API developers, and is meant to be used alongside traditional API documentation such as Swagger and I/O Docs.</em></blockquote>
<p>I really like this sentence when they start talking about generating API cookbooks:</p>
<blockquote><em>LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API. Design step-by-step walk-throughs for any use case, and LucyBot will provide cross-language code snippets, which expand into a working, visually-rich demo.</em></blockquote>
<p>Now you are talking my language. Swagger on Github is a powerful combo:</p>
<blockquote><em>LucyBot can also push the code to GitHub, where users are free to build it out further, e.g. by pulling in data from their own servers or other APIs.</em></blockquote>
<p>Add some <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> to the mix, and now you have some serious API coverage. It can be difficult to understand the vision behind a new API driven start-up&mdash;I look at quite a few new companies. To help move the process forward, let&rsquo;s start with the basics of what is significant about Lucynbot&rsquo;s perspective n API. There are two things that stand out for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning About APIs - </strong>Lucybot takes an API definition like Swagger, and turns it into an interactive walk-through for on-boarding with an API. Think Swagger UI, but more interactive walk-through than interactive documentation--now add in a little Swagger driven <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to help you authenticate, and navigate the request and response of each API. #Boom</li>
<li><strong>API Driven Clients -</strong> Lucybot isn't just generating interactive documentation or walk-throughs, they are generating a single page application (SPA). Another move forward in how we learn about valuable API driven resources, how we on-board them, and how we engage with them, all in a single, fluid, API definition driven motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to admit, after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">exploring my thoughts around API visualization using Swagger from Chris,</a> and seeing what is possible in generating &ldquo;API Cookbooks&rdquo;, and Single Page Apps (SPA), with Lucybot, I&rsquo;m about to go into cardiac failure from the movement in the space over the last week. I&rsquo;m excited about what Lucybot brings to the table. I haven&rsquo;t even used their offering, but I can see the potential, and when you line up with the other movement in the API definition world around visualization, and the <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2015/02/17/Utilising-API-Blueprint-in-API-Clients/">addition of hypermedia using API Blueprint</a>, I can begin to see some of one possible future I&rsquo;ve been imagining for the API Economy.</p>
<p>I am excited to see what Lucybot can deliver when it comes to cookbooks and SPAs. If they can deliver on the vision they are bringing to the table, it could further move the overall client and integration side of the API conversation forward pretty significantly. I&rsquo;m seeing many of the important elements of delivering API and microservices coming together in 2015, and <a href="https://lucybot.com/">Lucybot</a> reflects this. Adding yet another bonus incentive for creating machine readable API definitions using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> to the API game.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/scaling-what-i-do-at-api-evangelist/">Scaling What I Do At API Evangelist</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-scale.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my day to day operations, I get regular calls from VC's (Venture Capitalists) looking to better understand APIs, the role they are playing within specific industries, working towards a better awareness of how they will impact their portfolio. These conversations almost always end with the question, <em>"what can I do for you?"</em>, something that always leads to the next question,<em> "what does scale look like for API Evangelist?"</em>. A verty interesting set of questions...</p>
<p>Interestingly, the answers to these questions are directly related to another common question I get from people in the space, <em>"how do you make money?"</em>. I'm fortunate. I get to scale API Evangelist exactly as I see fit, because I get to choose who I take money from. All money has strings attached, and I want to make sure these strings lead me in positive directions, and never hold me back, or force me to make decisions that would be negative for the API space. This is something that is much easier to do in 2015, than it was in 2010, when I first started API Evangelist.</p>
<p>This leads me to yet another question I get from people, <em>&ldquo;how do I do what you do?&rdquo;</em>. A question which I do not have a good answer for. Honestly I do not fully understand how I got here, and not sure folks can deal with being as broke as I&rsquo;ve been over the last five years, something that only recently has changed with the support of my partners, <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://ws02.com">WSO2</a>, and <a href="http://restlet.org">Restlet</a>. I did not set out to build API Evangelist using a single plan, I&rsquo;m making this shit up as I go along, and honestly I do not remember all the decisions I&rsquo;ve made over the last five years, resulting in my current position.</p>
<p>So why am I rambling on about this? Because it brings home what scale actually means to me at API Evangelist. There is no scaling API Evangelist in a Silicon Valley VC sense. It isn&rsquo;t something you can throw money at, come up with an algorithm, and grow. I&rsquo;m obsessed with the API space, and the potential (good &amp; bad) of APIs, which motivates me to read, hack, and tell stories that share my experiences&mdash;that is it. The only way to scale that is to incite others to embark on similar journeys, share the stories I&rsquo;m telling, fork my code and projects, and hopefully begin developing their own stories, and tools, so that I can depend on them, in the same way.</p>
<p>I get a lot of people who engage me daily, and most of them want something from me. Some of these folks are on their own true API journey, sometimes running parallel to mine, but often times they are not, or maybe they are for just a short period of time. I just wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">being Swagger.ed Last Week, and Now I&rsquo;m Seeing Visualizations</a>, showcasing Swagger driven API visualization work by Chris Spiliotopoulos (<a href="https://twitter.com/chefArchitect">@chefArchitect</a>), who fits into this story, because he is what I envision when it comes to scaling API Evangelist.</p>
<p>Chris has been in the shadows, reading my work, listening to my ideas, and internalizing them in his own world, then he works to find something he can contribute that doesn&rsquo;t just augment my own ideas and work, but advances them forward, potentially delivering value for the entire API space. Chris doesn&rsquo;t need anything from me. He is looking to find his own way, and add value in a way that matches his own skills, wherever he can, in a way that amplifies the overall value generated. I wish I could explain this type of scaling to everyone, but hopefully the handful of folks who actually get what I am rambling about, will step in an help me scale the API Evangelist network over the next five years--thanks Chris!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this topic before, in an effort to understand the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">possible incentives for API providers to generate their own machine readable API definitions</a> in formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>. These machine readable definitions for APIs and microservices are important to have, but not everyone produces them by default for their APIs, and honestly nobody is going to create them until there are enough incentives to sweeten the pot.</p>
<p>It helps me to walk through this story again, understand the incentives for generating API definitions to date, in hopes of better understanding where we are going. Early on Wordnik developed <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, to generate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation -</strong> Making learning about an API, a hands-on experience, accelerating time to first API call.</li>
<li><strong>Generate Server-Side Code -</strong> Automatic generation of server side skeletons that take out much of the repetitive work of API deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Generate Client-Side Code -</strong> Automatic generation of client side code samples, and libraries, making API integration a much quicker process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a> came along and moved the needle back, making API definitions more about API design than just API management and integration, with the introduction of <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Design Editor -</strong> Apiary introduced the concept of API definitions and API design, with their introduction of their cloud-based API design tooling.</li>
<li><strong>Mock API Generation -</strong> API definitions aren&rsquo;t just for managing API deployment anymore, you can mock APIs, saving costly development cycles, early on in the life cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are seeing other providers like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a>, <a href="http://ardoq.com/">Ardoq</a>, and others step up to continue expanding what you can do with machine readable API definitions. I wanted to take a moment to brainstorm everything I am seeing, and would like to see emerge along the API life cycle, that could be driven by Swagger and API Blueprint API definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SDK Generation -</strong> Going beyond auto-generation of simple samples and libraries, and generating full SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong> - Allowing the visualization of not just API metadata, but also the resources available within.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - Understanding more about what an API does, evaluating the interface, and resources available within.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Allowing the automatic deployment and scheduling of API tests, based upon the defined surface area.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Enable automatic generation and scheduling of API monitoring, based upon the defined surface area.</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong> - Comparing two or more API definitions, and providing more insight into the differences present.</li>
<li><strong>Annotation</strong> - Opening up an annotation and communication layer around an APIs surface area, on any site or network.</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> - Helping organize, and bring coherence to the language involved with crafting an API surface, as well as existing APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Client Generation -</strong> Allowing the auto-generation of more sophisticated client, single page app, and other interfaces for API consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Search Discovery - </strong>Taking API discovery to the next level, allowing for searching across an APIs surface area, as well as other supporting building blocks, using formats like APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Discovery -</strong> Allowing for controlled API discovery in curated API collections, using formats like APIs.json to build collections. </li>
<li><strong>IDE Discovery -</strong> Introducing API discovery directly in the IDE, using cloud platforms like Codenvy to bring APIs to developers, instead of requiring developers to find the APIs they need.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time - </strong>Marry the real-time work occurring from providers like Firebase, PubNub, and Fanout with the API definition layer.</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity -</strong> Expose the integration, interoperability, and automation layers like IFTTT and Zapier that we are depending on as machine readable API definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation -</strong> Allow for the bridging, and daisy chaining of machine readable API definitions, aggregating many APIs into single, common, machine readable definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a brain dump, of of possible ideas that could be developed and generated using machine readable API definitions. Some of it represents patterns I&rsquo;m already seeing, while some of it represents existing API driven areas, that haven&rsquo;t been touched by API definitions, but should be (aka opportunity). Swagger and API Blueprint provide a common language for communicating around the central truth that is the API definition, and the more tooling that is developed around these common language, the more incentives there are for API providers and consumers to use them.</p>
<p>I believe we are reaching a tipping point with the tooling that already exists. Interactive documentation, and client and server side code generation is already proving to be enough of an incentive for many, but if you bring in the API design benefits from platforms like Apiary and <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, the  search discovery benefit introduced by <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://apis.io">Apis.io</a>, the IDE discovery brought to the table by <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, and visualization tools I&rsquo;m seeing from Ardok, and now Swagger.ed&mdash;things really look like they are tipping. Now I am looking to organize the current tools that are available, and better educate API providers and consumers that they exist, while also looking to stimulate the next wave of API lifecycle tooling that is driven by&nbsp;API definitions.</p>
<p>API Blueprint <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2015/02/17/Utilising-API-Blueprint-in-API-Clients/">recently took a big step forward by embracing hypermedia</a>, bringing actions into the API definition layer. In my opinion, all of this tooling is beginning to go beyond just the API meta layer, and permeating potentially every aspect of the API life cycle, and beginning to add more value to the data, content, and other digital resources being made available via APIs. The big picture benefits of API definitions are really coming into focus for me, but there is still so much work to be done, when it comes to properly defining the current API landscape, let alone keeping eye on what is just over the horizon.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ruler-2.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I constantly struggle to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/21/weekly-apireport-for-february-20th-2015/">stay in tune with the scope of the API space, and keep pace with its rapid expansion</a>. As part of this struggle,&nbsp;I am always on the hunt for new ways to shift the way I look at the space&mdash;as long as it helps me understand things better, while also contributing as much valuable, and open information back to the API space. The With this in mind, the API Evangelist monitoring algorithm is always in flux, with the latest change being the elimination of the <em>&ldquo;number of APIs&rdquo; </em>or <em>&ldquo;number of new APIs&rdquo;</em>, from the monitoring equation.</p>
<p>I have showcased the growth in public APIs for a long time now, and for a while, it was what I needed to motivate my research and storytelling, but after almost five years, these two data points are becoming a liability for me. As I go through the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies that are doing interesting things in the space</a>, and generate <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">APIs.json profiles, and machine readable API definitions using Swagger and API Blueprint</a>, I realize quantity or number of APIs has no bearing on my research, and it is just a distraction. Any number of APIs is meaningless if I cannot understand what these APIs do, their pricing, quality of service, terms of these services, and easily match with my own business objectives&mdash;elements I&rsquo;m working hard to define, and quantify in a machine readable way using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>
<p>In the everyday reality of the API space, there is no reason for me care about how many APIs there are, a goal that comes bundled with the desire to chase new APIs, in support of this metric. Sure I want to be informed about new, and interesting APIs that come into the space, but chasing them in the support of some data point, that actually has no bearing on my research, is a waste of my time.  When you couple this with my struggles to keep up with &ldquo;dark APIs&rdquo;, the APIs that are driving mobile applications, and the dizzying number of private APIs that startups, up to the enterprise, are deploying&mdash;it is game over, I just don&rsquo;t think you can quantify it (or at least I&rsquo;m not the guy to do it).</p>
<p>To better help me understand these data points, I asked Jakub Nesetril (<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) the CEO of <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, where their numbers are&mdash;how many APIs are lit up on the <a href="http://apiary.io/">API design and collaboration platform</a>? He said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"It has crossed 130,000 APIs a couple weeks ago&rdquo;</em></span>. I&rsquo;m sure I can get similar counts from other API providers, but ultimately it doesn&rsquo;t do anything for me. what then? More APIs doesn&rsquo;t do API Evangelist any good. Being able to find the most valuable, and interesting APIs, is what I&rsquo;m looking for. I&rsquo;m driven to find stories of successful and interesting APIs, to evolve my API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>, and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> strategy and storytelling&mdash;there are only so many APIs I can look at. I'm looking for the interesting conversations going on around the most important APIs, that platforms like Apiary are powering.</p>
<p>Until an API provider does something interesting, or someone does something interesting with an API, that API doesn&rsquo;t exist to me-there is no reason for me to chase any API, until it stands out in one of these ways. However, this is just my perspective, in relationship to my own goals. However, where it begins to apply more universally, and provides something that I think API consumers could walk away with, is that an API really doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, until it is actually being used.</p>
<p>I was talking with John Sheehan, the CEO of Runscope over the weekend, and the common question came up, &ldquo;<em>What are some of the interesting APIs you are seeing out there</em>&rdquo;? To which John replies, &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>None of them, until they are used in your app</em></span>&rdquo;! I think John&rsquo;s answer reflects this seismic shift for me in 2015, which is the year I stop counting and referencing the number APIs in the space, and chasing new APIs in support of this delusion and work harder to find, design, and share the most important API definitions that I possibly can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="120" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the side effects of being so open and transparent about my ideas, like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">the one I had around API visualizations</a>, is that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/06/my-wish-has-been-granted-swagger-driven-api-visualizations-from-ardoq/">people who are doing similar things, like Ardoq</a>, eventually find you. Even better, is when someone closely follows your thoughts, and takes your ideas, and sets into motion, your original idea, in a way that will allow it to become bigger than the original idea.</p>
<p>Last week Chris Spiliotopoulos (<a href="https://twitter.com/chefarchitect">@chefarchitect</a>) sent me an email, with a <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">simple Chrome extension</a> attached, asking what I thought. After installing the add-on (just drag onto your Chrome extension page), I visited <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">my notebook of Swagger defined APIs over at API Stack</a>, and when Twilio&rsquo;s Swagger definition loaded in the browser, I saw a little Swagger icon show up in my browsers address bar&mdash;you know kind of like when there is an RSS feed available.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger-ed/swagger-ed-address-bar.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>I click on the icon, and a new layer to my browser opens up, with a simple, crude, yet potentially powerful visualization of Twilio&rsquo;s API surface area.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger-ed/swagger-ed-visualization-1.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>Honestly, the visualization does little for sorting out the complexities of the API, but it demonstrates a possible future, where we can browse the Internet, stumble across APIs, and their machine readable definitions, and open up an entirely new, visual layer that helps us quantify, and make sense of what an API does. APIs are a very abstract concept, and helping developers understand the scope and value of an API can be difficult, the introduction of API definition driven visualizations go a long way in helping speed up the conversation.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to immediately understand the scope of a microservice. How big is micro? Can I see a tag cloud of parameters? Is there a visualization layer to explore the underling data model? Can you provide me with a visualization diff between two similar APIs, defined using Swagger or API Blueprint. I&rsquo;m just getting going on brainstorming ideas for visualizations, and so is Chris&mdash;a conversation that I think will be never-ending as we continue to work to understand the digital resources being deployed across the API landscape.</p>
<p>I have an alpha version of an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and Swagger editor, that I&rsquo;m using for the <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">redesign of my platform using microservices</a>, and don&rsquo;t just see the conversation Chris is started exclusively being about visualizing on the meta layer of APIs, but also directly connecting and exploring the valuable data, content, and other digital resources being made available via APIs. I also envision being able to explore collections of APIs defined using APIs.json, allowing not just software to navigate between many APIs, but also humans&mdash;something that is core to the APIs.json vision.</p>
<p>Swagger.ed is open source, and <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">available in a Github repo</a>. It is just an initial prototype, but imagine what is possible when you can take a machine readable Swagger or API Blueprint file, and instantly explore the meta layer to any API, then also visually explore data returned, like the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/">FDA is doing with clinical drug trials</a>. If you have any visualizations you&rsquo;d like to see, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed/issues">submit as an issue</a> on Chris&rsquo;s work, or in the comments here. I would love to better understand how visualizations can better help you understand your own APIs, and the APIs that are littered across the online landscape, thta you depend on.</p>

<p>I have API tooling on the brain, a result of conversations on multiple fronts, and the evolution of my own thoughts on creating what I&rsquo;d see as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">the perfect API design tool</a>. My thoughts on API tooling, reflect my general API philosophy, and focus on developing small, meaningful tools that truly make an impact.</p>
<p>First, nobody likes being dependent on bloated software products. The age where software  looks like Microsoft Office in my opinion, is over, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to a brighter future.  I feel pretty strongly that we need small, simple tools, that work in concert, not via a single client I have to pay for 100% of features, to get just 2% of the features I actually need to get done, what I need.</p>
<p>One of my popular Github repositories is my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/csv-converter/tree/gh-pages">CSV Converter</a>, which is just a reworking of <a href="https://github.com/shancarter/Mr-Data-Converter">Mr. Data Converter</a>, to which I added the ability to save XML, JSON, and CSV files directly to Github, making a completely client-side data management tool that runs 100% on Github pages. I like this idea developing small, stand-alone tooling for the API space, and is something you will see a lot more from me in coming months.</p>
<p>As I work to refine, and evolve my thoughts on the perfect API designer, I&rsquo;m engaged in several conversations, about what the tooling could look like to support this vision, and the consensus seems to be that the next generation of tooling has to reflect an API philosophy&mdash;simple, small, stand-alone tools that do one thing and do it well. Something you can see this in popular API tooling like <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, and <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>.</p>
<p>In recent times, I have been very adverse to developing any web or mobile client that someone else will depend on, stemming form PTSD developed by owning so much legacy code over my 25 year career. I'm happy to see that it isn&rsquo;t just me, and that there are so many other souls out there who are tired of legacy software bloat, and ultimately becoming slave to this, from both a provider, and end-user perspective.</p>
<p>The moral of this story (for me), is that any client I build from here forward will be simple, small, and add real value to my operations, or it will be tossed. This approach reflects the way I see APIs, and if a service, or its resulting clients are not delivering value, they shouldn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;something that isn&rsquo;t possible, if you don&rsquo;t have a modular, bite-size approach to developing your technology solutions. I'm fortunate...</p>

<p>I was just listening to segment on NPR, All Things Considered, about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/16/386758778/science-standards-draw-climate-change-debate-back-into-wyo-classrooms">educating students around the environment</a>. Throughout the program I couldn&rsquo;t help be reminded of a similar imbalance in the world of APIs. Throughout my API experience I&rsquo;m constantly faced with a separation between what I hear is possible, what I would like to see, and what actually occurs on the ground in startups, small businesses, and within enterprise organizations, and government agencies.</p>
<p>You might have to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/16/386758778/science-standards-draw-climate-change-debate-back-into-wyo-classrooms">listen to the segment</a>&nbsp;to fully grasp what I mean, but essentially it comes down to this: we&rsquo;d like a perfect world where we do not negatively impact the environment, and everyone understands the urgency, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints that prevent us from truly realizing this vision. In the world of APIs, these same constraints exist. We&rsquo;d like to achieve API harmony in everything we do, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints we have to navigate, from knowledge and education, to the time and resources needed to implement.</p>
<p>This chasm reflects the challenge in my API Evangelist mission. How do steer clear of selling people a single product, platform, or holistic vision of an API strategy, and break things into small, bite-size chunks of information that anyone can use (or not use) as they see fit, in the environments they operate within.  I don&rsquo;t believe there is a silver bullet, or single religion to follow here, it is all about staying in tune with what is working, and what is not&mdash;then making your own decisions about what is appropriate on the ground.</p>
<p>API Evangelist was born out of my success and failures working at SAP&mdash;which was all about striking a balance between what I knew was possible, what I wanted, and what was really possible in the environment I operated in. Alright, enough pontificating, and back to understanding all of this. I guess my point is, that this isn&rsquo;t just about understanding where are going, where we&rsquo;ve been or where we are currently&mdash;it is also about actually making meaningful connections that guide us, incrementally, in the right direction.</p>

<p>This first Weekly API.Report was about 8 hours worth of work for me, in addition to the regular API news curation I do each week. Next week should be easier, as I built some tools to help me. The hard work now is to prioritize the Weekly API.Report each week, providing a regular account of what I've curated.</p>
<p>This post has helped me better absorb what happened this week, something I hope I can achieve each week. I have this same data going back to 2013, as I've been doing the work each week, i just stopped publishing a weekly post when I went to work in Washington D.C. as a Presidential Innovation Fellow--I just got too busy.</p>
<p>Next up for me, is to generate a short summary, and do a companion email newsletter for the Weekly API.Report--stay tuned!</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-mean.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is an interesting story about <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/twitter-trolling-victims-mercy-daunting-100000942.html">Twitter trolling over at Yahoo News from CBCNews.ca</a>, which includes recommendations from Adria Richards (<a href="https://twitter.com/adriarichards">@adriarichards</a>) for using the Twitter API to crack down on trolling, based upon her own experiences. Here is the specific API mention from the story:</p>
<blockquote><em>Richards has shared her own recommendations for Twitter to clamp down on trolling, which include making trending harassment patterns available via the application programming interface (API) and allowing users to subscribe to blacklists to exclude words from their timelines.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think APIs can playing a larger roll when it comes to online trolling, but we&rsquo;ll need someone to step-up and own the topic, working with Twitter, and other social networks to expose the right APIs, and give more control to end-users. Then also help encourage the development of open tooling on top APIs, that help users manage their online profiles, manage filter settings, manage black and white lists, and other key features.</p>
<p>I'll continue to consider the potential of anti-trolling APIs, alongside other account, security, and privacy considerations, and see if we can start identifying some potential API patterns and approaches that can be re-used across the space.</p>

<p><a href="http://dev.mendeley.com/">I was playing catchup on my feeds over the weekend, and came across a nice, </a><a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/start-up-life/mendelife/meet-the-platform-team-part-i/">meet the Mendeley platform team post</a>, from the <a href="http://dev.mendeley.com/">academic research API</a>. I&rsquo;m a big fan of these types of efforts, that help humanize API operations, and bring API providers closer to API consumers. From the outside, it is difficult see behind the API curtain, and showcasing the team, is one of the best ways to break down barriers.</p>
<p>Simple things like showcasing the team, let each one tell their story, and providing Twitter accounts for each team member goes a long way in helping me connect with what an API does. Something that will continue beyond just this one post, because I followed each team member that is active on Twitter, and will be able to stay in tune asynchronously.</p>
<p>In the technical shuffle of API oeprations, it can be easy to forget about little touches like this, which is why I&rsquo;m going to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">add team showcase as a building block to my API management list</a>. When you are building out your API management strategy, it helps to have things like team showcase on the checklist.</p>

<p>If you were at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag in Colorado last November</a>, or in <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">Sydney, Australia for API Days last week</a>, you&rsquo;ve heard me talk about what containers are doing to APIs. There is a subtle, but important shift in how APIs are being deployed occurring right now, and as John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>&nbsp;says, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">containers are doing for APIs, what APIs have been doing for businesses</a>.</p>
<p>As I was processing news for <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a> this morning, I found more evidence of this, with the <a href="http://api.report/2015/02/14/logentries-releases-logging-container-for-docker-15-stats-api/">release of logging API container from Logentries</a>. APIs have made resources like &ldquo;logging&rdquo;, much more modular and portable, for use in multiple channels like mobile or via websites. A containerized logging API makes the concept of a logging API much more portable, by adding an entirely new dimension for deployment. You don&rsquo;t just have a logging API, you now have a logging API that can be deployed anywhere in the cloud, on-premise, or on any physical object.</p>
<p>This opens up a whole new world of APIs, one that goes beyond just a programmable web, quickly evolving us towards a programmable world, for the better, and the worse. Last month <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/01/21/when-will-my-router-have-docker-containers-by-default/">I asked, when will my router have docker containers by default</a>? I received an email from a major network equipment manufacturer this week, letting me know that they are working on it. This means little containers on the Internet enabled objects across our worlds, ushering in the ability to deploy localized, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale APIs</a>, giving us the ability to manifest exactly the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a> that we need, for any objective.</p>
<p>I try not to hype up where things are going in the API space, so I will stick with calling containers a significant evolution in how APIs are done. This new way of deploying APIs will push the evolution around the business of APIs, changing how we make generate revenue from valuable resources, while also putting even more stress on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">politics of APIs</a>, with introduction of more privacy and security concerns&mdash;not to mention adding a whole new dimension of complexity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where all of this is going. As with the rest of the API space, I struggle with making sense of all of this in real-time, and the allocation the mental bandwidth to see the big picture. All I can say at this moment, is to make sure you work to better understand various approaches to containerization, and adopt a microservice approach to your API design. Beyond this, all we can do is keep an eye on what companies like <a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a>&nbsp;are doing, when it comes to containerized API deployment, and try to learn as fast as we possibly can.</p>
