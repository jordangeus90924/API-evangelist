[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/programmableweb-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />][1]I made time for three posts on [ProgrammableWeb][2] this week. I provided some more coverage of Dreamforce, and their latest mobile platform.  Then I covered the US invasion of Viadeo Social Network, and called out the Government software provider TylerTech about their lack of API support for cities across the country.  Check the blog posts out for yourself:

At Dreamforce, Saleforce.com acknowledged that the future of the enterprise is both social and mobile, and the Salesforce.com APIs are a driving force.

Viadeo recently launched a publicly available version of its API that provides full access to the social network’s users’ data including career, news, groups, jobs, schools and a users status and messaging system.
