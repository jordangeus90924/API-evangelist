{% include JB/setup %}<p>I finished updating the speaker lineup for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference this weekend.While we still have a couple of panels to finalize and keynotes to announce, the speaker lineup is almost final.We have spent almost 8 weeks reaching out to leaders across the API industry, soliciting submissions for keynotes, panels and sessions.It has been a lot of fun taking all the submissions and crafting the most compelling schedule as possible.It was really important to me that we didn’t just discuss the common areas of the API industry, like service providers, REST, etc.</p>
