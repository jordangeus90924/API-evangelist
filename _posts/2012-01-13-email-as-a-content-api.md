{% include JB/setup %}<p>I think email is highly underrated as a content API.I know its not what we traditionally think of as an API, but has a lot of potential as a basic interface into an application.An example of this is If This Then That (iftt).I use iftt to syndicate content to some of my blog platforms.As part of my blogging strategy I want posts I publish on API Evangelist, to also show up on my Blogger, Posterous, Tumblr and Wordpress.</p>
