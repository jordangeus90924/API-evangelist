<p>REST head Glenn Block (<a href="https://twitter.com/gblock">@gblock</a>) over at <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a> asked a simple question on Twitter Wednesday night, Who is using Swagger? I responded, kicking off a conversation that a day later included Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) of <a href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>, Uri Sarid (<a href="https://twitter.com/usarid">@usarid</a>) of <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, and Jakub Nesetril (<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) of <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>.</p>
<p>After the fact, the conversation may be a little unwieldy to follow, but it contains enough insight and nuggets of information, I feel its worth publishing and hopefully continuing in other formats.</p>
<p>The conversation began on Twitter:</p>

<p>I was <a title="taking another look at the Makerbot Thingiverse API the other day" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/14/take-another-look-at-the-thingiverse-3d-printing-community-api/">taking another look at the Makerbot Thingiverse API the other day</a>, and was very pleased with their developer area overhaul. One feature I noticed when playing with my account settings, was the ability to set the default licensing for my "things".</p>
<p>Interestingly this is a feature you don't see in many SaaS apps, let alone as part of API developer settings. I remember first seeing this in my Flickr account settings, and is something I wish I&rsquo;d see it in every platform I use (keep dream'n buddy).</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/flickr/Flickr__Your_Account.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When it comes to user generated content via APIs, this licensing is kind of a big deal. It decides as a user and developer, who ultimately owns the exhaust from your work or just from your daily online world.</p>
<p>I'll be including licensing considerations in the future discussions around the politics of APIs. A setting to determine how user generated content is licensed should not just be a setting in your application account settings, but baked into API developer account settings as well.</p>

<p>I started API Evangelist in 2010 to help business leaders better understand not just the technical, but specifically the business of APIs, helping them be successful in their own API efforts. As part of these efforts I track on what I consider the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of API management</a>. In 2014 I'm also researching what the building blocks are in other areas of the API world, including API <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">deployment</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">discovery</a> and <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">integration</a>.</p>
<p>After taking a quick glance at the fast growing world of API integration tools and services, I've found the following building blocks emerging:</p>

<p>What else are you seeing? Which tools and services do you depend on when you are integrating one or many APIs into your applications? What tools and services would you like to see?</p>
<p>I'm <a title="API Design" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">looking at the world of API design</a> right now, but once I'm done with that research, I will be diving into API integration again, trying to better understand the key players, tools, services and the building blocks they use to get things done.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/api-design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending the next couple weeks going through each of the leading API design approaches: API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger.  Even though I still personally use Swagger in my own work, I&rsquo;m pushing myself to learn API Blueprint and RAML to better understand the landscape, as well as the pros and cons of each approach.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with this emerging trends in API design, they are approaches to defining your APIs either using JSON or a markdown language, which allows you to quantify and describe the API interfaces and underlying data models in a way that allows you to communicate with others, generate mock or production APIs, interactive documentation, code samples and potentially other tooling that will help you be successful in your API initiatives.</p>
<p>While there are other approaches, I&rsquo;m focusing on what I consider to be the three leading approaches right now:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Blueprint" href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></strong> - Using API Blueprint gives you awesome tools for your whole API lifecycle. Use it to discuss your API with others. Generate documentation automatically. Or a test suite</li>
<li><strong><a title="RAML" href="http://raml.org/index.html">RAML</a></strong> - RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a></strong> - Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. The overarching goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server</li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel there is a right or wrong answer to which API design provider you choose. What I want to understand is the nuances of each, how they help us define our APIs, what tooling is available for each, and what does the overall community of developers look like for each.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in the potential of these API design approaches empowering not just developers, but reaching a larger business audience with API design tooling and a language to articulate, and communicate around API resources.  APIs are a very intangible thing, and anything we can do to make them easier to describe is a big deal.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks I will be playing with several basic &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; examples with API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger to help demonstrate what is possible. Then I hope to get more advanced, and understand the tooling available to me from each platform. I&rsquo;ll even look through their roadmaps and talk to their creators to see what the future holds when it comes to API design.</p>

<p>Have you taken a look at the <a title="Thingiverse Developer Area" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/developers">Thingiverse developer area</a> lately? It&rsquo;s been a while since I reviewed it. A couple years ago while working at <a href="http://www.mimeo.com/">Mimeo</a> as an API evangelist I had the pleasure of doing some deep research into not just printing APIs, but <a title="3D printing APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/19/api-driven-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D printing APIs</a>&nbsp;as well. I wrote a lot on the subject, but overall I was unhappy with what was available in the areas of 3D printing APIs.</p>
<p>When you go to the Thingiverse API now, the landing page immediately tells you what is possible, gives you direct links to API documention, but also provides you what you need to get started, sign up and explore the Thingiverse API&mdash;a flow that is so very important!</p>
<p>When you look at the API docs, you immediately see that the API is a simple web API allowing you to manage users, things, their files and copies, while being able to tag, build collections as well as look for the newest, popular and featured things. The Thingiverse API interface is simple, well designed and actually allows you to access some seriously valuable 3D printing resources.</p>
<p>Thingiverse also delivers other critical resources, providing FAQs, application gallery, hackathon and challenge calendar, and a terms of service that provides a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/legal">plain english translation for developers</a>. All essential resources to supporting and growing your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed with the Thingiverse API, not just because it delivers what I envision a 3D printing API should look like, but it is a well-designed, simple implementation of what any API program should look like as well.</p>

<p>API Terms of Use is the single most important building block of any ecosystem, yet it is the least discussed area of API management and integration. I&rsquo;m working hard to dedicated more time in 2014 to not just the area of API TOS, but what I consider to be the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s focus is on making a plain english translation of your terms of service available. I came across a great example over at <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/developers">Makerbot Thingiverse</a> today, where they add:</p>
<blockquote><em>We realize Terms of Service can be confusing and, quite frankly, a snooze- fest; however, they are very important in explaining the basis of what we, the Company, expect of you, the User, while on this Site and how this interaction plays out. We promised &ldquo;understandability&rdquo; so, to the right of each term, we provided a summary in &ldquo;plain English&rdquo;.</em></blockquote>
<p>Music to my ears. Every time I come across an <a title="example of plain english terms of use" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/legal">example of plain english terms of use like this</a>, I&rsquo;m going to write a short blog post on it. While I may not always agree with a company&rsquo;s terms of service, I can get behind approaches to make them simpler, more accessible and understandable by users.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-json-data-store.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing catchup on some of my projects, and one of them is tracking on the evolution of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government">Executive Order 13642</a> from last May, which was the White House directive to make open and machine readable the new default for government information. The piece that I'm tracking on specifically right now is around the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo">OMB Memorandum M-13-13</a> Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, in which one of the items require agencies to publish a data.json file that provides a machine readable inventory of each agencies public data assets.</p>
<p>In short, each federal agencies should round up a list of all their public data assets, make a machine readable JSON file from that list, and publish to the web.  The deadline for publishing was November 30, 2013, and I got caught up in my FAFSA work and the holidays happened, resulting in just getting a chance to take a look at truly take a look at where our government is at with this.</p>
<p>To really quantify where we are at, you have to execute on the core vision of the mandate&mdash;write a script to pull all the federal agencies data.json file. First you pull all the agency&rsquo;s root url using the Federal Agency Directory API from <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/">USA.gov</a>. Then you append data.json to the end of each address, pull each data.json file and get to work!  When executing on this work, you encounter the problem of <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/06/knowing-your-http-status-codes-in-federal-government/">inconsistent HTTP status codes from agency</a>, which I talked about before. Once you navigate this I find:</p>
<ul>
<li>22 Federal Agency Data.json Publish (I also see SEC published, what they did is another story)</li>
<li>5,558 Public Datasets Published (6,479 actual distributions)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just my initial pull, and resulting count. I have only begun hand evaluating what is published, what is not. This is good though right? 22 federal agencies successfully publishing a data.json file for a combined 5,558 datasets available! I know how hard this was to make happen, and I commend everyone for their hard work.  I&rsquo;m a big fan of acknowledging the hard work that goes into this, but then also big fan of pushing back to make sure we keep working. So let&rsquo;s break M-13-13 down, and see if we are really on track.  What did I see during my initial pulling of these 22 data.json files?</p>
<p><strong>Validate Your Data.json Files</strong> <br />My number of piece of advice to give to agencies is make sure you validate your data.json files. <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a> is a free tool, head over there, paste in the contents of your data.json file. Do this after EVERY change. If your data.json doesn&rsquo;t validate, it will just be a headache for consumers. Before you validate, also work hard to clean up your descriptions, abstracts and other fields. Make sure you do away with unnecessary quotes, slashes and other garbage that is just unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>Size of Data.json Files</strong><br />Some of the files are pretty big (wink wink EPA, DOT). I&rsquo;m not sure what the solution is for this, but the bigger the file, the more compute it takes to process. We all need to discuss the solution for this, because it is only going to get worse, and will pretty quickly become unsustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Data.json Fields </strong><br />Overall agencies make good use of the common core meta data fields as recommended in the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/">open data implementation guide for M-13-13</a>. Agencies provided a wealth of descriptions, tags and even provided relevant contact info and other important meta data for listings. I'm analyzing all the fields used an will be providing a deeper analysis of how well they tagged, are there duplicate descriptions. in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Distribution Field</strong><br />There is one critical field in each data.json listing called distribution, which can be a listing of multiple file types for a single data set. For example the dataset might be a list of government acronyms, and you might have a CSV version, as well as Spreadsheet, XML and / or JSON versions. There are 5,858 datasets I&rsquo;ve recorded so far, and there are 6,479 distributions for those datasets. However, only 3,766 of the 5,858 datasets use the distribution field, relying on the Download URL or Access URL as the reference to where the dataset is located&mdash;this is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Format Types of Distribution Files</strong><br />One of the benefits of an agency using the distribution field, is that each entry has a format field, allowing me to understand the format of each dataset, such as HTML, XML, JSON, CSV or other. While this value should be a valid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type">internet media typ</a>e--they all pretty random entries. So the best I can extrapolate right now is 2,550 are html, 2,479 are xml, 13 are json 177 are csv, 285 are xls and the rest are some other format&mdash;including PDF which, well, which is a problem.  Another big problem is almost half are html references, which if it meant structured HTML would be one thing, but mostly means it is a web page with some sort of form you can extract data yourself (not in line with M-13-13 vision).  So 2,954 are truly machine readable (the whole point of the exercise), and 2,904 are not really or can&rsquo;t be identified as so. Ok, so around 50% of the datasets are machine readable (maybe, hopefully), which will have to be tested with another round of scripts and lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Progress </strong><br />How do we track progress on what is going on with federal agency&rsquo;s data.gov files, from here forward? The best I can come up with for right now is to store a copy of data.json files each time I pull. You can find these archives on my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/tree/gh-pages/data/json-archive">federal government research Github repository</a>. I will also be pulling a copy of the 6,479 dataset distributions and storing on Amazon S3, depending on what it costs me to pull, transfer and store. Then I will work on some diff, and month to month analytics based upon agency&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Quality Of Datasets </strong><br />I give the overall data.json effort of agencies a C grade. It very much has that, &ldquo;we got our homework in on time&rdquo; feel to it. The leading agencies did what they were supposed to, but ultimately didn&rsquo;t put a whole of of care into the quality of work. The 5000+ datasets reflect what I was saying in my advice for the federal government that came out today on Govfresh, we have a lot of house cleaning to do.</p>
<p>So how should OMB, OSTP and GSA respond to this C level effort by federal agencies? They should:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Help the agencies who DID publish, refine what they published. Bring in outside help if necessary, clean up data, listings and demonstrate to agencies what was done, and how they can continue doing better in the future.</li>
<li>Help the agencies who DID NOT publish, by going through their websites, finding high value, already published datasets and convert them to JSON and generate a data.json file for them to publish on their websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would help agencies who are already on board understand more about what is needed from the consumer side of things, and why quality in their data..json listings and datasets is so very, very important. It would also help agencies who aren&rsquo;t on board get their data inventory process kickstarted. It should all be able to be done in Q1 2014, then by Q2 we can get rolling with next steps with Data.gov.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I&rsquo;m not naive about the amount of work that went into the 22 agencies getting these 5,000+ datasets published, but we can&rsquo;t stop there. If you want to see meaningful data journalism, data visualizations, web and mobile apps incorporate this hard work into their own efforts, we have to clean things up. Remember Washington, you can&rsquo;t do it alone. You have to figure out a way to open these up and allow the public to help clean, organize and add value to the data you have published in addition to your own efforts.</p>
<p>It is a healthy start, but we have so much more work.</p>

<p>During the recent federal government shutdown this last fall, the concept of API redundancy became much more important for me, and I hope for others as well. The need to ensure public open data and APIs, as well as private sector resources, stay available is becoming increasingly vital.</p>
<p>As I work through these thoughts I'm playing with different approaches to caching some types of APIs. In my experimentation, I'm using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">RedHat OpenShift</a>&nbsp;to deploy caches of commonly used APIs resources.</p>
<p>Each type of API deployment is designed to sync with the mothership upon activation, and then receive regular updates of data via API + webhooks, with all updates to the code being done with Github.</p>
<p>In the future maybe we can make API addressing work somewhat like peer-to-peer file sharing, where I can receive multiple API endpoints for a common resource. Of course this wouldn't work for more unique APIs, but for commonly used APIs it could be a way to create redundancy and establish in fault tolerance in our applications.</p>
<p>At first I will be testing this out with data APIs like government facility locations by topic or state, then more complex API resources like website screenshots, or image manipulation APIs. If you have any specific type of API you'd like to see deployed in this way, let me know.</p>

<p>I had a friend ask me for help with their talk submission for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">#APIStrat in Amsterdam</a>. He was concerned that his talk was too product pitchy, and wanted help making it something that not just would be accepted by our event, but something community would want to hear.</p>
<p>It is good to hear the concern, its true we want the best talks at #APIStrat, we don&rsquo;t want to have a bunch of product pitches, we are seeking stories of API strategy and the practices from the trenches of API design, deployment and management.</p>
<p>Additionally, the audience doesn't want to hear it. I know many companies are focused on selling their products and services, but event audiences don't care. #APIStrat participants wants to hear about how you are solving the problems they face, using APIs.</p>
<p>Sure your product or service may solve their problems, but telling them this isn't good enough. You need intelligently articulate the problem and walk the the story of how the problem can be solved, in a compelling way. Sure your product or service may be woven in there, but it can't be the central actor in the story. You need to work extra hard to find a story that is meaningful to the #APIstrat audience, and provide details they can take home with them and apply in their own worlds.</p>
<p>We are still looking for more stories of <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> from the trenches. Our <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/contact-call-for-papers.php">call for papers</a> is only open for another week, so make sure and polish your story and get it submitted.

<p><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/?q=ericsson">Ericsson once had around 19 APIs available</a> via their <a href="https://labs.ericsson.com/">Ericsson Labs platform</a>. After doing a round of looking through all the APIs I track on, I noticed they have ALL gone away. They are still doing a lot of research, but they seem to have lost their interest in APIs all together.</p>
<p>I have no problem with experimentation and playing around with different resources, and even the deprecation of APIs, with appropriate communication, when it makes sense. I know Ericsson exploration is via their labs, and isn't really meant for production, but it grinds on me when there are APIs be played with, then all of sudden one day they are gone, with no trace.</p>
<p>If you are experimenting with APIs, I recommend leaving some sort of landing page behind, with some trace of the exhaust from your research, experimentation--if possible open source your work. You put APIs out there and expect developers to come, play and give you feedback with no compensation&mdash;the least you can do is leave some of that research or assetts behind for the industry to put to use, or at least for us to understand that this has occurred at some point in time.</p>
<p>I don't know why your API initiatives didn&rsquo;t work or were closed down, but I think in general it leaves a bad taste in developers mouths--I know it sure does in mine. Experimentation and iteration is fine, but if you want the public to care about your research in the future, leave some of the exhaust from your research behind, so we can derive meaning and value fromit. If nothing else, just a landing page that explains what happened, otherwise we wil stop giving a shit in the future and are unlikely to participate.</p>

<p>The latest<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/ibm-forms-watson-business-group-will-commercialization-follow-7000024929/"> tech news to come out of IBM this week is a brand new business group to push innovation around the IBM Watson platform</a>, with IBM committed to spending $1B on the new business group, with $100M set aside to fund startups who build on top of the Watson platform.</p>
<p>The introduction of the new business group may be in response to the media&rsquo;s, and analyst&rsquo;s chatter about less than impressive results so far with the Watson platform&rsquo;s ability to generate revenue, with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304887104579306881917668654">$100M revenue over the last three years, according to the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>There was a post on on ReadWrite today, called <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/01/10/watson-fails-to-compute-hadoop#awesm=~osBWHG1mh2rWcB">IBM's Watson Fails To Compute In A World Of Open-Source Hadoop</a>, where Matt Assay nails the reason: <em>Where Are The Watson Developers?</em></p>
<p>When you visit the "<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.shtml">IBM Watson Ecosystem Program</a>&rdquo;, you get a lot of text, and then even more text contained in PDF&rsquo;s telling how much you can innovate with the platform. Then when you are ready there is a pretty lengthy form to fill out, where you can tell them what you want to do with Watson, and hit submit and hope they will let you in. They also have a Twitter, Facebook and Youtube account, but really it doesn't smell of &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; where &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; is happening.  I've looked at over 10K &ldquo;ecosystems&rdquo;, which about less than 500 are truly &ldquo;innovating&rdquo;, and after a while you start to be able to smell the signs of success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the IBM Watson platform doesn&rsquo;t offer value, I&rsquo;m just saying the team doesn't know how to make "innovation" happen. They need to loosen up, stop being so enterprise, and open up a little bit. We know you got some APIs behind there, make them accessible to ANYONE, make registration self-service, and give us some dead simple, meaningful, powerful web API endpoints to play with that will stimulate our imaginations.</p>
<p>There are proven ways to limit the access new developers so they don&rsquo;t get out of hand, and models for developing incentive ladders that incentivize developers to not just play, but actual develop solid apps that can deliver and will actually evolve into real world business models.</p>
<p>Analytics and feedback loops can be put in place that allow you to easily control the moochers and bad actors, while stimulating and listening to the true innovators, allowing the Watson team to iterate and evolve API endpoints that don&rsquo;t just cater to one industry, but any business sector.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just develop an powerful resource like Watson, make it available in the cloud, label the platform an&ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo;, provide some case studies and innovation magically happens. You have to let go a little, and allow developers to come on board, play, imagine, fail, and push the boundaries of what is possible. This doesn&rsquo;t happen when you have total control over everything that happens.</p>
<p>Bringing a true developer ecosystem to life around Watson will be more than just about the technology, you need to put in place the essential building blocks developers need to be successful, let a little oxygen into the mix, then I think you will find the innovation and ultimately the revenue you are looking for from Watson.</p>

<p>There is an excellent post in GovFresh by former Presidential Innovation Fellow and Githubber Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>), <a title="Why no one uses your government data" href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/one-uses-government-data/">Why no one uses your government data</a>?</p>
<p>Ben is looking to address one of the biggest problems with open data in government. That data is just opened, purely to check a box on some requirement imposed on agencies. The data steward doesn&rsquo;t actually put any thought into how the data will be used, and is just taking advantage of positive re-enforcement associated with opening up the data.</p>
<p>This is not just a problem in federal, state or city government. This same problem occurs in the private sector as well. While it takes work to open up data and other resources via APIs, it takes even more work to see things through the eyes of a consumer. Making the data clean and actually usable by data journalists, in visualizations and applications is hard work.</p>
<p>We need to raise the bar when it comes to open data. If you work in government, non-profit or company, your work isn&rsquo;t done when you release your open data or API, you need to see things through and ask yourself one simple question: <strong><em>How can you optimize the experience for the consumer?</em></strong></p>

<p>Building on my last post,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/10/lessons-in-gov-open-data-optimize-for-consumer/">Lessons In Gov Open Data: Optimize For Consumer</a>, I want to share another important lesson for people working on open data in government. This very important lesson is about good data narration or storytelling around your data, not just publishing it as is.</p>
<p>This lesson is triggered by a great post over at <a title="Gnip" href="http://blog.gnip.com">Gnip</a>, where <a href="http://blog.gnip.com/data-narration/">Eric Swayne, Director of Product of MutualMind talks about the fundamentals of good data narration</a>.  Swayne starts out by saying that:</p>
<blockquote><em>People that live in data analysis have the crucial opportunity for extracting meaning that transforms businesses through data-driven decisions, and it takes much more than just pushing out the monthly graphs and charts</em></blockquote>
<p>Swayne continues to talk about the trademarks of good data narration which include true insights, user-centric approach, and idea inception. This is critical in releasing data in government, it isn&rsquo;t just about the release, it is about releasing the data, providing insights associated with the data, and tailoring it for as wide as possible audience, with the goal of triggering something new within the minds and imaginations of these potential consumers.</p>
<p>Remember, if you are opening up data in government, your work is not done once you release. It is your role as a data steward to narrate and tell the story of the data in a way that will relay the value to potential end-users and consumers, so that they may build on that value through visualizations, applications and even other stories--without the story it is just data. :-(</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiaxle-logo-2.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I got a email today letting me know that <a href="http://apiaxle.com/docs/acquisition-statement/">cloud platform Exicon, purchase API management provider ApiAxle</a>, further whittling away at all of the original and second wave of API management providers I&rsquo;ve been tracking on over the last 4 years.</p>
<p>ApiAxle first showed up as a blip on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/roundup-of-20-api-service-providers-in-2012/">2012 API management provider roundup</a> when:</p>
<blockquote><em>ApiAxle started out as a side project when Phil Jackson was CTO at Qwerly and found their API management provider didn't quite fit the needs of a busy, commercial API. API growth had already exploded back then and so, in the same way you could pick from a plethora of databases or webservers, there seemed an obvious space for an open source API management platform. That's when ApiAxle was born.</em></blockquote>
<p>According to Phil Jackson, the ApiAxle brand will continue to live as part of the Exicon suite of products, and he will keep evolving his baby. While it is 2014 now, I would consider this acquisition the last of a string of API management acquisitions we saw in 2014 which included Layer7, Mashery, and Apiphany.</p>
<p>These leaves just a handful of API management providers on the acquisition table in 2014, including 3Scale, Apigee, Mashape and Apiary.io. Who is next? Will API management platforms be as hot of a commodity in 2014?</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Data.gov has continued to evolve, adding data sets, agencies and features. With recent, high profile stumbles like with Healthcare.gov, it can be easy to fall prey to historical stereotypes that government can't deliver tech very well. While this may apply in some cases, I think we can confidently get behind the movement that is occurring at Data.gov, with 176 agencies working to add 54,723 data sets in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that before we look towards the future of what the roadmap looks like for Data.gov, we need to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">spend a great deal of time refining and strengthening what we currently have available at Data.gov</a>, and across the numerous government agency developer areas. Even with these feelings, I can't help but think about what is needed for the next couple years of Data.gov, in a more technical sense.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm biased, but I think the next steps for Data.gov is all API. How do we continue evolving Data.gov, and prepare to not just participate, but lead in the growing API economy?</p>
<p><strong>Management Tools for Agencies</strong><br /> We need to invest in management tools for agencies, commercial providers as well as <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a>. Agencies need to be able to focus on the best quality data sets and API designs, and not have to worry about the more mundane necessities of API management like access, security, documentation and portal management. Agencies should have consistent analytics, helping them understand how their resources are being accessed and put to use. If OSTP, OMB, GSA and the public expect consistent results when it comes to open data and APIs from agencies, we need to make sure they have the right management tools.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoint Design Tools for Data Sets</strong><br /> Agencies should be able to go from dataset to API without much additional work. Tools should be made available for easily mounting published datasets, then allow non-developers to design API endpoints for easily querying, filtering, accessing and transforming datasets. While data download will still be the preferred path for many developers, making high value datasets available via APIs will increase the number of people who access, that may not have the time to deal with the overhead of downloads.</p>
<p><strong>Common Portal Building Blocks</strong><br /> When you look through each of the <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">50+ federal agency /developer areas</a>, you see 50+ different approaches to delivering the portals that developers will depend on to learn about, and integrate with each agencies APIs.  A common set of building blocks is needed to help agencies standardize how they deliver their developer portals. Each individual approach might make sense within each agency, but as a consumer when you try to work across agencies it can be a confusing maze of API interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Developer Registration<br /></strong> As a developer I need to establish a separate relationship with each federal agency. This quickly becomes a barrier to entry, one that will run off even the most seasoned developers. We want to incentivize developers to use as many federal APIs as possible, and by providing them with a single point of registration, and a common credential that will work across agencies will stimulate integrations and adoptions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Application Keys</strong><br /> To accompany the standard developer registration, a standard approach to user and application keys is needed across federal agencies. As a user, I should be able to create a single application definition and receive API keys that will work across agencies. The amount of work required to develop my application and manage multiple API keys will prevent developers from adopting multiple federal agency APIs. Single registration and application keys will reduce the barriers to entry for the average developer when looking to build on top of federal API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Tooling and Analytics</strong><br /> When integrating with private sector APIs, developers enjoy a wide range of tools and analytics that assist them in discovering, integrating, managing and monitoring their application's integration with various APIs. This is something that is very rare in integration with federal government APIs. Standard tooling and analytics for developers needs to become part of the standard operating procedures for federal agency /developer initiatives, helping developer be successful in all aspects of their usage of government open data and APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML</strong><br /> All APIs produced in government should be described using on of the common API definitions formats that have emerged like Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML. These all provide a machine readable description of an API and its interface that can be used in discovery, interactive documentation, code libraries and SDKs and many other uses. Many private sector companies are doing this, and the federal should follow the lead.</p>
<p><strong>Discoverability, Portable Interfaces and Machine Readable by Defaul</strong>t<br /> As with open data, APIs need to be discoverable, portable and machine readable by default. Describing APIs in Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML will do this. Allowing APIs to be presented, distributed and reused in new ways. This will allow each agency to publish their own APIs, but aggregators can take machine readable definitions from each and publish in a single location. This approach will allow for meaningful interactions such as with budget APIs, allowing a single budget API site to exist, providing access to all federal agencies budget without having to go to each /developer area, but there are many more examples like this that will increase API usage and extend the value of government APIs. If you are familiar with data.json, think api.json.</p>
<p><strong>API Hubs</strong><br /> A new breed of API directories have emerged. API portals like <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> and <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">API Hub</a> don&rsquo;t just provide a directory of APIs, they simplify API management for providers and integration for API consumers. Federal agencies need to make their APIs friendly to these API hubs, maintaining active profiles on all platforms and keeping each API listed within the directories and actively engaging consumers via the platforms. Federal agencies shouldn&rsquo;t depend on developers coming to their /developer areas to engage with their APIs, agencies need to reach out where developers are already actively using APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Consistent API Interface Definition Models</strong><br /> Within the federal government each API is born within its own agencies silo. Very little sharing of interface designs and data models occurs across agencies, resulting in APIs that may do the same thing, but can potentially do it in radically different ways. Common APIs such as budget or facility directories should be using a common API interface design and underlying data model. Agencies need to share interface designs, and work together to make sure the best patterns across the federal government are used.</p>
<p><strong>Webhooks</strong><br /> In the federal government APIs are often a one-way street allow developers to come and pull information. To increase the value of data and other API driven resources, and help reduce the load on agencies servers, APIs need to push data out to consumers, reducing the polling on APIs and making API integration much more real-time. Technologies such as the Webhook which allows API consumer to provide a web URL, in which agencies can push newly published data, changes and other real-time events to users, are being widely used to make APIs much more of a two-way street.</p>
<p><strong>Hypermedia</strong><br /> As the world of web APIs evolve there are new approaches emerging to delivering the next generation of APIs, and hypermedia is one of these trends. Hypermedia brings a wealth of value, but most importantly it provides a common framework for APIs to communicate, and provide essential business logic and direction for developers, helping them better use APIs in line with API provider goals. Hypermedia has the potential to not just make government assets and resources available, but ensure they are used in the best interest of each agency. Hypermedia is still getting traction in the private sector, but we are also seeing a handful of government groups take notice. Hypermedia holds a lot of potential for federal agencies, and the groundwork and education around this trend in APIs needs to begin.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelists Present</strong><br /> The first thing you notice when you engage with an government API, is nobody is home. There is nobody to help you understand how it works, overcome obstacles when integrating, there is no face to the blog posts, the tweets or the forum replies. Federal government APIs have no personality. Evangelists are desperately needed to bring this critical human element to federal government APIs. All successful private sector APIs have an evangelist or an army of evangelists, spreading the word, supporting developers, and making things work. We need open data and API evangelists at every federal agency, lettings us know some one is home.</p>
<p><strong>Read / Write</strong><br /> I know this is a scary one for government, but as I said above in the webhooks section&mdash;APIs need to be a two way street. There are proven ways to make APIs writeable without jeopardizing the integrity of API data. Allow for trusted access, let developers prove themselves. There is a lot of expertise, &ldquo;citizen cycles&rdquo;, and value available in a developer ecosystem. When a private sector company uses federal government data, improves on it, the government and the rest of the ecosystem should be able to benefit as well. The federal government needs to allow for both read and write on APIs&mdash;this will be the critical next step that makes government APIs a success.</p>
<p>These are just 14 of my recommendations for the next steps in the API strategy for the federal government. As I said earlier, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">none of this should be done without first strengthening what we all have already done in the federal government around open data and APIs</a>. However, even though we need to play catch up on whats already there, we can&rsquo;t stop looking towards the future and understand what needs to be next.</p>
<p>None of these recommendations are bleeding edge or technology just for technology sake. This is about standardizing how APIs are designed, deployed and managed across the federal government, emulating what is already being proven to work in the private sector. If the federal government wants to add to the <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/">OpenData500</a>, and establish those meaningful stories needed to deliver on the promise of open data and APIs--this is whats needed.</p>
<p>With the right leadership, education and evangelism, open data and APIs can become part of the DNA of our federal government. We have to put aside our purely techno-solutionism view of #OpenGov and realize this is seriously hard work, with many pitfalls, challenges, politics and that in reality it won&rsquo;t happen over night. However, if we dedicate the resources needed, we can not just change how government works, making it machine readable by default, we can forever alter how the private and public sector partners.</p>

<p>It has taken me a while to respond to a post I read this weekend, by Mike Caulfield (<a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a>) called <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/01/03/revenge-of-the-os/">Revenge of the OS</a>. In short he points out the fragment world we live in with all of our apps, and the shortcoming of tech companies to actually deliver a solution that truly works for end-users.</p>
<p>Our desktop computer has always been the doorway to our digital worlds, and then came the Internet, and the Web 2.0 age where iGoogle (now dead), Facebook Apps (how many apps do you use these days), and other &ldquo;mega-services&rdquo; promised to be the doorway to our now online digital worlds.</p>
<p>Mike talks about how his daughter, who 4 years ago depended on Facebook to access her world, now &ldquo;moves fluidly between Tumblr, Snapchat, Instagram, and Vine accounts, with the notifications panel her point of integration&rdquo;. Our devices have become the doorway to our online, digital lives.</p>
<p>All of this is the result of tech companies, driven by their VC overlords, pushing to become the point of control for user identity and the pipes in which that users data flows&mdash;-at all costs! Sure these companies pay lip service to the interoperability that could fix this and employ OpenID, oAuth and use APIs, but without true investment and an honest belief in interoperability with other platforms, even competitors, it all means absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>The tech giants have the power to lead, come together and establish strong openID or oAuth alliances, strengthening tools, simplifying user experience, but they don&rsquo;t. Innovative startups like <a href="http://oauth.io">oAuth.io</a> from Webshell, and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> are left to do the heavy lifting, and the user is still left with a fragmented, cumbersome experience as they jump from cloud to cloud, across potentially several devices like smart phone, laptop, xBox, and tablets.</p>
<p>This world is only going to get worse, tech companies of all sizes show very little interest in truly working together. Sure, there are anomalies, and every has their own APIs, but there are no meaningful API standards, very little sharing of API interface designs and no investment in common identity approaches and tooling.</p>
<p>This insanity will grow exponentially defined by the number of internet connected devices that we adopt, including phones and tablets, but is being extended to our cars, homes, clothing, glasses and much, much more.</p>

<p>Building on my thoughts around <a title="preparing your API for wholesale access" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/is-your-api-ready-for-wholesale/">preparing your API for wholesale access</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking through the problem of developer API access when you have API providers offering up each others APIs, and bundling them seamlessly as part of their own API stack.</p>
<p>In this scenario I&rsquo;m working through, API provider A has an API they offer up wholesale to partners, and API provider B wants to bundle API provider A&rsquo;s API along with their own, adding value to their API and developer community.</p>
<p>In this scenario API provider B doesn&rsquo;t want their developers to have to sign up for a separate API key with API provider A, the developer should just have to create one account and use one key for their application.</p>
<p>To make this seamless, both API providers need to have their own APIs for their API management system, allowing users and keys to be provisioned programmatically. All API provider A needs to do is create a service tier for their wholesale partners to have access to account and application provisioning, so their partners can seamlessly generate new accounts for their new developer accounts and switch API keys when developers uses the wholesale API.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just an academic exercise. It is possible when your <a title="API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers</a>. I just think API providers aren&rsquo;t thinking at this level yet, and thinking about how the future of how their APIs will be consumed in the future, and the potential of sharing users with their API partners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep exploring the various elements needed to make your API available in a wholesale way. Having an <a title="API for your API management infrastructure" href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/activedocs#/account_management_api">API for your API management infrastructure</a> is definitely essential, and next I will be looking at having a machine readable API definition, and permissible terms of service (TOS).</p>

<p>As the number of public APIs grows well beyond 10K, expecting that developers will discover, let alone come to your developers area regulary will be reduced to just a fantasy. In this new API driven economy, your API will need to be decoupled, portable, and available in a wholesale manner, allowing other API providers to hang your valuable API resources in their own developers area.</p>
<p>If your API is developed in a simple, standard way, described using a common API definition format like Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, your account provisioning and management has an API, and terms of service (TOS) are flexible--you will be bundled with leading API platforms, available in the growing number of backend as a service (BaaS) platforms, and easily listed in API hubs like Mashape and APIHub.</p>
<p>In 2014 it won&rsquo;t be enough to just have an API and a developer area with all the <a title="essential API building block" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">essential building blocks</a>, you need to make sure your API is ready for re-use and re-sale. Sure we all want to be the Twilio of the API universe, but in reality we need developers to use our resources. Of course this approach to API deployment won&rsquo;t be for every API, some resources just can&rsquo;t be resold like this, but for many of the API resources I&rsquo;m seeing in the space, it will be the difference between life or death.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/timezone_UTC.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/developers">Dwolla API</a> sent out an email to developers today, letting us know that, "Effective January 21, 2014, all timestamps returned by REST API endpoints will be in UTC format.&rdquo;  Dwolla is looking to fix the issue of ambiguous timestamps, where the time zone is&nbsp;variable and not indicated in the timestamp.</p>
<p>Currently the timestamps look like: <em>9/20/2013 12:45:07 AM</em></p>
<p>After the switch to UTC they will look like: <em>2010-11-12T13:14:15Z</em></p>
<p>Formatted according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 standard</a>. This is a much cleaner, internationalized approach. I&rsquo;ve seen this mistake a lot, and still do it myself on some new systems. As an self-centered american, we tend to think the world evolves around us, and we don&rsquo;t think about these scaling issues ahead of time.</p>
<p>Are your API data formats in UTC? No? Maybe it is something you want to change before you grow too big and get too many developers on your API.</p>

<p>I stopped counting the number of successful applications that have had their private APIs reversed engineered by some savvy users,&nbsp;<a title="Snapchat API reverse engineered" href="http://apivoice.com/2014/01/08/are-your-api-security-practices-in-better-shape-than-the-snapchat-api/">Most recently Snapchat</a>, and famously the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/">original rogue Instagram API</a> was developed this way, and even auto maker <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/forum/forums/flaws-rest-api-authentication">Tesla had their API reverse engineered</a>.</p>
<p>This is fresh on my my mind because of the <a title="Snapchat security breach" href="http://apivoice.com/2014/01/08/are-your-api-security-practices-in-better-shape-than-the-snapchat-api/">Snapchat security breach</a>, in which this savvy tech user notified Snapchat back in August, and the company instituted rate limiting, but still left the API exposed for further attack, which the user took full advantage of in December by scraping all users after documenting and expoiting the private API.</p>
<p>If you are developing a mobile application, you are building an API. Even if you never intend on making this API public, there are huge benefits of going through the motions of pretending like it is&mdash;you will learn a lot! Every application API I&rsquo;ve seen reverse engineered was clearly developed in a rush, thinking that security through obscurity was a solid production strategy.</p>
<p>When you are planning your apps API, stop! Consider what you will need to make this publicly available. The exercise is healthy. Allow for registration of developers and apps, even if it will just be your team signing up. Put in place rate limits, analytics, etc. There are a ton of features that have evolved in the public API space that are transferrable to private APIs.</p>
<p><a title="API Infrastructure Providers" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API infrastructure providers like 3Scale</a> have been working at this for years. You can sign up for a free account, get started without any extra work from your dev team, and you can save any resources for making sure you monitor your API stats on a daily basis and responding to not just security threats, but find tuning how your apps are using your own API.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make the mistake that the Snapchat, Instagram and Teslas of the world have made. Treat your API like it is public, even if you never intend to open it up publicly. You will think differently and be ahead of the curve when it comes to monitoring and security.</p>

<p>If you weren't following the news over the holidays, a rogue group released <a href="http://www.snapchatdb.info/">SnapchatDB</a>, containing the 4.6 million <a title="snapchat" href="http://www.snapchat.com/" target="_blank">Snapchat</a> user profiles, after exploiting the poorly secured mobile application API.</p>
<p>There are opposing views of what's happened, but apparently the group contacted Snapchat in August 2013 letting them know of a potential vulnerability in their API, in which Snapchat claims they responded by instituting rate limiting to address the problem.</p>
<p>Apparently the actual vulnerability wasn't addressed, and in December the group mapped the private API, the company uses for their mobile app. They don't officially have an API, but like most mobile applications, it is right beneath the surface.</p>
<p>After mapping the interface the group proceeded to suck all the data, organized and publish as SnapchatDB, in an effort to raise awareness of the issue and point out that Snapchat was to slow in responding to the exploit.</p>
<p>Regardless of the exact facts, it is clear that Snapchat was lax on security. API rate limiting and other common security measures are pretty common place. <a title="API infrastructure provider" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API providers like 3Scale have been around for years delivering plug and play infrastructure</a> to help you deal with this.

<p>After watching the API space evolve, I've learned one thing, that there are lots of factors that influence the industry, and that the best solution doesn't always win.</p>
<p>As I'm studying the rise of Internet enabled devices, also known as Internet of Things (IoT), you see some devices embrace a RESTful approach to integration with their devices, but often times you see APIs released, but they are wrapped with SDKs.</p>
<p>I'm not making any assumption that SDKs or REST is better when it comes to IoT devices, technically an SDK may or may not provide a stronger solution. However within this approach I think it is easy to pave over the API, making it an after thought--stifling potential innovation that can occur around open endpoints.</p>
<p>When it comes to developing APIs for IoT I don't think engineers are consciously pushing out REST and web APIs, I think they stick with what they know. Without proper education around the larger potential of APIs + SDK, vs SDK only, engineers with go the path of least resistance, and the one they are familiar with.</p>
<p>As the space expands, we need to make sure there are sufficient stories available for IoT engineers to discover, making them aware of the potential of keeping their APIs front and center when integrating their devices to the Internet.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">What Is A Hypermedia API?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>The time has come. In 2014 I will be spending a lot more energy, helping you understand what a Hypermedia API is, and if you should be considering it as part of your own API strategy. I won&rsquo;t be in the business of telling you Hypermedia is always the answer, or that it is bad, I will be working to better understand myself, and along the way hopefully I can share some knowledge with you.</p>
<p>As I do with other technical issues that surround APIs, I will work to simplify, to help reach a wider audience, beyond the development community. If you are a developer and looking to understand Hypermedia APIs I recommend Googling, and exploring other resources (there are plenty). I want to help business leaders understand the potential, not sell developers on the concept.</p>
<p>In my mind, there are two key things that make hypermedia APIs different from common web APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Shared, common way that developers can communicate with the API</li>
<li>Guiding developers with what actions they can take along the way</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of other differentiators, but these are the two that stand out to me. So let&rsquo;s apply. Say you have a product API. A common web API approach might be to return a product, in a JSON format, which will probably be just a list of fields from the database where the products are stored, with the JSON structured in a way that makes sense to you and your development team. It is now up to the developer to interpret how the API responses are structured, and how to integrate into their application. Pretty standard stuff, right?</p>
<p>Now with a Hypermedia API, the API will use a registered media type such as&nbsp;<a title="HAL" href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Collection-JSON" href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collection-JSON</a>, providing a common framework for developers to communicate with the API&mdash;reducing the unknowns in API integration. With the product request, you will get get the same details on the product, but along with the product details you will also get a list of links, providing key insight into what you can actually do with the products returned.</p>
<p>Providing developers with a common way to understand how to communicate with an API, as well as the actions they can take with resources that are available via an API, will increase the chances an API will get used, as well as ensure that the APIs is used in ways that are in alignment with the API providers overall business goals.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions about Hypermedia APIs, let me know, I&rsquo;m happy to address particular topics as I explore this fascinating area of APIs.</p>

<p>I was doing some research in the area of harvesting and scraping APs. I was taking another look at <a href="http://webscrapemaster.com/" target="_blank">Web Scrape Master</a>, a simple scraping API that allows you to pass it a URL and it harvests structured data and content from the page.</p>
<p>The Web Scrape Master is a pretty dead simple API, with a purpose. It does one thing and it does it well. What I found really interesting though, was the fact that lower on the page, below the API documentation the API was for sale. You could buy a copy of the server side of the API and client side tooling as a bundle.</p>
<p>It is a pretty interesting approach, especially for these utility style APIs. You can either use the API provided as a service or you can download, install and use it within your own infrastructure, adding the API to your own stack.</p>
<p>While this isn't possible for all APIs, I think it has promise for many API providers, delivering a sort of on-premise version of their API. I'm getting in the habit of publishing server side code for many of my API designs, I'm will consider some APIs for possible sale in the future as well.</p>
<p>When you think about the growth of containers like <a title="Docker" href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a> and the PaaS solutions like <a title="OpenShift" href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, it makes the possibility of rapidly deployment of utility APIs much more of a reality.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was asked to provides some thoughts on what is next for the US Government API strategy.  I've been thinking about it during my work and travels over the last couple months, and I keep coming back to one thought:&nbsp;<strong>Strengthen What We Have!</strong></p>
<p>I wish I had some new technology or platform for the next wave of government APIs that would ensure success with APIs in Washington, but in reality we need to do what we've been doing, but do it at scale, and get organized and collaborative about how we do it.</p>
<p><strong>Release More Data Sets</strong><br /> There are thousands of data sets available via <a href="http://data.gov">Data.gov</a>, across 176 agencies and numerous categories. We need more. When any content or data is published via a government website, that data needs to also made available via agencies data repositories and Data.gov. Agencies need to understand that releasing open data sets it not something you do every once in a while to meet a mandate or deadline--it is something you do always, forever.</p>
<p><strong>Refine Existing Data Sets</strong><br /> There is a lot of data available currently. However much of it is in various formats, inconsistent data models and isn't always immediately available for use in spreadsheets, applications, visualizations or analysis. There is a great deal of work to be done in cleaning, normalizing and refining of existing data, as well as deploying APIs around open data that would increase adoption and the chances it will be put to use.</p>
<p><strong>Refine Existing APIs</strong><br /> Like open data, there are many existing APIs across the federal government, and these APis could use a lot of work to make them more usable by developers. With a little elbow grease, existing APIs could be standardized by generating common API definitions like Swagger, API blueprint and RAML, which would help quantify all APIs, but also generate interactive documentation, code samples and provide valuable discovery tools for helping understand where interfaces are and what they offer. The mission up until now for agencies is to deploy APIs, and while this remains true, the need to evolve and refine APIs will go a long way towards building those valuable case studies to get to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Robust /developer Areas</strong><br /> There are over 50 agencies who have successful launched a /developer area to support open data and API efforts. Much like open data and the APIs themselves, they represent a mishmash of approaches, and provide varied amounts of resources and necessary support materials. <a href="http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government">HowTo.gov already provides some great information on how to evolve an agencies developer area</a>, we just need some serious attention spent on helping each agency make it so. It doesn't matter how valuable the open data or APIs are, if they are published without proper documentation, support and communication resources, they won't be successful. Robust developer areas are essential to federal agencies finding success in their API iniatives.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Evangelist</strong><br /> Every successful API initiative in the private sector from Amazon to Twilio has employed evangelists to spread the word and engage developers, helping them achieve success in putting API resources to use. Each federal agency needs their own evangelist, to help work with internal stakeholders, making sure open data is published regularly, new APIs are deployed and existing resources are kept operational and up to date. Evangelists should have counterparts at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">OSTP</a> / <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb">OMB</a> / <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/">GSA</a> levels providing feedback and guidance, as well as regular engagement with evangelists in the private sector. Evangelism is the glue that will hold things together across agency, as well as provide the critical outreach to the private sector to increase adoption of government open data and APis.</p>
<p><strong>Build Public / Private Sector Partnerships</strong><br /> Opening up data and APIs by the federal government is about sharing the load with the private sector and the public at large. Open data and APIs represents the resources the private sector will need to build applications, sites, fuel industry growth, and stimulate job creation. A new type of public / private sector partnerships need to be defined, allowing for companies and non-profit groups to access and use government services and resources in a self-service, scalable way. Companies should be able to build businesses around government Internet services, much like the <a title="ecosystem that has grown from the IRS e-File system" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">ecosystem that has grown from the IRS e-File system</a>, with applications like TurboTax that reaches millions of US citizens and allows corporations to help government share the load while also generating necessary revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Establish The Meaningful Case Studies</strong><br /> When it comes to open data and APIs nothing gets people on board more than solid examples of successfel applications that have been build on open data, APIs. Open government proponents use weather data and GPS as solid examples of open data and technology impacting not just government, but also the private sector. We need to fold the IRS e-file ecosystem into this lineage, but also work towards establishing numerous other case studies we can showcase and tell stories about why open data and APIs are important--in ways that truly matter to everyone, not just tech folks.</p>
<p><strong>Educate &amp; Tell Stories Within Government</strong><br /> In order to take open data and APIs to the next level in government there needs to an organized and massive effort to educate people within government about the opportunities around open data and APis, as well as the pitfalls. Regular efforts to educate people within government about the technology, business and politics of APIs needs to be scaled, weaving in relevant stories and case studies as they emerge around open data and APIs. Without regular, consistent education efforts and sharing of success stories across agencies, open data and APIs will never become part of our federal government DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire &amp; Tell Stories Outside Government</strong><br /> As within government, the stories around government open data and APIs needs to be told outside the Washington echo chamber, educating citizens and companies about the availability of open data and APIs, and inspire them to take action by sharing successful stories of other uses of open data and APIs in development of applications.  The potential of using popular platforms like Amazon and Twitter spread through the word of mouth amongst developer and power user communities, the same path needs to be taken with government data and api resources.</p>
<p>The next 2-3 years of the API strategy for the US government will be about good ol fashioned hard work, collaboration and storytelling.  We have  blueprints for what agencies should be doing when it comes to opening up data, deploying APIs and enticing the private sector to innovate around government data, we just need to repeat and scale until we reach the next level.</p>
<p>How do we know when we've reached the next level? When the potential of open data and APIs is understand across all agencies, and the public instinctively knows that you can go to any government domain /developer, and find the resources they need, whether they are individual or a company looking to develop a business around government services.</p>
<p>The only way we will get here is by achieving a solid group of strong case studies showing that we are making change in government using open data and APIs. Think of the IRS e-file system, and how many citizens this ecosystem reaches, and the value generated through commercial partnerships with tax professionals. We need 10-25 of similar stories of how APIs impact people's lives, strengthened the economy and has made government more efficient, before we consider getting to the next level.</p>

<p>Major newspapers having APIs is nothing new. We've heard stories out of the Guardian, New York Times and USA Today having APIs, but after several years where are these API initiatives headed? What is next? Is there innovation going on in the area journalism when it comes to APIs?</p>
<p>This dive into the world of journalism will take some time, but I will start with what I consider to be the leader, <a title="The Guardian Open Platform" href="http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform">The Guardian Open Platform</a>. The UK paper has all the essential <a title="building blocks I would want in an API provider" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks I would want in an API provider</a>, starting with a clean overview and getting started pages to get developers and data journalists up to speed.</p>
<p>The Guardian Open Platform revolves around two API resource, the Content API and Politics API and a vast data store of spreadsheets and other data sets that the Guardian has gathered throughout news cycles. There is an API Explorer which allows you to quickly get your hands dirty with the Guardian APIs, which is essential.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/guardian/guaridan-data-visualization.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is also a variety of code libraries including Java, Scala, Ruby and ColdFusion flavors, as well as an App Gallery showcasing what has been built on the Guardian APIs.</p>
<p>The Guardian Open Platform is supported by an active blog, forum and Twitter account, providing the necessary building blocks to build community around the API.</p>
<p>There appears to be some unique gems under the surface with the Guardian Wordpress plugins and their MicroApp Framework looks like it could be interesting, but I just don't see a lot of information available on it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/guardian">Guardian Github account</a> is pretty active, but most of it is around the Guardian front-end, not for any innovation that you'd expect around open data and APIs.</p>
<p>On the surface, the Guardian Open Platform appears to have everything you need for a successful API platform, but I just don't see anything that stands out and screams "innovation in journalism using APIs". With that said, I have to mention the <a href="http://n0tice.org/">N0tice</a> platform, which is a separate user generated content publishing platform that is developed by the Guardian Media Group.</p>
<p>Maybe there is more going on behind the scenes than I can find in the API portal, but currently it looks like business as usual in the Guardian Open Platform. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I think all newspapers should have this, but you'd think with the leadership position in the space, the Guardian would have some secret sauce simmering on the back burner. I will look at NYT, USA Today and other publications API initiatives, tae a look at N0tice and then come back and take another look before I wrap-up my state of APIs in journalism.</p>

<p>This last week I was running through my network, and noticed the screenshot API had stopped working. It isn't a critical piece of infrastructure so I've used free services and don't really feel the need to monitor in real-time, I just respond when I stop seeing screenshots on the news listing page.</p>
<p>This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, and when I started looking for a new screenshot API I noticed the majority of them now charge, and was in a range I just didn't feel I couldn't afford being a one man show. I knew in the back of my mind that I could develop my own screenshot API solution.</p>
<p>After test driving several image libraries I settled in with <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, which allows me to load and manipulate web pages in an object, and then take a screenshot of the web page in that state. I quickly wrapped in a web API using the Slim Framework in PHP.</p>
<p>Once I had the API deployed I wrapped with my <a title="3Scale API Management Infrastructure" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API management infrastructure</a>, which requires an API key before you can use any of my APIs. Next I updated my company, API and news screenshot tool to use my new screenshot API.</p>
<p>After I get some free time I will clean up the code and publish via Github, so others can deploy their own screenshot API and take the same path I chose.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/15/irs-modernized-efile-mef-a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy-draft/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I look at a lot of APIs, I work hard to brainstorm ideas for potential new APIs, and I can't think of a more important API to not just the API economy, but to the overall economy, than an IRS API that would give citizens access to their income and tax history.</p>
<p>We know the APIs exists, since the same resources are made available via the <a title="IRS Modernized e-File System" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/15/irs-modernized-efile-mef-a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy-draft/">IRS Modernized e-File system</a> to tax professionals. I'm not talking about an API that gives access to every detail of my tax history, but the data I've entered into common forms like W2, 1099, and 1042.</p>
<p>This IRS API would provide simple REST API access to these values, along with an oAuth framework allowing any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approved application developer</span> to access all or portions of our most relevant income and tax data. With oAuth being the access layer to all of this, it would give us, the citizen control over who has access to our history, and how applications can use it.</p>
<p>An IRS API would be used to streamline numerous processes like home loans, student financial aid and other transactions actions we take in our everyday lives. These transactions occur over and over each year, and require manual entry, manual validation and other often cumbersome interactions.</p>
<p>The introduction of an IRS API with oAuth, would also do amazing things for basic digital literacy around oAuth, and who is accessing to our vital information. This type of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">literacy around APIs, oAuth, and data access</a>, is critical to not just a healthy API economy, but is quickly blending with the regular economy.</p>
<p>I'm not naive regarding the politics of such a move, which would uncover huge amounts of corruption, false statements, potentially disrupt existing jobs that are dedicated to these bureaucratic functions, and introduce a new wave of security concerns. However I think the benefits will outweigh the negatives and this represents the next generation of financial literacy.</p>
<p>It is up to the IRS to take the steps necessary to make such an API possible. The data is there, and we know existing web services are in place that facilitate these types of interactions. The IRS just needs to realize the importance role that web APIs and oAuth play in the current digital landscape, prioritize a simple web API design, oAuth deployment and supporting developer area.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/example-form.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm working on an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">API design for the free application for federal student aid form</a>, also known as FAFSA, over the last couple weeks. I took <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/pdf/PdfFafsa13-14.pdf">the form</a> which had over 150 separate fields, and turned into a basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) API. I even added an endpoint that allows you to query and get a list of the fields.</p>
<p>The project is a proof of concept to show the Department of Education what is possible around a FAFSA API. I'm not sure if the API will ever be deployed or adopted by the Department of Education or if by other 3rd party providers, establishing a sort of federated FAFSA API network. My goal is to just generate the API definition with supporting server and client side tooling, to show what is possible.</p>
<p>As I assess my work over the last couple weeks on FAFSA, I can't help but think how this should be standard practice for all forms. If you do a simple search at google for "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=forms&amp;oq=forms&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i65j69i60l3j69i59.752j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">forms</a>", you get IRS forms, immigration, legal, voter registration and yes the FAFSA forms. It is clear that forms still dominate our lives--print and PDF.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that simple, open designs and tooling around forms would help us continue evolve the concept of the "form" beyond the just the PDF. Sure the PDF still has a place, and some tooling can work with consuming and publishing as PDF, but APIs could help us innovate around what is a form, how users enter their data into them, and take advantage of newer technologies like tablets.</p>
<p>In my opinion, every form should be an API. If you'd like help developing a new form as an API or evolving an older print or PDF form as an API, feel free to <a href="http://kinlane.com/contact/">reach out</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/pop-up-archive-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time talking to folks on the phone, Skype, in Google Hangouts and in person about their API business models. Not everyone I talk with is willing to share their story public, so I'm also happy when I meet folks who are as open and transparent about figuring all of this out as I am.</p>
<p>This morning I spoke with Anne and Bailey over at the <a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank">Pop Up Archive</a> about their upcoming API, and potential business model(s) for their API when ready. We talked about their immediate API release and then brainstormed about how to get the word out, how people might use the API, and possible approaches monetization.</p>
<p>The Pop Up Archive is an <a href="https://www.popuparchive.org/">audio transcription service</a>, allowing you to publish audio files and receive back full text transcriptions of the audio. It is a pretty straightforward service, and they will be releasing an API so others can use the audio transcription service in their own apps, as well as access the wealth of audio resources they are amassing in their archive.</p>
<p>Even with the straightforward nature of this upcoming API resource, the question of who will use this service, and what they are willing to pay comes up--something we spent the good part of an hour discussing. We should have recorded, then we'd have the transcription, but since we didn't here are some of my thoughts from today's discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Your API Is Tech and Business Research &amp; Development</strong><br /> The tech space moves fast, and success is all about getting your API up and running, allow for developers to use, even if it is just within a trusted group, then iterate and evolve as you gain more knowledge about what people want and how they will be using it. You can speculate from now until the cows come home about how people will use, but until you have it up and running you won't know for sure. When you approach your API with a R&amp;D mindset, you will be much more open to opportunities and more resilient when things go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Rolling Out With Minimum Viable Monetization Strategy</strong><br /> When you are pioneering into a new area of API resources, it can be tough to know what the market is willing to pay. Start with identifying your hard costs like compute, storage and bandwidth, tack on a reasonable profit and get your API open for business in a beta release. Make it clear that things will change, but let people start using your API, pay for basic services and begin understanding more about their usage and what your first wave of customers are willing to pay. Over time, you can evolve your monetization strategy, building on what your hard costs are, the value you deliver to your users, and ultimately what they are willing to pay for your service(s).</p>
<p><strong>Casting A Wide Net To Identify Target Audience Beyond Obvious Ones</strong><br /> When identifying their potential target audience, the Pop Up Archive starting with the obvious ones like radio and journalists, but then how do they potentially identify other areas, that aren't so obvious? You do this by first by getting your API up and available in some sort of private beta. To support the API release, publish a blog and twitter account and get to work telling the stories of your API, which Pop Up Archive has done. Then get to work telling the details of every step of your journey, and every use case of the obvious target groups. These stories will become your net, and the wider you cast the net, including as many keywords as you can, and the number of stories you tell, the wider possible audience you will draw in. The Pop Up Archive introductory video says that if you don't provide text representations of your audio, they won't be found in searches--when it comes to APIs, if you don't tell stories of the problems your API solves, users will never find it when searching for solutions to their problems.</p>
<p><strong>Not All API Consumers Are Created Equally</strong><br /> When identifying your API consumers make sure you get to know their needs and goals. In the case of the Pop Up Archive, some users may be using the API for audio transcription, while others may be using it to gain access to the rich library of audio uploaded by other users. These two groups will have radically different needs, and possess very differ thresholds of what they will pay for API access. While it makes sense to charge audio transcription users for the heavy lifting of transcribing, you want to incentivize archive users to access, syndicate and share as much content as you can. Why even charge them? With a proper branding strategy these users can become the marketing vehicle of the API, building directories, sites, widgets and other content syndication that could potentially drive new users to the API.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/pop-up-archive-tapes.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Anne and Bailey are doing a great job of approaching their API strategy in a very open and agile way. The worst thing any API provider can do is approach their strategy with a very rigid view, thinking they understand exactly how developers should use an API resource. The Pop Up Archive has built a great service that does two things, and does them well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Audio Transcription</li>
<li>Audio + Transcription Archive</li>
</ul>
<p>They provide a clean, easy to use website, and now they are preparing a first version of their API, with accompanying documentation, code samples and widgets. They have identified their operational costs and are developing an appropriate fee for the service that is based upon the number of minutes of audio you are processing.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Pop Up Archive will open their API for business with a handful of beta partners and begin iterating on the technology and business of their API platform. While there are a lot of unknowns, Anne and Bailey realize they just need to just get up and running, engage their users, and establish a feedback loop that will then help define the future of their API and its business model.</p>
<p>Your API is a an external, R&amp;D lab for your business. While you will be producing real products and services out of this lab, you need to approach operations with an agile state of mind, enabling you to be open to use cases and business models you may never have conceived when you set out  on this road. If you do this, your chances of success will significantly increase.</p>
<p>What sort of uses cases and business models do you envision for the Pop Up Archive?</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://portal.ehawaii.gov/page/subscriber-services/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/state-government/hawaii-gov-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The question of whether government should charge for APIs and other digital services came up again this week during a Google Hangout I did with Luke Fretwell(<a href="https://twitter.com/lukefretwell">@lukefretwell</a>) of <a href="https://twitter.com/govfresh">@GovFresh</a>. I began exploring this concpet last year in my post, <a title="Should the Government Subsidize and Profit from Data Market" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">Should the Government Subsidize and Profit from Data Market</a>, after talking with several city government open data folks.</p>
<p>Luke had pointed me to a page on the <a href="https://portal.ehawaii.gov/page/subscriber-services/">Hawaii.gov website that described their subscriber services</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>A subscriber account offers the benefit of monthly invoicing and payment and provides convenience to users who conduct large volumes of online transactions through our website. In some cases, a subscriber account is also required to access a specific online service.</em></blockquote>
<p>Many people I talk to in the open data space have reacted negatively when I propose the idea of government charging for access to services, but as reflected in Hawaiis approach, this is just for higher volume and heavy commercial use cases.</p>
<p>It costs money to gather and organize government data, design, deploy and manage APIs. I feel strong that many of the resources coming out of government should be free and open for access, but in the cases where it is incurring huge costs for government to provide, it might make sense to pass costs off to consumers.</p>
<p>Think of any other physical government assets like city, county, state, or national parks. These are open for anyone to access, and many are even free, but if you want to use them for commercial purposes, you have to pay. Virtual resources should be seen in a similar light.</p>
<p>However, this could easily evolve into a negative analogy, because park access fees sometimes can seem ridiculous, and I want to incentivize consumption of government open data and APIs through as wide of access as possible--not scare people away.</p>
<p>My goal here is to not take a for or against stance, but to stimulate conversation around the topic and see where it makes sense to apply. I don't think government charging for access is applicable in all areas of open data and APIs, but if it will ensure better quality of service and potentially fund new data and APIs, I think it can be a good idea. What do you think?</p>

<p>The terms of service for APIs is the single most important building block of an API strategy, one that dictates how developers can access and put API resources to use and sets the tone for an entire API ecosystem. Your API can be publicly available, but the terms of service and licensing will determine whether it is truly open.</p>
<p>Even with the importance of this area of API operations, there aren't a lot of open resources to help guide you through crafting your API licensing and terms of service properly--until now.</p>
<p>A group of swedish entrepreneurs <a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/danielrudmark">Daniel Rudmark</a> of <a href="https://www.viktoria.se/">Viktoria Swedish ICT</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elias-arnestrand/1/922/64b">Elias Arnestrand</a> of  <a href="http://www.samtrafiken.se/">Samtrafiken</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anna-mirsch/83/936/14a">Anna Mirsch</a> lawyer at <a href="http://www.mannheimerswartling.se/">Mannheimer Swartling</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/andreaskrohn">Andreas Krohn</a> at <a href="http://dopter.se/">Dopter</a> have come together to create a new project to address this need, called <a title="Swedish API License" href="http://apilicens.se/en/">Swedish API License</a>.</p>
<p>The goals with the project was to create an API license that...</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Is open and free for anyone to use, encouraging maximal adoption</li>
<li>Is flexible enough to fit many different use cases</li>
<li>Respects both the publisher and the consumer of the API.</li>
<li>Easy to understand for people without a law degree</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apilicens.se/en/dokumentation/wizard/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swedish-api-license/swedish-api-license-wizard-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Swedish API license covers the following areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>License</li>
<li>Intellectual Property Rights</li>
<li>Processing of Personal Data</li>
<li>Technical Requirements and Limitations</li>
<li>Other Requirements of Use</li>
<li>Liability</li>
<li>Changes</li>
<li>Terms and Conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The Swedish API license even has an <a href="http://apilicens.se/en/dokumentation/wizard/">API license wizard</a> that walks you through 13 steps of constructing and customizing your license, keeping within the legal and commercial considerations your company has around your API.</p>
<p>While the Swedish API License is published in Sweden, the site and licenses are in english and all the work is licensed under CC-BY license. This opens up a whole lot of opportunity to use the model around the globe.</p>
<p>I will be spending more time getting familiar with the approach to developing terms of service by the Swedish API License, and consider it side by side with existing efforts like <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn't Read</a> and <a href="https://tosback.org/">TOS Back</a> from EFF. I'm thinking we are approaching a critical point in API growth, where we really need to start getting our house in order when it comes to open resources for API providers and API consumers.</p>

<p>Over the last 3 years I have looked at all the APIs available in <a href="https://bitly.com/10rGRbg+">ProgrammableWeb API directory</a>, with about 2500 of which I monitor regularly. Throughout this process I've evolved an eye for what building blocks go into a successful API program.</p>
<p>When I review an existing API area or program, public or private, I spend as little or as much time as I need to look at an API initiative through the following 20 lenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- The general look, feel and initial impression of an API at the high level.</li>
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong>&nbsp;- Review of API endpoints, looking at the detail.</li>
<li><strong>On-boarding</strong>&nbsp;- How easy is it to get up and going? Where is the friction?</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- General API documentation review and critique.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with authentication and security.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>&nbsp;- A look at all available code libraries, SDKs, apps and language or platform availability.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a mobile fit and how does an API address this world.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What do direct and indirect support practices look like and what are activity levels.</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;- How are communications handled, and is it done in a transparent way.</li>
<li><strong>Change Practices</strong>&nbsp;- How are updates, changes, and communication around the roadmap handled.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model</strong>&nbsp;- What is the business model of an API, how does it make ends meet.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>&nbsp;- What resources are provided from how-to, case studies to videos and workshops.</li>
<li><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong>&nbsp;- Does an API reflect a research &amp; development group.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Department&nbsp;</strong>- Covering the legal areas of terms of use, privacy and branding.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong>&nbsp;- How portable and embeddable are aspects of the API? Can it be distributed easily?</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>&nbsp;- A look at the underlying environment of the API, sandboxing, testing, monitoring, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong>&nbsp;- What does this look like for a developer? What tools do we get to ensure success?</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>&nbsp;- How consistent are API endpoints and the support resources, and the overall operations.</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong>&nbsp;- If the API is public, to what degree of open are API efforts?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong>&nbsp;- What does outreach around the API look like, regarding events, social, storytelling, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look across the&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html" target="_blank">building blocks I have listed for API management</a>&nbsp;to get a better idea of the detail I'm looking for across API operations. These building blocks have been assembled through over 3 years of reviewing APIs, and can provide a good checklist to use when applying the above lenses.</p>
<p>Each review involves visiting an API area, applying the above 20 lenses, register and often times hack on an API. When done I write up a review report, which in many cases will be privately shared with a company and key&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;for review and discussion.</p>
<p>In some cases, when approved, I will publicly write up a review, providing a more polished view of an API area based upon final review report, and publish on my API Evangelist network of blogs.</p>
<p>The goal with a review is to better understand the balance of technology, business and politics going on within an API ecosystem, providing feedback that will help a company better achieve balance and success with their API initiative.</p>

This was the second annual API event, which kicked off last year around the same time. I've been a supporter of the event since Mehdi (<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) of Webshell told me about the idea.</p>
<p>Last years event was small, and over half the audience seemed to be imported API specialists such as myself, where this year it was clear--this was a french conference. A passionate community of API enthusiasts has grown over the last year, producing an impressive line-up of speakers and attendees.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about the space ranging from containers and oAuth to revelations about how we can learn from history and make the right decisions as we move forward in a world of APIs.</p>
<p>I encountered some pretty smart folks who knew a lot about technology, APIs and open data, that I hadn't encountered before in the online API world. This shows me the value of this type of event, and the importance of bringing folks together from around the world and share API stories.</p>
<p>Thanks <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> and <a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/">FaberNovel</a> for making it happen, and bringing Audrey and I out to be part of such an important event.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/12/11/my-free-application-for-federal-student-aid-fafsa-api-project/">My Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) API Project</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was able to give my <a title="FAFSA API Project" href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">FAFSA API project</a> a little more attention in preparation for some data jams later this week. While there is still a lot of work to happen, I feel pretty good about what I have been able to get done. I'd love to reflect on the API design, get some feedback before I move it forward too much more.</p>
<p><strong>75% Github</strong><br /> As with all of my projects, the FAFSA API is mostly deployed via Github, except for the actual API. The project was born as a Github repository and expanded as a Github Page. Using Github I'm able to manage the project, while also making it open by default so anyone else can fork and put the work to use.</p>
<p><strong>Designing The API</strong><br /> Once the repository was created, I got to work on an API design. For this project I started with a <a title="Swagger" href="https://bitly.com/1j2KERU+">Swagger</a> specification, and developed a basic CRUD interface and data model that was derived from the list of 100+ fields from the <a title="FAFSA Form" href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/pdf/PdfFafsa13-14.pdf">FAFSA form</a>.  Now I had a basic API design I could work with as guide for developing my API, generating my documentation and code samples. It isn't perfect, but it is a good start.</p>
<p><strong>Deploying The API</strong><br /> Next with API design in hand, I got to work deploying an actual API that would allow developers to build applications that could create, update and manage FAFSA application. I selected the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim framework</a> and PHP to deploy the first iteration of the FAFSA API. This allowed me to rapidly produce server side code in a common programming language. I will be deploying Python, Ruby and Node.js versions in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive Documentation</strong><br /> The first step in quantifying an API interface and make it something you can see and understand, is by developing documentation. In 2013 the common way to do this is with interactive documentation, which you can generate directly from the previously generated Swagger specification. Swagger has a slick JavaScript implementation that I can easily run from my Github project pages.</p>
<p><strong>Code Samples</strong><br /> I want to make sure my basic API design works I need to actually hack against it. Like the server side code, I'm developing the first code samples in PHP. I developer a set of samples that allow me to add, update, delete and pull all or an individual FAFSA entry. Next on the roadmap is to develop Python, Ruby, JavaScript and hopefully some mobile code samples for iPhone and Android (eventually).</p>
<p><strong>Secondary APIs</strong><br /> Once I started hacking on the FAFSA API I realized I would need more resources to actually make an application possible. First I needed a list of states and provinces--basic I know, but something I would need. Next there are other form fields, supporting processing logic, form rejection codes and lists of colleges and universities that would help developers be successful in building applications. I got to work downloading, and extract the data I would need and added these secondary APIs to my FAFSA API stack.</p>
<p><strong>A Portal To Round It Off</strong><br /> I have good amount of resources available for my FAFSA API project. I need a portal to hang all my resources within, establishing one stop access to everything generated as part of my work. Using Github Pages I generate a gh-pages branch of my Github repository, upload a graphical template, home page, about page, and a blog to provide a single portal gateway that developers can get at everything I've done. The portal blog will provide a real-time journal to chronical the evolution of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Data Behind</strong><br /> I've launched a suite of secondary APIs to support developers when building FAFSA applications, but this project is just a prototype API and even if it was a production deployment, some developers will just want access to the data behind. To support this, I published JSON data stores of FAFSA form fields, business process logic, rejection codes, and a list of states and schools that users can put to use. All data is stored as basic, machine readable JSON files in the master Github repository behind the FAFSA project portal.</p>
<p><strong>A Roadmap For The Future</strong><br /> While I made significance progress on the FAFSA API work, there is always more work to be done.  I need a roadmap to help me remember the various features I will be adding to the FAFSA API, but also a way to allow other contributors to submit suggestions to the roadmap. I developed a simple Javascript widget that was driven from the underlying Github Milestones system. This way milestones would list in the FAFSA API project roadmap, but would also allow anyone to submit potential features using the underlying Github platform.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Necessary Resources </strong><br /> I used a variety of PDF and website resources to understand the FAFSA program and derive the API interface and data model for this project. I wanted to make sure an provide an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/resources.html">easy list of resources</a> for other developers to use. A significant part of this project was derived from existing resources, making these part of the living project is important to support it's evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Adding To The Commons</strong><br /> With a first draft of the API definition and underlying data model for the FAFSA form published, i wanted to make sure I put forth the definition for public comment and consumption. To do this I create an <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest which registers the FAFSA API swagger definition with the commons. As I evolve the project and update the specification the manifest will keep it actively published in the API commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://apicommons.org"><img class="c1" style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Licensing</strong><br /> Beyond adding the FAFSA API definition to the API Commons, I make sure all code that is published as part of my FAFSA project is licensed using the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>, and any content is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY license</a>. I want the entire project to be freely and widely used, but make sure the central project is attributed to help build awareness and contributions to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /> That is where I stand. The goal of my FAFSA API project is to show what is possible with a simple API, and supporting resources. Developers can now build web applications that support students in applying for aid. Anyone can not just build applications, but deploy their own FAFSA API, becoming a node in a federated FAFSA ecosystem. Think of the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">ecosystem that has emerged as part of the IRS e-file system</a>. Popular apps like Turbo Tax that help taxpayers file their federal and state taxes, providing a successful blueprint for public and private sector partnerships.</p>
<p>This is all just a beginning. I'm just getting going on this project. It should provide a base prototype for building FAFSA solutions. I'm using this base model for other projects I'm working on, but FAFSA has provided a great project to evolve my approach. I need help on this project. It is unpaid work and I can use financial support, code contributions or just <a href="https://github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api/issues?state=open">feedback on what should be on the roadmap</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/oraclevgoogle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm just getting time to read through the news coming out of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the next phase of the Oracle v. Google case, which kicked off December 4th in California courts.</p>
<p>A panel of three judges presided over the Oracle v. Google Android/Java copyright appeal hearing, and after <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2013/12/detailed-analysis-of-federal-circuit.html">reading several accounts of the hearing</a>, all three judges seem to all agree that the Java API should protected under copyright, but whether Google's use of portions of the Java API is fair use, is still unclear--potentially overturning Judge William Alsup earlier ruling.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that APIs are the "fair use tip" of software that could potentially be covered by copyright and patents. As demonstrated by <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">my support</a> of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/2013.1021.1022.computer.scientists.amici_.brief_.pdf">Electronic Frontier Foundation amicus brief</a>, I think API definitions remaining fair use is critical to interoperability and and not just a healthy API economy, but the the larger economy.</p>
<p>The hearing last week is just the beginning, the legal battle is likely to go on for a while,  potentially making its way to the Supreme Court and / or possibly heading back to a lower court. Even if the earlier Oracle vs. Google ruling, that APIs aren't copyrightable is upheld, I anticipate we will see many, many legal battles on this front in coming years.</p>
<p>As we increase our vocabulary for describing and designing API interfaces, with approaches such as <a title="Swagger" href="https://bitly.com/1j2KERU+">Swagger</a>, <a title="RAML" href="https://bitly.com/16ZTZYt+">RAML</a> and <a href="https://bitly.com/1cl8tCc+">API Blueprint</a>, attempts to protect these definitions by copyright will increase. While I will continue to support efforts to defend APIs in their entirety as being protected under fair use and free from copyright, I will be focusing my efforts on encouraging healthy API design, sharing and collaboration through placement of API definitions into the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>While Oracle vs. Google remains a critical case that will have a major impact on the world of APIs, whichever way the case goes, it won't change the importance of <a title="publishing APIs to the commons" href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">publishing API definitions to the commons</a>, setting the precedent for fair use, reinforcing the fact that this open use of API designs is critical to getting us from 10K APIs to millions of APIs, ensuring the interoperability we will need for our increasingly Internet enabled world.</p>

<p>We have added the <a title="OpenEd API" href="http://www.opened.io/#/developer">OpenEd API</a> to the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. OpenEd provides open educational resources like courses, videos and games for teachers to use in their classes.</p>
<p>Using the API, developers can read and write resources to the platform, which currently houses 250K openly licensed educational resources.</p>
<p>In addition to making all of the content openly licensed, the <a href="https://github.com/openedinc/opened.io">OpenEd.io site is also open sourced on Github</a>. Making the OpenEd API definition a perfect candidate for the API commons.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.opened.apiary.io/">OpenEd team designed their API using Apiary.io</a>, defining it using API Blueprint, a <a href="http://apiblueprint.com/">web API language that allows for the description of APIs using markdown</a>.</p>
<p>OpenEd is a great open educational content API blueprint to follow, and we are honored to have it in the commons!</p>

<p>I'm getting more PR folks reaching out to me trying to get me to review their client's API program. I'm happy to add these to my list and make time each week to review them alongside the other new APIs I find each week.</p>
<p>I'm not willing to jump on the phone and hear a pitch about the API. You should send me a short succinct email, or even better a Tweet with a URL and I'm happy to add to my list and make time when i can.</p>
<p>I'm not the usual blogger who just wants to regurgitate what you told me in a briefing or in a press release. Your API and its supporting area should do the talking. I should be able to click on a single link, understand what you do, and be able to find what I need within 5 minutes or less.  If I can't? Well I will let you know.</p>
<p>Think of me as a developer. I will be reviewing your product from that perspective.</p>
<p>So if you are doing PR for an API company, make sure and read my blog, engage me on Twitter and save the briefings and emails for other bloggers. I'm more concerned with the value your client is bringing to the table, and their approach to delivering a self-service API platform.</p>
<p>No briefing required. :-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><span>This fall while working in Washington D.C. I was introduced to the concept of</span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/government-services/RepresentingGovernmentServiceswithJSON-LD.pdf">representing government services with JSON-LD</a><span>. Using the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices">civic services schema.org</a><span>&nbsp;proposal you can represent common government services that target indvidiuals and businesses, providing a standard that developers can use when presenting government services in websites and mobile applications.</span></p>
<p>I was working on a project to help publish services from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I wanted to enable people who work at the VA, as well as other agencies to be able to generate and manage JSON-LD representations of their services in the easiest way possible. So I thought to myself, what is the number one way for people in government to manage data? Spreadsheets of course!</p>
<p>I decided to start with Google Docs, and generate a simple JavaScript tool to take a Google Spreadsheet template that was setup with the required fields for a government services schema. Next I wrote an import script using Tabletop.js that would grab the contents of the Google Spreadsheet template and using JavaScript to generate the JSON-LD.</p>
<p>This thanksgiving holiday I decided to add one more tool to my work with government services and JSON-LD, and build a form that anyone could fill out and generate their own government services JSON-LD. The result is a Bootstrap, JQuery form that you can fill out, then hit publish JSON and using JavaScript it generates the JSON-LD representation for you.</p>
<p>I started a <a href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/index.html">project to organize my work around government services</a> and published the <a title="Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD" href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/google-doc.html">Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD</a> and the <a title="form to JSON-LD generators" href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/form.html">form to JSON-LD generators</a>. Next I will be adding the ability to save generated files to the Github master repository, making the whole thing a formable, government JSON-LD generator and storage repo.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying developing forms that generate JSON lately. I built an <a href="http://apicommons.org/manifest-generator.html">API Commons manifest generator</a> the other night, and using the same momentum I developed the government services JSON-LD generator. I couldn't think of a more worthy project to spend my time on over Thanksgiving. Hopefully government agencies of all shapes and sizes can more easily generate and publish machine readable lists of the valuable services they offer, so that Google, Yahoo, Bing and other web or mobile app developer can more easily and accurately represent these services in their apps.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2013</span>

<p>My friend <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>, Director of Platform for the <a href="http://developer.klout.com/">Klout API</a>, wrote up a great piece before <a title="#APIStrat" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">#APIStrat</a>, called <a href="https://medium.com/p/4d36eab870c9">A Short Proposal for Robots.json</a>.</p>
<p>This is a topic that I've been meaning to make time to discuss, but only now finding time. I love exchanging ideas with <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>, because we tend to disagree on some important API related topics, however he is extremely knowledgeable on the space, and like me he possesses some strong opinions and is very open to lively discussion via blogs, twitter and on stage at events.</p>
<p>On the topics of web scraping, API rate limits, and API access that exist in the realm of what I call the politics of APIs, <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> and I couldn't disagree more on what is acceptable use in the API economy. What is interesting though, within this disagreement we find affinity in the topic of the robots.json.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>&nbsp;has a very succinct description of what a robots.json file would be:</p>
<blockquote><em>A Robots.json file, or something like it, would contain all desired rules for retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody, business models and other use cases allowed and encouraged for developers.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think a machine readable file that provides access to all aspects of an APIs terms of use is a great idea. Beyond the obvious benefits of publishing a robots.json file for API providers and consumers, I think the practice would help standardize industry best practices for API terms and conditions. In my experience most API providers just emulate what they see in the space and if top players lead on this subject, others will follow.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> and I both agree that there should be a robots.json, however we come at it from two opposing viewpoints. <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> is coming at from an API vendor  position, and I'm coming at from the stance of an API consumer. <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> wants to establish a definition of where the provider stands, setting the "rules of the road" as Twitter would say--where I want a single location to find the same definition, so that as an API consumer I can understand the "rules of engagement", and decide if I want to even waste my time, based upon their stance.</p>
<p>With a standardized robots.json, as a developer I could very easily set the bar for which API providers I integrate into my applications. If a company's views on "retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody and business models" are not in alignment with my businesses, I can easily determine this without spending any time learning about their API--something that can be very costly and time consuming.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> uses Craigslists as the lead in for what a possible robots.json file could be used for, and the tone that it could set. While the tone of Craiglist's robots.json file might be very stern, setting what I would consider to be a very uninformed, "get off my lawn" vibe, I don't think all robots.json would reflect this tone.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://asuc.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/universities/uc-berkeley/associated-student-university-california-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>On November 6th, 2013 the <a title="ASUC" href="http://asuc.org/">Associated Students, University of California(ASUC) Senate</a> submitted SB 48: <a href="http://asuc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Week-10-Agenda-Packet-11.6.131.pdf">A Bill in Support of Student Information Systems Application Developers</a>, stating that "open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System".</p>
<p>UC Berkeley has embarked on a "Student Information System Replacement Project" that is looking to "replace its constellation of aging, unique, disparate home-grown student systems with a modern, nimble and effective vendor-supported system".  Systems including financial aid, registration, enrollment, admissions and records are being targeted for replacement.</p>
<p>The existing Student Information Systems(SIS) has been in place for over two decades, and facing the same for future systems, the students led organization that represents over 35K students, is taking a stance to ensure that all future systems have APIs. That is some serious forethought and leadership on behalf on the ASUC Senate!</p>
<p>SB 48 puts forth that:</p>
<blockquote><em>an API, or Application Programming Interface, is a foundation put in place on top of a system to securely make specific information and data public to developers for those developers to create third-party extensions and applications pertaining to their specific uses for the data and program</em></blockquote>
<p>API and Integration Architect of UC Berkeley, George Atala(<a href="https://twitter.com/gmatala">@gmatala</a>) adds:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;An SIS API would be critical for supporting the many user applications and other campus systems that serve students. These systems change and evolve continuously, and a real time read/write API is necessary to enable this. The API must cover the full range of core functionality in the SIS, and should support appropriate levels of security for private and public data.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The bill authored by Sahil A Pandya and Quinn Z Shen nails some of the critical areas around APIs being a vital aspect of university operations, and that much of the SIS overhaul will not happen all at once, when in reality the evolution of all campus systems should happen in smaller, bite-size chunks. APIs would help evolve campus information systems from a 20-30 years technology procurement cycle, to a real-time, ongoing, agile systems lifecycle.</p>
<p>Current SIS are operating without APIs, limiting which applications can be integrated and deployed on top of university systems. Even with this current closed approach, there are a handful of student-made applications such as <a title="BerkelyTime" href="/admin/blog/berkeleytime.com">BerkeleyTime</a> and <a href="/admin/blog/ninjacourses.com">NinjaCourses</a>&nbsp;that have emerged showing the demand for better quality SIS applications and tools.</p>
<p>These existing, student-developed applications often obtain their information by scraping publicly available information on the Internet. APIs would provide direct access to information, eliminate scraping load on public websites, and provide analytics and insight into what applications exist, and how they use university and student information.  APIs provide higher level of control and security for UC IT operations, than even the currently closed systems offer. UC Berkeley uses <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> to manage acess, analytics and other vital aspects of their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/get-a-list-of-all-classes-at-uc-berkeley-with-api-call/">recently launch API operations</a>, but unfortunately is not fullly taken advantage of across all university systems..</p>
<p>In addition to current student-developed applications, there are also other faculty-developed extensions to SIS that apply to specific departments, but are not covered by central information systems. All of these student, faculty and third party applications have proven to be so beneficial to students in serving purposes, that many of them have been officially adopted and endorsed by the University.</p>
<p>Imagine a university where each entering student experiences the financial aid, enrollment and registration process, then one of their first opportunities to learn involves actually contributed to building applications and tools that make that process better. In a world where university resources are increasingly strained, the institutions that remain relevant will allow for student, faculty and third party access to all campus resources via APIs.</p>
<p>I think SB 48 nails it again with?</p>
<blockquote><em>"the university with the top computer science department should also have the top student information system in place and harness the talent in its students by allowing them to create applications that enhance and extend features in the information system (i.e. the mantra 'Created by students, for students')"</em></blockquote>
<p>Wait! Information systems created by students for students? What if businesses students could help with data analysis and reporting? What if marketing students could help build interactive campaigns? Sounds like the recipe for some interesting education and work experience for students, and a huge opportunity for the university system to maximize the valuable intellectual exhaust generated by its faculty and students eacUh day.</p>
<p>I have to go out with the last section of SB 48, I think it speaks for itself:</p>
<blockquote><em>"THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Associated Students of the University of California stand in solidarity with student, faculty, and administrative developers under the unified opinion that open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System to ensure its longevity and holistic usefulness to students, not only in its core features, but in the potential add-ons from third-party applications and extensions"</em></blockquote>

<p>I'm working on an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">API for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form</a>. I'm working my way through a document from Department of Education called the <a href="http://www.ifap.ed.gov/appprocspecsswd/1314AppProcSysSoftwareDevSpecsAugust2013Update.html">2013-2014 Application Processing System Specifications for Software Developers</a>.</p>
<p>I'm isolating various datasets, and data models, trying to get a feel for all the API resources I will need for the FAFSA API. The specifications provides several tables of data and data models for me to use, including the actual fields for the FAFSA form.</p>
<p>One dataset that is provided in the PDF is a list of states. It makes sense that a list of states is included for any developer who is building a federal student aid application. And I have a states API available elsewhere, that I've used in several other applications, so building this API will for the project will be easy.</p>
<p>Next I'm thinking..how do I replicate this utility API easily for an external API project like this? One of the architectural considerations for the FAFSA API is to make an API that anyone could fork and easily setup for their own use. That includes the state API resource.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about APIs in general. When it comes to APIs, they are ften attached to brands, like the Twilio API or Twitter API. We do not think of single API definitions as ubiquitous, as utilities or as commodities yet. However there are a lot of common API resources like states, IP addresses, counties, cities and many more, that are essential to many web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Sure these datasets are widely available, but you need to actually design and deploy the actual API. How do we make utility APIs like this deployable anywhere? Anytime? I should be able to select from a library of common API definitions and easily fork, then deploy to my AWS EC2, AWS Cloud Formation or OpenShift platform. I shouldn't have to rely on 3rd party services for all of these resources.</p>
<p>Of course, not all APIs should be this portable, but there are a number of very common APIs that could. I should be able to launch a new API portal for a public audience or even a private development group, and easily publish the unique, as well as the utility APIs they will need to be successful, in a single, easy to navigate API area.</p>

<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>
<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a &ldquo;need analysis&rdquo; based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>
<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">this umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work</a>, and created an individual project site just for the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">Free Application for Federal Student Aid API</a>.</p>
<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data">Gitihub repositories</a>, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>
<p>Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA...</p>

<p>I've been pushing the boundaries of open data and API deployment using Github. I have a project I've been evolving since August called <a title="Simple API" href="http://simple-api.github.io/central/">Simple API</a> and its sister implementation <a title="api.ongithub.com" href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a>, which allows you to launch an API by forking common API definitions that are hosted on Github.</p>
<p>I was recently introduced to similar approach to geospatial API deployment using GeoJSON stored on Github called <a href="http://gitspatial.com/" target="_blank">GitSpatial</a>. Using the same approach, GitSpatial lets allows you to oAuth into the API deployment platform using your Github login, then spiders your repositories and let's you sync the repositories that contain GeoJSON.</p>
<p>Then using three URL parameters:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>user_name</strong> - Your GitHub user name</li>
<li><strong>repo_name</strong> - A GitHub repo name</li>
<li><strong>feature_set_name</strong> - A file in your repo that contains GeoJSON</li>
</ul>
<p>GitSpatial allows you to construct a geo spatial API resource URI: <strong><em>http://gitspatial.com/:user_name/:repo_name/:feature_set_name</em></strong></p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff! I might be a little biased here, but I think this type of API deployment via Github blueprints, plus JSON data stores is going to be big. I've been experimenting with <a title="API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/server-side-api-templates-on-aws-cloud-formation-and-openshift/">API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift</a>, and it seems like the next evolution in cloud driven API deployment to me.</p>
<p>The best part to this approach is that your data, configurations and core elements are maintained within your world as simple, open formats like JSON--then you get to externally connect, using Github, to premium API services that augment and enhance your existing resources.</p>
<p>Lookout for an increase in the number of Github + API solutions in the coming months...</p>

<p>I created <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">11 very simple API designs</a> for the launch of <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>. We needed some API definitions to show the potential of the commons, so I wanted to design a handful of common API patterns to seed the launch.</p>
<p>For all 11 API designs I started with a <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">Swagger definition</a>, then using PHP and the Slim framework I quickly generated server side code for each API. I generate this code programmatically from the Swagger spec, but I also prefer going through the generated code and giving it a human touch.</p>
<p>This approach isn't just for these 11 API design templates, I'm using it for all my projects right now. I'm designing the API definition, generating and modifying the server side code, publishing Swagger UI documentation, then any client side code libraries I will need.</p>

<p>I'm publishing the API definition and Swagger UI, plus a project overview completely on Github. Currently I'm generating PHP / Slim framework driven code on AWS EC2 instance. I'm will expand this to include server side frameworks in Ruby, Python, Node.JS.</p>
<p>Next I will take each API definition + server-side code in PHP, Ruby, Python and Node.js and running on Amazon EC2 and port to run in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS Cloud Formation</a> and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a> from RedHat--providing an open API blueprint that others can deploy in the cloud.</p>
<p>This will be my basic process for any standard API design I'm evolving for <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, APIs I develop internally, as well any API that I design, develop and build for external projects.  As with my stories and open data, I want any API I design to be open and reusable by anyone who is in need of the same API.</p>

<p>With the growing number of hypermedia API deployments, hypermedia haters&copy; are going to lose a major argument, that hypermedia is just an academic exercise and will never work in the wild. ;-)</p>
<p>The latest hypermedia API I was told about&nbsp;in the wild(thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), is from Amazon Web Services with the recent <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api.html#rest-api-hal">AppStream API</a>--"a flexible, low-latency service that lets you stream resource intensive applications and games from the cloud".</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api.html#rest-api-hal">The AWS AppStream API</a> is an API that uses <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">Hypertext Application Language</a> (HAL),  a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between API resources, created by Mike Kelly(<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>) of <a href="http://stateless.co/">Stateless.co</a>. When HAL is used, with each API request, you get a  wealth of links that allow you to programmatically explore the functionality of an API.</p>
<p>For example, you can explore the JSON returned in each response from the application API endpoint, about a specific app you are streaming including using the services, you will find links to determine application status, show information on current session and many more.</p>
<p>Normally with APIs, developers have to explore each API endpoint, and read through documentation to understand the different actions that can be taken against an API. With HAL, API owners can craft links that provide meaningful actions that can be discovered and implemented by developers along the way, teaching them about what is possible with each API call.</p>
<p>Hypermedia goes a long way in extending business rules to developers, not just directing them to what next steps may be taken at each API request, but really save them a lot of homework on how your API business model works, and how to best build an application around an API.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">other hypermedia APIs</a> in the wild, including the very important <a href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/">Public Media Platform (PMP)</a>, but the numbers are still low. I will keep finding quality hypermedia solutions in the wild and sharing them with you as I find.</p>

<p>I was going through the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/#search-endpoint">Free Law Project Court Opinion API</a> today, playing with the API and data, while developing some server and client side tooling.  All the API endpoints are pretty consistence because they used their Django model and the <a href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Tastypie framework</a> to generate most of the API.</p>
<p>There is one endpoint that is radically different from the rest of the opinion API: the /search endpoint. The Free Law Project used <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> to generate the /search endpoint results and instead of directly hitting just the database for information it utilized Solr index to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Using Solr opens up a whole world of search by introducing common concepts like AND, OR, NOT, fielded queries, wildcards, fuzzy searches and much more when it comes to searching for court opinions.</p>
<p>While the on-boarding of Solr newbies to an endpoint like this takes some education, and the opinion API /search endpoint docs could use a little more polishing to  make it easier to start using, but the concept of a Solr driven endpoint is still very interesting.</p>
<p>Using Solr like this might not work for all API providers, but for some who are heavily using data stores that include document repositories as well, it might be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While <a title="Have A Bunch Of Documents? Launch An API With Apache Solr" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/13/have-a-bunch-of-documents-launch-an-api-with-apache-solr/">I have advocated for using Solr to generate an API before</a>, this is the first time I've seen it bundled alongside another API offering so seamlessly, just to drive the search endoint.

<p>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/">Court Listener Opinions API</a> is a well designed, dead simple REST API with 7 endpoints to search opinions, citations across jurisdictions, using Basic Auth to secure the API.</p>
<p>Along with the simple API and docs, the Court Listener provides a blog and forum to support developers, and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/">bulk downloads of all data</a> in addition to the REST API.</p>
<p>The court opinions API implementation is a model to follow for other public sector open data and API projects. The API and supporting developer area is simple and very well done, providing all the essential building blocks needed to grow an ecosystem around the API and data.</p>
<p>The entire API and data is released in the  public domain, and relies on donations to do the work and keep the lights on--something that should be the bar set for all public data projects.</p>
<p>This external, open approach to liberating, aggregating and improving on vital public sector data, is a model we need to replicate across all areas of city, county, state and federal government in all sectors.</p>
