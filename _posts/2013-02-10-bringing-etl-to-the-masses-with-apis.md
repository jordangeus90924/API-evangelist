I’m spending a lot of time lately thinking about [emerging trends in API usage][1]. One area I’m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs. The best known examples are from companies like [If This Then That (IFTTT)][2] and [Zapier][3], who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining tasks that move data between SaaS platforms.

Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just [Extract Transform Load (ETL)][4], which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services. But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms.

Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on [rethinking ETL for the API age][5]. If you don’t know [Seabourne][6], they are behind high profile government projects like [MyFCC][7] and [GovInfo][8]. They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs.

To better help me better understand the space, I’m watching 12 service providers that I’m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers:
