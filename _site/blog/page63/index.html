        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/08/10/deeper-connections-between-apps-with-web-intents/">Deeper Connections Between Apps with Web Intents</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/chrome-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />With all of the technology available to us, the way we express ourselves online and interact between web applications is still in its infancy. The two most common examples of online interaction are the share and like, which are like grunts and groans in online expression. However they are a very ubiquitous form of showing how you feel about a news article, discussion, event, song, video and many other things we interact with every day.<p></p>
On my blog I can give users a couple of basic actions to interact with my posts: share, link, favorite, vote up and down. These are pretty basic actions in the grand vision of the Internet. Because of the popularity of Facebook, the like has become a common expression for the web. So how do we evolve beyond this homogenized, like based world we've created?<p></p>
<a title="Google and Mozilla are trying to evolve the actions available to us" href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/08/google-mozilla-team-up-to-create-a-smarter-action-based-web/">Google and Mozilla are trying to evolve the actions available to us</a> with the concept of <a title="Web Intents" href="http://www.webintents.com/">Web Intents</a>. Both companies are building this spec into their browsers, but <a title="Google seems to be taking it a step further with their Web Intents API" href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/08/connecting-web-apps-with-web-intents.html">Google seems to be taking it a step further with their Web Intents API</a>. This web platform API will provide the same benefits of <a title="Android Intents" href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters.html">Android Intents</a>, but better suited for web applications. With Web Intents, you will be able to connect your web app or site to a service with a couple lines of code, and the browser will handle the rest.<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/firefox/firefox-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />A web intent based application will let users request a generic action like share or like, triggering this action, and the user is presented with a list of registered apps that can handle the requested intent. When selected, the action is triggered, information passed, and the intended action is fulfilled.<p></p>
Web Intents will start with the usual of intent actions like edit, view, and share, but it will create a framework allowing new types of web intents to evolve. Google intends to build a site allowing the adding, viewing and curation of web intents and their corresponding actions, and build a community around web intents that will create a sort of marketplace of what can actions can occur on the web.<p></p>
This all reminds me somewhat of the online marketing term conversion event. When someone clicks off a Google Ad and ends up your site, you need to define a conversion event to measure if your Google Ad campaign is successful. The most common type of conversion event being a shopping cart purchase, but could be anything like newsletter sign-up, or even sharing a post to Twitter.

Web intents are the next generation of events that can occur on web sites and applications. These intents will often use services provided by other platforms and applications. The web intents will start simple, using what we know--share--and evolve into more complex forms of online expression like altering, mashing up, curation, and syndication.<p></p>
Web Intents will benefit everyone. It will allow users to perform more meaningful actions while using apps, and allow site owners to easily offer popular actions that users want, and app developers can offer a wider variety of actions and services from a range of providers, as well as enabling developers who are looking to specialize in web intent focused web services. Of course Google will be the big winner in this by providing a frawework to grow what actions can be taken across the Internet, they put themselves at the center when it comes to the next generation of actions, that replace the ones we know now, like search.

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/factual/factual-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /><a title="Factual" href="http://www.factual.com">Factual</a> just launched a <a href="http://blog.factual.com/crosswalk-api">new API that will centralize how physical places are represented within Factual data-sets</a>, and across 3rd party APIs, dubbed the <a title="Factual Crosswalk API" href="http://developer.factual.com/display/docs/Places+API+-+Crosswalk">Factual Crosswalk API</a>.<p></p>
Data about physical places is notoriously messy, and with number of providers, and the growing value of location based data, its only going to get messier. Factual is aiming to normalize places data across the web by providing a central ID to link individual entries across multiple data providers.<p></p>
Using the Factual Crosswalk API you can retrieve a place by providing its Factual ID or any associated URL, either way you get a complete record from the Factual database, and URLs to its associated IDs and locations. The Factual Crosswalk API can be used to link to data across the Internet, as well as cleaning and standardizing local data sets.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1133424.js?file=place.json"></script>
Taking the lead in providing centralized storage and API for data-sets will help make Factual the goto place when looking for places data, and it will also make them a source when discovering multiple sources for places online.<p></p>
The <a title="Factual Crosswalk API" href="http://developer.factual.com/display/docs/Places+API+-+Crosswalk">Factual Crosswalk API</a> is free for now, and is only available in the United States, but they are looking to roll-out the service for 40+ countries in the near future. Factual has partnered with multiple data providers to create this centralized resource, and they are welcoming other providers to participate.

        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hackathons/Hackathon-Tag-Cloud-2.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><a title="Hackathons" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/hackathons-and-contests.php">Hackathons</a> are becoming a popular vehicle worldwide for identifying talent, sharing ideas, tackling big data, building apps, and providing a forum for developers, graphic designers and business minds to network.
<p></p>Hackthons were born out of the Silicon Valley start-up scene. During these events, companies bring together a group of developers, give them a coding target, allow them to break into teams where they build a plan and hack together apps, mobile apps, and other web services that meet the criteria of the event.
<p></p>Hackathons are now being held in Seattle, Los Angeles, London, Paris, New York and beyond. Other start-up groups and incubators have seen the value in holding these coding events and bringing together the best minds in their community, hoping to bring attention to their event on the world wide tech scene.
<p></p>The success of hackathons as an innovation vehicle is spreading beyond general coding and the start-up community. There are hackathons coming up for <a title="Photo Hack Day" href="http://photohackday.org/">photos</a>, <a title="Water Hackathon" href="http://www.rhok.org/event/water-hackathon">water</a>, <a title="Cleanweb Hackathon" href="http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/">sustainability</a>, <a title="Health 2.0's live code-a-thons" href="http://www.health2challenge.org/code-a-thon/">health</a>, <a title="Open Gov Hackathon" href="http://loqi.me/poll/geoloqi-hackathon-2010">government</a> and I just finished covering <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/13/hacking-education-with-donorschoose-org-contest/">Hacking Education</a>, an event hosted by <a href="http://www.DonorsChoose.org">DonorsChoose.org</a>, to challenged developers to create apps and data visualizations with the its API that would engage the public and have an impact on education.
<p></p>Its exciting to see Hackathons being used outside of Silicon Valley. I would like to see the Hackathon format evolve and be applied to other areas, like manufacturing, real estate, mining, livestock, farming and beyond. Hackathons hold a lot of power in bringing together talented minds and ideas, and creating a fertile environment for innovation to occur.
<p></p>It's important to remember that the technology produced at Hackathons is not always the most important outcome of these events. It's about bringing together the right minds and sharing ideas that can result in people going back to their everyday life with a new perspective and can encourage them to make a real impact in their daily lives.
<p></p>What industries would most benefit from holding Hackathons?

        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Code-Value-Reliability.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I've written about the <a title="essential building blocks necessary a successful API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential building blocks necessary for a successful API</a>, and there are other great posts like, <a title="What Developers Say About API Documentation" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/20/what-developers-say-about-api-documentation/">What Developers Say About API Documentation</a> from Peter Gruenbaum of <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/api-documentation/">SDK Bridge</a>.
<p></p>Everyone seems pretty unanimous that a RESTful API, with simple and complete documentation, qualitiy code samples in the popular languages, and real API support from the owner and the community are the ingredients for a successful API.
<p></p>Iparticipatedin a chat about APIs on Twitter, where amix of API influencers, owners, advocates, evangelists and developers hung out for about an hour, answering questions posed by <a title="http://twitter.com/#!/retailigence" href="http://twitter.com/#!/retailigence">@retailigence</a>. Overall there were about seven questions asked, but the second one was simple, and thought provoking:
<p></p><em>What is the most important characteristic of an API?</em>
<p></p>The <a title="common building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks</a> were rattled off (by myself included): REST, quality documentation, code samples, while other said more innovative things like API explorer or <a title="Mashery I/O Docs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/02/mashery-open-sources-their-api-io-docs/">Masherys I/O Docs</a>. Then <a title="@infochimps" href="http://twitter.com/#!/InfoChimps">@infochimps</a> said <strong><em>reliability &amp; usefulness</em></strong>.
<p></p>This started some side conversations and got me thinking. Does the overall value an API deliver and its reliability trump its RESTfulness, documentation and available code samples?
<p></p>I would say definitely, yes! It is true that a RESTful API, with simple and clear documentation, and code samples are a must have. But if your API doesn't offer clear value and reliably deliver on this value, no amount of documentation or code samples is going to work.
<p></p>These are all pretty basic concepts at first glance, but it is a reminder where to focus your resources when it comes to your API.

I think these are pretty standard <a title="Rules of the Road" href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">rules of the road</a> that us publishers and developers are getting used when integrating with APIs and deploying gadgets, widgets and other embeddable tools. But they don't give us much build upon, as a content publisher, or developer trying to build a business.<p></p>
I cannot see into the future, and I understand the problems providers face, but these terms seem pretty wide open, in favor of the provider. What can we do to make terms of services (TOS) for APIs and other tools more in support of the community a provider is targeting with these services?<p></p>
I don't have the answers, just asking the question. This bizdev 2.0 stuff is a lot harder than we anticipated.

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2011</span>
        <a title="Office of the Federal Register" href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/government/presidential-seal.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>Each day Federal agencies publish documents in the Federal Register. These documents include proposed rules, final rules, public notices, and Presidential actions. The print-based version of the Federal Register can be difficult to read, process and access, so the <a title="Office of the Federal Register" href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/">Office of the Federal Register</a> (OFR) of the <a title="National Archives and Records Administration" href="http://www.archives.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration</a> (NARA), and the <a title="U.S. Government Printing Office" href="http://www.gpo.gov/">U.S. Government Printing Office</a> (GPO), who all joined forces to launch the <a title="federalregister.gov" href="http://www.federalregister.gov/">FederalRegister.gov</a> website, also deployed an API.<p></p>
The goal of the initiative was to make it even easier for developers to build new ways of interacting with Federal Register data, making it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in the Government decision-making process.<p></p>
The <a title="Federal Register API" href="http://www.federalregister.gov/blog/learn/developers">Federal Register API</a> is RESTful, with no keys required for authentication and responses in a JSON format. They even provide a simple JSON interface for callbacks. All data in the Federal Register is updated daily by 6 a.m., and is published Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, and consists of four types of entries:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Presidential Documents</strong> - Executive orders and proclamations</li>
	<li><strong>Rules and Regulations</strong> - Policy statements and interpretations of rules</li>
	<li><strong>Proposed Rules</strong> - Petitions for rulemaking and other advance proposals</li>
	<li><strong>Notices</strong> - Scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public, grant applications, administrative orders, and other announcements of government actions</li>
</ul>
The Federal Register API is meant to deliver print-based material in machine-readable formats, to make the Federal Register more searchable, accessible, easier to digest, and easier to share withother systems.<p></p>
The Federal Registers, encourages every citizen to become more involved in the workings of their government and to make their voices heard on the things that matter to them, from the smallest to the largest issues.<p></p>
I'm reporting on multiple government APIs lately with, <a title="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/08/01/sunlight-labs-releases-influence-explorer-text-api/" href="Political Influence in U.S. an API Call Away" target="_blank">Political Influence in U.S. an API Call Away</a>" and "<a title="More Government Data with U.S. Department of Labor API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/28/more-government-data-with-u-s-department-of-labor-api/" target="_blank">More Government Data with U.S. Department of Labor API</a>". With all the bullshit and theatrics in politics and the media, this kind of news really gets me excited about getting more involved in the Government decision-making process.

I/O Docs provides an interactive documentation system for RESTful web APIs. By defining APIs at the resource, method and parameter levels in a JSON schema, I/O Docs will generate a JavaScript client interface. API calls can be executed directly from the documentation interface, proxied through the I/O Docs server, producing formatted responses.<p></p>
Mashery has <a title="open-sourced a version of the I/O docs on Github" href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">open-sourced a version of the I/O Docs on Github</a>, for any API owner to deploy for their own documentation. This version of I/O docs runs on <a title="Node.js" href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation">Node.js</a> and uses <a title="Redis" href="http://redis.io/download">Redis</a> as a data store.<p></p>
Last year Apigee launched their <a title="API consoe" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API console</a> which allows users to also make calls against an API, and <a title="earlier this year they made it freely available for any API owner" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/apigee-api-console-is-now-free-for-everyone-to-use/">earlier this year they made it freely available for any API owner</a> to deploy. The API console is a popular tool with developers to get up and going using an API, and build an understanding how an API works. Apigees move to make free was a significant market play, and definitely built awareness of their platform.<p></p>
Masherys approach to API exploration reflects an alternative view from Apigees, one that integrates API discovery with API documentation, as opposed to being an entirely separate tool. Masherys move to open-source their I/O Docs on Github, is great to see. I'm sure it will definitely attract more attention to their platform and tools.<p></p>
You can <a title="download or fork the Mashery I/O docs on Github" href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">download or fork the Mashery I/O Docs on Github</a>, and find necessary installation info and documentation.

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2011</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/junk-drawer.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I had a discussion yesterday with <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>about the infamous junk drawer(s) that exists in every house. That end of the counter drawer that seems to accumulate everything from around our house that we think we may some day use.</p>
<p>Junk drawers possess those small items that hold our lives together. Nuts, bolts, fasteners, knobs, hinges and handles as well as the tools we use to assemble the futon, bikes, shelves and other household appliances. We keep all these items because we don't want to throw them away. We will use them some day right?</p>
<p>We all live with this delusion. I have no hard data on what we actually use from the junk drawer, but we all have them, and I'm sure many of us have just taken that entire drawer to the Goodwill, sold at a yard sale, or worse.....thrown away.</p>
<p>Instead of having a junk drawer, what if we could take a picture of each object with our mobile devices. The mobile app would use image recognition or some sort of image scanning to identify the object. The mobile application would scan potentially millions of parts and pieces to identify this little piece of treasure in our lives. Once identified it would pull all meta data related to it, identifying it as a screw, faster for a futon or drawer handle from IKEA.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15 px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AutoCAD_Symbols_Fasteners.jpg" alt="" align="right" />We could create a virtual junk drawer of all these items. Once cataloged in our virtual junk drawer, we could properly dispose of in a recycling bin, Goodwill donation bag, or items in garage for the big yard sale that will make us rich. No more physical junk drawer. We could access our virtual junk drawer at any time, in an online environment.</p>
<p>When that magical time comes, and we actually need the exact same screw, knob, fastener or obscure alan wrench we could search in our virtual junk drawer and pull up the item. Then we could either find out a local place to purchase, or even better the virtual junk drawer would pull the 3D drawing for the part and have it printed for us at the nearest 3D printer.</p>
<p>Instead of clinging to the vision that some day we will need this part or piece, we could keep track of the parts and pieces that make up our lives, and when this day comes we could actually have recreated, and magically it appears in our lives.</p>
<p>This would make way more sense then having a junk drawer with thousands of un-identifiable parts and pieces, and think of the valuable data you could extract from such an application.</p>
<p>Anyways...just a thought.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.twitter.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>I just finished reading two great posts about battles within API ecosystems.<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/07/convoluted-tos-and-open-apis-w.php" target="_blank">Convoluted TOS and "Open" APIs Will Be the Death of Us</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shiondev" target="_blank">Shion Deysarkar</a> and <a href="http://blog.louisgray.com/2011/07/topify-to-go-dark-as-twitter-claims.html" target="_blank">Topify to Go Dark as Twitter Claims Another Dev Victim</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/louisgray" target="_blank">Louis Gray</a>. I recommend you read, and form your own opinion.<p></p>
I'm totally behind Shion in,<em> ..arguing that the breaching parties (i.e. the developers holding the API key) should not be held in contempt of court, as it were. </em>When it comes to terms of service disagreements, there needs to be more discussion.<p></p>
<em></em>I also feel Topify's pain in their decision to, <em>..shut down the service, rather than chasing after Twitter's continued meandering API road-map</em>. This makes it very difficult to build a business on Twitters API.<p></p>
I am the biggest advocate for the developer when it comes to these ecosystems battles. API developers often deliver on the promise of an API, but seldom see the reward.<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/topify_125.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />However I also feel the pain of API owners. How are you supposed to have an API that delivers true value, is sustainable, makes all your developers happy, and have terms of service and a roadmap that is all knowing and sees into the future, and promises never to step on your developers toes.<p></p>
I see both sides of the argument, however I feel much of the trouble Twitter and other API owners run into, is the result of not properly sharing its roadmap with developers. If Twitter shared its road-map <span style="text-decoration: underline;">earlier</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more consistently</span> with its developers, and also allowed feedback periods before launching, I think there would a lot less backlash--even if the community didn't always win 100% in the resulting decision.<p></p>
How "open" an API owner is with their road-map obviously is entirely up to them. They have trade secrets to protect, and many other considerations when managing a roadmap. However you should identify a consistent time frame in which to give the developer community a heads up about what is happening. Something they can get used to, count on.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/APIRoadmap-FeedbackLoop.png" alt="" width="600" align="center" />
Of course there will most likely be partners you share your road-map with before sharing it with your developer ecosystem. And don't forget to make sure to consider the press and blogosphere in this road-map release cycle. The press can be the first to bring up an issue, and ultimately end up being the bullhorn for developer grievances.<p></p>
Also, if your platform has a accompanying web application, you will have to consider the linkage between its road-map and your API road-map. How do features you plan to release impact your developer community? When should they be informed about your companies plans for new products and features?<p></p>
Rather than being polarized about these API ecosystem battles I hear about, I'm trying to put on my product managers hat, and find a balanced approach to solving. I don't think there is one single solution to make developers feel warm &amp; fuzzy about integrating with APIs, and each industry or API sector may be different. But I think many of these problems can be addressed through early and consistent sharing of our API road-maps, which will truly make our APIs more open.

A <a title="PHP code library for the Github Gist API" href="http://codecanyon.net/item/gist-api/410684">PHP code library for the Github Gist API</a>, for sale on the code marketplace <a title="CodeCanyon" href="http://codecanyon.net/">CodeCanyon</a> for $2.00.
<p></p>I almost just closed the window, but then thought a little more about it. I think its the first time I've seen a code libraries for sale like this. I've seen more robust integrations and API clients for sale, but never a simple library for working with an API.
<p></p>The <a title="Github Gist API" href="http://develop.github.com/p/general.html">Github Gist API</a> is well documented and there is a <a title="PHP Library for the Github API" href="https://github.com/ornicar/php-github-api">PHP library for the Github API</a> available for free on the site. It doesn't look like it has Gist API support yet, but is well written, and shows you how to exend the PHP class.
<p></p>Seems like there is a narrow window where you could build an API code library and make money off selling it before a free library is available, or is it also possible to sell them even when there are other free libraries available?
<p></p>I will keep watching for other API code libraries for sell on CodeCanyon and elsewhere, see if this is a growing trend. I prefer to just open source mine on <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>, for the entire community to put to use.

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2011</span>
        <a title="Moodstocks" href="http://www.moodstocks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/moodstocks/Moodstocks-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>I was reviewing the image recognition API from <a title="Moodstocks" href="http://www.moodstocks.com/">Moodstocks</a>, for a story on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> today, and discovered another API management story I feel should be told. Its a story about bootstrapping your API management using existing free and low cost services.<p></p>
Before users adopt your API, it can be hard to justify costs around using paid API management services to support your developer ecosystem (because at that stage the ecosystem often doesn't exist). Moodstocks approach to its API community was a great example of bootstrapping API management until you can afford more.<p></p>
For managing its <a title="documentation" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=120">documentation</a>, <a title="code libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">code libraries</a>, <a title="articles" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=122">articles</a> and <a title="FAQs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=132">FAQs</a>, Moodstocks turned to Github for help. Github provides these tools for free, and are great for delivering these API management essentials.<p></p>
For developer support, Moodstocks uses Vanilla Forums for its <a title="forum" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=131">forum</a>, and Campfire for chat support. Moodstocks uses a nicely skinned copy of Wordpress for its <a title="blog" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=123">blog</a>, and has a solid social media approach using Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube.<p></p>
With this bootstrapped approach, it was up to Moodstocks to deliver its own API processes: rate limiting, security and other reporting features. But when it came to management the startup chose a nice selection of free and low cost services to delivery services to its API community.

<a title="OAuth" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=184">OAuth</a> is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data, and is a popular method to allow secure API authorization, enabling websites to provide a more streamlined user login experience with the additional benefits of enhanced privacy and security.<p></p>
The Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit is the first solution of its kind that enables enterprises to control policy and identity aspects of many different OAuth token operations, a capability that is particularly important as enterprises increasingly use OAuth to authorize access to APIs in cloud settings, said Phil Walston, vice president of products at Layer 7 Technologies. By allowing enterprises to seamlessly manage their OAuth implementations as the standard evolves, the toolkit simplifies operations while providing rigorous security and control.<a title="Layer 7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/layer7-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><p></p>
Features of the Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Policy and identity controls to handle HMAC-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signature methods, SAML and OAuth WRAP</li>
	<li>Mix and match implementations of OAuth with SAML</li>
	<li>Ability to drop in new signature and credential methods without changing APIs</li>
</ul>
Layer 7's new OAuth Toolkit supports a variety of standards, including OAuth 1a, OAuth 2.0, SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, WS-Trust, <a title="REST" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=196">REST</a> and <a title="JSON" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/27/api-technology-json/">JSON</a>.<p></p>
Layer 7 will be demonstrating its OAuth Toolkit at the Layer 7 Hospitality Suite at <a title="Gartners Catalyst Conference" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/catalyst/">Gartner's Catalyst Conference</a> at the San Diego Hilton Bayfront, Aqua Room 311, from 6:00 - 9:00 p.m., July 26-29.

</p>
<p>
     The investment will be used as part of a continued global expansion and R&amp;D efforts focused on the company's in-car, location based services (LBS) and mobile applications businesses.
</p>
<p>
     With over 150 industry-leading customers across 8 different distribution channels, a profitable business, and nearly 90 percent compound annual revenue growth over the past 3 years, INRIX did not need to raise capital, said Bryan Mistele, president and CEO of INRIX. However, given new market opportunities including the rapid adoption of our premium traffic services, increasing demand from automakers for global solutions and the explosion of LBS on mobile devices, we're accelerating several investments designed to firmly cement our global leadership position.
</p>
<p>
     The investment by KPCB Green Growth Fund and August Capital show the growth of the LBS data market, and resulting APIs that gather and deliver this data to mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/inrix/inrix-traffic-mobile-applications.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Traffic congestion costs the U.S. economy upwards of $155 billion dollars annually. Last year alone, US drivers wasted 3.9 billion gallons of fuel sitting idle in traffic, and the US is a small part of a much larger and growing global traffic problem, commented Michael Linse, partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers. We believe that INRIX is uniquely positioned to help improve the efficiency of our cars in ways that reduce fuel consumption and improve sustainability for all.
</p>
<p>
     We are experiencing a convergence of automotive and mobile efforts that leverage the latest smart devices, data analytics and connectivity technologies that improve how the world's one billion drivers travel from place to place.
</p>
<p>
     The use of crowd-sourced traffic information from mobile devices, vehicles, and sensors on the road can provide continuous real-time speed, congestion, accident data that can provide a unique understanding of traffic events from school schedules, concerts, sporting events and everyday commutes to deliver highly accurate real-time, predictive and historical traffic information.
</p>
<p>
     APIs are the "vehicle" in which data will travel from cars, phones, and sensors and to companies like INRIX, and investors are started to see the huge potential in this massively growing market.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/07/24/could-you-be-an-api-evangelist/">Could you be an API Evangelist?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-tag-cloud-1.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />In the summer of 2010 I was looking to reinvent my career. I was looking for a new direction. Somewhere I could apply all my strengths, and stay relevant and at the forefront of a fast changing tech landscape.
<p></p>As part of this effort, I spent some time considering what areas dominated the past 5 years of my career. Looking at my resume, social media and cloud computing were the two major themes. Then I put some thought into what technology is dominating right now, and will continue growing in the next couple years. The answer was mobile technology.
<p></p>Looking to apply what I know, but also be relevant and competitive in the future, I wanted to find a common thread. What did all of these areas have in common? It was clearly application programming interfaces, or more specifically, web APIs.
<p></p>APIs drove the social media revolution from Flickr to Twitter, reinvented IT with cloud computing, and is a driving force behind mobile applications.
<p></p>I found an area to focus my energy, but do I have the skills needed to work with APIs. What is needed to be successful with an API?
<p></p>I set off to study all the top APIs out there and answer this question. After much research, success with an API seemed to boil down to equal parts technical, business, and marketing. It sounded like a fit for my skills.
<p></p>Successful APIs like Amazon, Twilio and Google all had one thing in common. They had developer advocates or technical evangelists. This is what I wanted to do. What skills are required to be an API developer advocate or evangelist?
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Hacker</strong> - You have to have a love of hacking. You have to be able to write code samples, prototypes and be able to know what programmers experience hacking on an API. You should also be able to push the boundaries on what can be done with APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Business Development</strong> - You need business development experience and an understand of how APIs can evolve businesses and industries. You push to understand how APIs can change how business is conducted, where it can be applied, an how this can be communicated to existing business leaders.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong> - You need to be able to plan and maintain an on and offline sales and marketing presence. Attend and speak at events, able to mingle with both developers and business people, and possess a knowledge of traditional marketing as well as online and social media marketing tactics.
     </li>
</ul>The biggest skill you have to posses is the classic self-starter or self-motivator. There is no well laid road-map to follow, you have to be able to plan, strategize, execute and fail or succeed all on your own.
<p></p>I closely monitor how other players are executing, and apply relevant pieces to my own strategy. But ultimately you have have the knowledge and confidence to define your own road-map, and awareness to adjust as necessary.
<p></p>This kind of experience I've gained from being the leader on several development teams, and wisdom gained from running my own business, including several failed startups.
<p></p>I'm writing this blog post this for my own benefit. To establish a clear definition of who I am, and what I'm bringing to the table, and make sure I'm on track with my career.
<p></p>However, I also want to help others understand this evolving new role of being a developer advocate or API evangelist. There is a growing need in this area, and I get offered an average of 2-3 jobs per week in this area. I'm very happy in my current position, so they all end with me telling them I will refer anyone I know from my network.
<p></p>Which is kind of bullshit, because I don't know anyone with these skills, that is looking for work. Do you have these skills? Maybe you should consider a career with APIs. Let me know.

        <span class="post-date">22 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/file-open-dialog.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />The file open dialog box is an important tool that we use every day, but we very rarely notice it or think much about it.
<p></p>On the Windows platform, using the file open dialog box, we see our desktop, my documents or whatever was the last hell hole of a folder we were working in.
<p></p>On the Mac, using the file open dialog box, it seems like I eternally live in my downloads folder with the occasional venture do my documents or desktop folders. Maybe that's just me?
<p></p>More and more I find myself living in my Amazon S3, which I still access via my Firefox S3Fox extension versus the Amazon Console. Old habits die hard. Regardless, more of my world is living in the clouds.
<p></p>The file open dialog box just doesn't have the same meaning in the clouds. Its a desktop, localized tool. When we open it, we see that local desktop mess we've created and maintained (well sort of).
<p></p>When we open a web dialog, we don't see much. It seems to be something made up, nothing near the meaning of when we open it locally. Or we are forced to paste the URL of a single file or page into a textbox.
<p></p>Google is <a title="making a move to re-invent the File Open Dialog" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/07/get-picky-with-google-picker-api.html">making a move to re-invent the file open dialog box</a>, in context of the web, and the context of your Google workspace.
<p></p>With the <a title="Google Picker API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/picker/docs/index.html">Google Picker API</a>, any developer can build a web-based file open dialog box. In Google's opinion, a web-based file open dialog box should provide a user with a more modern experence:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Familiar</strong> � A look-and-feel that users will recognize.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Graphical</strong> � A dialog experience, with many views showing previews or thumbnails.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Streamlined</strong> � An inline, modal window, so users never leave the main application.
     </li>
</ul>I would add that users need to see, and have access to the content they use most. In this day and age, this means on and offline content. Google Picker API gives you access to what you use most on the Google platform. This makes sense in the context of the Google vision.
<p></p>As a developer Google Picker API provides you display access to a users:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Google Docs (Folders, Docs, Spreadsheets, Presentations)
     </li>
     <li>Picasa Web Folders
     </li>
     <li>Videos (Youtube?)
     </li>
</ul>Since I use Google Docs and Picassa heavily, this will help, but I still don't consider this the next generation of the file open dialog box.
<p></p>I would like to see all of my Google Data (I'm sure Google is working on this), and other sources of data I use regularly. I need my Flickr, Amazon S3, Twitter, Instapaper, Evernote, Github, Pinboard and any other relevant applications I use.
<p></p>Will Google open up access to other services, allow them to register their services, and offer access within the new, web-based vision of the file open dialog box?
<p></p>I agree the file open dialog box is ready for an overhaul. I like Google's style. I think they have the talent and resources to make it happen. I also think they will recognize the importance of opening up access to other services.
<p></p><strong>One last random thought:</strong> When will my file open dialog box give me access to my <a title="Locker Project" href="http://lockerproject.org/">Locker Project</a> data?

Many API owners are in experimental mode when it comes to how they make money with their API.
<p></p>Beyond the fuzzy plans for how API owners intend to make money, even more API owners don't have a clear vision of how they will reward their developers, and share revenue with its API ecosystem.
<p></p>There are examples of leadership from API owners. <a title="Qwerly gives discounts of API costs for high volume API users" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/24/whats-next-for-apis-learning-from-social-apis/">Qwerly gives discounts on API costs for high volume API users</a> and <a title="YellowAPI pay developers for high volumes of traffic" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">YellowAPI pay developers for high volumes of traffic</a> originating from their applications as well as sharing advertising revenue with developers.

<p></p>This type of straightforward approach represents the future of how API owners can clearly communicate how a platform intends to generate revenue, and share revenue with the developer community so that they too can be successful in building businesses around an API platform. It sets clear expectations with the developer community, allowing developers to understand the risks and benefits with building a business around an API.
<p></p>Bluevia's approach to revenue earned from selling apps in a marketplace is nothing new. Other providers like YellowAPI also share mobile advertising revenue, and other service revenue with developers. What really stands out is their clear presentation of solid business models that developers can choose from. This identifies the value of the developer community, and gives them the clear revenue opportunities they need to be successful.

Seems like every hackathon I attend, there are discussion about how to better harness the talent available at these events, and develop a way to track what gets generated.
<p></p>The last hackathon I attended one of the ideas pitched was actually a web application that tracks what gets produced at hackathons. It would track the participants, and provide repositories for any code created. The application would provide access to ideas and projects from any participating event.
<p></p>It's a pretty good idea. I think a lot of good ideas and code goes to waste from contests and hackathons. Evening winning ideas may never go anywhere.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hackathon.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Today I came across a Google project called <a title="Melange" href="http://code.google.com/p/soc/">Melange</a>. Melange is an open-source web application that Google uses to track the <a title="Google Summer of Code" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a title="Google Code-In" href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gci/2010-11/index.html">Google Code-in</a> programs.
<p></p>The goal of the project is to create a framework for tracking open-source contribution programs. Google is able to manage Google Summer of Code programs, and other similar programs with the web application.
<p></p>Melange is part content management system, part issue tracking system, and part customer relationship manager. It is written in Python and runs on Google App Engine.
<p></p>At first glance it looks like Melange is setup to track all the users, ideas, projects and code for a hackathon environment. It might take a little customization, but Melange may work as a platform for tracking hackathons and contests.
<p></p>It would be great to have access and visibility to projects and code that gets generated from event to event, and information about the smart people were involved.

        <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/visually/visually-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />It is hard for me to imagine why someone would launch a web application these days, without immediately launching an API, or at least having plans for an API shortly after release.
<p></p>There always is some data that can be liberated, and make it available in a JSON format. Simple data APIs can easily drive widgets and other embeddable tools, providing viral marketing tools that drive awareness and SEO.
<p></p>So when I am playing with new web applications, if there is no clear API strategy, it always gets me thinking about the possibilities. This happened when I was playing the new <a title="infographic builder and marketplace Visual.ly" href="http://www.visual.ly">infographic builder and marketplace Visual.ly</a> today.
<p></p>There is no evidence of an API at Visual.ly. I see an RSS feed of infographics, but no API. So I started thinking about a simple API and embeddable strategy for them.
<p></p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/visually/visually-infographic.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I would start with infographic and designer services providing JSON responses for searches on the infographic marketplace and graphic designers.
<p></p>Visual.ly only provides tools for sharing infographics. You can't actually embed them, I believe this is how they plan to monetize. So you wouldn't have full copies of infographics via the API. You'd provide smaller representations of parts and pieces, or other relevant visualizations.
<p></p>For every infographic, a designer would create a handful of small images, and the API could serve up these images and all the meta data for each entry in the marketplace.
<p></p>This would open up possibilities for embeddable buttons, widgets and gadgets that anyone could copy and paste, and virally promoteinfographics without actually giving away everything.
<p></p>The Visual.ly API wouldn't be complex to begin with, just allow basic access to infographics and designers, and provide an assortment of embeddable tools for users to syndicate content. A more advanced API, providing more complete access to infographics and the builder, can come later.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/puzzle-partial.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="last year google launched support for partial responses and updates" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/03/making-apis-faster-introducing-partial.html">Last year google launched support for partial response and updates</a> to a couple of the Google APIs. The goals was to significantly reduce network, memory, and CPU resources needed to work with Google APIs.<p></p>
Now Google is <a title="adding support" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/07/lightning-fast-performance-tips-for.html">adding support </a>for partial response, and an improved version of <a title="partial update, called patch" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/v1/performance.html#patch">partial update, called patch</a>, to a number of newer APIs including:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google Buzz API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/">Google Buzz API</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Tasks API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/">Google Tasks API</a></li>
</ul>
All APIs available in the <a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> and the <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">APIs Explorer</a> supporting partial response and updates.<p></p>
The partial response algorithm works by supplying a fields query parameter to any API call that returns data, you can request specific fields.<p></p>
Here is an example request that returns only titles and timestamps of a user's public Buzz activities: <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">https://www.googleapis.com/buzz/v1/activities/kinlane@gmail.com/@public?alt=json&amp;pp=1&amp;fields=items(title,updated)</a><p></p>
A full response for Buzz activity would be around 53KB and the partial response is 3KB, a reduction of almost 95%!<p></p>
You can try out both partial response and patch algorithms in the <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google APIs Explorer</a>. In partial responses, the fields parameter is available for most methods. You can easily tell which are partial update methods by the .patch in the method name. Both the fields parameter and the patch method on the tasklist resource in the APIs explorer.<p></p>
Partial response and updates are a great way to make APIs more efficient for devices with limited connectivity, as well as making API platforms operate as efficiently as they can by delivering only what information is needed.<p></p>
Google is in a unique position with the number of APIs they offer, volume of API calls they manage, and wide audience they deliver to. We can all learn a lot from watching them organize their APIs, and apply elements of their approach to our own API ecosystems.

<p></p>While considering this, I keep having thoughts about the perfect API stack. In my opinion, these are APIs that do one thing and do it well, makes a developers life easier, and have clear business value.
<p></p>The first one that comes to mind is <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-detail.php?API_ID=1823">Twilio</a>. When I think of Twilio, I think of two clear use cases: voice and SMS.
<p></p>Voice and SMS are two critical tools to have in your developer toolbox. These are services that have clear value, that would take a lot of effort to duplicate yourself, making it a no brainer to pay for as a service.
<p></p>In an effort to define the perfect API stack, I'm going to start blogging about APIs that fall into this category as I find them. They will be short posts that introduce you to these services, and when I get enough I will launch a landing page showcasing the perfect API stack.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/search-magnifying-glass.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />One of the new features that Twitter rolled out with the <a title="new Twitter developer area" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/07/11/twitter-launches-new-api-developer-area/">new Twitter developer area</a> was an enhanced search tool powered by <a title="Apache Solr" href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>. The new unified search provides an engine for searching across all areas of the new developer area, including the mailing list historical archives.<p></p>
Many of us API owners have to cobble together our developer areas from several tools like <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, <a title="Google Groups" href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a>, and other tools we can leverage to quickly provide communication and support for our APIs. There is nothing wrong with this approach, however one side effect is that we end up with information available in separate silos, making information harder for developers to find.<p></p>
Providing a single search interface, that allows developers to search across all systems, delivering comprehensive and relevant search results can make a significant difference in whether or not a developer finds the details they need to successfully integrate.<p></p>
Apache Solr is one indexing tool you can deploy as part of your API area, but there are also lower impact solutions such as <a title="Google Custom Search" href="http://www.google.com/cse/">Google Custom Search</a> that can be deployed as an external service, without investing in costly equipment or software.<p></p>
Don't underestimate the power of having a single search interface that developers can use to find the information they are looking for when integrating with your API.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/fear.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I spend a lot of time looking through various APIs. One common problem I see, are with, what on the surface appear to be <a title="public APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">public APIs</a>, but once I start looking to get access as a developer, I get walls thrown up.
<p></p>Often times, information about the API is public. I can browse the documentation, code samples and more, but when I want to play with the API I have to ask for access and wait for approval.
<p></p>This is different than a <a title="private APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">private API</a>, where you just want to give API access to a private audience. I can tell these API owners have a good idea, want to open it up to the public, but they are very concerned about who has access to their API.
<p></p>These businesses are concerned about what people will do with their data and resources. They have concerns for their brand, and legal issues to wrestle with. What will developers do? How will it affect customers? Will it damage the companies reputation?
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/wall-usb-port.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />There are a lot of unanswered questions when launching an API. None of us have all the answers, and can predict what the future holds, and managing public developers can be a lot of work.
<p></p>What you need is a quality API management platform, with tools for providing visibility into how developers are using your API. If you can't build the tools you need yourself, make sure and check out the API service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, <a title="Layer7" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/layer-7-technologies-launches-new-api-portal/">Layer7</a> or <a title="Atmospher" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">Atmosphere</a>.
<p></p>Next you need an agile process and attitude for evaluating API usage and feedback, then be able to quickly evolve your API to satisfy your business objectives, adding the most value to your brand, while also building a healthy and vibrant developer ecosystem.
<p></p>One of my goals with<a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, is to pay attention to the industry as a whole, understand the best practices for API management and share this knowledge with other API owners so there is less fear and uncertainty around deploying public and private APIs.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />According to <a title="Reuters" href="http://www.reuters.com">Reuters</a>, <a title="Twitter is preparing to launching an Advertising API" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/twitter-idUSN1E76C1Y920110713">Twitter is preparing to launch an Advertising API</a>, targeting larger advertisers, allowing them to tailor, automate, and publish ads in bulk directly into Twitter users' streams.
<p></p>Access to the Twitter Adverting API, which Twitter plans to begin in the fourth quarter, will initially be rolled out as a test involving a limited number of partners, <a title="according to Reuters" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/twitter-idUSN1E76C1Y920110713">according to Reuters</a>.
<p></p>The Advertising API is a sign that Twitter is pulling together its business model and looking to further monetize its network in the same way as Google does with its Adwords and Adsense, and Facebook with its Ad Network.
<p></p>Right now you have to <a title="submit a form" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/start">submit a form</a>, and talk with a sales person to run ads on Twitter, the new API would create an automated advertising marketplace on top of the Twitter ecosystem.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/Twitter-Advertising-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />According to Reuters, Twitter's advertising API will initially let advertisers automatically deliver ads in two formats:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Promoted Tweets" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/promoted-tweets">Promoted Tweets</a></strong> - Allowing an advertiser to sponsor any 140 character messages via Twitter

          <strong><a title="Promoted Accounts" href="http://business.twitter.com/advertise/promoted-accounts">Promoted Accounts</a></strong> - Enabling advertisers to promote its own Twitter account to other users
     </li>
</ul>A marketing research firm <a title="eMarketer" href="http://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a>, estimates that <a title="Twitter is expected to generate about $150 million in ad revenue" href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008192">Twitter is expected to generate about $150 million in ad revenue</a> through its ad network in 2011.
<p></p>Evolving the Twitter advertising network to a self-service system, and adding an API for programmatic integration, will significantly increase the volume of advertising that runs through the network, putting it on par with Google and Facebook's offering.
<p></p>This kind of system is well-suited for larger advertisers that need to buy ads in bulk and run large-scale online advertising campaigns that involve thousands of different versions of an ad.
<p></p>"They can just flood the system with ad types and almost in real time they can figure out which ads are working, which are most successful, which are getting the clicks at the right price," says Debra Aho Williamson, analyst at eMarketer.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/twitter-monetization.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The release of an API is the next logical step for the Twitter advertising network, but one area that isn't mentioned in the Reuters piece -- and is critical to the overall health of the Twitter ecosystem: where do the developers fit in?
<p></p>Will developers be able participate in the advertising network and share in the revenue generated from advertising on their sites and applications?
<p></p>Developers play a central role in building sites and applications that will drive traffic and resulting revenue for Twitter and its advertisers. Giving developers an opportunity to make money from their efforts, will only strengthen the overall platform, and bring more value for advertisers and Twitter.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tumblr/Tumblr-Engineering-Blog.png" alt="" width="260" align="right" /><a title="Tumblr just released version 2.0 of the blog platform API" href="http://engineering.tumblr.com/post/7541361718/introducing-tumblrs-new-api">Tumblr just released version 2.0 of the popular blogging platform API</a>, in an effort to make developers lives a little easier when integrating with the Tumblr platform.
<p></p>The previous version of the API made distinctions between read and write operations and pushed different activity to two separate domains, the www.tumblr.com and the blog subdomain.
<p></p>The new API version consolidates all API access to api.tumblr.com and exposes two major resources in the URI: /blog and /user. Consolidation under one domain will allow Tumblr to effectively measure and balance traffic using DNS.
<p></p>The new URLs will follow a pattern, making them intuitive, allowing developers to easily discover and experiment with the API without having to rely exclusively on documentation.
<p></p>Instead of adhering to strict RESTful practices, Tumblr is looking to create simple URLs that enable manipulation by the average human.
<p></p>For example, to pull the avatar of my tumblr blog I use the following URL: <a href="http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar">http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar</a>
<p></p>The API returns the default avatar image, and if I want a larger size, I just append the size to the URL: <a href="http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar/512">http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/kinlane.tumblr.com/avatar/512</a>
<p></p>In the first version of the Tumblr API, all data was available in XML, with JSON support added largely as an afterthought. Now Tumblr has just decide to eliminate XML, and focused on dialing in their JSON implementation. A common approach for API owners.
<p></p>The new API implements OAuth 1.0a for authentication and they are looking at upgrading to OAuth 2.0 in the neear future.
<p></p>I like how Tumblr has consolidated under a single domain, and I favor their approach to intuitive URL's over a strict RESTful implemntation.
<p></p>The Tumblr API v2 is definitely an improvement, I will see how it sizes up against the <a title="new Posterous API launched last month" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/posterous-from-saas-to-paas-using-an-api/">new Posterous API launched last month</a>.

<p></p>And until now, to be visible in search, you had to submit your app to the App Directory.
<p></p>In light of this data Facebook is removing the App Directory and depending on search for application discovery on the Facebook platform.
<p></p>For an app to show up in search, developers now need to go to the application detail page, and click the Submit to Search link in the left sidebar while editing the application.
<p></p>When submitted, applications are automatically available in search and there is no longer an approval process to go through. When any changes are made to application settings, it will automatically be updated in the listing.
<p></p>Obviously this approach doesn't apply to all <a title="application directories" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">API application directories</a>, but some interesting data to consider from one of the larger development platforms, when deploying your own <a title="API application directory" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/08/a-white-label-api-appstore-platform/">API application directory</a>.

The new developer area focuses on enhancing developer communication channels and providing improved reference material and documentation.
<p></p>The new <a title="dev.twitter.com" href="https://dev.twitter.com/">dev.twitter.com</a> is built using the <a title="Drupal Platform" href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal platform</a> and focuses on providing core building blocks for its developer community:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter Discussion Forum" href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions">Forum</a></strong> - Retiring of the old mailing list with a new dicussion forum that includes hot topics, email category subscriptions, and Dev Teatime, a section to focus on the social side of the Twitter developer community.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter Blog" href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog">Blog</a></strong> - A new blog to learn about important API announcements, events, tips and how-tos, case studies, product insights, and featuring content from different teams at Twitter, as well guest blog posts from community members.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter Documentation" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs">Documentation</a></strong> - The new Twitter docs have better structure and searchability, so they are easier to update, and easier to find the most up to date information about the API.

     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter Search" href="https://dev.twitter.com/search/apachesolr_search/Search">Enhanced Search</a></strong> - The new developer area search is powered by Apache Solr, providing a unified search engine with filters and more relevant search results including from the group mailing list historical archives.
     </li>
</ul>Twitter focuses on the most important aspects of a developer area, while also providing many other important <a title="API Building Blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">API building blocks</a>:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Getting Started

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/07/09/wisdom-shared-from-the-foursquare-api-team/">Wisdom Shared from the Foursquare API Team</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/foursquare/foursquare-engineering-logo.png" alt="" align="right" />Foursquare is <a title="sunsetting their APIv1" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foursquare-api/tZPFTbUTQJQ">sunsetting their APIv1</a>, and recently spent some time sharing the lessons they learned during APIv1 and the decisions that went into APIv2.
<p></p>Here are some excerpts:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>JSON -</strong> This was a no brainer. Its flexible and understood by everybody.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>OAuth2 and HTTPS-Only -</strong> OAuth2 is straightforward to implement on the server and client, and offloading encryption to HTTPS makes it easy to get it right.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>REST Lite -</strong> It makes sense to use resourceful URLs for certain key objects, like users/USER_ID or venues/VENUE_ID, with actions and connections hanging off of them. Also avoiding deeply nested URLs like users/USER_ID/tips/TIP_ID, instead using tips/TIP_ID, leads to much simpler URLs. Finally, they avoided using the extended set of HTTP verbs beyond POST and GET, putting the action into the endpoint name, such as tips/add.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation -</strong> Quality documentation combined with an API explorer is a win. Also theimplementationof a simple documentation generation system, made it easy for Foursquare engineers to keep API documentation up to date.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Timestamps as Seconds Since Epoch -</strong> Renders timestamps not readable by humans, but extremely easy to parse.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Versioning -</strong> The hardest part of designing an API is that you're stuck with a bunch of decisions you can't take back. But in some cases they needed to take them back anyway, so they came up with the idea of clients sending back a version like 20110708 and promising to be compatible with all changes up to the date.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Object Level detail -</strong> It's always hard to decide how much detail to include in an object, and Foursquare lets the clients dictate what to include where. In APIv2, they introduced compact and full JSON representations of resources.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Envelope -</strong> The decision to wrap all responses in { meta: { � }, response: {...} } was well received, along with the error details included in the meta block.
     </li>
</ul>They provide a lot more wisdom in their blog post,<a title="APIv2: Woulda, coulda, shoulda" href="http://engineering.foursquare.com/2011/07/08/apiv2-woulda-coulda-shoulda/">APIv2: Woulda, coulda, shoulda</a>. Some of the points I couldn't do justice with just an excerpt.
<p></p>Some of their reflections are just reminders of the success of JSON, OAuth2 and a simple RESTful approach. But their insight about how to structure objects, envelopes, timestamps and categories has me putting some more thought into upcoming changes to my API.

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Inbox</strong> - Mashape redesigned their inbox and messaging system. Developers can contact you from your API detail page, and the inbox provides interface for managing developers and your conversations.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API Wizard</strong> - The API setup and management wizard is no longer a step by step wizard. It now gives you five options in a left hand navigation, leaving the room for more options to be added in the future.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Private APIs</strong> - You can now deploy a private API with Mashape, only inviting the developers you want to have access.

</ul>Some small changes, but prettyimportantchanges for API owners and developers who use <a title="Mashape" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/04/mashape-api-service-provider/">Mashape</a>.
<p></p>I would say the ability to deploy a private API is the most significant, as more people realize the value of APIs, and deploy them for partners, not the general public.

        <span class="post-date">05 Jul 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/rellinking.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I made some more changes to my network over the holidays. I'm working to better tie together my blog(s) and my social network profiles using the <a title="rel= property" href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_link_rel.asp">rel="" property</a>.<p></p>
The process is a three part process, meant to link the various places I write with my author brand, that is represented in my social network profiles, most importantly Google +.<p></p>
I write on several blogs and I want the authorship of my work to be linked back to my <a title="Google + Profile" href="https://plus.google.com/106460238807821851374/">Google + profile</a>.<p></p>
I'm very Google centric, so in my network this is the most important profile in my network. This also feeds into my overall SEO strategy which is another story.<p></p>
I started by created two separate author pages on my two blogs. <a title="Kin Lane" href="http://www.kinlane.com/about/">Kin Lane</a> and <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/about/">API Evangelist</a>.<p></p>
Then I updated all of my blog posts within those domains to link my author name to those respective about pages, and include the rel='author' link.  This attributes each post to me, the author.<p></p>
Then on those about me pages I listed my social network profiles, most importantly Google +, and included the link rel='me'. This attributes each of these social network profiles as my profile pages.<p></p>
The final link is on my Google + Profile page I make sure and add link to both my blogs, and include the option "This page is specifically about me", which automatically includes the rel='me' property for each of the links.<p></p>
All of this completes a circle showing that I am the author of my blog posts, and associating these blog posts with my Google Profile. Google will now recongize that these profile pages and blog posts are associated with my Google Profile.<p></p>
This all results in improving my author brand in eyes of Google, and since Google dominates the web, the eyes of the Internet.

        <span class="post-date">04 Jul 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/core-share-buttons.png" alt="" align="right" />I updated the sharing tools on blog.apievangelist.com today.  Previously it had eight buttons, representing the top social network channels that drive traffic to the blog.<p></p>
I'm changing it, putting emphasis on:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google +1" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/" target="_blank">Google +1</a></li>
	<li><a title="Twitter Share Button" href="http://twitter.com/about/resources/tweetbutton" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
	<li><a title="LinkedIn Share Button" href="http://www.linkedin.com/publishers" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>
These are the top places that people share posts on API Evangelist that drives traffic to the blog.<p></p>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/secondary-share-buttons.png" alt="" align="right" />I started by adding individual buttons from all the major providers:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Facebook Like Button" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/#" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
	<li><a title="StumbleUpon Share Button" href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/badges/" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a></li>
	<li><a title="Digg Share Button" href="http://about.digg.com/downloads/button/smart" target="_blank">Digg</a></li>
	<li><a title="Reddit Share Button" href="http://www.reddit.com/buttons" target="_blank">Reddit</a></li>
</ul>
At first I used <a title="AddThis Sharing" href="http://www.addthis.com/analytics" target="_blank">AddThis</a> for the whole share toolbar, but I couldn't get it to layout the way I wanted.   So I used individual buttons from the Google +1, Twitter and LinkedIn, then I used AddThis for the other top providers:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Instapaper</li>
	<li>Hacker News</li>
	<li>DZone</li>
	<li>Posterous</li>
	<li>Tumblr</li>
	<li>Reddit</li>
</ul>
I will be making some major updates to <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://www.kinlane.com" target="_blank">kinlane.com</a> and using the same share strategy for the blog and web site.  I'll keep adjusting to keep in line with top channels that drive traffic to my blogs.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="Amazon Affiliate Program" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/affiliate/amazon-affiliates.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>Amazon sent me an email about the recent <a title="signing of the online sales tax law, by California Governor Brown" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_18282733" target="_blank">signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown</a>, which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores.
<p></p>As a result of this, contracts with all <a title="California residents particpating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/06/amazon-end-affiliate-program-in-california/">California residents participating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated</a> effective, June 29, 2011.
<p></p>As I was writing up the story of this on <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>, ad it got me thinking about the impact of this on API affiliate programs. I'm tracking on various monetization strategies for APIs, and affiliate sales is one of them.
<p></p>California has broadened their definition regarding who has to pay sales tax, to include theaffiliatesof online retailers. But from what I can read it all still goes back to the sale of <em><span class="c2">"tangible personal property"</span></em>. The tax code defines what type of merchandise is subject to use tax as:
<blockquote>
     <em>Generally, the same types of items that are subject to sales tax are subject to use tax. Sales and use tax applies to the sale or use of tangible personal property in California. Section 6016 of the Revenue and Taxation Code defines tangible personal property as "personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses."</em>
</blockquote>I'm no lawyer, but my interpretation of the <a title="assembly bill 28" href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/abx1_28_bill_20110628_enrolled.pdf">assembly bill 28</a>, is that if your API is not faciliting the sale of <em><span class="c2">tangible goods</span></em>, you are safe. If your selling access to bits and bytes, and you want to share revenue with developers and / or affiliates who drive traffic and sales to your API, you are not subject to any online sales tax for California.
<p></p>I haven't read New York, Illinois or other states bills. I will some night when I need help going to sleep, and update in the future.

        <a href="http://www.mashape.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>The <a title="Mashape API Proxy" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/Mashape-API-Proxy">Mashape API Proxy</a> is an open-source version of the same proxy that allows APIs to integrate with the <a title="Mashape Platform" href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape Platform</a> andhandles authorizing users, billing, rate limiting and other features.<p></p>
Version 1.1 is whats available for <a title="download on Github" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/Mashape-API-Proxy">download on Github</a>, and Mashape is testing the private version 1.2 of the proxy with a small set of API providers, and they will push it to Github after its been tested.<p></p>
The new version dramatically improves the performance and the security of the proxy, while reducing latency.<p></p>
The API Proxy version 1.1 is an extremely early version and Mashape recommends waiting for version 1.2 before deploying.<p></p>
The open-source Mashape API Proxy is written in JavaScript and runs on the latest version of <a title="node.js" href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a><p></p>
This is the first <a title="open-source API proxy" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/Mashape-API-Proxy">open-source API proxy</a> that I know of, and in my opinion, opens up a lot of possibilities for the API industry.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2011</span>
        <a title="Energy pricing data provider Genability" href="http://www.genability.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/genability/genability-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Energy pricing data provider Genability" href="http://www.genability.com/">Energy pricing data provider Genability</a> just announced the roll-out of more <a title="flexible pricing for their API" href="https://developer.genability.com/plans-pricing">flexible pricing for their API</a>.
<p></p>The new pricing structure gives Genability API developers more options with no long term commitments, when accessing the Genability tariff and electricity pricing database.
<p></p><a title="Genability API" href="https://developer.genability.com/">Genability API</a> pricing starts with a free plan which offers 10 unique tariff credits per month, and will serve up 1,000 calls per hour.
<p></p>Genability bulk paid plans range from $89.99 / month to $1499.99 a month:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/genability/genability-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Bronze for 89.99 / month</strong>, with 100 unique tariff credits per month, and 5,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Silver for 299.99 / month</strong>, with 350 unique tariff credits per month, and 20,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Gold for $799.99 / month</strong>, with 1000 unique tariff credits per month, and 50,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Platinum for $1499.99 / month</strong>, with 2000 unique tariff credits per month, and 100,000 calls per hour
     </li>
</ul>The call per hour portion is pretty straightforward, but whats a tariff credit?
<p></p>A tariff credit is when you request a full tariff (including all its rates, bands and properties), or request a price, or a calculation on a tariff. Genability keep track of each tariff you request, and keep a count of the unique ones, with subsequent calls for previously requested tariffs being free.
<p></p>All of Genability's API plans both, both free and paid, include LSE data, season &amp; time of use data, and zip codes, and geo-location data.
<p></p>Genability also offers custom pricing plans, if one of their doesn't fit your needs, just contact them and they'll negotiate additional services, flexible usage policies or volume pricing.
<p></p>It's interesting to see pricing for an API that provides access to energy utility pricing, take on a very utility pricing model for consumption.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.mashape.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm exploring the <a title="Mashape API Platform" href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape API Platform</a>, trying to break things down and understand everything in more detail. Blogging about a topic does this for me.
<p></p>So let's start with deploying an API with Mashape.
<p></p>With the <a title="Mashape PHP Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-php-library">Mashape PHP Library</a> you can deploy an API on your infrastructure. You <a title="download the library from Github" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-php-library">download the library from Github</a>, deploy on your server, and then add the methods for your API by extending the Mashape PHP component class.
<p></p>If you already have an API that returns JSON responses, you can just register it as a Mashape API for distribution, without deploying the Mashape PHP Library.
<p></p>If you've deployed your API without the Mashape PHP Library you will need to accomplish one more step. You will need to implement the <a title="Mashape Connector" href="http://www.mashape.com/guide/publish/xml#authentication">Mashape Connector</a> by adding one line of code to your API, which is required to connect your API to the Mashape Platform and handle user authorization, billing, and rate-llimiting.
<p></p>Whichever way you deploy your API, you can now distribute it using Mashape. The first step for distributing an API is to create an XML file that describes what the API does. This XML file gets deployed on your server and needs to be updated as your API evolves.
<p></p>Once your API is deployed and published to Mashape, the platform distributes your API to the <a title="Mashape Marketplace" href="http://www.mashape.com/explore/">Mashape Marketplace</a> and provides a detail page with title, description, documentation, test console and <a title="Mashape PHP Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-php-client-library">PHP</a>, <a title="Mashape Python Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-python-client-library">Python</a>, <a title="Mashape Ruby Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-ruby-client-library">Ruby</a>, <a title="Mashape Java Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-java-client-library">Java</a> and <a title="Mashape Objective C Client Library" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/mashape-objectivec-client-library">Objective C</a> client libraries.
<p></p>Mashape then provides a way for developers to sign-up and start hacking on any API in the Mashape Marketplace with a single developer account and key. There are also social features allowing users to follow and contact other users.
<p></p>All APIs that are published using Mashape will connect and communicate with Mashape through an API Proxy. This is the proxy that handles the authorization of users, implementation of billing, rate limiting and other functions described above.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape/Mashape-Manage-Your-API.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />Right now the proxy is primarily available via the Mashape platform, but you can also find an <a title="Open-Source version of the Mashape API Proxy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/30/open-source-version-of-the-mashape-api-proxy/">open-source version of the Mashape API proxy</a> on Github. The API Proxy is intended to be downloaded and installed on your servers, which will increase the performance and security of your API.
<p></p>In addition to being able to register your API and use the <a title="Mashape API Proxy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/30/open-source-version-of-the-mashape-api-proxy/">Mashape API Proxy</a> in the cloud, you can <a title="download and install" href="https://github.com/Mashaper/Mashape-API-Proxy">download and install</a> on-premise. Since it is open-source, you could also fork the code and potentially add in your own modifications to the API proxy, which is written in JavaScript and runs on the latest version of node.js
<p></p>I'm playing around with deploying one small and one large data-set as two separate APIs using the Mashape PHP Library, so I can get more familiar with how the platform works. I just wanted to work through some thoughts about what they provide here on the blog. More to come on <a title="Mashape" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/04/mashape-api-service-provider/">Mashape</a>...
